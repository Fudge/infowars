[00:00.000 --> 00:20.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, October 28th, 2022, and the doomsday clock just ticked
[00:20.120 --> 00:24.280]  several minutes closer to midnight.
[00:24.280 --> 00:32.080]  In a stunning strategy reversal, Pentagon will no longer rule out use of nuclear weapons
[00:32.080 --> 00:42.600]  against non-nuclear threats, reversing previous U.S. policy, knowing back into the early 1960s.
[00:42.600 --> 00:48.200]  The Pentagon now says, and President Biden now says, they will preemptively use nuclear
[00:48.200 --> 00:53.800]  weapons against non-nuclear threats or conventional armies.
[00:53.800 --> 00:59.440]  This was done on the heels, as been reported today by Bloomberg, after Putin came out yesterday
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.440]  and said that we have no political military reason in a nuke strike in Ukraine and are
[01:05.440 --> 01:09.520]  not planning to use nuclear weapons preemptively.
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.480]  And so the establishment responds here in the West by saying, oh really?
[01:14.480 --> 01:20.560]  Well we will preemptively use nuclear weapons against you.
[01:20.560 --> 01:26.720]  The globalists are setting the stage for a limited, if not strategic, planetary war with
[01:26.720 --> 01:30.400]  nuclear weapons that will end civilization as we know it.
[01:30.400 --> 01:34.160]  I've walked through many times what will happen during even a limited nuclear war, it will
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.600]  crash the economies, it will create absolute panic, which is part of the great reset plan.
[01:39.600 --> 01:47.160]  Most analysis and most breakdowns by different think tanks and military industrial complex
[01:47.160 --> 01:55.280]  systems believe that a limited strike has a more than 50% chance of leading to a theater
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.700]  war, meaning in the region, Europe, and that that would then lead to a full-on strategic
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.960]  nuclear war.
[02:01.960 --> 02:05.960]  This has been war-gamed in Europe heavily, it's been war-gamed also in the South China
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.160]  Sea, it's been war-gamed between India and Pakistan, which most analysts until recently
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.480]  thought was the number one main vector site that could kick this war off.
[02:15.480 --> 02:23.040]  Now it's no longer India, Pakistan, India, China, it is now the Ukraine proxy war that
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.720]  is now a de facto war between the West and Russia.
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.720]  We're going to be laying more of this out today on this special Friday broadcast, there's
[02:30.720 --> 02:34.840]  a lot of other interesting news like Elon Musk taking over Twitter and all the freaking
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.000]  out there and the midterms, you know, less than two weeks away.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.920]  All of it is incredibly important, but centrally is the issue of the globalist mouthpieces
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.160]  and the globalist media pushing nuclear war like it's a good idea, pushing nuclear war
[02:50.160 --> 02:55.520]  like it's survivable, pushing nuclear war like it's no big deal, and now the Pentagon
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.480]  coming out and saying we'll strike preemptively non-nuclear threats.
[03:00.480 --> 03:05.920]  On a scale of one to ten of insanity, this is a nine, a ten is launching the weapons.
[03:05.920 --> 03:11.440]  This is the globalist taking the safety off the gun, it's now loaded, their fingers on
[03:11.440 --> 03:16.560]  the trigger, and when you look at the poison injections and the devaluation of currencies,
[03:16.560 --> 03:24.320]  the open borders, it's all part of the great reset strategy to destabilize the entire world.
[03:24.320 --> 03:27.960]  This is the time for the people to come together, whether they're conservative, whether they're
[03:27.960 --> 03:31.720]  liberal, whether they're Christian, whether they're Muslim or Buddhist or agnostic.
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.880]  If you like living and you don't want to enter bare minimum a new dark age, then we need
[03:36.880 --> 03:38.440]  to stop this right now.
[03:38.440 --> 03:42.440]  A limited war will cause a total financial collapse, which they're already engaged in.
[03:42.440 --> 03:45.000]  They want to blame the collapse on the nuclear war.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.800]  A strategic war will lead to massive fallout, nuclear reactors melting down and exploding
[03:49.800 --> 03:56.440]  at least in Europe, and we're talking Chernobyl, we're talking other major meltdowns like we
[03:56.440 --> 04:00.800]  saw a few years ago in Japan, times ten, times a hundred, and then the statistics and the
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.960]  research shows that a strategic war will probably lead to a full-on strategic nuclear war on
[04:06.960 --> 04:09.080]  a planetary scale.
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.480]  That's why we have to be so concerned and so engaged and so involved.
[04:13.480 --> 04:16.520]  People should be in the streets peacefully demonstrating, people should be at churches
[04:16.520 --> 04:19.960]  speaking about this, people should be going to their city councils, anywhere you can find
[04:19.960 --> 04:24.840]  a microphone and an audience, so this is the number one central issue that the globalists
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.800]  always plant on a nuclear war with Russia to bring in their world government.
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.680]  They've got their deep underground bases, they've got their systems set up, they've
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.920]  got their programs prepared, and they believe that they can come out of this limited nuclear
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.080]  war and establish their technocracy in their new world order.
[04:41.080 --> 04:44.920]  They were unable to get it with their poison shots in their virus hysteria, so now they're
[04:44.920 --> 04:46.960]  moving on to phase two of the war.
[04:46.960 --> 04:49.080]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.000]  Owen Schroeder and others are coming up, we'll be filing other special reports throughout
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  the broadcast.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  Please share the live links, like your life depends on it, because it does.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  God bless and good luck.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.840]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[05:06.840 --> 05:12.520]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.160]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.560]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over, and
[05:20.560 --> 05:25.720]  all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[05:25.720 --> 05:30.880]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[05:30.880 --> 05:36.080]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com
[05:36.080 --> 05:37.080]  it changes the world.
[05:37.080 --> 05:42.120]  And that's why when you go to infowarsstore.com and get amazing products that empower you
[05:42.120 --> 05:46.800]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[05:46.800 --> 05:49.360]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[05:49.360 --> 05:55.600]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarsstore.com.
[05:55.600 --> 05:57.600]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[06:25.600 --> 06:35.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show on this Friday, October 28th, 2022.
[06:35.920 --> 06:41.960]  And I got to tell you, there are just, it's like a game of whack-a-mole, except all the
[06:41.960 --> 06:45.760]  moles are up out of their hole at the same time.
[06:45.760 --> 06:49.240]  And we've got to find a way to hammer each one with the mallet.
[06:49.240 --> 06:53.040]  And that's what we're going to be doing here today on the Alex Jones show with myself,
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.920]  Alex Jones and special guests coming up as well.
[06:57.920 --> 07:02.520]  Before I lay out what's coming up with the news coverage today, because I've got three
[07:02.520 --> 07:09.600]  or four stacks of extremely important news, there's an energy that I haven't felt in a
[07:09.600 --> 07:18.000]  while right now in America and you may be feeling it and experiencing it yourself.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.640]  And it's an energy we haven't felt in years.
[07:21.640 --> 07:30.800]  It's an energy of victory, it's an energy of free speech, it's an energy of hopefulness.
[07:30.800 --> 07:37.440]  And really, the midterms coming up in 11 days is going to be either the lid put back on
[07:37.440 --> 07:42.680]  that energy or the lid blown off of that energy.
[07:42.680 --> 07:51.240]  And we move forward with the best Congress in modern day history, if we can get some
[07:51.240 --> 08:00.880]  of these great patriots in like a Blake Masters, like a Herschel Walker, and so many more just
[08:00.880 --> 08:04.720]  expanding to the few great patriots that we have in Congress right now in the Republican
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.720]  Party.
[08:05.720 --> 08:11.840]  And then it'll add more fuel to the flame of liberty that burns within the Republican
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.840]  Party.
[08:12.840 --> 08:14.000]  It's completely snuffed out of the Democrat Party.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.200]  That's why people like Tulsi Gabbard and others have left.
[08:18.200 --> 08:23.800]  And it will make them more emboldened to do what is right to save this country and speak
[08:23.800 --> 08:33.040]  the truth and move America forward in a way that brings it prosperity and independence
[08:33.040 --> 08:35.840]  for the people.
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.680]  The complete opposite of globalism, the complete opposite of liberalism, the complete opposite
[08:40.680 --> 08:43.840]  of the direction that we have been going.
[08:43.840 --> 08:53.680]  And a lot of that has to do with obviously the midterms, but I'll also, with Elon Musk
[08:53.680 --> 09:01.320]  officially closing the Twitter deal yesterday, and then with such viral tweets getting a
[09:01.320 --> 09:11.320]  million likes, plus like the bird is free, also replying to others on Twitter asking
[09:11.320 --> 09:18.960]  for accounts to be unbanned saying, we're going to be digging into that today.
[09:18.960 --> 09:26.680]  Now as far as, I mean, this has to be one of the most popular tweets of all time.
[09:26.680 --> 09:38.080]  The bird is freed, Elon Musk, 1.6 million likes, 264,000 retweets, not even up 24 hours
[09:38.080 --> 09:39.080]  yet.
[09:39.080 --> 09:40.080]  That's got to be one of the most popular of all time.
[09:40.080 --> 09:45.060]  I don't know what the list there is, but that's got to be up there.
[09:45.060 --> 09:48.360]  We might have free speech again on Twitter.
[09:48.360 --> 09:53.480]  And so I've obviously got a stack of news on that.
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.720]  I've got a big stack of news over here with some major developments leading up to the
[09:58.720 --> 10:08.040]  midterms, but the trend continues where liberals and leftists, and this is the genuinely anti-establishment
[10:08.040 --> 10:16.920]  liberal left that may not see eye to eye with you or I politically, but they don't like
[10:16.920 --> 10:24.640]  wars and generally speaking their anti-establishment.
[10:24.640 --> 10:32.680]  And so when you have AOC and Pelosi and now Ilhan Omar and all these other people getting
[10:32.680 --> 10:38.120]  protested at their own event by leftists for supporting war, Elizabeth Warren, so many
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.080]  others, that's a good sign.
[10:42.080 --> 10:47.080]  And I think a lot of that has to do with the boldness and the bravery of Tulsi Gabbard
[10:47.080 --> 10:54.920]  coming out who's always been anti-war and saying, I can't be a part of this Democrat
[10:54.920 --> 10:55.920]  party anymore.
[10:55.920 --> 10:59.800]  They're pro-war, they're pro-censorship, they're anti-American.
[10:59.800 --> 11:06.520]  And that has given other leftists, other liberals the courage to go to these Democrat events
[11:06.520 --> 11:13.520]  and shout down their representatives saying, we don't want World War III, you ran on anti-war.
[11:13.520 --> 11:16.120]  Why are you now getting us into World War III with Russia?
[11:16.120 --> 11:17.200]  What the hell is wrong with you?
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.520]  So we've got more examples of that.
[11:21.520 --> 11:27.320]  There is a huge development, and I didn't even get to this yesterday, and I'm hoping
[11:27.320 --> 11:29.000]  I'll have time to get to it today.
[11:29.000 --> 11:40.680]  There is a huge development on a January 6th defendant that may be the greatest new evidence,
[11:40.680 --> 11:51.280]  I mean, aside from REAPs, aside from all the Antifa people going into the capital first
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.720]  that we have on footage, and REAPs calling people to go in, and then the January 6th committee
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.080]  says they don't know who he is, and the FBI takes him off the most wanted list, as if
[12:01.080 --> 12:04.080]  that wasn't proof enough that there was Fed involvement.
[12:04.080 --> 12:13.560]  I think that this story of a January 6th defendant might be the most subtle yet obvious proof,
[12:13.560 --> 12:20.400]  specifically when you give it a side-by-side comparison with the fake kidnapping of Gretchen
[12:20.400 --> 12:27.880]  Whitmer case and the attempt to launch a similar situation in Virginia when Ralph Northam was
[12:27.880 --> 12:29.600]  the governor there.
[12:29.600 --> 12:35.680]  So I'll explain that coming up as well.
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.640]  We've got a Alex Jones prediction almost 14 years ago to the day.
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.000]  We'll go back to October 30th, 2008.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.920]  This is in regards to the deep state wanting a war with Russia now, making that clearer
[12:49.920 --> 12:56.960]  than ever, putting all of our lives in danger, quite frankly, the Pentagon and the White
[12:56.960 --> 13:03.680]  House right now, saber-rattling to try to get a war with Russia going, and we're not
[13:03.680 --> 13:10.120]  in a good position as far as geopolitically is concerned, because we're no longer self-sustainable,
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.320]  we're no longer independent, we are a dependent nation on foreign nations, we've shut off
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.240]  our own energy, so we don't even have energy.
[13:19.240 --> 13:25.080]  Biden has drained the strategic oil reserves, so that's a problem too, and then you see
[13:25.080 --> 13:29.800]  the rest of the world power structure backing Russia.
[13:29.800 --> 13:36.200]  And then you see who would supposedly be our allies in such a situation, the NATO allies
[13:36.200 --> 13:42.040]  and the European countries pretty much bulking and telling the US, yeah, you want war with
[13:42.040 --> 13:44.880]  Russia over Ukraine, you're actually in it alone.
[13:44.880 --> 13:54.160]  Because remember, Ukraine is not a NATO country, so despite all the propaganda trying to sell
[13:54.160 --> 14:04.640]  it like the West has some sort of loyalty or duty to protect Ukraine, they don't.
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.680]  European countries don't, and NATO countries don't, they don't.
[14:09.680 --> 14:16.880]  And the only reason why the US has that loyalty is because of people like Nancy Pelosi and
[14:16.880 --> 14:25.160]  the Biden crime family that have their business deals there, where they send $100 billion to
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.640]  Ukraine, and then where does the money go?
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.160]  Nobody seems to know, and nobody seems to want to know.
[14:36.160 --> 14:41.880]  So that is what's coming up on today's transmission, plus we'll be hearing from Alex along the
[14:41.880 --> 14:43.760]  way as well.
[14:43.760 --> 14:48.280]  But ladies and gentlemen, despite all the censorship, we're still here on air.
[14:48.280 --> 14:50.640]  And so that's the good news.
[14:50.640 --> 14:53.080]  They did not expect for Info Wars to still be on air.
[14:53.080 --> 14:55.920]  They did not expect Alex Jones to still have a voice.
[14:55.920 --> 15:02.120]  They did not expect you to still have a voice, yet here we are ready for another three-hour
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.120]  transmission, a four-hour Alex Jones show, and then I'll be also hosting the War Room
[15:06.120 --> 15:07.120]  later today.
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.280]  And that's thanks to your support at InfowarsStore.com.

[15:21.040 --> 15:24.840]  friends and family because people are thirsty for the truth.

[15:28.520 --> 15:29.960]  They're looking for knowledge.
[15:29.960 --> 15:31.560]  They're looking for understanding.
[15:31.560 --> 15:35.360]  And this book is a great blueprint for that process.

[16:00.120 --> 16:01.920]  This is our best seller.
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.720]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.280]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.200]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[16:14.200 --> 16:17.640]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.

[16:59.840 --> 17:05.720]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[17:05.720 --> 17:11.080]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.920]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[17:14.920 --> 17:15.920]  to speak freely.
[17:15.920 --> 17:18.960]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[17:18.960 --> 17:20.600]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[17:20.600 --> 17:24.760]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[17:24.760 --> 17:29.080]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.080]  your support.
[17:30.080 --> 17:33.240]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[17:33.240 --> 17:37.680]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[17:37.680 --> 17:41.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been because

[19:47.360 --> 19:51.600]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[20:01.640 --> 20:13.440]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:13.440 --> 20:26.200]  All right, I want to get into this stack of political news as we are 11 days out from
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.840]  the midterm elections.
[20:27.840 --> 20:31.980]  Such a key election coming up here in 11 days.
[20:31.980 --> 20:33.900]  It's hard to believe we're that close.
[20:33.900 --> 20:38.900]  The whole world, the whole process is so crazy now that you're actually near the finish line.
[20:38.900 --> 20:41.140]  You're like, whoa, here we are.
[20:41.140 --> 20:51.380]  Now there's some oddities in the financial news sector here today that I try to understand
[20:51.380 --> 20:58.020]  and it just really, the best way to describe it is that, again, you're being lied to by
[20:58.020 --> 21:01.640]  the White House, you're being lied to by the American media.
[21:01.640 --> 21:07.940]  And so this was a big story all week long, shell and total oil giants report huge profits
[21:07.940 --> 21:10.580]  on high energy prices.
[21:10.580 --> 21:14.820]  And so this was the big talking point is, oh, look, the oil companies are making more
[21:14.820 --> 21:17.020]  money than ever before.
[21:17.020 --> 21:22.820]  And they're trying to blame the oil companies, well, okay.
[21:22.820 --> 21:27.060]  But it's not even American oil companies, it's European oil companies.
[21:27.060 --> 21:33.620]  And so they're trying to say that this is an American oil problem and then they're covering
[21:33.620 --> 21:36.660]  European oil companies.
[21:36.660 --> 21:42.260]  So they say, see, look it out corrupt the American oil, look at how bad big oil is,
[21:42.260 --> 21:43.260]  look at what they do.
[21:43.260 --> 21:44.900]  And then you say, well, what are they talking about?
[21:44.900 --> 21:47.620]  Oh, European oil companies, wait, what?
[21:47.620 --> 21:52.140]  So what do you want Biden to do to European oil companies, liberals?
[21:52.140 --> 21:53.140]  I'm just curious.
[21:53.140 --> 21:59.860]  But okay, oil companies making a record profit, maybe you got a problem with that.
[21:59.860 --> 22:08.540]  Okay, so what happens when corporations, what happens when big businesses, what happens
[22:08.540 --> 22:10.540]  when they make a lot of money?
[22:10.540 --> 22:16.140]  Well, your GDP goes up, you see, because they're selling more products.
[22:16.140 --> 22:21.660]  So they complain that the oil companies are making more money than ever before, but then
[22:21.660 --> 22:31.340]  they celebrate that the White House is claiming that there has been a 2.6% GDP growth in the
[22:31.340 --> 22:32.340]  third quarter.
[22:32.340 --> 22:42.620]  So big corporations, big oil making record profits bad, GDP going up good.
[22:42.620 --> 22:46.820]  Those two things are not consistent, obviously.
[22:46.820 --> 22:50.660]  But again, we're talking about liberals, we're talking about Democrats, so consistency is
[22:50.660 --> 22:56.220]  not a concern of theirs, only the party propaganda.
[22:56.220 --> 23:01.420]  So again, oh, oil companies making a lot of money, big business making a lot of money,
[23:01.420 --> 23:08.740]  oh, GDP up when a Democrat's in the office, good, good, yes, good.
[23:08.740 --> 23:12.820]  Business is making a lot of money, bad, bad, yes, bad, boo, we don't like business is making
[23:12.820 --> 23:21.580]  money, no good, oh, GDP up, GDP up, good, yes, thank you, Biden, yes, GDP good.
[23:21.580 --> 23:24.020]  These are not bright people.
[23:24.020 --> 23:32.700]  But some aren't believing the 2.6 GDP number, like Wall Street, Silver, can't help but
[23:32.700 --> 23:39.980]  notice those Amazon earnings don't explicitly jibe with the whole 2.6 economic growth thing.
[23:39.980 --> 23:46.260]  How the heck is GDP up 2.6% when these numbers, with these numbers from Amazon, is GDP data
[23:46.260 --> 23:47.900]  fake right before the election?
[23:47.900 --> 23:55.180]  Well, I wouldn't be surprised if they faked data before the election.
[23:55.180 --> 24:01.620]  I mean, the GDP, we were already in a recession, technically speaking.
[24:01.620 --> 24:07.860]  So going up 2.6% is still not even getting it back to where it needed to be.
[24:07.860 --> 24:11.620]  So you're still technically in the red, if you're looking at from a percentage growth
[24:11.620 --> 24:15.940]  standpoint under the Biden administration, you're still in the red.
[24:15.940 --> 24:19.140]  But see, here's what they do.
[24:19.140 --> 24:24.460]  They tell this big lie, just like the Biden White House did with the gas prices.
[24:24.460 --> 24:28.260]  This is Joe Biden yesterday.
[24:28.260 --> 24:34.620]  So okay, they say, look how great we are, GDP growth up 2.6%, but if you look at the
[24:34.620 --> 24:39.420]  overall number since Biden got in the White House, it's still down.
[24:39.420 --> 24:43.620]  We'd actually still be considered in a recession if it wasn't for this most recent number.
[24:43.620 --> 24:47.860]  So maybe they faked it to say we're not in a recession, maybe it's legit.
[24:47.860 --> 24:51.180]  But either way, they're lying by saying, look at how good we've done with the GDP.
[24:51.180 --> 24:55.340]  This is the same thing they're doing with gas prices now.
[24:55.340 --> 25:04.900]  Here's Joe Biden yesterday taking a victory lap on lowering gas prices in Clip F.
[25:04.900 --> 25:13.500]  The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office.
[25:13.500 --> 25:18.100]  So, that is as big of a lie as you can make.
[25:18.100 --> 25:26.780]  Water is not wet, the sun doesn't rise in the east, whatever you want to say.
[25:26.780 --> 25:32.100]  We all know that the average price per gallon in the United States when Biden took office
[25:32.100 --> 25:35.300]  was $2.39 a gallon.
[25:35.300 --> 25:39.860]  This is easily available data.
[25:39.860 --> 25:46.500]  So gas, when Biden took office, was $2.39 per gallon.
[25:46.500 --> 25:51.220]  But here's what Joe Biden lies and tells you gas was, again, here it is, play the clip
[25:51.220 --> 25:52.300]  one more time.
[25:52.300 --> 26:00.940]  The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office.
[26:00.940 --> 26:06.940]  So gas got up to $5 after Joe Biden took office, he doubled the gas prices.
[26:06.940 --> 26:12.620]  More than doubled, actually, more than doubled, more than doubled.
[26:12.620 --> 26:16.380]  Even Twitter, which I guess we can't even say even Twitter now since it's owned by
[26:16.380 --> 26:21.900]  Elon Musk, but even Twitter has a fact check on this saying Biden's lying.
[26:21.900 --> 26:28.140]  It was $2.38 a gallon when he took office, he said it was $5.
[26:28.140 --> 26:32.740]  So he lies to you and the media is not going to call him on it and he assumes that you're
[26:32.740 --> 26:36.580]  so stupid you're going to believe his lie or he really doesn't even know what's going
[26:36.580 --> 26:37.580]  on actually.
[26:37.580 --> 26:39.780]  Biden doesn't even know where he is half the time.
[26:39.780 --> 26:45.660]  So $05 when I took office, look, I lowered the gas to $3.39, that's actually a dollar
[26:45.660 --> 26:50.500]  higher than it was when you took office, you jackass.
[26:50.500 --> 26:56.940]  So now they're doing the same thing with the GDP and they're saying, look, GDP is up 2.6
[26:56.940 --> 26:57.940]  percent.
[26:57.940 --> 26:58.940]  Thank you, Joe Biden.
[26:58.940 --> 26:59.940]  No.
[26:59.940 --> 27:07.620]  So he just had three quarters of negative GDP growth, which means we're in a recession
[27:07.620 --> 27:13.060]  and we're still in the red under Joe Biden and he says, look, we've gained 2.6 percent
[27:13.060 --> 27:15.180]  GDP growth, which is still in the red.
[27:15.180 --> 27:18.020]  Oh, look, gas is down from $5 a gallon.
[27:18.020 --> 27:22.620]  When I took office, no gas is up a dollar from $2.39 a gallon.
[27:22.620 --> 27:24.980]  When you took office, you liar.
[27:24.980 --> 27:26.260]  So it's the same thing with GDP.
[27:26.260 --> 27:28.660]  Oh, GDP up 2.6 percent.
[27:28.660 --> 27:36.940]  So GDP is actually down about 4 percent since you took office, you liar.
[27:36.940 --> 27:41.780]  But maybe crashing the economy isn't your thing.
[27:41.780 --> 27:42.780]  Maybe it's war.
[27:42.780 --> 27:44.900]  Maybe that's what you like.
[27:44.900 --> 27:50.660]  By the way, before I hit these war clips, in fact, I'll cover the news with the war
[27:50.660 --> 27:51.700]  on the other side.
[27:51.700 --> 27:58.620]  But here's Alex Jones on October 30th, 2008, almost 12 years ago to the day predicting
[27:58.620 --> 28:01.460]  a nuclear war with Russia in this clip.
[28:01.460 --> 28:05.820]  They want a major war with an influential world power.
[28:05.820 --> 28:06.820]  Mad men.
[28:06.820 --> 28:08.740]  I mean, what does it ever end?
[28:08.740 --> 28:10.820]  They're publicly stealing all the money.
[28:10.820 --> 28:13.420]  They're trying to start World War III.
[28:13.420 --> 28:15.900]  They snuck attack Russia a month and a half ago.
[28:15.900 --> 28:21.860]  They got 10,000 nukes, topolims, and they're openly, NATO has announced that they have
[28:21.860 --> 28:25.460]  a preemptive strike, that they may sneak attack Russia.
[28:25.460 --> 28:28.020]  And then Russia comes out and says, well, we're going to defend ourselves and the media
[28:28.020 --> 28:29.020]  spins that.
[28:29.020 --> 28:31.900]  It says Russia is threatening to blow the U.S. to Kingdom come.
[28:31.900 --> 28:34.020]  That's why the Russians are moving back into Cuba.
[28:34.020 --> 28:35.020]  They're moving into Venezuela.
[28:35.020 --> 28:36.900]  They've moved nukes into Venezuela.
[28:36.900 --> 28:38.220]  They're in the Gulf of Mexico.
[28:38.220 --> 28:44.020]  Random the Carlisle group are not amused at the fact that the stock market is crashing
[28:44.020 --> 28:48.340]  and they want a new war to reinvigorate it.
[28:48.340 --> 28:49.340]  They said that...
[28:49.340 --> 28:52.540]  I mean, that's evil enough, but why can't they pick Venezuela or something?
[28:52.540 --> 28:55.460]  Why does it have to be Russia and China?
[28:55.460 --> 28:56.620]  And now here we are.
[28:56.620 --> 28:58.620]  Once again, Alex Jones, ahead of his time.

[33:01.220 --> 33:08.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.220 --> 33:45.140]  So, nobody wants World War, you would think, nobody wants nuclear war.
[33:45.140 --> 33:49.180]  That is unless you want to see civilization destroyed, you want to see the planet destroyed
[33:49.180 --> 33:57.040]  and then you think you can take over upon its ashes, seems to be what our deep state and
[33:57.040 --> 33:59.020]  White House are into right now.
[33:59.020 --> 34:04.580]  The U.S. accelerates plan to deploy upgraded nukes to Europe.
[34:04.580 --> 34:08.940]  That's nice, let's just move a bunch of nukes around the planet and threaten nuclear war.
[34:08.940 --> 34:10.940]  That's what the people want.
[34:10.940 --> 34:14.580]  You'd think we'd be beyond that by now as humans in the information age, in the digital
[34:14.580 --> 34:21.500]  age, in the globalized age, but no, no, our governments still want to blow people up.
[34:21.500 --> 34:26.700]  In stunning strategy reversal, Pentagon will no longer rule out use of nuclear weapons
[34:26.700 --> 34:29.300]  against non-nuclear threats.
[34:29.300 --> 34:37.540]  So Russia comes out and says, we don't want to use nukes and we will not preemptively
[34:37.540 --> 34:39.060]  use nukes.
[34:39.060 --> 34:44.420]  Again, where are the peace talks, where are the summits, where are the leaders sitting
[34:44.420 --> 34:49.100]  down, Russia, Russia has said they would sit down in Zelensky for peace talks, Zelensky
[34:49.100 --> 34:54.900]  said FU, Elon Musk said he would help usher in peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, Zelensky
[34:54.900 --> 34:57.220]  said FU.
[34:57.220 --> 34:59.300]  And then that story goes on.
[34:59.300 --> 35:03.220]  And so Russia says we're not going to use nukes preemptively, so what is the U.S.'s
[35:03.220 --> 35:04.220]  response?
[35:04.220 --> 35:09.580]  Well, we will, wow.
[35:09.580 --> 35:15.740]  So I mean, you could say this is a moment of Russia lowering its guard, putting its guard
[35:15.740 --> 35:16.740]  down.
[35:16.740 --> 35:22.420]  This is a moment of Russia saying, look, we know we're not having peace talks, but here's
[35:22.420 --> 35:30.260]  our, here's our public statement saying we won't use nukes preemptively as a sign to the
[35:30.260 --> 35:36.220]  world that we don't want nuclear war, they haven't made their agenda in Ukraine's secret,
[35:36.220 --> 35:38.020]  but they're saying we don't want nuclear war.
[35:38.020 --> 35:44.260]  So the U.S. instead of saying this is an opportunity to lower the temperature in the room, this
[35:44.260 --> 35:50.140]  is an opportunity to maybe help avoid a nuclear confrontation or larger escalation of war,
[35:50.140 --> 35:53.820]  and instead the U.S. says, no, this is an opportunity for us to look at Russia as weak
[35:53.820 --> 36:03.700]  and threaten them with nukes, incredible stuff from our evil, satanic government, the White
[36:03.700 --> 36:08.260]  House and the Pentagon, sick, sick stuff.
[36:08.260 --> 36:12.740]  But the average liberal Democrat voter doesn't want war either.
[36:12.740 --> 36:19.020]  They have a self-preservation mechanism not to get into a nuclear war, despite the overwhelming
[36:19.020 --> 36:23.500]  propaganda in the media that would have you believe most liberals want war.
[36:23.500 --> 36:24.500]  That's not true.
[36:24.500 --> 36:28.980]  There are obviously the radical left that will just support any state propaganda that's
[36:28.980 --> 36:30.460]  shoved down their throats at this point.
[36:30.460 --> 36:32.940]  They're in total brainwashing Stockholm syndrome.
[36:32.940 --> 36:34.980]  We can't really help them anymore.
[36:34.980 --> 36:36.500]  They're gone.
[36:36.500 --> 36:41.300]  But no, the average liberal, the average liberal Democrat that can still think for themselves
[36:41.300 --> 36:42.580]  doesn't want war.
[36:42.580 --> 36:48.980]  And so now you've had Cortez, you've had Elizabeth Warren, and all of these other liberal Democrats
[36:48.980 --> 36:54.860]  in Congress have their events get shut down by leftist protesters who are against war.
[36:54.860 --> 37:02.220]  Here is the latest example at an Ilhan Omar event where she gets disrupted by protesters,
[37:02.220 --> 37:03.220]  anti-war protesters.
[37:03.220 --> 37:06.060]  Here it is in clip B.
[37:06.060 --> 37:14.780]  You are supposed to be a progressive Democrat, anti-war, anti-war, 80 billion to Ukraine
[37:14.780 --> 37:16.780]  is not anti-war.
[37:16.780 --> 37:22.780]  You are helping Ukraine defend themselves if Ukraine is killing its own citizens.
[37:22.780 --> 37:26.860]  You are helping people in the Donbass war.
[37:26.860 --> 37:32.820]  We are helping little children like you that have your power to tell.
[37:32.820 --> 37:37.700]  So I'll pause it right quick, see claims that they're helping little children like her.
[37:37.700 --> 37:39.300]  First of all, that's not even accurate at all.
[37:39.300 --> 37:45.420]  To act like Ukraine and Somalia are in the same situation is just ridiculous.
[37:45.420 --> 37:49.340]  But oh, okay, let us pretend like we can take that at face value.
[37:49.340 --> 37:55.980]  Oh, so you mean we're going to take in Ukrainian refugees like yourself who then end up working
[37:55.980 --> 38:01.220]  to destroy the very country that gave them a second shot at life?
[38:01.220 --> 38:06.300]  Just like we took in Ilhan Omar and gave her everything and now she works to destroy
[38:06.300 --> 38:07.820]  the country that took her in.
[38:07.820 --> 38:09.820]  That's what it's all about to her in Ukraine.
[38:09.820 --> 38:11.860]  Oh, now I get it.
[38:11.860 --> 38:16.420]  Let's bring in other foreigners like Ilhan Omar to come to the United States of America
[38:16.420 --> 38:18.980]  and destroy it.
[38:18.980 --> 38:24.660]  That's because I guess that's a, I guess her saying she's anti-war but being pro-destroying
[38:24.660 --> 38:29.540]  America with foreigners is a better stance to take in response to this protester.
[38:29.540 --> 38:33.740]  So guys, pick it up where we left it off here and we will finish up the clip.
[38:33.740 --> 38:34.740]  Go ahead.
[38:34.740 --> 38:42.100]  We are helping little children like me that have been held in touch, so unless, unless,
[38:42.100 --> 38:50.700]  listen, unless you have not been paying attention to what is happening, there are millions of
[38:50.700 --> 38:53.020]  Ukrainians that have been displaced.
[38:53.020 --> 38:58.620]  There are piles of bodies that are being found in mass graves.
[38:58.620 --> 39:03.740]  There are little children who are, who lives are being lost.
[39:03.740 --> 39:04.740]  Like Zelensky.
[39:04.740 --> 39:07.740]  Yeah, Zelensky and the Ukrainians are doing all of this with our weapons.
[39:07.740 --> 39:13.740]  But unless you are someone like me that haven't been that child, you do not get to tell me
[39:13.740 --> 39:19.740]  what my votes mean and how I get to vote in supporting the people.
[39:19.740 --> 39:22.540]  See, and there it is right there.
[39:22.540 --> 39:29.900]  There is the entire psychology for, for where they're coming from on display here.
[39:29.900 --> 39:36.660]  I'm bigger and better than you, so I, my opinion matters more than yours.
[39:36.660 --> 39:42.500]  I was a refugee from Somalia, therefore I'm more important than you, my opinion matters
[39:42.500 --> 39:45.540]  more than you, and you don't get to criticize anything I do.
[39:45.540 --> 39:46.700]  Do you see that mentality?
[39:46.700 --> 39:47.900]  It's the same thing.
[39:47.900 --> 39:52.540]  Oh, I'm, I'm a gay liberal, so I get to strip naked in front of children and make them grab
[39:52.540 --> 39:54.540]  my genitals.
[39:54.540 --> 39:56.380]  I'm pro trans kids.
[39:56.380 --> 40:00.140]  I get to chop up little boys and girls and call it gender affirmation care.
[40:00.140 --> 40:01.140]  You bigot.
[40:01.140 --> 40:02.140]  You transphobe.
[40:02.140 --> 40:05.780]  Oh, I'm black.
[40:05.780 --> 40:09.700]  And so you can't criticize anything I do because I'm a victim here.
[40:09.700 --> 40:11.340]  I'm black.
[40:11.340 --> 40:13.540]  This is the psychology of the left.
[40:13.540 --> 40:15.840]  This is why they have the victim economy.
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.260]  This is why they want to have the victim totem pole putting you at the bottom of it and
[40:21.260 --> 40:27.060]  they perched on top of you, you can't criticize them, they're bigger victims than you.
[40:27.060 --> 40:34.060]  So imagine, so the protester says, you said you were anti-war.
[40:34.060 --> 40:36.860]  You have funded the war in Ukraine.
[40:36.860 --> 40:38.700]  That's not anti-war.
[40:38.700 --> 40:42.820]  And then a lot of more says, because I was a little gore, a little girl in a war torn
[40:42.820 --> 40:47.540]  nation, you can't criticize me or anything I do.
[40:47.540 --> 40:53.500]  But then the protester, obviously more informed than she is says, you do understand that that's
[40:53.500 --> 40:56.980]  Ukraine and Zelensky bombing Ukrainians in Donbas.
[40:56.980 --> 40:59.180]  That's not Russia.
[40:59.180 --> 41:01.140]  And she just goes on to say, you can't criticize me.
[41:01.140 --> 41:04.020]  I'm a Somali refugee.
[41:04.020 --> 41:08.700]  And then she says that they're not anti-war protesters, even though that's exactly what
[41:08.700 --> 41:09.700]  they are.
[41:09.700 --> 41:12.180]  So imagine, I mean, this is the clown world of it.
[41:12.180 --> 41:16.660]  You go to a Democrat event as an anti-war protester because you're anti-war and the
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.660]  Democrats are getting us into a war with Russia.
[41:18.660 --> 41:23.220]  And you say, I'm going to make a disturbance here because I'm anti-war and I don't like
[41:23.220 --> 41:25.380]  what the Democrats representing me are doing.
[41:25.380 --> 41:30.860]  And then they say, how dare you, you're not anti-war.
[41:30.860 --> 41:34.420]  That's how fast reality comes at you.
[41:34.420 --> 41:38.180]  That's how fast it comes at you now.
[41:38.180 --> 41:41.580]  And I would imagine this trend is going to continue.
[41:41.580 --> 41:47.780]  Now the major push ahead of midterms here, Biden's student loan forgiveness has been
[41:47.780 --> 41:48.780]  a disaster.
[41:48.780 --> 41:50.700]  I think they fired it off too early.
[41:50.700 --> 41:52.220]  Nobody's getting the student loan forgiveness.
[41:52.220 --> 41:53.220]  People are complaining.
[41:53.220 --> 41:56.580]  They're saying Biden lied about it and it's just illegal to do it.
[41:56.580 --> 41:58.180]  It's not holding up in the courts.
[41:58.180 --> 42:02.620]  And so the Biden administration came out today and said, Biden predicts student loan forgiveness
[42:02.620 --> 42:06.300]  checks will go out within two weeks, oh, just before midterms.
[42:06.300 --> 42:09.740]  I got news for you, liberals, they're lying.
[42:09.740 --> 42:11.980]  You're not going to get that student debt relief.
[42:11.980 --> 42:13.140]  Biden lied to you.
[42:13.140 --> 42:14.380]  The Democrats lied to you.
[42:14.380 --> 42:17.300]  They can't even legally do it.
[42:17.300 --> 42:21.780]  They tried to buy your vote and they assume you're stupid enough to fall for it even though
[42:21.780 --> 42:22.940]  you won't get the money.
[42:22.940 --> 42:25.540]  Hey, I'm going to give you 200 bucks to vote Democrat.
[42:25.540 --> 42:27.340]  Oh, okay.
[42:27.340 --> 42:28.340]  Weeks go by.
[42:28.340 --> 42:29.340]  Hey, where's my 200 bucks?
[42:29.340 --> 42:30.340]  It's coming.
[42:30.340 --> 42:31.340]  Tomorrow's the midterm.
[42:31.340 --> 42:32.340]  Where's my 200 bucks?
[42:32.340 --> 42:33.340]  Don't worry.
[42:33.340 --> 42:34.340]  It's coming.
[42:34.340 --> 42:35.340]  No, it's never coming.
[42:35.340 --> 42:40.740]  But that's okay because Biden apparently is driving cars with Jay Leno.
[42:40.740 --> 42:44.940]  Biden pushes Corvette to 118 miles per hour in drag race against Colin Powell's son.
[42:44.940 --> 42:45.940]  So he's having fun.
[42:45.940 --> 42:47.860]  He can drive the gas powered car.
[42:47.860 --> 42:53.140]  Vice President Harris announces $1 billion for electric school buses in all 50 states.
[42:53.140 --> 42:55.980]  That's a nice little flower for her.
[42:55.980 --> 42:58.820]  It's not going to solve climate change, but she gets to celebrate.
[42:58.820 --> 43:05.180]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.700]  you.
[43:06.700 --> 43:10.620]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[43:10.620 --> 43:15.700]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[43:15.700 --> 43:19.940]  the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[43:19.940 --> 43:26.020]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com
[43:26.020 --> 43:30.660]  and to also financially support info wars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using

[43:46.460 --> 43:49.780]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[44:05.660 --> 44:09.940]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[44:09.940 --> 44:15.260]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[44:15.260 --> 44:20.380]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and
[44:20.380 --> 44:27.860]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[44:27.860 --> 44:31.380]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[44:31.380 --> 44:37.140]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[44:37.140 --> 44:41.620]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[44:41.620 --> 44:47.660]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours
[44:47.660 --> 44:49.580]  it isn't going to give up.
[44:49.580 --> 44:51.340]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[44:51.340 --> 45:00.620]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[45:00.620 --> 45:05.260]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the global of stone documents from their own
[45:05.260 --> 45:07.300]  admissions is now happening.
[45:07.300 --> 45:11.780]  Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of your
[45:11.780 --> 45:17.820]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[45:17.820 --> 45:20.420]  the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[45:20.420 --> 45:25.260]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[45:25.260 --> 45:30.460]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[45:30.460 --> 45:34.380]  In my decades on air I've never asked for personal donations but I'm being forced by
[45:34.380 --> 45:39.900]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[45:39.900 --> 45:41.140]  It's unsustainable.

[46:00.340 --> 46:06.260]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[46:06.260 --> 46:11.620]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[46:11.620 --> 46:13.700]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[46:13.700 --> 46:16.500]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[46:16.500 --> 46:18.260]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[46:18.260 --> 46:21.180]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[46:21.180 --> 46:25.300]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[46:25.300 --> 46:26.300]  all of this.
[46:26.300 --> 46:29.620]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[46:29.620 --> 46:30.620]  your support.
[46:30.620 --> 46:33.700]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[46:33.700 --> 46:38.220]  as to America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[46:38.220 --> 46:41.860]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been
[46:41.860 --> 46:43.540]  because of your past support.
[46:43.540 --> 46:47.340]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, to critical juncture of the battle,

[47:01.020 --> 47:07.020]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:31.020 --> 47:38.900]  Last night, there was an intruder at the Pelosi mansion, the Pelosi estate.
[47:38.900 --> 47:44.180]  It's gigantic, it's huge, because they're rich.
[47:44.180 --> 47:53.340]  And Paul Pelosi was home and was attacked with a hammer and sent to the emergency room,
[47:53.340 --> 47:59.460]  and now more is developing as far as the details in this story are concerned.
[47:59.460 --> 48:04.740]  They're claiming that the assailant, the home invader, was shouting, where is Nancy?
[48:04.740 --> 48:05.940]  Where is Nancy?
[48:05.940 --> 48:09.980]  And went in the house looking for Nancy Pelosi, and of course, this is the Democrat angle
[48:09.980 --> 48:16.180]  of where the victims here see MAGA extremists are trying to have us killed.
[48:16.180 --> 48:25.060]  Now, before I get into the questions as far as that story is concerned, should we not
[48:25.060 --> 48:28.980]  look at the obvious here?
[48:28.980 --> 48:35.500]  Victims have been engaged in domestic terrorism for my entire life.
[48:35.500 --> 48:42.580]  I mean, I don't like to say I'm a victim because these people only come at me because
[48:42.580 --> 48:45.900]  I'm a freedom fighter.
[48:45.900 --> 48:50.860]  But no, I mean, I could sit here and I could show the dozens of death threats that I get.
[48:50.860 --> 48:56.060]  I could show I've had two incidents where leftist terrorists have come to my private
[48:56.060 --> 49:00.260]  residence to happen twice in my life.
[49:00.260 --> 49:01.260]  And I could get in all that.
[49:01.260 --> 49:02.260]  And it's not just me.
[49:02.260 --> 49:04.060]  It's probably a lot of you in the audience.
[49:04.060 --> 49:15.020]  We've had dozens of GOP headquarters fire-bombed, planned, excuse me, rather non-abortion support
[49:15.020 --> 49:18.900]  centers for women, pro-life centers for women, fire-bombed.
[49:18.900 --> 49:22.660]  I mean, do we even have to get into all the Democrat terrorism of 2020?
[49:22.660 --> 49:25.460]  Do we have to get into the chas and the chop?
[49:25.460 --> 49:29.740]  Do we have to get into Democrats and liberals trying to burn federal buildings, burn police
[49:29.740 --> 49:30.740]  stations?
[49:30.740 --> 49:32.820]  We all remember all of that.
[49:32.820 --> 49:36.220]  They just sent an assassin to try to kill Justice Kavanaugh.
[49:36.220 --> 49:40.300]  They sent an assassin to the Republican baseball practice to try to engage in a mass shooting
[49:40.300 --> 49:42.980]  of Republicans, shot Steve's police and others.
[49:42.980 --> 49:46.940]  They've tried to attack and kill Rand Paul multiple times.
[49:46.940 --> 49:52.300]  So I mean, if you want to look at a rap sheet, let's say you decide to take this story at
[49:52.300 --> 49:58.260]  the face value that a conservative went to hunt down Nancy Pelosi in her home with a hammer
[49:58.260 --> 49:59.980]  shouting, where is Nancy?
[49:59.980 --> 50:02.260]  So okay, let's take a look at a rap sheet.
[50:02.260 --> 50:07.900]  The Democrat domestic terror rap sheet is about 10 million pages long from the KKK to
[50:07.900 --> 50:12.700]  the Weather Underground to Antifa and BLM and to just their random supporters going
[50:12.700 --> 50:15.060]  out to assassinate Republicans.
[50:15.060 --> 50:18.380]  Their rap sheet is about 10,000, 10 million pages long.
[50:18.380 --> 50:23.580]  The conservative rap sheet of violence is a page, one page.
[50:23.580 --> 50:29.420]  So I'm not going to be sit here, I'm not going to sit here and get gas lit by the Democrats
[50:29.420 --> 50:37.260]  crying victim if it's even true that a crazed conservative went into the house of the Pelosi's
[50:37.260 --> 50:42.460]  to try to harm Nancy Pelosi with a hammer, which I don't even believe that.
[50:42.460 --> 50:47.860]  But let's say I take that at face value, we condemn that, we don't promote violence,
[50:47.860 --> 50:52.020]  we're not violent people, that's not what we do, I fully condemn someone going into Nancy
[50:52.020 --> 50:55.980]  Pelosi's house with a hammer to try to do her harm, fully condemn it.
[50:55.980 --> 51:01.340]  Now you'll never see that action out of Democrat liberals, they never condemn their terrorism
[51:01.340 --> 51:07.780]  because at the end of the day they support it, they cheer it on, they bail out the terrorists
[51:07.780 --> 51:10.820]  like Kamala Harris did.
[51:10.820 --> 51:19.380]  But okay, at face value I think all conservatives will condone violence being done to the Pelosi
[51:19.380 --> 51:20.700]  in the name of politics.
[51:20.700 --> 51:24.340]  I don't think a conservative will have any problem with those words coming out of their
[51:24.340 --> 51:29.100]  mouth today, even if most of us don't even believe that that's the truth.
[51:29.100 --> 51:37.500]  But okay, there you go, Democrat domestic terror rap sheet, thousands of pages long,
[51:37.500 --> 51:42.540]  and of course the conservative rap sheet, a single page.
[51:42.540 --> 51:45.060]  But we condone that, fine.
[51:45.060 --> 51:48.260]  But oh, see what they did on January 6th, they got all the conservatives, all the Republicans
[51:48.260 --> 51:52.500]  to condone that, now that looks like it was actually a Fed surrection, but I'll have more
[51:52.500 --> 51:53.780]  on that coming up.
[51:53.780 --> 51:55.420]  Back to the story last night.
[51:55.420 --> 51:58.940]  So others are mentioning this is not the first time there's been a security breach in the
[51:58.940 --> 52:04.580]  Pelosi neighborhood, even Harmeet Dillon, a lawyer who has experienced with this story
[52:04.580 --> 52:09.300]  and specific knowledge on it, is saying how could this be possible?
[52:09.300 --> 52:12.420]  The neighborhood the Pelosi's are in is extremely secure.
[52:12.420 --> 52:14.940]  It's a bunch of millionaires that live there.
[52:14.940 --> 52:19.620]  The house that the Pelosi's live in is secure in its own right with a private gated fence
[52:19.620 --> 52:22.980]  and security cameras and security.
[52:22.980 --> 52:31.060]  So how does a lone hammer man get through all of that security undetected into the Pelosi
[52:31.060 --> 52:40.140]  home undetected, not only that, but we have no videos or images of the individual, none.
[52:40.140 --> 52:49.580]  Now let's recall, just earlier this week, Katie Hobbs' campaign blamed a break in at
[52:49.580 --> 52:58.300]  her campaign headquarters on Kerry Lake supporters, then when the image came out of the criminal
[52:58.300 --> 53:03.740]  and the investigation was launched into the criminal, all of a sudden Katie Hobbs' campaign
[53:03.740 --> 53:08.340]  quit blaming it on Kerry Lake, all of a sudden Katie Hobbs' campaign stopped talking about
[53:08.340 --> 53:09.340]  that.
[53:09.340 --> 53:11.820]  Huh, I wonder why that would be.
[53:11.820 --> 53:19.020]  Obviously, they lied and they knew it wasn't a member of Kerry Lake's supporting voters
[53:19.020 --> 53:23.980]  and it was either a random act of criminality or even they false flagged themselves to blame
[53:23.980 --> 53:26.780]  Lake in their desperation.
[53:26.780 --> 53:35.100]  Either way, they got wildly silent after screaming as loudly as they can, look at what Kerry
[53:35.100 --> 53:39.940]  Lake did to us, she sent a terrorist into our campaign headquarters, then the late campaign
[53:39.940 --> 53:43.540]  denied it, shared the image of the individual, said it's under investigation, and all of
[53:43.540 --> 53:47.380]  a sudden the Hobbs' campaign crickets.
[53:47.380 --> 53:52.220]  So what's the real story with the Nancy Pelosi break in?
[53:52.220 --> 53:56.220]  I would say, well look, look at how much crime there is in California, look at how much
[53:56.220 --> 54:00.940]  crime there is in San Francisco, are you really surprised a break in at your house is almost
[54:00.940 --> 54:06.380]  an odds on favorite these days, even if you are Nancy Pelosi, but no.
[54:06.380 --> 54:11.980]  If it was a conservative crazy that went in there looking for Nancy Pelosi, we condemn
[54:11.980 --> 54:13.260]  it, that is bad.
[54:13.260 --> 54:18.060]  We hope that the investigation bears fruit and the criminal is brought to justice.
[54:18.060 --> 54:24.340]  But I'm sorry that I can't sit here and believe that at face value, no, no I can't.
[54:24.340 --> 54:29.620]  We know Democrats do false flags against themselves, we know that the hate crime hoax is a massive
[54:29.620 --> 54:30.620]  phenomenon.
[54:30.620 --> 54:35.700]  In fact, there was a book that just came out, I'm looking forward to reading this book.
[54:35.700 --> 54:39.340]  I forget the gentleman's name, he was on Fox News last night, it was Ridley something who
[54:39.340 --> 54:44.140]  just wrote a book about hate crime hoaxes, an entire book, I mean folks, we have dozens
[54:44.140 --> 54:48.940]  on record of hate crime hoaxes, and it's always the same side doing it.
[54:48.940 --> 54:59.220]  The left from Jussie Smollett to the Boston Children's Hospital fake bomber, where they
[54:59.220 --> 55:03.940]  write fake, they write stories calling me a conspiracy theorist because I accurately
[55:03.940 --> 55:09.980]  cover the news when it was mainstream news that that was a hoax.
[55:09.980 --> 55:13.740]  But so what is the real story with the Pelosi break in?
[55:13.740 --> 55:17.500]  Who knows if we'll ever know the truth, but at the time they're trying to blame Trump,
[55:17.500 --> 55:20.660]  they're trying to blame conservatives saying, look, conservatives are violent, they came
[55:20.660 --> 55:21.660]  into my house.
[55:21.660 --> 55:26.620]  But of course, the real story would be, okay, so if that's bad, so if somebody breaking
[55:26.620 --> 55:32.380]  into Pelosi's house to do harm to the Pelosi's is bad, and it is, then what do you call all
[55:32.380 --> 55:37.060]  of the domestic terrorism from the Democrat party for my entire life?
[55:37.060 --> 55:39.220]  Hell on earth?
[55:39.220 --> 55:43.940]  Well, let's just take a look at what goes on in these Democrat cities.
[55:43.940 --> 55:50.540]  A seven-year-old boy hit and killed by stray bullet in his Chicago home.
[55:50.540 --> 55:52.340]  Gun-free zone, by the way.
[55:52.340 --> 55:57.860]  Gun-free zone, Chicago, seven-year-old boy killed by stray bullet, gun-free zone.
[55:57.860 --> 56:02.980]  New York police reveals 25 victims who have been shoved in front of subway cars so far
[56:02.980 --> 56:08.660]  this year with two months to go, two victims killed, 20 narrowly avoided death.
[56:08.660 --> 56:10.540]  Was that white supremacists doing that?
[56:10.540 --> 56:11.540]  No.
[56:11.540 --> 56:12.540]  No.
[56:12.540 --> 56:15.020]  They were stabbed and hit by a stranger on Brooklyn Street.
[56:15.020 --> 56:18.980]  Woman, just standing on the street corner, guy just randomly comes up, stabs her, walks
[56:18.980 --> 56:19.980]  away.
[56:19.980 --> 56:21.820]  Is that white supremacy?
[56:21.820 --> 56:22.820]  No.
[56:22.820 --> 56:27.500]  Youth, youth, who stabbed home intruder, jailed for three and a half years.
[56:27.500 --> 56:30.460]  Now this is actually a wild story out of Ireland.
[56:30.460 --> 56:35.940]  An individual breaks into his home, the young man stabs and kills the intruder, he gets
[56:35.940 --> 56:37.580]  three and a half years.
[56:37.580 --> 56:41.620]  So in America, if you're a criminal who stabs somebody in the streets, you get released
[56:41.620 --> 56:43.060]  from jail the next day.
[56:43.060 --> 56:46.460]  In Ireland, you stab somebody that invades your house, you get three and a half years
[56:46.460 --> 56:47.460]  in jail.
[56:47.460 --> 56:48.460]  Crazy.
[56:48.460 --> 56:49.860]  Back to America, though.
[56:49.860 --> 56:53.380]  Slain landlord found in freezer, called police many times on tenant.
[56:53.380 --> 57:00.740]  Now, why would a person of color, renting from a white woman, decide that she doesn't
[57:00.740 --> 57:06.740]  have to pay rent and when the white woman demands that she pay rent, she decides to chop her
[57:06.740 --> 57:09.620]  up and put her in a freezer?
[57:09.620 --> 57:11.860]  Why would that be?
[57:11.860 --> 57:13.980]  Who would have given her that idea?
[57:13.980 --> 57:20.820]  Guys, please pull up the New York Post story for me so we can get a look at this.
[57:20.820 --> 57:26.860]  Tenet Sandra Kolaulu, 36, has been charged with murder of Francis Walker, 69, who was
[57:26.860 --> 57:32.580]  found in a freezer in her north side home after a resident of the building chopped her
[57:32.580 --> 57:37.300]  up and put her in a freezer because she didn't want to pay rent.
[57:37.300 --> 57:39.500]  And after all, she's a minority.
[57:39.500 --> 57:41.020]  So she shouldn't have to pay rent.
[57:41.020 --> 57:44.660]  And if you make her pay rent as a white person, you should get murdered.
[57:44.660 --> 57:46.580]  Who would have given her that idea?
[57:46.580 --> 57:50.020]  Not the peace-loving Democrats.
[57:50.020 --> 57:51.180]  It's our best seller.
[57:51.180 --> 57:55.140]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[57:55.140 --> 58:00.220]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[58:00.220 --> 58:04.220]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.

[58:13.020 --> 58:14.020]  function of the body.

[58:18.820 --> 58:21.380]  need to live and be healthy.

[58:23.660 --> 58:27.660]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it
[58:27.660 --> 58:31.740]  is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[58:31.740 --> 58:35.180]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the

[58:52.500 --> 58:57.980]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.

[59:51.420 --> 1:00:06.260]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.260 --> 1:00:16.700]  Boy, it's been a rough go for Paul Pelosi, married to the wicked witch of the West,
[1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:26.100]  death warmed over Nancy, then drives his car completely inebriated, gets in a crash.
[1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:30.180]  You would probably be in jail for years if you did that, not Paul Pelosi.
[1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:34.660]  And they said, home, when somebody allegedly breaks in and tries to harm his wife with
[1:00:34.660 --> 1:00:38.380]  a hammer and takes it out on him.
[1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:42.780]  But of course, people are wondering what the real story is, and that's just where we're
[1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:43.780]  at now.
[1:00:43.780 --> 1:00:48.900]  Sadly, this is on both sides of the aisle, nobody trusts anybody anymore, but Democrats
[1:00:48.900 --> 1:00:54.780]  have a track record of faking hate crimes and lying.
[1:00:54.780 --> 1:00:57.980]  And so, of course, people are questioning it.
[1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:08.780]  But again, what happened to the slain landlord in Chicago when Sandra Kolalu chopped her up
[1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:14.740]  and put her in a freezer because she was demanding that she pay her rent?
[1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:21.700]  Why would a black woman feel that she doesn't have to pay rent to the white woman?
[1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:25.180]  And when the white woman demands rent, she says, well, I'm going to chop you up and put
[1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:26.340]  you in a freezer.
[1:01:26.340 --> 1:01:27.340]  Why?
[1:01:27.340 --> 1:01:28.640]  Who would have given her that idea?
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:32.300]  Not the party of peace, the Democrats, of course not.
[1:01:32.300 --> 1:01:35.380]  Of course not them.
[1:01:35.380 --> 1:01:44.140]  He's already been called on the killer five times in October alone.
[1:01:44.140 --> 1:01:48.140]  But I guess, you know, with Democrat logic, we should ban knives and we should ban hammers,
[1:01:48.140 --> 1:01:49.140]  right?
[1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:50.140]  Right.
[1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:51.140]  Right.
[1:01:51.140 --> 1:01:52.140]  Right.
[1:01:52.140 --> 1:01:53.140]  Right.
[1:01:53.140 --> 1:01:54.140]  Right.
[1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:55.140]  Right.
[1:01:55.140 --> 1:01:56.140]  Right.
[1:01:56.140 --> 1:01:57.140]  Right.
[1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:58.140]  Right.
[1:01:58.140 --> 1:01:59.140]  Right.
[1:01:59.140 --> 1:02:00.140]  Right.
[1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:01.140]  Right.
[1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:02.140]  Right.
[1:02:02.140 --> 1:02:07.140]  Right.
[1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:13.960]  Now, even when he gets something right, we'll call him, by his real name, Sink Uyghur, formerly
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:16.940]  known as Chunk Yogurt of the Young Turks.
[1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:19.540]  He's like had some sort of an epiphany, whether he realizes it or not.
[1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:24.140]  I don't know if maybe he got, he maybe went into the deep Amazon rainforest and had some
[1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:25.420]  ayahuasca.
[1:02:25.420 --> 1:02:27.400]  Maybe he smoked some DMT.
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.720]  Maybe he consumed some magical mushrooms.
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:32.020]  But he seems to have some sort of an awakening here.
[1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:36.600]  She's calling out Democrat liberal cities are turning into hell holes.
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:38.780]  And then a couple more instances here.
[1:02:38.780 --> 1:02:42.660]  He says, I hope Karen Bass proves me wrong, but I would be shocked if she changed the status
[1:02:42.660 --> 1:02:43.860]  quo even a tiny bit.
[1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:47.540]  Well, yeah, that's the Democrat status quo of violent cities.
[1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:48.940]  What did she do in Congress?
[1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:51.020]  Approximately nothing.
[1:02:51.020 --> 1:02:53.460]  That's what establishment Dems always do.
[1:02:53.460 --> 1:02:55.240]  LA desperately needs change.
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:57.860]  If you don't think it doesn't need a change, that's amazing.
[1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:00.740]  Watch, thank you for getting one right.
[1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:01.820]  Another one.
[1:03:01.820 --> 1:03:06.220]  There is this persistent irrationality in American politics that people assume you love
[1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.220]  the person you're voting for and think they're perfect.
[1:03:08.220 --> 1:03:11.060]  No, it just means they're better than your other choice.
[1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:12.580]  Why is this so hard for people to understand?
[1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:14.180]  It's an incredibly simple concept.
[1:03:14.180 --> 1:03:18.140]  Wait, are you talking about Trump?
[1:03:18.140 --> 1:03:20.060]  Are you talking about Trump here?
[1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:22.660]  Because that's what people were saying about Trump.
[1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:30.660]  And now you're saying about Biden on, on indeed, hmm.
[1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:31.660]  And then there's this.
[1:03:31.660 --> 1:03:34.340]  Get used to this because this is the new world order.
[1:03:34.340 --> 1:03:41.340]  This is the end man made climate change green new deal right here for you.
[1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:49.660]  Thousands to ashamed to go to work because they can't afford soap and deodorant good.
[1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:50.660]  That's good.
[1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:56.420]  A report suggests 3.2 million of adults in Britain are in hygiene poverty and many are
[1:03:56.420 --> 1:04:03.780]  ashamed to go to work because they cannot afford items such as soap and deodorant good.
[1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:04.780]  Don't you get it?
[1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:05.900]  That's good.
[1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.260]  You're causing climate change.
[1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:15.820]  I don't know what it is about logic and some people's inability to have it or some people's
[1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:23.900]  inability to reach conclusions because, because logic is not a, a it, it moves, it's, it's,
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:25.340]  it's moving.
[1:04:25.340 --> 1:04:28.300]  Logic leads to conclusions.
[1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:31.820]  So what do you think is going to happen with your whole stop man made climate change when
[1:04:31.820 --> 1:04:37.220]  you shut off energy, shut off oil, like, yeah, you're not going to have hygiene products.
[1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:38.220]  You're not going to have warm showers.
[1:04:38.220 --> 1:04:39.780]  You're not going to have running water.
[1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:41.020]  You're not going to have plumbing.
[1:04:41.020 --> 1:04:42.020]  You're not going to have heating.
[1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:43.020]  You're not going to have air conditioning.
[1:04:43.020 --> 1:04:44.020]  You're not going to go to work.
[1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:45.340]  You're not going to have a car.
[1:04:45.340 --> 1:04:49.140]  So they sit here and they're like, stop oil, stop energy, stop climate change.
[1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:52.020]  And then they're like, I'm so poor, I can't afford anything.
[1:04:52.020 --> 1:04:53.300]  What's going on?
[1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:55.100]  That's what you wanted.
[1:04:55.100 --> 1:04:59.340]  You're saving the planet now, just die.
[1:04:59.340 --> 1:05:05.460]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:05:05.460 --> 1:05:11.140]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:05:11.140 --> 1:05:14.780]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:05:14.780 --> 1:05:18.300]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:19.300]  It's game over.
[1:05:19.300 --> 1:05:24.340]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:29.500]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:34.820]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,
[1:05:34.820 --> 1:05:35.820]  it changes the world.
[1:05:35.820 --> 1:05:40.740]  And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products that empower you
[1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:45.460]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:47.980]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[1:05:47.980 --> 1:05:54.220]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowars.com.
[1:05:54.220 --> 1:06:01.220]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:06:24.220 --> 1:06:42.660]  I want to get into the Twitter news now and guys, let's put this image on screen.
[1:06:42.660 --> 1:06:49.140]  So the people can see who has been censoring them on Twitter for the last year.
[1:06:49.140 --> 1:06:52.620]  There are the people who have been censoring you on Twitter.
[1:06:52.620 --> 1:06:55.220]  How does that make you feel?
[1:06:55.220 --> 1:07:01.220]  How does that make you feel that these two individuals have been censoring your free
[1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:08.580]  speech, the free speech of Americans censored by these two?
[1:07:08.580 --> 1:07:15.020]  You know, there's this thing about America and about American people called freedom
[1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:17.380]  of speech and it's something we really believe in.
[1:07:17.380 --> 1:07:24.500]  It's part of our destiny to be free and show the world the meaning of freedom and the results
[1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:28.740]  of freedom with the prosperity that it brings.
[1:07:28.740 --> 1:07:33.420]  And when you have foreigners come here that don't have those same values that shut off
[1:07:33.420 --> 1:07:37.060]  and cut off our freedoms, they just don't get it, folks.
[1:07:37.060 --> 1:07:39.620]  They don't get it.
[1:07:39.620 --> 1:07:45.060]  Most people that live in this country have one or two things in their background and
[1:07:45.060 --> 1:07:51.180]  that is a struggle to get to this country and earn their freedom through the means of
[1:07:51.180 --> 1:08:02.260]  immigration or the struggle of wars and fighting and bloodshed to earn their freedom.
[1:08:02.260 --> 1:08:09.180]  So when you earn that freedom, it means something to you, something really deep in your soul.
[1:08:09.180 --> 1:08:10.180]  It's in your blood.
[1:08:10.180 --> 1:08:11.180]  It's in your makeup.
[1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:12.180]  It's in your consciousness.
[1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:15.340]  Your blood goes away, it can't be put out.
[1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:17.580]  It's an infinite flame.
[1:08:17.580 --> 1:08:21.380]  So when people that don't have that flame come here and shut off your free speech,
[1:08:21.380 --> 1:08:23.460]  they really don't get it.
[1:08:23.460 --> 1:08:25.540]  These two never got it.
[1:08:25.540 --> 1:08:31.780]  They never will get it and they never should have had it to begin with.
[1:08:31.780 --> 1:08:33.460]  So how does that make you feel?
[1:08:33.460 --> 1:08:38.660]  And this goes on at every other big tech company.
[1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:43.980]  So I'm sorry that these two don't have the desire to be free and the loyalty and commitment
[1:08:43.980 --> 1:08:49.060]  and understanding of what that means to the American people, but thank God Elon Musk does
[1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:52.020]  and thank God he took out the trash.
[1:08:52.020 --> 1:08:54.700]  Goodbye, freedom haters.
[1:08:54.700 --> 1:08:56.820]  Get out.
[1:08:56.820 --> 1:09:00.900]  But like good communists, don't worry, they got paid on the way out.
[1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:04.900]  These two are going to make approximately $200 million.
[1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:12.980]  Oh, and the left, oh, the left is against rich people, oh, the millionaires are so bad.
[1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:16.100]  And then all the people they look up to, all the people that are thought leaders, all the
[1:09:16.100 --> 1:09:20.940]  people that censor the opposition, they're all millionaires.
[1:09:20.940 --> 1:09:24.420]  Isn't that ironic?
[1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:30.820]  So yeah, sorry, you never supported free speech, sorry, you never got it, did you?
[1:09:30.820 --> 1:09:34.580]  You never got it, did you?
[1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:35.620]  Maybe you never will.
[1:09:35.620 --> 1:09:37.860]  I hope someday you will.
[1:09:37.860 --> 1:09:42.620]  I hope someday people will understand what you understand, what I understand, the value
[1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:46.740]  of the First and Second Amendment.
[1:09:46.740 --> 1:09:56.740]  But Vijaya Gide and Parag Agrawal never got it and sadly never will get it, but that's
[1:09:56.740 --> 1:10:05.140]  okay because you will never put out our flame of liberty, ever.
[1:10:05.140 --> 1:10:08.780]  You never will.
[1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:13.100]  You never will.
[1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:17.700]  So good riddance, don't let the door hit you on the way out with your hundreds of millions
[1:10:17.700 --> 1:10:19.980]  of dollars that you're making on the way out.
[1:10:19.980 --> 1:10:23.180]  Oh, I'm sure they'll give it all the charity too.
[1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:25.980]  Yeah, right.
[1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:30.940]  So they're panicked though, because Elon Musk is taking over and their anti-American
[1:10:30.940 --> 1:10:38.900]  censors are out, Wired Magazine, a Musk-owned Twitter could be disastrous for women in marginalized
[1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:39.900]  communities.
[1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:46.820]  Oh, there it is, yes, oh, disastrous for women in marginalized communities already facing
[1:10:46.820 --> 1:10:50.500]  abuse and targeted harassment on the platform.
[1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:53.180]  Oh, I got it.
[1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:59.060]  Hey, here's an idea, if you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.
[1:10:59.060 --> 1:11:02.100]  You ever heard that one before?
[1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:06.180]  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.
[1:11:06.180 --> 1:11:12.180]  Nobody's making you go on Twitter.
[1:11:12.180 --> 1:11:22.820]  Women in marginalized communities already facing abuse on Twitter, it's so hard for them.
[1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:25.620]  What are they even doing there then, if it's so bad?
[1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:28.180]  You want to know just how psychotic these people are though?
[1:11:28.180 --> 1:11:30.500]  I mean, do you really want to know?
[1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.820]  Folks, it's bad, trust me.
[1:11:32.820 --> 1:11:40.140]  I go into their minds, it is a place, it's empty, actually, it's empty, nothing but state
[1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:48.300]  propaganda bouncing around in there, no God, no soul, no light, just darkness and propaganda,
[1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:50.260]  like JoJo from Jurors.
[1:11:50.260 --> 1:11:54.220]  Now nobody actually follows this woman, but she's always on your news feeds.
[1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:57.900]  I don't think that's going to be continuing much longer, by the way.
[1:11:57.900 --> 1:12:02.100]  All the Democrat Party propaganda forced under your news feeds is going to be shut down
[1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:06.900]  pretty soon, and all of their synthetic interaction is going to be shut down pretty soon.
[1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:11.860]  So enjoy it while it lasts, guys, because it's not going to go on much longer.
[1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:18.100]  But here she is, this is a woman paid for by the Democrat Party and synthetically boosted
[1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:23.660]  on Twitter to get as much interaction as possible to make sure Democrat Party propaganda enters
[1:12:23.660 --> 1:12:27.940]  the mind and the stream of consciousness to the uninformed voter.
[1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:29.340]  Just you want to know how psycho they are?
[1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:30.780]  Here's an example.
[1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:36.460]  I joined this app, Twitter, in 2017, largely because I wanted to tell Donald Trump that
[1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:39.180]  he had old balls and stuff.
[1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:43.100]  Yeah, you're clearly not well in the head, lady.
[1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:46.620]  And while I really, really, really don't want to, I'll do it again if I have to.
[1:12:46.620 --> 1:12:48.380]  So of course, what's the story here?
[1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:49.780]  And I've got an example.
[1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:50.900]  Here's Robert Reich.
[1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:56.980]  Folks, look, Robert Reich is legitimately mentally retarded.
[1:12:56.980 --> 1:13:00.380]  And so, I mean, it's kind of like, oh, you're ableist.
[1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:07.140]  Well, no, I'm not going to sit here and take serious advice from a man who has an IQ of
[1:13:07.140 --> 1:13:08.900]  10.
[1:13:08.900 --> 1:13:10.940]  But see, oh, here's Robert Reich.
[1:13:10.940 --> 1:13:13.100]  Again, he promotes the Democrat Party propaganda.
[1:13:13.100 --> 1:13:14.100]  He does it for free, though.
[1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:16.100]  See, he's so dumb, he does it for free.
[1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:21.540]  This was him in July of 2021.
[1:13:21.540 --> 1:13:24.940]  Trump is suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google for violating his First Amendment rights by
[1:13:24.940 --> 1:13:26.980]  keeping him off their platforms.
[1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:30.060]  Someone should remind him that their private companies to which the First Amendment doesn't
[1:13:30.060 --> 1:13:31.060]  apply.
[1:13:31.060 --> 1:13:37.100]  Okay, so Robert Reich, Robert Third Reich, Robert Firth Reich says censorship is good.
[1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:38.620]  Censorship is perfectly good and legal.
[1:13:38.620 --> 1:13:39.780]  That was July of last year.
[1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:45.780]  Now, here he is yesterday, when multi-billionaires take control of our most vital platforms
[1:13:45.780 --> 1:13:46.780]  for communication.
[1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:48.340]  It's not a win for free speech.
[1:13:48.340 --> 1:13:49.340]  It's a win for oligarchy.
[1:13:49.340 --> 1:13:52.900]  Oh, I see Robert.
[1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:56.500]  I see Robert, you tiny small man.
[1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:57.500]  I see Robert.
[1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:02.860]  So, when the censorship works in your political beliefs favor, it's a good thing.
[1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:09.020]  When the censorship is no longer working in your political favor, it's a bad thing now.
[1:14:09.020 --> 1:14:10.820]  I see.
[1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:12.740]  I got you.
[1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:14.740]  Yeah.
[1:14:14.740 --> 1:14:18.000]  And by the way, Robert was one of the many out there who said he would leave Twitter
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.500]  if Musk took over.
[1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:21.620]  Yeah, right.
[1:14:21.620 --> 1:14:24.500]  So here's Robert Fourth Reich today.
[1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:28.580]  I thought I'd leave these here just in case, hypothetically, the new potential owner of
[1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:32.740]  Twitter decides to bar videos critiquing billionaires in the system that enables it.
[1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:36.460]  Oh, Robert Reich is against censorship now again yesterday.
[1:14:36.460 --> 1:14:42.380]  So Robert Fourth Reich was all about censorship when it was President Trump and his supporters
[1:14:42.380 --> 1:14:46.420]  now that his opposition is not going to be censored.
[1:14:46.420 --> 1:14:51.140]  All of a sudden, he's worried about censorship, which, by the way, nobody's going to be censoring
[1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:52.140]  the left.
[1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:53.140]  Nobody calls for censorship of the left.
[1:14:53.140 --> 1:14:55.700]  Elon Musk is going to censor the left.
[1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:57.860]  But all of these people were threatening to leave Twitter.
[1:14:57.860 --> 1:15:03.540]  Yes, all the paid for Democrat bot accounts like Brooklyn Defiant Dad and Jersey Joe and
[1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:04.540]  the rest of them.
[1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:05.540]  You've seen them in your news feeds.
[1:15:05.540 --> 1:15:06.540]  You don't follow them.
[1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:07.540]  They pop up in your news feeds every day.
[1:15:07.540 --> 1:15:12.660]  Democrat paid for party propaganda forced into your news feeds by the Twitter algorithms.
[1:15:12.660 --> 1:15:14.220]  I don't think it lasts much longer.
[1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:17.340]  They all said they would leave Twitter when Elon Musk took over.
[1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:21.460]  How many of them do you think will actually leave?
[1:15:21.460 --> 1:15:23.460]  Zero.
[1:15:23.460 --> 1:15:24.460]  That's how many.
[1:15:24.460 --> 1:15:25.460]  None.
[1:15:25.460 --> 1:15:26.460]  Zero.
[1:15:26.460 --> 1:15:27.460]  Zilch.
[1:15:27.460 --> 1:15:28.460]  Nada.
[1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:30.460]  And that's for two reasons.
[1:15:30.460 --> 1:15:34.620]  One, because they like it too much and they like all the synthetic attention they've
[1:15:34.620 --> 1:15:35.620]  been getting.
[1:15:35.620 --> 1:15:36.620]  It's a dopamine hit.
[1:15:36.620 --> 1:15:40.140]  For the first time in their lives, they feel like they have friends and that they're popular.
[1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:42.860]  Even though it's all fake, they'll have to learn the hard way.
[1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:47.260]  But two, it's the same reason why they never left America when Donald Trump got in office.
[1:15:47.260 --> 1:15:50.580]  They all said they'd leave America when Trump got in and then they didn't.
[1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:51.580]  Why?
[1:15:51.580 --> 1:15:53.700]  Because America is the best country on earth.
[1:15:53.700 --> 1:15:55.380]  And so, of course, you don't want to leave.
[1:15:55.380 --> 1:15:56.880]  You frauds.
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:16:03.460]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:16:03.460 --> 1:16:04.460]  you.
[1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:08.700]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence infowars because they rightly see
[1:16:08.700 --> 1:16:13.820]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:18.020]  the world, for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:24.140]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for infowars.com
[1:16:24.140 --> 1:16:28.380]  and to also financially support infowars.com for the most critical time on our fight by

[1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:08.100]  of the spear.
[1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:12.100]  And when we talk about the products at infowarsstore.com, they all blow you away.

[1:19:59.660 --> 1:20:05.540]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.540 --> 1:20:13.660]  You will always have conspiracy theories, they are nothing but distractions.
[1:20:13.660 --> 1:20:16.380]  We need a great reset.
[1:20:16.380 --> 1:20:21.700]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario.
[1:20:21.700 --> 1:20:25.940]  Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated.
[1:20:25.940 --> 1:20:29.140]  I don't have to sit here and tell you it's coming anymore and show you documents like
[1:20:29.140 --> 1:20:30.140]  I used to.
[1:20:30.140 --> 1:20:31.140]  You're just going to live it now.
[1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:47.860]  Is that a Dr. Fauci Halloween costume or a serial killer Halloween costume?
[1:20:47.860 --> 1:20:50.060]  I can't tell the difference.
[1:20:50.060 --> 1:20:52.460]  Trick question, there is none.
[1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:57.340]  Happy Halloween ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:57.340 --> 1:21:02.060]  Happy Halloween from all of us here at InfoWars to you.
[1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:06.420]  We hope you have a great weekend.
[1:21:06.420 --> 1:21:13.940]  By the way, I was wondering what the ripple effect would be to free speech being returned
[1:21:13.940 --> 1:21:18.940]  to Twitter and if that wouldn't maybe change the tide in the competitive business market
[1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:23.900]  of social media for other big tech companies to say, hey, you know what?
[1:21:23.900 --> 1:21:27.020]  We can't have Twitter be the only platform for free speech.
[1:21:27.020 --> 1:21:29.180]  Now we're losing out on revenue.
[1:21:29.180 --> 1:21:30.500]  We need free speech too.
[1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:35.020]  Well, not looking like that's how it's going to go here.
[1:21:35.020 --> 1:21:41.460]  YouTube announces it will certify medical information in cahoots with the World Health
[1:21:41.460 --> 1:21:42.460]  Organization.
[1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:43.460]  Nice.
[1:21:43.460 --> 1:21:50.060]  So the commies at the WHO who lie to you for a living are going to control the flow of
[1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:51.860]  information on YouTube.
[1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:52.860]  Nice.
[1:21:52.860 --> 1:21:53.860]  Nice.
[1:21:53.860 --> 1:21:55.540]  That's not fascist at all.
[1:21:55.540 --> 1:21:57.180]  That's not collusion.
[1:21:57.180 --> 1:22:01.260]  That's not big government.
[1:22:01.260 --> 1:22:03.100]  Amazing stuff.
[1:22:03.100 --> 1:22:04.100]  Amazing stuff.
[1:22:04.100 --> 1:22:13.380]  Of course, the big question is, will or when will Alex Jones be back on Twitter?
[1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:24.740]  And we may have some information on that coming up in the next hour with a special guest.
[1:22:24.740 --> 1:22:28.420]  I'm debating kind of breaking some stuff that I know about it, but I really don't even want
[1:22:28.420 --> 1:22:32.300]  to talk about it because it's the kind of thing where I just want to wait until the
[1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:36.540]  thing is complete to report on it.
[1:22:36.540 --> 1:22:39.300]  And the honest truth is right now, I don't know.
[1:22:39.300 --> 1:22:42.140]  I don't know if Alex Jones will ever be allowed back on Twitter.
[1:22:42.140 --> 1:22:45.180]  I don't know if Info Wars will ever be allowed back on Twitter.
[1:22:45.180 --> 1:22:49.420]  I don't know if I will ever be allowed back on Twitter.
[1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:54.700]  I know for myself, speaking for myself personally, of course, I would like to be back on Twitter
[1:22:54.700 --> 1:22:58.380]  and then for Info Wars.
[1:22:58.380 --> 1:23:00.740]  Of course, we would like to be able to be back on Twitter.
[1:23:00.740 --> 1:23:04.860]  Now people have tried to share our links on Twitter and you still can't.
[1:23:04.860 --> 1:23:07.820]  Our links are still banned from being shared.
[1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:11.540]  So we'll see how long that lasts.
[1:23:11.540 --> 1:23:12.540]  And then we'll see.
[1:23:12.540 --> 1:23:16.980]  I mean, I think the Alex Jones account when it got suspended had close to two million followers.
[1:23:16.980 --> 1:23:19.180]  So that's a big deal.
[1:23:19.180 --> 1:23:21.180]  That's a big deal.
[1:23:21.180 --> 1:23:24.220]  And we shall see.
[1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:32.020]  I know that Elon Musk, who I guess obviously talks to Kanye West, has reinstated Kanye's
[1:23:32.020 --> 1:23:34.020]  account.
[1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:39.900]  Elon Musk, who follows the Babylon Bee, has reinstated the Babylon Bee's account.
[1:23:39.900 --> 1:23:42.820]  So these are people that obviously have a direct communication with Elon.
[1:23:42.820 --> 1:23:44.740]  We don't.
[1:23:44.740 --> 1:23:50.140]  But I think a lot of people will go to bat for Alex Jones and we shall see if his account
[1:23:50.140 --> 1:23:51.140]  is restored.
[1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:56.260]  There have been so many accounts banned that the process, I'm sure, will take some time.
[1:23:56.260 --> 1:24:04.780]  Now, the globalists, they understand this, but the liberal left don't because they truly
[1:24:04.780 --> 1:24:06.540]  cannot even conceive.
[1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:12.940]  The concept of independence and self-sustainability to the left is not even in their head.
[1:24:12.940 --> 1:24:14.540]  They can't even conceive it.
[1:24:14.540 --> 1:24:19.300]  They can't even perceive it in their heads because they've been suckling off the memories
[1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:22.500]  of the state and their daddies their entire lives.
[1:24:22.500 --> 1:24:26.700]  So they thought when they banned info wars on social media and big tech, they thought
[1:24:26.700 --> 1:24:28.500]  that would be it.
[1:24:28.500 --> 1:24:30.060]  They didn't understand that we were independent.
[1:24:30.060 --> 1:24:32.500]  They didn't understand that we were truly grassroots.
[1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:34.060]  And it was our audience that supported us.
[1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:37.260]  And so as long as we had our audience, we would still be on air.
[1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:41.340]  So then they went next level and engaged in the law fair to try to take us off there.
[1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:42.820]  They're still in the process of that.
[1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:46.460]  You see those precedents set and then applied towards other individuals, whether it's Internet
[1:24:46.460 --> 1:24:52.820]  censorship or not a law fair, but we have been able to stay on air thanks to your undying
[1:24:52.820 --> 1:24:57.980]  support at infowarstore.com, you telling your friends and family about the transmission,
[1:24:57.980 --> 1:25:02.060]  getting people to tune in, spreading the links where you can spread them and of course shopping
[1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:03.060]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:25:03.060 --> 1:25:11.380]  Now, Alex is set to be back in town this evening and he's going to be up here tomorrow doing
[1:25:11.380 --> 1:25:18.220]  some special reports, but also cutting new sales at infowarstore.com.

[1:25:53.220 --> 1:25:55.740]  I'm running out of air telling you about all these sales.

[1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:21.340]  can be applied towards future purchases at infowarstore.com.
[1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:26.100]  All right, let me hit a couple of other stories here before the break.
[1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:31.100]  This is from Science Photo Library.
[1:26:31.100 --> 1:26:36.300]  And so the Science Photo Library has photos of babies in the womb, right?
[1:26:36.300 --> 1:26:37.660]  Babies in the womb.
[1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:41.460]  And so they have all the photos of babies in the womb because that's what they are.
[1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:45.100]  They're babies and they're in the womb and you can see their bodies and arms and fingers
[1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:48.780]  and phalanges and the heart beating and everything.
[1:26:48.780 --> 1:26:51.460]  And so they lied to you and they say that's not a baby, it is a baby.
[1:26:51.460 --> 1:26:57.220]  But on Science Photo Library where you can go look at the photos of babies in the womb,
[1:26:57.220 --> 1:26:59.980]  very amazing images, very powerful stuff.
[1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.860]  They have a little disclaimer here.
[1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:03.860]  So here you go.
[1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:08.100]  Okay, babies in the womb, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, you can go look at it, Science Photo Library.
[1:27:08.100 --> 1:27:09.660]  And they have a little disclaimer here.
[1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:11.700]  Look at this.
[1:27:11.700 --> 1:27:15.500]  Not for use by pro-life or similar organizations.
[1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:16.500]  This is real.
[1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:20.100]  Folks, this is real.
[1:27:20.100 --> 1:27:25.560]  Science Photo Library, not for use by pro-life or similar organizations.
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.780]  So am I not allowed to use this right now on air?
[1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:34.620]  Am I going to get sued by Science Photo Library for pointing out that you have photos of babies
[1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:36.740]  before they're born?
[1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:41.500]  And because I'm pro-life, I'm not allowed to look at this or share this?
[1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:42.500]  Wow.
[1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:44.700]  Now, why would that be the case?
[1:27:44.700 --> 1:27:48.540]  It's sad, I guess, Science Photo Library is pro-abortion.
[1:27:48.540 --> 1:27:49.540]  They're in the death cult.
[1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:50.540]  They like killing babies.
[1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:52.740]  They like chopping up babies for body parts and selling them.
[1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:56.700]  I guess Science Photo Library is into that.
[1:27:56.700 --> 1:27:59.860]  But here's the true story here.
[1:27:59.860 --> 1:28:03.660]  It just shows that they know what they're doing is baby murder, folks.
[1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:05.180]  They know it.
[1:28:05.180 --> 1:28:13.100]  Why would they put this as a disclaimer in their baby in the womb Science Photo Library?
[1:28:13.100 --> 1:28:16.900]  Why would they put not for use by pro-life or similar organizations?
[1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:22.740]  Because they know it's a baby in that womb and abortion is murder.
[1:28:22.740 --> 1:28:27.220]  And so they have to put this disclaimer out because they know that's the case and they
[1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:30.540]  have all the evidence right there in their own Photo Library.
[1:28:30.540 --> 1:28:31.540]  Incredible.
[1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:33.660]  But Planned Parenthood is absolutely disgusting, folks.
[1:28:33.660 --> 1:28:34.660]  This is a new one.
[1:28:34.660 --> 1:28:39.060]  A woman in New York took abortion pills as directed by Planned Parenthood and then gave
[1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:42.860]  birth in the bathroom to a fully formed, stillborn baby boy.
[1:28:42.860 --> 1:28:46.460]  The expert estimate was 33 to 36 weeks old.
[1:28:46.460 --> 1:28:49.220]  Planned Parenthood is being sued for its unthinkable negligence.
[1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:53.700]  Yeah, well, Planned Parenthood has killed millions of babies and they get government
[1:28:53.700 --> 1:28:54.700]  money to do it.
[1:28:54.700 --> 1:28:55.700]  It's sick.
[1:28:55.700 --> 1:28:56.700]  It's our bestseller.
[1:28:56.700 --> 1:29:04.660]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:09.340]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it feel and
[1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:13.140]  how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:16.580]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[1:29:16.580 --> 1:29:22.020]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[1:29:22.020 --> 1:29:23.020]  function of the body.
[1:29:23.020 --> 1:29:27.820]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:30.380]  need to live and be healthy.
[1:29:30.380 --> 1:29:32.660]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[1:29:32.660 --> 1:29:34.420]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:29:34.420 --> 1:29:39.500]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.500]  with a product like this.
[1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:44.180]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[1:29:44.180 --> 1:29:47.700]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the infowar.
[1:29:47.700 --> 1:29:51.860]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:55.780]  back in stock at infowarstore.com for a 50% off.
[1:29:55.780 --> 1:29:58.620]  Vitamin Refusion back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[1:29:58.620 --> 1:30:04.780]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[1:30:04.780 --> 1:30:10.460]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:14.100]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:17.620]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:30:17.620 --> 1:30:18.620]  It's came over.
[1:30:18.620 --> 1:30:23.620]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:30:23.620 --> 1:30:28.820]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:30:28.820 --> 1:30:34.180]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswords.com,
[1:30:34.180 --> 1:30:35.180]  it changes the world.
[1:30:35.180 --> 1:30:40.060]  And that's why when you go to infowarstore.com and get amazing products that empower you
[1:30:40.060 --> 1:30:44.740]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[1:30:44.740 --> 1:30:47.300]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[1:30:47.300 --> 1:30:53.500]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarsstore.com.
[1:30:53.500 --> 1:30:58.740]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:30:58.740 --> 1:31:01.860]  Look it's not hype that infowars has changed the world.
[1:31:01.860 --> 1:31:06.420]  It's not hype that your support of infowars is the reason we were able to do this.
[1:31:06.420 --> 1:31:08.100]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:31:08.100 --> 1:31:12.060]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[1:31:12.060 --> 1:31:15.460]  Well high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:19.020]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves, it doesn't just
[1:31:19.020 --> 1:31:22.380]  give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the
[1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:27.460]  bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[1:31:27.460 --> 1:31:31.940]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average, take a
[1:31:31.940 --> 1:31:36.020]  few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:37.380]  Plus it funds the infowar.
[1:31:37.380 --> 1:31:41.740]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?
[1:31:41.740 --> 1:31:49.180]  Experience X3, finally back in stock at infowarsstore.com right now for 50% off.

[1:31:58.860 --> 1:32:01.220]  by the will of God.

[1:32:06.460 --> 1:32:10.780]  attacks never before seen in the western world against independent media.
[1:32:10.780 --> 1:32:11.780]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:32:11.780 --> 1:32:16.580]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times
[1:32:16.580 --> 1:32:19.980]  and kept infowars and free speech on the air and I thank you.
[1:32:19.980 --> 1:32:24.380]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and
[1:32:24.380 --> 1:32:25.380]  I need your support.
[1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:30.100]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight
[1:32:30.100 --> 1:32:35.100]  against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com.

[1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:42.500]  fund.
[1:32:42.500 --> 1:32:46.660]  This whole phase of their attacks, foyers in the making is almost over.
[1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:50.860]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[1:32:50.860 --> 1:32:54.500]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[1:32:54.500 --> 1:32:59.540]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:05.380]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:51.660]  And before, I'd rather other people break this news, so I'm not going to break it right
[1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:52.660]  now.
[1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:53.660]  It's already out there.
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:59.860]  So let me just pump the brakes on that and kind of give the backdrop.
[1:33:59.860 --> 1:34:04.180]  And then we'll see if we want to break it on this show or let others break it.
[1:34:04.180 --> 1:34:09.220]  It's already out there, but when I say break it, meaning if there's a story floating around
[1:34:09.220 --> 1:34:12.580]  out there and then we report on it, it gets broken wide open.
[1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:16.620]  It doesn't mean we're the original source, it's just that's how it goes.
[1:34:16.620 --> 1:34:20.180]  So I really don't want to break this right now, but let me just put it like this.
[1:34:20.180 --> 1:34:27.340]  In regards to the Pelosi home invasion, I think there are a lot of obvious questions.
[1:34:27.340 --> 1:34:31.060]  Now if you take it at face value, then okay, fine, we condemn political violence against
[1:34:31.060 --> 1:34:33.380]  Nancy Pelosi.
[1:34:33.380 --> 1:34:35.420]  But there's obviously questions lingering.
[1:34:35.420 --> 1:34:38.980]  How does one get into the home, the multiple levels of security, the security cameras,
[1:34:38.980 --> 1:34:39.980]  all of it?
[1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:40.980]  How can this be?
[1:34:40.980 --> 1:34:43.740]  And then the ridiculous narrative that he's running around the house, where's Nancy?
[1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:44.740]  Where's Nancy?
[1:34:44.740 --> 1:34:45.740]  I'm here for Nancy.
[1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:49.980]  And then they're saying he tied up Paul Pelosi begging for Nancy Pelosi to come home.
[1:34:49.980 --> 1:34:58.380]  So okay, but that is almost to the same level of on January 6, Nancy Pelosi having documentary
[1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:01.940]  film crews following her around that day.
[1:35:01.940 --> 1:35:04.380]  So oh, it was so dangerous.
[1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:06.780]  She didn't send the documentary film crew home.
[1:35:06.780 --> 1:35:07.780]  It was so dangerous.
[1:35:07.780 --> 1:35:08.780]  No.
[1:35:08.780 --> 1:35:13.180]  And it was such an important day for her that she somehow knew to hire a documentary film
[1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:16.540]  crew so it could be used later in a legal case.
[1:35:16.540 --> 1:35:18.140]  Isn't that an incredible coincidence?
[1:35:18.140 --> 1:35:20.940]  Well, could there be something similar going on?
[1:35:20.940 --> 1:35:22.420]  I mean, that's how ridiculous it would be.
[1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:27.100]  It'd be like if there was a documentary film crew in Nancy Pelosi's house filming Paul
[1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:30.820]  Pelosi getting tied up and beaten with a hammer.
[1:35:30.820 --> 1:35:34.820]  I mean, that might be how ridiculous this thing gets, folks, but I'm going to hold off
[1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:37.580]  on taking that story next level.
[1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:40.460]  I really don't want to break it here.
[1:35:40.460 --> 1:35:48.460]  But let's just say the questions may be getting answered.
[1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:51.060]  And again, you might say, well, this is so ridiculous.
[1:35:51.060 --> 1:35:56.940]  The Democrats wouldn't false flag themselves to this extent with 11 days left to the midterms.
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:35:57.940]  Really?
[1:35:57.940 --> 1:35:58.940]  They wouldn't.
[1:35:58.940 --> 1:36:02.820]  Did you see Nancy Pelosi's documentary film crew following her around on January 6 and
[1:36:02.820 --> 1:36:07.500]  they released the footage right ahead of the midterm elections during the January 6 hearings?
[1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:10.620]  You really don't think that's what would be going on?
[1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:17.620]  Yeah, I think they might just be that desperate and they might be acting in that much desperation.
[1:36:17.620 --> 1:36:21.140]  And you know, this is how God works and this is how demons work.
[1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:24.540]  Demons cannot help but overexpose themselves eventually.
[1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:30.460]  Now let me get back to this January 6 news that I think is extremely important here and
[1:36:30.460 --> 1:36:34.940]  I'm going to revisit this later.
[1:36:34.940 --> 1:36:37.980]  Ali Alexander wrote this for the Gateway Pundit, he joins me in the next hour.
[1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:42.860]  Pelosi cover up, now we know why Democrats lied about Trump's National Guard offer.
[1:36:42.860 --> 1:36:48.380]  Now this is an incredible development that is an ongoing development here where all the
[1:36:48.380 --> 1:36:50.260]  receipts are available, folks.
[1:36:50.260 --> 1:36:52.940]  So you don't need to worry about hearsay here.
[1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:58.500]  The receipts are available, the phone calls, all of it, where Donald Trump and the White
[1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:06.380]  House were asking for added security from the DC police in the mayor's office and from
[1:37:06.380 --> 1:37:08.580]  the National Guard with Nancy Pelosi.
[1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:11.300]  It's on record.
[1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:15.900]  There are proof of receipts there.
[1:37:15.900 --> 1:37:21.460]  So when the Democrats come out and say Trump stood down the National Guard, Trump stood
[1:37:21.460 --> 1:37:27.460]  down the police, he wanted there to be activities that day, it's a blatant lie provable with
[1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:30.500]  hardcore evidence that we already have access to.
[1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:33.740]  So why are they continuing to push that lie?
[1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:36.220]  We're going to get into that later with Ali Alexander.
[1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:43.180]  Now here's the real big story that I see in regards to January 6 that most people are
[1:37:43.180 --> 1:37:45.180]  missing.
[1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:47.700]  This is from Politico, of course.
[1:37:47.700 --> 1:37:52.700]  January 6, Ryder gets probation, not prison after Judge Fiennes' autism played a role.
[1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:56.500]  Now let me try to encapsulate this for you.
[1:37:56.500 --> 1:38:03.700]  So one of the individuals, you've probably seen him in images next to the QAnon Shaman,
[1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:07.740]  and he's got kind of longer hair, and he was in the building that day, he was walking
[1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:14.540]  around next to the QAnon Shaman, and his name is Nicholas Rodian.
[1:38:14.540 --> 1:38:19.260]  And so Judge Trevor McFadden has said that Asperger's or autism, or he's somewhere on
[1:38:19.260 --> 1:38:26.020]  the spectrum there, caused him to be more susceptible into falling into this trap, and
[1:38:26.020 --> 1:38:30.940]  therefore he shouldn't get prison time, and instead get five years of probation, and his
[1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:34.140]  family was there arguing on his behalf, if you will.
[1:38:34.140 --> 1:38:36.220]  He just started a dog walking service.
[1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:41.460]  It actually seems like a really wholesome guy, a really nice guy, perhaps has autism
[1:38:41.460 --> 1:38:43.700]  or Asperger's, but works on his own.
[1:38:43.700 --> 1:38:47.420]  Probably we all know somebody like that in life, some of the nicest people we ever meet,
[1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:51.820]  but very naive, very susceptible, very trusting.
[1:38:51.820 --> 1:38:58.900]  And so this particular individual was talking about how he was getting secret information
[1:38:58.900 --> 1:39:06.780]  and documents directly from QAnon, who was giving him directives to share it and to take
[1:39:06.780 --> 1:39:11.300]  action upon it, like getting on his YouTube channel and talking about it.
[1:39:11.300 --> 1:39:15.460]  Now most people are unaware of this, because I'd never seen his YouTube channel, you'd
[1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:20.620]  never seen his YouTube channel, you've just seen the pictures of him walking around next
[1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:24.060]  to QAnon Shaman that day.
[1:39:24.060 --> 1:39:28.960]  So folks, are you starting to get the picture here?
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:41.820]  So an individual with autism is getting secret documents and information from QAnon or government
[1:39:41.820 --> 1:39:47.420]  sources or military sources, and then he goes out on January 6th and goes in the building
[1:39:47.420 --> 1:39:50.780]  thinking he's on a mission from QAnon.
[1:39:50.780 --> 1:39:55.220]  Are you starting to see where I'm going with this yet?
[1:39:55.220 --> 1:40:01.820]  Well let's recall what happened in the fake plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer.
[1:40:01.820 --> 1:40:03.980]  What did the FBI do?
[1:40:03.980 --> 1:40:11.140]  They targeted single, lonely men who might be on some sort of autism, mental illness
[1:40:11.140 --> 1:40:20.380]  spectrum, who are susceptible and naive and communicated with them via the internet and
[1:40:20.380 --> 1:40:31.260]  text and convinced them and swayed them into joining what they later would find out, FBI
[1:40:31.260 --> 1:40:35.260]  agents in a plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer.
[1:40:35.260 --> 1:40:40.200]  So this is what the FBI has been caught doing numerous times now.
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:44.900]  They set up a plot, will use the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer, FBI agents set up a plot
[1:40:44.900 --> 1:40:49.300]  to kidnap Governor Whitmer as a trap and entrapment operation.
[1:40:49.300 --> 1:40:57.500]  They then go out and find individuals, men particularly, that are easily susceptible to
[1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:05.100]  propaganda, specifically ones that might have a mental illness or autism, and then they
[1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:12.220]  entrap them in these crimes to say CX Group is violent and terroristic because they wanted
[1:41:12.220 --> 1:41:14.700]  to kidnap the governor of Michigan.
[1:41:14.700 --> 1:41:17.580]  And of course the feds did it the whole time.
[1:41:17.580 --> 1:41:23.460]  The feds entrapped innocent men so that they could have a political stunt to say that Trump
[1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:27.180]  supporters are violent, C, they tried to kidnap Governor Whitmer when it was the FBI the entire
[1:41:27.180 --> 1:41:29.060]  time.
[1:41:29.060 --> 1:41:37.820]  And so that all comes out, folks, this case of Nicholas Rodin I think is now the skeleton
[1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:40.180]  key.
[1:41:40.180 --> 1:41:49.100]  If it's not Ray Epps, if it's not the pipe bomber, it's Nicholas Rodin.
[1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:54.300]  Based off what I can tell from this story, it sounds like Nicholas Rodin was contacted
[1:41:54.300 --> 1:42:00.300]  by feds posing as QAnon, convincing him what they were doing was real, convincing him to
[1:42:00.300 --> 1:42:07.580]  be a part of this movement much like the QAnon, Shaman, and other similar people getting communicated
[1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:12.660]  with feds telling them this was all going on, they're getting top secret classified information,
[1:42:12.660 --> 1:42:16.540]  they've been selected for this special mission just like the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:20.660]  and then they end up in court, they end up going to jail and the narrative ends up getting
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:24.740]  spun that they were terrorist the whole time when they were entrapped by the FBI.
[1:42:24.740 --> 1:42:28.340]  Folks, this is not a minor story.
[1:42:28.340 --> 1:42:33.740]  To me this is now the third loose thread hanging from the sweater on the January 6th narrative.
[1:42:33.740 --> 1:42:38.980]  So you now have Ray Epps, the pipe bomber who there's about to be massive news breaking
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:43.740]  from Darren Beatty in the next couple of days, by the way, keep your eyes peeled for that.
[1:42:43.740 --> 1:42:48.980]  And now Nicholas Rodin, but I've noticed not many people have picked up on this yet.
[1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:53.460]  So now though, I'm covering it and I'm going to contact some of the other people covering
[1:42:53.460 --> 1:42:57.140]  this and we're going to look more into this because I think we've got another loose thread
[1:42:57.140 --> 1:42:58.140]  here.
[1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:04.540]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:09.860]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[1:43:09.860 --> 1:43:13.720]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:14.720]  to speak freely.
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:17.980]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[1:43:17.980 --> 1:43:18.980]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:43:18.980 --> 1:43:23.540]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[1:43:23.540 --> 1:43:24.540]  all of this.
[1:43:24.540 --> 1:43:27.860]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[1:43:27.860 --> 1:43:28.860]  your support.
[1:43:28.860 --> 1:43:32.660]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:36.460]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[1:43:36.460 --> 1:43:40.420]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been because
[1:43:40.420 --> 1:43:41.420]  of your past support.
[1:43:41.420 --> 1:43:45.580]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[1:43:45.580 --> 1:43:50.340]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on
[1:43:50.340 --> 1:43:51.340]  air.

[1:43:56.500 --> 1:43:57.500]  your support.
[1:43:57.500 --> 1:44:04.580]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:10.580]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:11.580]  world.
[1:44:11.580 --> 1:44:16.620]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:17.620]  deserve the credit.
[1:44:17.620 --> 1:44:22.580]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real
[1:44:22.580 --> 1:44:25.140]  reason you've had the success.
[1:44:25.140 --> 1:44:29.580]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
[1:44:29.580 --> 1:44:30.580]  had.
[1:44:30.580 --> 1:44:34.580]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:44:34.580 --> 1:44:39.140]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been
[1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:43.340]  in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify
[1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:44.340]  them.
[1:44:44.340 --> 1:44:45.340]  God bless you all.
[1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:46.340]  I salute you.
[1:44:46.340 --> 1:44:47.340]  I thank you.
[1:44:47.340 --> 1:44:52.140]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and this
[1:44:52.140 --> 1:44:53.140]  victory is happening.
[1:44:53.140 --> 1:44:54.940]  The fight is my fight.
[1:44:54.940 --> 1:44:55.940]  It's your fight.
[1:44:55.940 --> 1:44:56.940]  It's our fight.
[1:44:56.940 --> 1:44:58.660]  God bless you all.
[1:44:58.660 --> 1:45:03.460]  Think about a world without Infowars.
[1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:07.780]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[1:45:07.780 --> 1:45:13.060]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is Infowars.
[1:45:13.060 --> 1:45:18.380]  Think about how Infowars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other
[1:45:18.380 --> 1:45:25.940]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[1:45:25.940 --> 1:45:29.180]  base to defeat the new world order.
[1:45:29.180 --> 1:45:34.940]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:39.420]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:45:39.420 --> 1:45:41.140]  I don't take the credit.
[1:45:41.140 --> 1:45:42.980]  I give you the credit.
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:47.380]  And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours and isn't going to give up.
[1:45:47.380 --> 1:45:49.140]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[1:47:05.980 --> 1:47:23.700]  Alright, I was hesitant to get into this in the last segment, but I'll go ahead and break
[1:47:23.700 --> 1:47:31.540]  into this now, but folks here's the thing, the constellation on this story is expansive
[1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:39.180]  and it's not concentrated here, so I'm kind of having to bounce around here to connect
[1:47:39.180 --> 1:47:45.300]  the dots, but it's all connected, January 6th, Pelosi standing down security, the lies
[1:47:45.300 --> 1:47:55.500]  about that and yes, the home invasion at Pelosi's house now, but it is now known, the suspect
[1:47:55.500 --> 1:48:03.620]  is now known, by the way, why is Nancy Pelosi's son-in-law Michael Voss pictured next to the
[1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:13.620]  QAnon Shaman on January 6th, why is that, is that what I have in my hand here, well,
[1:48:13.620 --> 1:48:20.180]  so Pelosi has a film crew out there, her son-in-law is out there, but you know, nothing to see
[1:48:20.180 --> 1:48:25.100]  here and then the big Nicholas Rodin story where he's talking about, he's getting secret
[1:48:25.100 --> 1:48:29.820]  information from QAnon and government sources and then he's confused in the court trial
[1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:35.300]  and he says, well, I don't understand, I watched riots in America for the entire 2020 year
[1:48:35.300 --> 1:48:39.500]  and then I saw January 6th and I didn't think it was a big deal, we watched cities burn,
[1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:45.140]  this all came out in that court case, but okay, we now officially know, it's now official
[1:48:45.140 --> 1:48:50.620]  news, it's been published, we now know the suspect of the Pelosi home invasion, so but
[1:48:50.620 --> 1:48:58.660]  ask yourself this, before I reveal the individual here, ask yourself this, why have you not
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:06.060]  seen a name or an image of the home invasion suspect yet today, why?
[1:49:06.060 --> 1:49:10.940]  You know why don't you, because it wasn't a Trump supporter, it wasn't a conservative,
[1:49:10.940 --> 1:49:15.260]  if it was, they would have already blasted the individual, it wasn't, now we know who
[1:49:15.260 --> 1:49:26.100]  it was, David DePappe, Paul Pelosi suspect, five facts you need to know from heavy.com,
[1:49:26.100 --> 1:49:32.980]  let's see what we have here, David DePappe is a former Fidel Castro nudist protester
[1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:38.420]  and hemp jewelry maker who has children with a well-known pro-nudity activist, in other
[1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:44.740]  words, he's a leftist activist.
[1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:49.740]  Berkeley, California, David DePappe wrote a blog called Welcome to Big Brother's Centorship
[1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:58.460]  Hell, oh, interesting, David DePappe entered the Pelosi home through a sliding glass door
[1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:02.620]  looking for Pelosi, reports say, how did he get in, I mean again, I'm not gonna sit here
[1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:07.300]  and act like the Pelosi's can't make mistakes or security systems don't have errors, but
[1:50:07.300 --> 1:50:11.780]  I mean seriously, that is amazing that he was able to get into the home, that's the real
[1:50:11.780 --> 1:50:18.260]  question, how does he get into the house, he must have known where he was going, Paul
[1:50:18.260 --> 1:50:25.900]  Pelosi was taken to the hospital, Pelosi's of course worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:50:25.900 --> 1:50:31.180]  and I believe it's also going to come out, I don't see it in this story, but I believe
[1:50:31.180 --> 1:50:40.460]  it will also come out that this individual DePappe has been involved in other protests,
[1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:49.940]  specifically protests at Pelosi's house where they put a dead pig head out on her lawn.
[1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:54.620]  So this is a leftist protester from Berkeley, California who did it.
[1:50:54.620 --> 1:50:58.900]  So they're gonna try to bury this story as fast as they made a big fuss about it because
[1:50:58.900 --> 1:51:00.100]  it is not a Trump supporter.
[1:51:00.100 --> 1:51:05.340]  Now you can go on to, I don't know about the TV, definitely with the internet, the TV
[1:51:05.340 --> 1:51:10.860]  liberal propagandists are a little smarter than your average liberal propagandists on
[1:51:10.860 --> 1:51:15.780]  Twitter, meaning when they find out the truth about a story, which they will, they will
[1:51:15.780 --> 1:51:21.060]  bury it, whereas the morons on Twitter who live with their heads up their rear ends,
[1:51:21.060 --> 1:51:24.540]  they don't know the truth if it's backed them right in the face, so they're gonna continue
[1:51:24.540 --> 1:51:29.260]  to promote the false narrative that it was a Trump supporting conservative that broke
[1:51:29.260 --> 1:51:30.260]  into Pelosi's house.
[1:51:30.260 --> 1:51:35.180]  In fact, you could probably go on to Twitter right now, find all the same Democrat propaganda
[1:51:35.180 --> 1:51:39.260]  accounts still saying that this was a conservative Trump supporter that went to the Pelosi house
[1:51:39.260 --> 1:51:41.980]  even though we now know the suspect and know it wasn't.
[1:51:41.980 --> 1:51:43.980]  They will still promote that lie.
[1:51:43.980 --> 1:51:46.140]  That's what they do.
[1:51:46.140 --> 1:51:49.720]  So Moore is gonna develop on this, but now we know the question.
[1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:52.900]  Why didn't we get the identity of this individual sooner?
[1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:57.260]  Why didn't we see images and information about the home invader sooner?
[1:51:57.260 --> 1:51:59.900]  Because he wasn't a conservative Trump supporter.
[1:51:59.900 --> 1:52:00.900]  That's why.
[1:52:00.900 --> 1:52:07.540]  And you know, and now you know, the only thing that was missing was a documentary film crew
[1:52:07.540 --> 1:52:13.980]  there to catch the whole thing that Nancy Pelosi hired just like on January 6th.
[1:52:13.980 --> 1:52:15.220]  Yep.
[1:52:15.220 --> 1:52:18.900]  And so here it is, see the crew's already pulled it up.
[1:52:18.900 --> 1:52:24.060]  You log right into Twitter right now and you will find Democrat Party propaganda accounts
[1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:27.300]  still blaming Trump and Trump supporters.
[1:52:27.300 --> 1:52:28.300]  Here's one right here.
[1:52:28.300 --> 1:52:29.900]  This was just tweeted a minute ago.
[1:52:29.900 --> 1:52:33.060]  Folks, the heavy story came out about 30 minutes ago.
[1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:38.420]  So the identity has been known for at least an hour to anybody who's looked into it.
[1:52:38.420 --> 1:52:42.700]  I just a listener of the show sent this information to me and that's why when I first got it,
[1:52:42.700 --> 1:52:45.540]  I was like, hey, I'm gonna wait and do a little verification here, but okay, we've
[1:52:45.540 --> 1:52:47.660]  got the verification now.
[1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:53.380]  So they're still tweeting out at this moment, liberal Democrats are still tweeting out blaming
[1:52:53.380 --> 1:52:58.660]  Donald Trump and Republicans for the Pelosi home invasion, even though we now have the
[1:52:58.660 --> 1:53:05.660]  suspect and know who he is and he's a leftist.
[1:53:05.660 --> 1:53:07.380]  They're sick.
[1:53:07.380 --> 1:53:16.420]  They are sick, sick people, but of course they are because they write stories like this
[1:53:16.420 --> 1:53:17.420]  in Newsweek.
[1:53:17.420 --> 1:53:19.980]  Yeah, I mean, you guys can pull these up all day long if you want.
[1:53:19.980 --> 1:53:24.140]  These are all tweets within the last five minutes.
[1:53:24.140 --> 1:53:27.820]  We've known the identity of the suspect for at least an hour.
[1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:32.260]  Same news now has published the identity of the suspect for at least the last half hour
[1:53:32.260 --> 1:53:37.860]  and liberals on Twitter are still tweeting out in this very moment, in this minute that
[1:53:37.860 --> 1:53:42.620]  it was Trump and Trump supporters that did this.
[1:53:42.620 --> 1:53:46.580]  And they won't even know that the information is already out there and that they're wrong.
[1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:49.820]  So I mean, the crew can pull these up as long as they'd like when I'm covering this
[1:53:49.820 --> 1:53:54.020]  other news here, because I think it's important to show that reality doesn't matter to these
[1:53:54.020 --> 1:53:55.220]  people.
[1:53:55.220 --> 1:53:57.220]  Truth doesn't matter to these people.
[1:53:57.220 --> 1:54:01.740]  It's the political propaganda and the political agenda first and everything until last.
[1:54:01.740 --> 1:54:02.740]  That's it.
[1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:03.740]  That's all they have.
[1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:04.740]  It's their religion.
[1:54:04.740 --> 1:54:08.300]  Here's an example from Newsweek.
[1:54:08.300 --> 1:54:09.700]  Fact check.
[1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:13.020]  Ted Cruz has claimed that Antifa burnt U.S. cities for a year.
[1:54:13.020 --> 1:54:17.020]  So remember, Ted Cruz goes on the view, says, how are you going to talk about January 6th
[1:54:17.020 --> 1:54:20.780]  and not talk about the BLM Antifa riots from the summer of 2020?
[1:54:20.780 --> 1:54:26.140]  And they say, that didn't even happen, but this is even crazier on Newsweek.
[1:54:26.140 --> 1:54:27.140]  Fact check.
[1:54:27.140 --> 1:54:29.940]  Ted Cruz claim that Antifa burnt U.S. cities for a year.
[1:54:29.940 --> 1:54:32.300]  Now, I'll do this here.
[1:54:32.300 --> 1:54:33.300]  You can doc him this.
[1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:34.300]  So, okay.
[1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:38.300]  Oh, I have the Newsweek story right in front of me, okay?
[1:54:38.300 --> 1:54:39.300]  So let's find out.
[1:54:39.300 --> 1:54:40.300]  Fact check.
[1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:41.300]  Is it true?
[1:54:41.300 --> 1:54:44.420]  Ted Cruz's claim that Antifa burnt U.S. cities for a year.
[1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:48.500]  Now Newsweek has to do a fact check on this, as if we don't know the answer.
[1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:52.660]  Now get this, right out of the gates in their own story.
[1:54:52.660 --> 1:54:59.380]  They have images of Antifa and BLM burning cities to the ground in the year 2020.
[1:54:59.380 --> 1:55:03.100]  It's in the story, literally the images of it.
[1:55:03.100 --> 1:55:05.100]  And they say they're doing a fact check.
[1:55:05.100 --> 1:55:07.260]  So I can scroll through, I can flip through the story.
[1:55:07.260 --> 1:55:10.540]  Oh, picture of leftist burning cities in the summer of 2020.
[1:55:10.540 --> 1:55:11.540]  Okay, okay.
[1:55:11.540 --> 1:55:12.540]  Fact checking, Ted Cruz.
[1:55:12.540 --> 1:55:14.700]  Oh, here's pictures of Democrats burning cities.
[1:55:14.700 --> 1:55:15.700]  Fact check.
[1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:16.700]  And then what does it say?
[1:55:16.700 --> 1:55:17.700]  False.
[1:55:17.700 --> 1:55:18.700]  It says false.
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:19.700]  Look at this.
[1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:24.700]  It says false.
[1:55:24.700 --> 1:55:28.740]  Oh, unbelievable.
[1:55:28.740 --> 1:55:33.340]  So they show you the pictures and the images of liberal Democrats burning cities to the
[1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:40.860]  ground in the summer of 2020 in the very story where they claim Ted Cruz is saying that liberal
[1:55:40.860 --> 1:55:43.140]  Democrats burned cities to the ground and that's false.
[1:55:43.140 --> 1:55:48.220]  And then they show you the images of the actual facts and evidence and then they still say
[1:55:48.220 --> 1:55:50.500]  it's false.
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:51.500]  Incredible.
[1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:58.900]  Newsweek, fact checks, Ted Cruz did BLM and Antifa burn cities in the United States in
[1:55:58.900 --> 1:56:05.220]  the year of 2020 and they show the images in the story of liberals doing just that and
[1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:10.540]  they still say Ted Cruz is false after showing you the evidence that it's true.
[1:56:10.540 --> 1:56:14.420]  Can it get any crazier than that?
[1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:22.020]  Well, perhaps if you're one of the victims of these deranged fascists and authoritarians
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:29.340]  like Paul Manafort, Andrew Weisman placed Paul Manafort in solitary confinement for
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:33.580]  11 months in effort to get him to lie about Donald Trump.
[1:56:33.580 --> 1:56:34.740]  You know, this is really sad.
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:35.740]  Here's another one.
[1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:39.260]  Weisman and the Mueller gang made up charges against 11 mystery Russians in effort to claim
[1:56:39.260 --> 1:56:40.460]  Russia hacked the DNC.
[1:56:40.460 --> 1:56:41.460]  It was all a lie.
[1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:47.060]  Remember, they made those claims about these Russians and expected that the Russians wouldn't
[1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:48.100]  show up to court.
[1:56:48.100 --> 1:56:53.420]  The Russians actually showed up to court and wanted to defend themselves and Mueller and
[1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:56.340]  the Democrats said, nope, never mind, we're dropping the charges.
[1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:58.060]  You remember that?
[1:56:58.060 --> 1:56:59.060]  Remember that?
[1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:03.420]  They wrote, oh, look at these Russians that hacked the DNC and they filed a lawsuit.
[1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:08.540]  The Russians showed up in court with a lawyer and the Mueller team and the Democrats said,
[1:57:08.540 --> 1:57:13.060]  never mind, never mind, we don't want to try this case.
[1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:17.220]  Email released in Danchenko case proves Obama and his deep state lied and set up President
[1:57:17.220 --> 1:57:18.980]  Trump in an attempt to remove him from office.
[1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:20.180]  Yeah, we have all the evidence.
[1:57:20.180 --> 1:57:21.540]  But see, this is what's so sick.
[1:57:21.540 --> 1:57:24.620]  And I, you know, here's the one thing about Donald Trump that actually I think is even
[1:57:24.620 --> 1:57:27.460]  more important than the vaccine deal.
[1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:31.140]  Donald, people have suffered so much for this man.
[1:57:31.140 --> 1:57:34.740]  People have suffered so much in support of Donald Trump, myself included, but not the
[1:57:34.740 --> 1:57:36.060]  worst of it for me.
[1:57:36.060 --> 1:57:40.740]  People in jail, rotting in jail, solitary confinement in their support for this man.
[1:57:40.740 --> 1:57:41.900]  He owes them.
[1:57:41.900 --> 1:57:43.300]  He owes them so much.
[1:57:43.300 --> 1:57:48.340]  I don't know how he's going to pay it back.
[1:57:48.340 --> 1:57:54.500]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:57:54.500 --> 1:58:00.180]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:58:00.180 --> 1:58:03.780]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:58:03.780 --> 1:58:07.340]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:58:07.340 --> 1:58:08.340]  It's came over.
[1:58:08.340 --> 1:58:13.380]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:58:13.380 --> 1:58:18.540]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:58:18.540 --> 1:58:23.900]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,

[1:59:51.260 --> 2:00:12.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:18.980]  So of course you're a bigot if you believe that men would dress up as women to get access
[2:00:18.980 --> 2:00:21.460]  to children because they're perverts.
[2:00:21.460 --> 2:00:24.860]  If you think that you're a transphobe and obviously a bigot and there's no evidence
[2:00:24.860 --> 2:00:26.780]  to support that theory by the way.
[2:00:26.780 --> 2:00:29.780]  Oh wait, what's this?
[2:00:29.780 --> 2:00:34.780]  Here's the Berkshire police in England recognize this person.
[2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:40.380]  We're investigating an incident at the field station and releasing CTV images in connection.
[2:00:40.380 --> 2:00:46.500]  A person exposed their genitals to two teenagers and masturbated in a station shelter.
[2:00:46.500 --> 2:00:51.740]  And of course it's a man dressed like a woman.
[2:00:51.740 --> 2:00:59.940]  Now tell me, why would a man dress like a woman to go masturbate to teenagers at a train
[2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:01.140]  station shelter?
[2:01:01.140 --> 2:01:02.540]  Why would he do that?
[2:01:02.540 --> 2:01:07.500]  Oh I know why because he knows if he does that dressed as a woman, you're a bigot if
[2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:09.620]  you say anything about it.
[2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:12.940]  So if you're a pedophile, that's obviously frowned upon and bad.
[2:01:12.940 --> 2:01:20.020]  But if you're a transgender pedophile, that is all good baby baby.
[2:01:20.020 --> 2:01:23.300]  CCTV images released after indecent exposure.
[2:01:23.300 --> 2:01:29.980]  So man dresses as a woman, masturbates to kids at a train station, but don't dare call
[2:01:29.980 --> 2:01:34.740]  him a pervert because that's a transgender person, you bigot.
[2:01:34.740 --> 2:01:37.980]  Now this is really just sick stuff here.
[2:01:37.980 --> 2:01:41.500]  I wasn't going to cover this, but then I saw two stories and so somebody's got to mention
[2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:42.500]  this.
[2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:44.000]  This is just out of control.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:49.900]  So it was an opinion piece originally that got syndicated on a bunch of news platforms
[2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:53.380]  and it made the New York Post and that's where I saw it and I was going to just discount
[2:01:53.380 --> 2:01:57.180]  it, but then there was a follow up and I was like okay, I'll cover it now.
[2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:02.060]  Nadia Boccotti, why no nut November needs to stop.
[2:02:02.060 --> 2:02:07.060]  And there's this thing called no nut November that it's mostly for men and it's this promotion
[2:02:07.060 --> 2:02:12.300]  to stop watching porn and stop masturbating and that's a good health thing.
[2:02:12.300 --> 2:02:15.020]  It's a good mental health thing, physical health thing.
[2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:21.860]  So it's a trend that happens in November for men and this blogger, I assume it's a woman.
[2:02:21.860 --> 2:02:23.500]  I don't think it's a transgender, but whatever.
[2:02:23.500 --> 2:02:24.500]  I don't know about the blogger.
[2:02:24.500 --> 2:02:26.980]  So the blogger says, oh, it's bad.
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:28.780]  It's bad to shame people for masturbating.
[2:02:28.780 --> 2:02:30.380]  It's bad to shame people for watching porn.
[2:02:30.380 --> 2:02:31.380]  It's actually healthy.
[2:02:31.380 --> 2:02:32.380]  It's actually good.
[2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:33.380]  Okay, fine.
[2:02:33.380 --> 2:02:34.380]  You can believe that.
[2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:44.780]  And then, and then, and then even goes as far as to blame Christianity saying, oh, it's
[2:02:44.780 --> 2:02:45.780]  propaganda.
[2:02:45.780 --> 2:02:50.940]  It's a PSYOP that you think watching porn or masturbating is a bad thing or a sinful
[2:02:50.940 --> 2:02:51.940]  act.
[2:02:51.940 --> 2:02:52.940]  That's not real.
[2:02:52.940 --> 2:02:54.460]  That's just programmed into your head.
[2:02:54.460 --> 2:02:59.380]  And so you know what, even if I would accept that and you wanted to make the debate that
[2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:04.100]  watching porn and masturbating was not a degenerate act, which is just a ridiculous argument,
[2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:11.340]  but fine, you know what, then I would say, good, I'm glad that my parents raised me with
[2:03:11.340 --> 2:03:18.140]  enough dignity to know that watching porn and masturbating is a despicable degenerative
[2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:21.860]  act and I should be ashamed of myself if I do it.
[2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:27.140]  So you know what, good, count that as a win for Christianity.
[2:03:27.140 --> 2:03:28.740]  But here's why I had to cover this.
[2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:35.940]  Then I turned the page and there's this, priests and nuns watch porn online too, says Pope
[2:03:35.940 --> 2:03:36.940]  Francis.
[2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:37.940]  They just want you to be a pervert.
[2:03:37.940 --> 2:03:39.340]  They want you to watch porn.
[2:03:39.340 --> 2:03:40.820]  They want you to be a sex addict.
[2:03:40.820 --> 2:03:43.220]  They want you to be a porn addict.
[2:03:43.220 --> 2:03:45.220]  So no, I'm glad I was raised Christian.
[2:03:45.220 --> 2:03:46.460]  I'm glad I read the Bible.
[2:03:46.460 --> 2:03:48.900]  I'm glad I was told it's a degenerative act.
[2:03:48.900 --> 2:03:55.700]  I'm glad I was, I was shamed thinking, yeah, if you masturbate and watch porn, you should
[2:03:55.700 --> 2:03:56.700]  be ashamed.
[2:03:56.700 --> 2:03:58.380]  I'm glad I was raised that way.
[2:03:58.380 --> 2:04:01.220]  Call it Christian bigotry, good.
[2:04:01.220 --> 2:04:02.220]  But see, here's all the stories.
[2:04:02.220 --> 2:04:03.220]  They have them all pulled up.
[2:04:03.220 --> 2:04:04.220]  Oh, porn's good for you.
[2:04:04.220 --> 2:04:05.220]  No, it's not.
[2:04:05.220 --> 2:04:09.540]  It's just as addicting as any other drug and it's horrible for you and you should be ashamed
[2:04:09.540 --> 2:04:10.540]  of yourself.
[2:04:10.540 --> 2:04:15.140]  You think your ancestors sitting around watching you touch yourself as a good thing?
[2:04:15.140 --> 2:04:17.700]  You should be embarrassed.
[2:04:17.700 --> 2:04:21.100]  But see, it's all, it all comes back to the trans stuff, folks.
[2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:24.580]  NHS warning, many trans kids merely going through a phase.
[2:04:24.580 --> 2:04:25.580]  Well, that doesn't matter.
[2:04:25.580 --> 2:04:29.260]  Stop them up so that it's a permanent thing.
[2:04:29.260 --> 2:04:32.100]  Another disturbing, all ages drag show caught on camera.
[2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:39.220]  Yeah, see, they want you and your children to be addicted to porn and then when you try
[2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:44.700]  to say, hey, you shouldn't do that, that's bad, oh, you're a Christian bigot, don't shame
[2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:45.700]  them for doing that.
[2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:46.700]  It's fine.
[2:04:46.700 --> 2:04:47.700]  It's good.
[2:04:47.700 --> 2:04:48.700]  It's actually healthy.
[2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:49.700]  No, it's not.
[2:04:49.700 --> 2:04:50.700]  Stop lying to children.
[2:04:50.700 --> 2:04:52.420]  Stop sexualizing children.
[2:04:52.420 --> 2:04:58.860]  You are despicable beasts for promoting this activity.
[2:04:58.860 --> 2:04:59.860]  It's our best seller.
[2:04:59.860 --> 2:05:03.980]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[2:05:03.980 --> 2:05:09.020]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[2:05:09.020 --> 2:05:12.980]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:05:12.980 --> 2:05:16.380]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:21.860]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[2:05:21.860 --> 2:05:22.860]  function of the body.
[2:05:22.860 --> 2:05:27.660]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[2:05:27.660 --> 2:05:30.220]  need to live and be healthy.
[2:05:30.220 --> 2:05:34.260]  Essential means without these things, you die and so much of the food is debased.
[2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:36.460]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:05:36.460 --> 2:05:40.380]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[2:05:40.380 --> 2:05:44.020]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:47.540]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[2:05:47.540 --> 2:05:51.700]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion, finally
[2:05:51.700 --> 2:05:55.540]  back at stock at infowarstore.com for a 50% off.
[2:05:55.540 --> 2:06:23.580]  Vitamin mineral fusion back at stock, infowarstore.com.
[2:06:23.580 --> 2:06:30.300]  Earlier this week, he reported that Elon Musk would take over by Friday and make all
[2:06:30.300 --> 2:06:32.140]  the executive firings.
[2:06:32.140 --> 2:06:36.420]  Here is Ali Alexander earlier this week before everyone else he had the story.
[2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:37.420]  Here it is.
[2:06:37.420 --> 2:06:38.420]  I'm going to tell you this.
[2:06:38.420 --> 2:06:43.180]  As sure as I'm sitting here now, they're not going to stop Elon Musk from acquiring
[2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:44.180]  Twitter.
[2:06:44.180 --> 2:06:49.100]  We are going to expose to the world the side up information game that has gone on.
[2:06:49.100 --> 2:06:57.220]  The deal will close this week as I was the first person in the country to telegram out
[2:06:57.220 --> 2:07:00.860]  over a week ago and let me go ahead and break news.
[2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:04.860]  Let me break news that not even the Wall Street Journal or Business Insider has.
[2:07:04.860 --> 2:07:07.540]  Let me break news on the stone zone.
[2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:14.540]  I can announce exclusively that Elon Musk plans to serve as the CEO of Twitter.
[2:07:14.540 --> 2:07:20.540]  He will not just be running it as its major owner, no, and there is an investment group
[2:07:20.540 --> 2:07:24.620]  that is investing alongside Elon Musk.
[2:07:24.620 --> 2:07:27.740]  Elon Musk plans to take the helm himself.
[2:07:27.740 --> 2:07:30.020]  He's staring down the Biden administration.
[2:07:30.020 --> 2:07:31.740]  He's staring down the Marxists.
[2:07:31.740 --> 2:07:37.780]  He's staring down the pedophiles, the Satanists, and everybody else opposed to him.
[2:07:37.780 --> 2:07:44.140]  Elon Musk, Ali Alexander, it's exclusively reporting on the stone zone will serve as
[2:07:44.140 --> 2:07:45.140]  its CEO.
[2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:51.100]  He'll be CEO of three companies and you can bet your butt that the Biden administration
[2:07:51.100 --> 2:07:55.780]  will then come after him, but only after he's taken the helm and we're going to clean
[2:07:55.780 --> 2:07:56.780]  house.
[2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:59.380]  And by we, I just mean free thinkers.
[2:07:59.380 --> 2:08:04.340]  So there it is, folks, tomorrow's news today from Ali Alexander.
[2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:07.340]  And by the way, they have gone after Elon Musk.
[2:08:07.340 --> 2:08:09.180]  He's got multiple probes into him.
[2:08:09.180 --> 2:08:11.060]  He's got probes into Tesla.
[2:08:11.060 --> 2:08:15.380]  So they are coming after him with the government, but just like Donald Trump, he's clean.
[2:08:15.380 --> 2:08:18.500]  There's nothing there and he's a lot less controversial and hated than Donald Trump.
[2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:23.780]  So there's not many teeth to those investigations, but they are going after Elon Musk now as
[2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.100]  well with the deep state.
[2:08:25.100 --> 2:08:29.620]  So Ali Alexander joins me live now here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:29.620 --> 2:08:36.020]  Ali, let me just let you kind of take the helm here with the news breaking today.
[2:08:36.020 --> 2:08:38.260]  You had it earlier this week, but now the news is out.
[2:08:38.260 --> 2:08:41.820]  Elon Musk takes over Twitter a bunch of questions.
[2:08:41.820 --> 2:08:43.900]  When will the censorship be relinquished?
[2:08:43.900 --> 2:08:47.900]  When will people like Donald Trump, Alex Jones, Ali Alexander, myself and others get their
[2:08:47.900 --> 2:08:49.100]  accounts back?
[2:08:49.100 --> 2:08:53.660]  What is it like over there now with 75% of the staff getting fired, including the two
[2:08:53.660 --> 2:08:58.980]  big executives that clearly have no American values in their principles, in their heart
[2:08:58.980 --> 2:08:59.980]  and their souls?
[2:08:59.980 --> 2:09:01.820]  Ali Alexander, you broke the news first.
[2:09:01.820 --> 2:09:03.980]  What do you have for us today?
[2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:07.500]  You know, well, first, I want to say, oh, and today you're running a hell of a show.
[2:09:07.500 --> 2:09:13.340]  I just watched the past half hour and it's amazing to watch you break the news, make
[2:09:13.340 --> 2:09:16.500]  the news, teach people how to analyze the news.
[2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:18.980]  And I think that that's what we're doing here now together.
[2:09:18.980 --> 2:09:23.700]  But you know, I think that, look, I think that Alex and you and I, we've approached
[2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:29.100]  this issue where we've seen Elon Musk as an ally, as somebody who wants to restore the
[2:09:29.100 --> 2:09:30.660]  public square.
[2:09:30.660 --> 2:09:35.220]  And you and I also know that, you know, we're better at debating our enemies and battling
[2:09:35.220 --> 2:09:40.500]  our enemies in the public square than our opponents are, you know, we're not with Elon,
[2:09:40.500 --> 2:09:44.500]  with the electric vehicles, we're not with Elon on the transhumanism.
[2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:45.780]  But we do need this here.
[2:09:45.780 --> 2:09:50.500]  The question is beg, why wasn't there a right wing billionaire who came in and bought the
[2:09:50.500 --> 2:09:56.260]  New York Times or bought the Washington Post or bought Twitter or saved us from Facebook
[2:09:56.260 --> 2:09:57.260]  censorship?
[2:09:57.260 --> 2:10:00.620]  Well, what we've got to do is have a coalition, frankly, of the willing.
[2:10:00.620 --> 2:10:06.580]  And that includes EA, that includes Elon Musk and anybody else who wants a more normal
[2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:07.580]  America.
[2:10:07.580 --> 2:10:13.300]  And so, you know, I've got sources embedded in Twitter and in around Elon and all of
[2:10:13.300 --> 2:10:15.500]  the stuff I'm hearing is really good.
[2:10:15.500 --> 2:10:21.620]  What I'm hearing is that they don't have a formal process to reverse the permanent suspensions.
[2:10:21.620 --> 2:10:26.380]  But Elon himself has made that one of his top three priorities.
[2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:28.820]  His investors are on board with this.
[2:10:28.820 --> 2:10:31.620]  They're ready for troubled storms.
[2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:36.300]  There are investors at SpaceX, there are investors at Tesla that know that they're going to have
[2:10:36.300 --> 2:10:42.260]  to pay the price for Elon's political bravery, frankly, at Twitter.
[2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:43.260]  And this isn't about money.
[2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:49.020]  I really hate to see, you know, some of the dumb analysis when people said, oh, you know,
[2:10:49.020 --> 2:10:55.820]  certainly Elon could take or is taking Twitter private and could make a couple multiples
[2:10:55.820 --> 2:10:59.820]  of his investment, but that's not usually why you're investing this much money.
[2:10:59.820 --> 2:11:02.980]  When you're investing this much money, you know, you want to 10X your money, you want
[2:11:02.980 --> 2:11:07.580]  to do something more, there's no opportunity with taking Twitter private and then putting
[2:11:07.580 --> 2:11:11.940]  it back on the public market, maybe in three to five years, there's no opportunity to make
[2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:12.940]  that much money.
[2:11:12.940 --> 2:11:19.420]  So, this is a headache, this is a sacrifice, it's going to hurt other businesses he owns.
[2:11:19.420 --> 2:11:25.980]  And quite frankly, the SEC wasn't against Elon as much as they should have been or could
[2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:30.940]  have been during the Trump administration because Trump was busy pumping up the market.
[2:11:30.940 --> 2:11:33.020]  And so now we're in a different environment.
[2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:39.540]  It is, Elon is taking a lot more risk on behalf of putting us all on and taking all
[2:11:39.540 --> 2:11:40.740]  of the heat.
[2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:47.140]  And frankly, I can't wait, I can't wait till we actually see a demand market, a demand-based
[2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:51.500]  market on the right that, you know, people are missing the Roger Stones and the Orange
[2:11:51.500 --> 2:11:56.820]  Royors and the Alex Jones and they're not fully aware of the plight that you're going
[2:11:56.820 --> 2:12:02.260]  through after January 6th or that I'm going through or that Alex is going through.
[2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:06.940]  Too much of even the right is hypnotized by some of these false narratives and here we
[2:12:06.940 --> 2:12:09.020]  are to give them market options.
[2:12:09.020 --> 2:12:14.380]  Well, and your explanation of, I mean, the risk you could say that Elon Musk is taking,
[2:12:14.380 --> 2:12:21.780]  I think of it more of a, it's more of a risk of love where he genuinely doesn't mind taking
[2:12:21.780 --> 2:12:26.180]  a massive financial loss if that ends up being the case on Twitter because he truly believes
[2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:27.820]  in free speech.
[2:12:27.820 --> 2:12:32.660]  And I think as somebody that Elon Musk that uses Twitter, I think he just likes it.
[2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:33.660]  He likes Twitter.
[2:12:33.660 --> 2:12:34.660]  He likes the engagement.
[2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:35.660]  He likes the interaction.
[2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:37.980]  He likes to be able to put something out and everybody around the world can see it.
[2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:41.980]  He likes tweeting images and videos of his rocket ships going up into space.
[2:12:41.980 --> 2:12:47.060]  It's something he actually likes to be like if somebody bought a baseball team or a football
[2:12:47.060 --> 2:12:49.620]  team or something because they like the sport.
[2:12:49.620 --> 2:12:53.740]  Most owners of professional teams don't make much money on the teams until they sell them
[2:12:53.740 --> 2:12:54.740]  again.
[2:12:54.740 --> 2:12:58.580]  They might even take a loss, but they love their Chicago Bears or they love their New
[2:12:58.580 --> 2:12:59.980]  York Mets or whatever it is.
[2:12:59.980 --> 2:13:00.980]  So they buy it.
[2:13:00.980 --> 2:13:01.980]  They don't care.
[2:13:01.980 --> 2:13:03.220]  It's just something that they love to have.
[2:13:03.220 --> 2:13:05.300]  I kind of view that as what Elon Musk is doing.
[2:13:05.300 --> 2:13:08.420]  Now you said there's three priorities.
[2:13:08.420 --> 2:13:10.700]  Doing something about the permanent suspensions is one.
[2:13:10.700 --> 2:13:13.180]  There's no infrastructure or button or anything to click.
[2:13:13.180 --> 2:13:15.260]  So that's obviously going to be a bit of a process.
[2:13:15.260 --> 2:13:17.180]  We can dig into that in the next segment.
[2:13:17.180 --> 2:13:21.260]  But what are the other two priorities or can you tell us the other two priorities that
[2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:25.860]  Elon Musk has after taking over Twitter just 24 hours ago?
[2:13:25.860 --> 2:13:30.300]  Well, I'll speak to the personnel issue and then I'll leave one as a mystery.
[2:13:30.300 --> 2:13:36.700]  But on the personnel issue, I haven't myself been able to independently confirm the 75%
[2:13:36.700 --> 2:13:39.460]  number that's been reported around.
[2:13:39.460 --> 2:13:47.060]  It seems to me very difficult actually to lay off 75% of Twitter.
[2:13:47.060 --> 2:13:51.060]  Behind the scenes, you and I have had conversations following your banning and I've had conversations
[2:13:51.060 --> 2:13:58.140]  with Alex to kind of describe how the Twitter infrastructure is a lot different than Facebook.
[2:13:58.140 --> 2:14:02.220]  A lot of people think of these companies as competitors when they're really not.
[2:14:02.220 --> 2:14:07.460]  Facebook has 15,000 data points on every American user.
[2:14:07.460 --> 2:14:09.100]  Twitter has something like 15.
[2:14:09.100 --> 2:14:11.900]  And so it's very, very difficult to compare these companies.
[2:14:11.900 --> 2:14:14.340]  Twitter has less than 10% of the employees than Facebook.
[2:14:14.340 --> 2:14:16.500]  So I don't see a 75% halt.
[2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:20.420]  But the great thing is that we've gotten rid of four bad executives.
[2:14:20.420 --> 2:14:24.820]  So he fired the CEO, he fired the CFO, he fired basically the general counsel.
[2:14:24.820 --> 2:14:28.980]  I call her the JJ who was the worst demon at the company.
[2:14:28.980 --> 2:14:32.620]  But also over a week ago, we lost Del Harvey.
[2:14:32.620 --> 2:14:35.900]  She quit before she could get suspended.
[2:14:35.900 --> 2:14:39.620]  She has ties reportedly to Antifa.
[2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:42.060]  And so she has been a very big problem.
[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:46.900]  So I say, but JJ and Del Harvey were the two names that I've always alluded to that I've
[2:14:46.900 --> 2:14:51.020]  talked to Gavin McKinnis and yourself and Alex Jones in private and said, these are the
[2:14:51.020 --> 2:14:52.380]  people that need to go.
[2:14:52.380 --> 2:14:56.460]  These are the people that need to get pushed out because they were holding the board hostage.
[2:14:56.460 --> 2:14:59.980]  They were holding other executives hostage.
[2:14:59.980 --> 2:15:04.500]  And so the personnel issue and kind of setting that tone that, hey, you can stay if you're
[2:15:04.500 --> 2:15:06.220]  down with the new rules.
[2:15:06.220 --> 2:15:09.340]  But if you're not down with the new rules, then you got to go.
[2:15:09.340 --> 2:15:14.340]  But I'll say this, I think that Elon is going to try to move us to a different model that's
[2:15:14.340 --> 2:15:16.980]  not so ad dependent.
[2:15:16.980 --> 2:15:20.900]  And that's one of his personal priorities and his priorities he's had for decades.
[2:15:20.900 --> 2:15:24.740]  Now he sees an opportunity with Twitter in moving on that.
[2:15:24.740 --> 2:15:30.460]  And of course, if it's not so ad dependent, the excuse that the leftist had to ban free
[2:15:30.460 --> 2:15:35.620]  speech because of the, oh, the sponsors or the advertisers or the marketers complaining
[2:15:35.620 --> 2:15:39.220]  about it, that power, those teeth go away.
[2:15:39.220 --> 2:15:43.260]  I want to continue on the personnel issue when we come back because I got a couple follow
[2:15:43.260 --> 2:15:46.540]  up questions for Ali Alexander on that.
[2:15:46.540 --> 2:15:51.940]  But yes, good riddance to the dirty commies, the entitled brats that wanted to censor you
[2:15:51.940 --> 2:15:52.940]  on Twitter.
[2:15:52.940 --> 2:16:20.740]  Good bye.

[2:18:00.980 --> 2:18:07.500]  That's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them

[2:20:12.340 --> 2:20:23.340]  It certainly is a time it certainly is a season
[2:20:24.340 --> 2:20:26.340]  And you know
[2:20:26.980 --> 2:20:33.100]  We're getting into the personnel issues here with Ali Alexander on the Alex Jones show Owen Schroder filling in at Twitter
[2:20:34.620 --> 2:20:36.620]  I kind of one of though in the
[2:20:36.620 --> 2:20:41.820]  Just hearing that song coming in Ali, maybe just kind of
[2:20:42.860 --> 2:20:49.660]  Stray from the path real quick because I'm hearing this I'm noticing this I'm seeing this in real time
[2:20:51.460 --> 2:20:54.340]  Forget about what the results of the midterms end up being I
[2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:59.100]  Feel like Americans are starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel
[2:20:59.100 --> 2:21:06.020]  They're starting to see things that are bringing them hope that America can come back to its once greatness that that the liberal
[2:21:06.020 --> 2:21:10.660]  Left ideology and everything that comes with it is in their final death rose and finally
[2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:18.020]  Revealing itself in its its final play to try to conquer us. Are you feeling that same energy? Are you getting that same vibe?
[2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:23.500]  I know you're somebody that likes to kind of go off of those vibes those energies try to tune into those frequencies like me
[2:21:23.660 --> 2:21:28.140]  Are you getting that same energy? Are you are you getting that same reverb?
[2:21:28.220 --> 2:21:32.500]  Not just internally, but but externally from talking to people and seeing people
[2:21:32.500 --> 2:21:37.740]  It's so funny, you know, we're definitely in sync. So 60 days ago
[2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:43.860]  I I felt like my spirit was saying, you know, wow, you're noticing all this great content, you know, Alex
[2:21:44.980 --> 2:21:47.820]  Frankly, I thought just this is me speculating
[2:21:47.820 --> 2:21:54.860]  I thought that Alex a depression had lifted off of Alex and that he was ready to see the the the trials ahead of them as
[2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:58.980]  What they were instead of imagining what they could be and oftentimes
[2:21:58.980 --> 2:22:06.080]  Lawfare is designed to to give you kind of this cognitive dissidents about what outcomes could be achieved and I watched
[2:22:06.180 --> 2:22:11.580]  You know our friend kind of say, okay, well, you know, if you're gonna crucify me, I'm gonna make you do it in public
[2:22:11.580 --> 2:22:16.980]  I was also watching Alex Stein and he was just killing it and I got this this since that
[2:22:16.980 --> 2:22:19.980]  I hadn't seen since Andrew Breitbart and I was like man
[2:22:19.980 --> 2:22:26.260]  Yeah, I miss Andrew and Alex Stein has some of that jovial energy that happy warrior energy
[2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:32.060]  That that that few possessed like he did he did and then I was watching, you know yourself
[2:22:32.060 --> 2:22:38.180]  I was watching Nicholas J. Fuentes and I said we're on the eve of a content renaissance. Okay, well then six weeks later
[2:22:38.540 --> 2:22:44.340]  Here we are, you know, and now we're three weeks into this thing two weeks into this thing and I got to tell you
[2:22:44.340 --> 2:22:47.940]  I'm feeling it and it's very tough to describe because then what I do
[2:22:47.940 --> 2:22:53.260]  You know when you're feeling this frequency is you call the other people that you know are empaths or or
[2:22:53.260 --> 2:23:00.540]  Spiritually inclined you say are you feeling something are you noticing anything and and no one can name what's what's going on, you know
[2:23:00.540 --> 2:23:01.900]  It's this
[2:23:01.900 --> 2:23:08.180]  2016 energy part two is it's the great meme or you know, what exactly are we seeing and I'm not sure
[2:23:08.180 --> 2:23:11.300]  I think that we're purposefully not being given a
[2:23:12.300 --> 2:23:17.700]  Descriptor of what this is because it's still formulating, but I'll tell you this today
[2:23:17.980 --> 2:23:21.060]  The kind of the clarity that I'm coming to is that we
[2:23:21.060 --> 2:23:25.900]  We we don't we we're being the handcuffs are coming off
[2:23:26.220 --> 2:23:29.340]  We're being allowed to fight. We're about to be given an opportunity
[2:23:29.940 --> 2:23:35.100]  To do the right thing and I think that we were given that opportunity during stop the steel
[2:23:35.100 --> 2:23:38.220]  And that's why the deep state subverted it and inverted it
[2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:40.220]  I think that we were given that opportunity
[2:23:40.500 --> 2:23:46.660]  Unfortunately during the pandemic and I think that the Trump administration through operation warp speed, you know failed that test
[2:23:46.660 --> 2:23:48.700]  I think America has failed a lot of tests
[2:23:48.700 --> 2:23:52.740]  I think that we might be given one opportunity to do the right thing
[2:23:53.260 --> 2:24:00.840]  To come together on basic truths the due process violations of the January's of those criminally charged in January 6
[2:24:01.340 --> 2:24:05.780]  You know this meme about the election. Do we want elections that have integrity or not?
[2:24:05.780 --> 2:24:09.460]  Can we have a public square where both sides can duke it out?
[2:24:09.460 --> 2:24:13.580]  I mean these are fundamental questions on whether or not we can be a society or not
[2:24:13.580 --> 2:24:18.780]  So so I'm I'm feeling the vibe. I'm feeling the frequency and you know, it's corny to some
[2:24:18.780 --> 2:24:27.020]  But it's uncanny that all the people who really tuned in are all feeling this and and I'll note this the yay interview
[2:24:27.620 --> 2:24:32.620]  With um, I forgot which which interview yay said this in but he's like I was given it
[2:24:32.620 --> 2:24:38.300]  Oh, this was when the Daily Mail had a paparazzi person outside a facility that yay was at
[2:24:38.300 --> 2:24:44.300]  He said I was given all this money to lose it all and and this was before he lost the adidas deal
[2:24:44.300 --> 2:24:51.340]  Which took 1.5 billion dollars from his net worth Elon Musk himself could really stand to lose more than half his net worth
[2:24:51.340 --> 2:24:57.980]  And people don't realize it and you know you and I and Alex, you know, we've got the government coming after us
[2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:04.260]  We've got civil litigants coming after us and we could lose everything now is the opportunity to take that founder's pledge
[2:25:04.260 --> 2:25:10.820]  And pledge our lives our fortune and our sacred honor together because really come on the deep state the NWO
[2:25:10.820 --> 2:25:13.340]  They need slaves. They don't really want us dead
[2:25:13.340 --> 2:25:18.500]  They'll kill a couple of us if they have to but they really want slaves and if we can just push them back
[2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:24.460]  We can push them back for 50 years a hundred years and prep the next generation to feel this fight
[2:25:24.460 --> 2:25:29.820]  But I'm definitely feeling the vibe Owen. Well, and it's kind of are you yeah, and I you know
[2:25:29.820 --> 2:25:35.180]  It's not that I can even put words into it. I can more just describe a situation where
[2:25:35.900 --> 2:25:42.500]  We've been scratching and clawing for so long trying to expose the globalist trying to expose the left-wing ideology
[2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:45.380]  We've been destroyed in that process now here
[2:25:45.380 --> 2:25:52.740]  We are broken and destroyed but on the eve of victory because now the globalists are exposing themselves now the radical liberal left is
[2:25:52.740 --> 2:25:55.700]  Exposing themselves. It's almost like we don't even we've been completely
[2:25:55.700 --> 2:26:03.140]  Handicapped and removed from the fight in so many ways. It's almost like we're sitting here nailed strapped to the wall and just staring
[2:26:03.140 --> 2:26:05.340]  Let's death staring them like yeah, what you're gonna do now?
[2:26:05.340 --> 2:26:10.100]  What you're gonna do now because everybody else is everybody else is starting to wake up all around them
[2:26:10.100 --> 2:26:13.260]  And that's why the midterms are so imperfect. I mean when or lose
[2:26:13.660 --> 2:26:18.460]  They can't put the cat back into the bag when or lose the genie is out of the bottle
[2:26:18.460 --> 2:26:24.260]  And if you see election results in the midterms with carry like not winning or Blake masters not winning or
[2:26:24.260 --> 2:26:29.460]  Our odds not winning. I mean people doubting the 2020 election. That was just the beginning
[2:26:29.460 --> 2:26:36.180]  I mean the landslide of people waking up and not trusting the elections or the politicians or the mainstream news is gonna be a hundred
[2:26:36.180 --> 2:26:42.060]  Fold and so yeah, that kind of enters us into a new a new danger zone that a lot of people aren't used to
[2:26:42.220 --> 2:26:44.940]  But we've we've lived in this danger zone
[2:26:44.940 --> 2:26:50.820]  We're like buried in the graveyard of the danger zone just like hoping to get a little air a little water to touch us
[2:26:50.820 --> 2:26:57.100]  So that's kind of the analogy that I see here the average American is now catching up at light speed
[2:26:57.260 --> 2:26:59.260]  To where the rest of us have been for so long
[2:27:00.420 --> 2:27:04.260]  And you've always said this, you know, you've always said, you know, it's me now
[2:27:04.580 --> 2:27:10.600]  But it's my listeners next and and not enough people realize this this system of oppression is
[2:27:11.100 --> 2:27:19.140]  Scalable whether it's deep platforming law fear fake criminal charges accusations, you know deep fake videos and memes
[2:27:19.140 --> 2:27:25.860]  It's it's all scalable and so, you know, we've got to take this opportunity to hold fast to each other like brothers and
[2:27:26.340 --> 2:27:33.220]  And really support each other and that's the opportunity that replatforming on Twitter is I haven't been able to pay all my legal bills
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:35.540]  But if I have my Twitter account
[2:27:35.540 --> 2:27:42.260]  I can and so they cannot disrupt the dissidents in this movement and democracies and republics
[2:27:42.260 --> 2:27:49.740]  rely on the perception that there is a consensus amongst the people and what you and I and frankly the corporations know is
[2:27:49.740 --> 2:27:55.900]  That there is no consensus among the American public because they haven't been given at least two options and there's more than two options
[2:27:55.900 --> 2:27:59.580]  We want our options the American people deserve options and so
[2:28:00.220 --> 2:28:05.220]  You know, I think that this is a fascinating time to be alive and like you said you and I we're already dead
[2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:10.380]  We're already dead, but the Bible tells us right that we can be resurrected and in this fight
[2:28:10.380 --> 2:28:14.520]  We're sort of being resurrected. I mean, it's it's it's the ninth inning
[2:28:14.580 --> 2:28:21.740]  You know with the eight yard line and it's just not the night ending we're fourth down and you know the eight yard line
[2:28:21.740 --> 2:28:23.740]  It's just kind of it's kind of weird
[2:28:23.740 --> 2:28:29.820]  It's kind of freaky and I'm loving it and and this is God. This isn't our Republican leaders. This is God
[2:28:29.820 --> 2:28:33.940]  No, absolutely hundred percent right couldn't agree more now ladies and gentlemen
[2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:39.500]  I'm gonna get back to the issue at hand with the personnel at Twitter and as we're sitting here talking
[2:28:39.500 --> 2:28:43.180]  Elon Musk has just put out a huge tweet
[2:28:44.060 --> 2:28:48.420]  Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints
[2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:54.220]  No major content decisions or account means freeing statements will happen before that cancel convenes or talk about that on the other side
[2:28:56.380 --> 2:29:02.540]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you and
[2:29:02.540 --> 2:29:09.100]  The globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of
[2:29:09.500 --> 2:29:16.580]  Resistance alerting the people not as of America, but the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny
[2:29:16.860 --> 2:29:22.260]  That's why it's so essential today now more than ever to share links remphal wars calm

[2:31:01.220 --> 2:31:08.340]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit
[2:31:08.580 --> 2:31:13.300]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely
[2:31:13.300 --> 2:31:17.980]  So they're gonna go from Mike Lindell next or they're gonna go for Steve Bannon or gonna go for Tucker Carlson
[2:31:17.980 --> 2:31:20.940]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on there 28 years
[2:31:21.100 --> 2:31:25.140]  And I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul revere
[2:31:25.220 --> 2:31:30.500]  But I couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet
[2:31:30.500 --> 2:31:34.620]  Not as to America where public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda

[2:32:07.300 --> 2:32:09.980]  We've broken together this family that is info wars
[2:32:11.500 --> 2:32:19.860]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Ball Sonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as
[2:32:20.220 --> 2:32:22.220]  being the main impetus
[2:32:22.900 --> 2:32:26.860]  Towards firing up their main base to defeat the new world order
[2:32:27.580 --> 2:32:30.700]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[2:32:30.700 --> 2:32:37.060]  Is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show
[2:32:37.860 --> 2:32:44.300]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours
[2:32:44.300 --> 2:32:45.760]  It isn't gonna give up

[2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:18.240]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:22.760]  the Info War and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:31.280]  Folks, quickly, this situation with the Pelosi House home invasion is spiraling out of control
[2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:32.920]  right now.
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:36.960]  And so, you know, I had mentioned it earlier and I said I was going to lay off of the coverage
[2:33:36.960 --> 2:33:38.920]  and then there was some breaking news in it.
[2:33:38.920 --> 2:33:43.520]  Now I'm looking at all the new breaking news and folks, this thing is just totally out
[2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:44.520]  of control.
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:50.560]  But you notice when Paul Pelosi was driving a vehicle inebriated with a woman in the
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:54.280]  car with him and almost killed somebody, you notice how they didn't have a big problem
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:33:55.280]  with that.
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:57.280]  Did you ever hear about that victim of Paul Pelosi?
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:33:58.280]  No, you didn't.
[2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:03.600]  But you're going to hear all about this protester that somehow got his way into Pelosi's open
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:08.520]  house through two, three, four lines of security cameras and everything.
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:09.800]  No videos from that night.
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:13.720]  I'm surprised Pelosi didn't have a documentary film crew there filming when the guy entered
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:15.920]  the house like she did on January 6th.
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:18.800]  But we'll get more into that later because I do have a couple of questions.
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:23.040]  Ali did write a story about the Pelosi coverup site, but I want to get back into the Twitter
[2:34:23.040 --> 2:34:24.360]  personnel thing now, Ali.
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:30.960]  And so this tweet from Elon Musk just came out moments ago.
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:36.640]  Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:43.360]  No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:47.680]  Can you give us more insider information on that or any other personnel information in
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:48.880]  regards to that?
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:52.840]  Well, it was interesting because a bunch of friends asked me, do we need to create new
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:54.280]  accounts?
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:59.000]  And what I was told is that we likely wouldn't need new accounts.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.840]  But additionally, it's not like I'm some reporter full time or something.
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:07.440]  My own view was that if we were going to be forced to create new accounts, then I was
[2:35:07.440 --> 2:35:08.960]  going to go hog wild.
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:11.400]  And bad things happen when I go hog wild.
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:13.520]  So I was like, no, we need our old accounts back.
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:17.600]  It sounded like that that was the consensus that was forming.
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:21.240]  And then I was told, what do you think?
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:25.560]  I was asked, what do you think the process looks like for people like yourself coming
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:26.560]  back?
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:31.160]  And I said, look, I'm OK with a little bit of a mea copa.
[2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:35.840]  There are certain things that I'm willing to concede to get back on the battlefield.
[2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:40.040]  And I think that something that we, a couple, the way that we approach this needs to be
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:41.720]  very, very prudent.
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:44.000]  And I said, you guys do need a process.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:51.760]  If this looks like Elon is ruling by fiat instead of giving a vision that is then policy
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:54.520]  is formed around that, then it's not sustainable.
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:35:59.480]  We need a succession plan for Elon's vision.
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:03.680]  And I think that that's what people in the Valley and good executives believe, too.
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:07.360]  And so today, I think that you're seeing him announce part of those first steps, that
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:08.800]  there needs to be a process.
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:12.760]  And so I've had a couple of friends file their appeals, and I'm not wasting my time on the
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:13.760]  appeals.
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:18.640]  People like me and people like you, Owen, and Alex, and Roger Stone, and Laura Loomer,
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:23.040]  we have additional locks on our account because we're newsworthy individuals.
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:26.520]  And so we just got to trust the process.
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  We got to let the process create itself.
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:30.760]  We got to participate in the process.
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:34.360]  And we got to push back when we think that the process is going to lead to long term
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:35.360]  bad outcomes.
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:42.400]  But right now, he's attempting to set up something that is a encouraging of dialogue.
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:46.760]  And I think that I told people, we'll be back soon.
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:50.320]  It'll be sooner than you expect, but not immediate.
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:55.440]  And I think that Elon, with this news today, is letting people know that once again, I
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:36:57.080]  was ahead of the media.
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:02.240]  Well, and I will just go ahead and say this now.
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:07.960]  I logged into my Twitter account for the first time in a while last night.
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:11.720]  And ever since I was banned years ago, by the way, they never gave me any reason for
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:13.240]  the ban.
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:20.160]  The only thing I could derive for any reason was, I think it was either a Newsweek or a
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:24.680]  Daily Beast story or a Politico story where I was on a live stream, and I'm not kidding
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:26.760]  you folks, I coughed.
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:29.720]  I coughed on a live stream.
[2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:33.520]  And whoever it was, Daily Beast, Politico said, oh, and Schreuer needs to be banned
[2:37:33.520 --> 2:37:34.520]  from Twitter.
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:36.680]  He coughed on a live stream during the pandemic.
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:38.000]  Not even kidding you folks.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  That was that.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:44.240]  Now, so after they published that story of me coughing on a live stream during the pandemic,
[2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:47.280]  after they published that, I was banned the next day.
[2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:48.920]  Never got an email from Twitter.
[2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:50.800]  Never got one, two, three strikes.
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:54.640]  Never had a tweet linked that they offered if you delete this or correct it, we'll get
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:55.640]  rid of it.
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:57.600]  No, just boom, wiped off of Twitter with that.
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:03.360]  Now, at that time, I could log into my account, but there was nothing there.
[2:38:03.360 --> 2:38:06.120]  It was the picture of the egg as my profile.
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:09.000]  It was the standard open your account avatar.
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.800]  And I couldn't access any of the tweets or any information.
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:12.800]  There it is right there.
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:14.040]  It was media matters.
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:17.880]  Twitter is facilitating the promotion of an InfoWars host rally that will flout Texas's
[2:38:17.880 --> 2:38:19.600]  social distance order.
[2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:22.760]  And you can see they have the picture of me coughing.
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:26.920]  They put the picture of me coughing on the front page, then they said, look, he coughed
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:29.840]  during a live stream during a pandemic, he needs to get banned.
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:32.680]  I logged into my account for the first time last night.
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:35.080]  I could see my profile picture.
[2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:38.040]  I could see my old tweets.
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:42.320]  And for the first time ever, I was able to appeal my suspension.
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:47.840]  Now again, I'm not expecting there to be any, you know, immediate action on that, but clearly
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:52.240]  something has changed where it used to be when I logged in, it was the egg picture, couldn't
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:56.160]  see any of the metadata, nothing, couldn't appeal nothing.
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.120]  Now I can look in and see all my old stuff and appeal, I even got a response from the
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:01.120]  Twitter support team.
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:03.280]  So something is in the works.
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:09.080]  I mean, do you know, I mean, this could just be the Twitter people hiding all their crimes
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:13.160]  ahead of Elon Musk taking over and changing all the algorithms and code and stuff so that
[2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:16.240]  he can't see what they've really done.
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:21.560]  Or have there been moves maybe made behind the scenes, just little stuff that has happened?
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:26.880]  Well, yeah, and there's a notification inside of your profile that says it's in read only
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:27.880]  mode.
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:34.480]  And this is important because I think it's going to, it charts a path forward for sites
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:39.160]  that want to be an alternative authentication.
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:45.360]  So you know, like I use my Twitter to log in to a site called like product hunt.com.
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:50.360]  So I haven't been able to log into product hunt because I don't sign in into Twitter.
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:54.200]  And I've never created an alternative account or anything else like that.
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:59.080]  But what I'll say is, is that, is that while the deal was going through and Elon was making
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:07.640]  its bid, the Twitter team kind of had a fiduciary duty to continue to follow its insane policies
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:09.840]  because that's what its CEO wanted them to do.
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:11.760]  And that's what their board wanted them to do.
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:17.040]  So they kind of had a legal right to keep wasting money, frankly, I mean, tens of millions
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:25.320]  of dollars spent of the shareholders money that was that Elon's were going to repeal.
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:30.120]  But they also needed to start making moves with the smaller team that showed good faith
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:35.560]  efforts and preserved data and did all kinds of other things because Elon also assumes
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:37.600]  all of Twitter's liability.
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:43.680]  So as long as Twitter disclosed the liabilities to him, Elon now assumes those liabilities.
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:49.040]  So if I wanted to sue Twitter tomorrow, I would be suing Elon's Twitter.
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:50.880]  There's no past Twitter to sue.
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:57.440]  And so, so, so what I, as far as I understand it, you know, Twitter basically took two
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:03.280]  tracks where 80% of their actions were anti-Elon and they tried to kill the deal.
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:06.960]  They tried to, you know, do all kinds of dirty things behind the scenes.
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:13.080]  But 20% of it was the board of directors and the executives for, for legal reasons needing
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:15.000]  to show good faith.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:18.960]  And so, yeah, I still haven't tried to log into my account.
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:20.920]  I'm just, you know, I'm just, I'm just going to wait.
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:26.640]  I've been, I've been just fine for 21 months and, you know, I'll wait another month or
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:29.040]  two if I, if I need to.
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:36.160]  By the way, do you know how Parag and Vijaya were able to fandango a deal that they get
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.400]  fired and make $200 million collectively on their exit?
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  How did they get that deal done?
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:47.240]  I mean, it's a part of, it's a part of your deal when you become an executive.
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:53.600]  So, so one, when you become at that level of a publicly traded company, your severance
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:01.160]  packages are in one sense pre-negotiated and then on the way out, they're also renegotiated.
[2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:08.640]  And so, there's a windfall of sorts because Elon paid above the valuation of Twitter,
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:11.800]  above the market cap of Twitter stock.
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:15.680]  Not only that, that was when the stock, before the stock market fell out.
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:21.520]  So, it's kind of like a double windfall for them and good riddance to them.
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:23.800]  I mean, just absolutely good riddance to them.
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:24.800]  Yeah.
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:27.760]  But I'm sure, you know, they're good liberals, so they'll turn around and probably give that
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:31.720]  hundreds of millions to, you know, a charity organization or something like that because
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:33.360]  they're good liberals and they hate the rich, right?
[2:42:33.360 --> 2:42:34.360]  I mean, come on.
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:38.600]  We know they hate the rich so much, oh, except when it's their money, they love the rich.
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:43.200]  It's kind of like Bono, who's worth almost a billion dollars, and Bono now comes out
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:46.840]  and says, wait a second, I was wrong, capitalism is the answer.
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:47.840]  Capitalism is good.
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:49.840]  It's rich people that can save the world.
[2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:50.840]  What?
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:51.840]  Bono's a capitalist now?
[2:42:51.840 --> 2:42:52.840]  It couldn't be.
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:53.840]  No.
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:54.840]  No, Bono.
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:43:02.320]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:03.320]  you.
[2:43:03.320 --> 2:43:07.640]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:12.720]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:16.920]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[2:46:58.400 --> 2:47:10.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:15.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back here with Ali Alexander on the Alex Jones
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:16.080]  show.
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:20.400]  Owen Troyer sitting in and you know, I said this earlier, I was gonna, I was hesitant
[2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:25.920]  and I was gonna wait to cover the latest out of the Pelosi home invasion and then I kind
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:30.160]  of got into it and broke the latest news and it's not that I regret that, but I think I
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:35.720]  kind of jumped the shark a little bit because now the propaganda is overwhelming.
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:39.400]  And so I kind of jumped the shark before the major propaganda hit.
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:43.400]  Now it's full on, they're blaming Trump, they're blaming Trump supporters are saying, look,
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:48.080]  Trump supporters are trying to kill politicians, of course, ignoring the legitimate assassins
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:52.840]  that went and shot Steve Scalise, went and tried to kill Brett Kavanaugh and all the
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:55.200]  other Democrat assassins, they ignore that.
[2:47:55.200 --> 2:47:59.120]  And so that just shows you that, yes, this is whether it was designed to be this way
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:02.220]  or not, it is being used for political propaganda.
[2:48:02.220 --> 2:48:05.280]  And so there's a lot of questions, I don't really want to get into it now, I just want
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:07.120]  to say this.
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:14.080]  It looks like however deep this goes, it looks like this might be an attempt at a big October
[2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:19.400]  surprise ahead of the midterms initiated out of the home invasion of Paul Pelosi.
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:24.120]  Now I'm gonna have to sit and wait as more information is incoming on this to really
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:28.760]  do a deep analysis and give you what I think my perspective is, I kind of jumped the shark
[2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:29.760]  on it a little bit.
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:34.320]  But now I'm seeing it's like it's full on folks, they're really gonna try to make this
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:38.360]  the big story this weekend and blame Trump and blame conservatives and say, look, they're
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:40.120]  all terrorists.
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:45.400]  And there's still a lot of questions remaining that are pretty obvious to the people watching.
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:49.320]  But Ali, I don't really necessarily want to get into that, but it's all in the same vein
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:54.880]  to me as January 6th, oh January 6th, worst day since 9-11.
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:48:59.920]  And yet somehow Nancy Pelosi has a documentary film crew following her around all day.
[2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:01.400]  Wow, what perfect timing.
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:04.760]  And then they release the videos to the public right before the midterms.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:07.520]  Turns out her son-in-law is there with the QAnon shaman.
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:10.340]  Wow, what are the odds of all of that happening?
[2:49:10.340 --> 2:49:12.880]  So you wrote a story the other day though.
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:16.120]  This is so incredible actually.
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:20.400]  Nancy cover-up, now we know why Democrats lied about Trump's National Guard offer.
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:25.800]  Ali, there's a story every once in a while that is an open shut case.
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:30.000]  You know, a lot of these times there's a lot of hearsay, a lot of opinion, and you kind
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:36.720]  of have to crawl through the mud, if you will, you'll never come out clean trying to figure
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:38.240]  out what's going on.
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:41.480]  With this story, it's clean, it's clear cut as day.
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:46.520]  We have the receipts of Trump asking for the DC police to be enhanced that day, and
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:47.920]  Mario Bowser saying no.
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:49.200]  We have the receipts.
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:53.840]  We have the receipts of Trump asking for the National Guard to be initiated by Nancy
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:55.480]  Pelosi on that day.
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:58.600]  We have the receipts of her standing it down.
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:03.400]  And now they say, oh it's Trump's fault, Trump stood down the police, Trump stood down the
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:04.840]  National Guard.
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:05.840]  What?
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:10.680]  We literally have the evidence, the phone calls, the emails, the texts, it's all there.
[2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:15.280]  And then they run stories saying it's not, you covered that for the Gateway Pundit.
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:19.320]  Try to put this into perspective for the audience here.
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:20.800]  Just how ludicrous this is.
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:24.040]  The sun rises in the west, water is not wet.
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:25.840]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:32.720]  Yeah, you know, Owen, it's really tough because there's a story and a meme that the public
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:37.320]  understands, and that's that Trump and the committee are fighting something about National
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:40.080]  Guard, something, something, something.
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:43.200]  And then there is how it relates to the law.
[2:50:43.200 --> 2:50:48.440]  This literally affects the criminal defendants.
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:54.720]  This literally affects people targeted by the January 6th Select Committee like myself
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:56.480]  and what we knew and what we didn't know.
[2:50:56.480 --> 2:51:01.720]  And this literally affects whether or not Trump can be charged with a crime that Liz
[2:51:01.720 --> 2:51:06.600]  Cheney is trying to whip up support for a criminal referral from the committee.
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:09.280]  And there's internal battles going on in the committee.
[2:51:09.280 --> 2:51:15.480]  And so what's interesting is I had to tell this story in a chronological way, in a compelling
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:18.120]  way that also had the receipts.
[2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:21.640]  And I didn't want anyone to overlook it because the story sounds familiar.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:28.240]  Again, we know that Trump and the committee have been fighting over the National Guard.
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:33.080]  What I did not know, I was missing one piece of the puzzle, one piece of the puzzle that
[2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:37.160]  I was missing, and Nancy Pelosi's daughter provided that for us.
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:40.840]  And what I think is illegal footage, it is illegal footage.
[2:51:40.840 --> 2:51:46.640]  And let me say this, Nancy Pelosi's daughter is holding on to footage that might be exculpatory
[2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:50.320]  evidence for all these criminal defendants.
[2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:54.960]  We have evidence that Nancy Pelosi authorized her daughter in a professional capacity.
[2:51:54.960 --> 2:51:57.240]  A lot of people can focus on the personal capacity.
[2:51:57.240 --> 2:52:00.400]  She was there in a professional capacity.
[2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:01.400]  Her husband works for him.
[2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:04.440]  And by the way, just so people understand this, that means there's a paper trail.
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:05.440]  That means there's requests.
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:07.640]  I mean, you have to get access there.
[2:52:07.640 --> 2:52:10.880]  There's a bunch of sign-offs and a routine to get that access.
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:13.640]  It's not like she can just show up with a camera crew.
[2:52:13.640 --> 2:52:14.640]  Right.
[2:52:14.640 --> 2:52:17.200]  And so we know that there was all kinds of clearance.
[2:52:17.200 --> 2:52:19.360]  There was talking with the US Capitol Police.
[2:52:19.360 --> 2:52:21.920]  The Speaker of the House has US Capitol Police.
[2:52:21.920 --> 2:52:26.840]  I mean, we should eventually talk about, well, not on this show, but we should talk soon
[2:52:26.840 --> 2:52:30.800]  about Nancy Pelosi's home break-in because there's a lot of questions there.
[2:52:30.800 --> 2:52:34.200]  And I had a source tip me off right before I came on air.
[2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:39.360]  So that's a whole other thing, but look, the fact is, is that Nancy Pelosi's daughter was
[2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:42.240]  given privileges that other members of Congress want.
[2:52:42.240 --> 2:52:48.760]  She was with the people who secure the continuity of government and she filmed the whole thing.
[2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:50.440]  We need that footage released.
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:51.520]  She has this footage.
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:57.320]  How did Nancy Pelosi, who has watched other and overseen and participated in January 6
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:53:02.240]  lawful objections at the congressional level, how was she able to know that this time she
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:03.240]  wanted it filmed?
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:08.680]  Let's try to make this a little more palatable for the audience to sink their teeth into.
[2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:13.320]  Folks, this would be like if Nancy Pelosi invited her daughter and a documentary film
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:18.440]  crew into, you know, let's say the basement of the White House when Biden and Pelosi were
[2:53:18.440 --> 2:53:22.600]  discussing nuclear secrets or if they're going to nuclear strike Russia or something.
[2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:25.120]  And she had her film crew in there filming it.
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:30.240]  And obviously there would be extreme violations there of US government policy and code if
[2:53:30.240 --> 2:53:31.240]  she did that.
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:36.400]  But you're saying that on a lower level, that's basically the access that she was given.
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:38.640]  It's the access she was given.
[2:53:38.640 --> 2:53:39.640]  It was unlawful.
[2:53:39.640 --> 2:53:45.880]  For example, they film a conversation with Nancy Pelosi and Governor Hogan in Maryland.
[2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:48.160]  Maryland is a two-party consent state.
[2:53:48.160 --> 2:53:50.800]  She either broke the law or she didn't.
[2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:53.200]  You know, I think Virginia might be a one-party state.
[2:53:53.200 --> 2:53:57.160]  You know, DC is definitely a one-party state.
[2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:00.080]  But they're also filming conversations.
[2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:05.440]  All security conversations with the sitting attorney general, the secretary of the Department
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:06.440]  of Defense.
[2:54:06.440 --> 2:54:09.720]  And none of these people had communication with the president at the time.
[2:54:09.720 --> 2:54:12.200]  This was a violation of the separation of powers.
[2:54:12.200 --> 2:54:17.800]  They were filming national security conversations and HBO and CNN are in possession of that
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:22.360]  footage while people who are charged with crimes and complaints that reference that
[2:54:22.360 --> 2:54:25.080]  they disrupted this event aren't.
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:30.040]  This also shows that Nancy Pelosi had a premeditated awareness that this was a newsworthy
[2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:33.640]  event, that this was an event that she should have secured the Capitol.
[2:54:33.640 --> 2:54:39.840]  So she actually violated, she has a dereliction of duty as the Speaker of the House.
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:42.720]  And what you're going to see, Liz Cheney, and I'll break it here, what you're going
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:46.840]  to see Liz Cheney push for, and what I think she'll find votes on the January 6th Select
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:50.160]  Committee, this is going to give me a big trouble, is Liz Cheney is going to suggest
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:54.800]  that there's something called the Take Care Clause in the United States Constitution that
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:54:59.560]  should prohibit Donald Trump from running again and that we should use the 14th Amendment
[2:54:59.560 --> 2:55:05.240]  and the Take Care Clause to prevent Donald Trump from ever running from president again.
[2:55:05.240 --> 2:55:10.200]  Nancy Pelosi essentially doesn't have a Take Care Clause, but she is given jurisdiction
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:11.880]  over the U.S. Capitol grounds.
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:16.400]  That's why she makes that ridiculous comment about punching Donald Trump, because those
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:17.400]  grounds are hers.
[2:55:17.400 --> 2:55:21.120]  By the separation of powers, she controls those grounds.
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:23.400]  And so my story lays out all the receipts.
[2:55:23.400 --> 2:55:27.440]  I lay out how the Democrats deny that they want National Guard, Trump wants them to have
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:33.600]  National Guard, and here's important distinction, I want everyone to realize, Trump cannot order
[2:55:33.600 --> 2:55:37.600]  the National Guard to go onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:39.680]  He can only pre-authorize it.
[2:55:39.680 --> 2:55:41.240]  He can authorize it.
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:47.120]  Not only did Trump authorize it, he recommended it and he ordered his government to lean
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  on the local government and to lean on the U.S. Capitol and make sure that the offer was
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:55.040]  seen in good faith and the offer was rejected.
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:56:02.280]  So thank God for Trump, we have a paper trail that Mayor Browser and Nancy Pelosi did not
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:04.920]  want an event that was well-coordinated.
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:07.120]  They did not want structured fencing.
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:11.040]  They didn't want to inform organizers about restricted area.
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:14.880]  They did not want a police presence to deter or direct traffic.
[2:56:14.880 --> 2:56:17.760]  They purposely set us up and we've got the goods.
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:22.680]  And that's why Jim Hoff texted me, he said, Ali, your story was viral within 10 minutes.
[2:56:22.680 --> 2:56:28.400]  And so this is the case against Nancy Pelosi, it's the criminal case against Nancy Pelosi.
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:32.720]  Well, and this is why when I look forward to midterms and just do five short minutes
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:36.200]  with me on the other segment, on the other side of this break, we can kind of get into
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:40.160]  your opinion on the midterms, I realize the Democrats are all in.
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:43.720]  And so we can sit here and look at all the anecdotal evidence all around us that there's
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:45.080]  set to be a red wave.
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:51.040]  Folks, you don't understand, they are all in and they know if the Democrats lose Congress,
[2:56:51.040 --> 2:56:54.720]  their entire January 6 fraud is done.
[2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:55.720]  It's done, folks.
[2:56:55.720 --> 2:56:59.960]  You're going to have real Republicans get in there and watch their own investigation,
[2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:04.400]  not just into the January 6 committee, but then further digging into the evidence of
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:08.640]  why Nancy Pelosi stood down the National Guard, why she was able to get a documentary film
[2:57:08.640 --> 2:57:14.600]  crew in her office that day, and why the mayor of DC also stood down the DC police that day.
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:16.440]  Then you'll start to get the real questions.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:18.960]  And they know the only reason they've been able to get away with this is because they
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:21.200]  have full control of the media.
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:23.880]  If the media covers this story, it's game over.
[2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:29.080]  But if the Republicans take back Congress and investigate the Democrats' involvement
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:34.840]  and the Fed's involvement in January 6, not only is it game over, it's criminal investigation
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:37.360]  and charge time, folks.
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:39.680]  Everything hinges on this midterm election.
[2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:42.080]  That's why I'm betting the Democrats are going to steal it.
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:47.880]  We'll get Ali Alexander's opinion on the other side.
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:49.680]  That's our best seller.
[2:57:49.680 --> 2:57:53.480]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:58.040]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:01.960]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:05.400]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[2:58:05.400 --> 2:58:10.840]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:11.840]  function of the body.
[2:58:11.840 --> 2:58:16.640]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[2:58:16.640 --> 2:58:19.200]  need to live and be healthy.
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:21.480]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:23.240]  And so much of the food is debased.
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:28.320]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:29.320]  with a product like this.
[2:58:29.320 --> 2:58:33.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the

[2:59:49.040 --> 2:59:59.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:59.720 --> 3:00:07.120]  All right, my final segment here on the Alex Jones show, by the way, Alex Jones will return
[3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:08.120]  this weekend.
[3:00:08.120 --> 3:00:13.200]  We'll be on the lookout for that at band.video, I am going to be hosting the War Room coming
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:17.240]  up in an hour, it's Veterans Calling Day, we got a couple of great veteran guests, I've
[3:00:17.240 --> 3:00:20.120]  got some other news I'll cover, but we'll be taking a lot of calls on the War Room coming
[3:00:20.120 --> 3:00:21.120]  up in an hour.
[3:00:21.120 --> 3:00:24.600]  Oli Alexander with me, another segment before Jay Dyer takes over here.
[3:00:24.600 --> 3:00:31.040]  Oli, here's where I'm at, now, the Vegas odd, the odds makers in Vegas now have Republicans
[3:00:31.040 --> 3:00:35.760]  at the highest odd so far this year to win the House and Senate.
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:40.800]  I think it's in the 60th percentile now, that huge margin when it comes to Vegas odds for
[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:43.440]  Republicans to win the House and the Senate.
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:46.960]  And of course, all the anecdotal evidence shows us that that will be the case too, just
[3:00:46.960 --> 3:00:50.080]  like in 2020 it did with Trump, but ultimately we saw the results.
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:56.880]  Now here's my fear, I look at this as a Democrat's knowing that they're never going to have
[3:00:56.880 --> 3:01:01.840]  more power than they have right now, and all of their wet dreams of adding two more states
[3:01:01.840 --> 3:01:08.080]  to control the Electoral College, ending the filibuster to stop anybody from disrupting
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:13.840]  their legislative agenda, and just all the other stuff that they're involved in, amnesty,
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:17.760]  open borders, I mean, you name it, they know this is all within arm's reach right now.
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:21.400]  All they need is to secure the midterms, two more years under Biden, they can do it all,
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:24.320]  blaming on Biden, and then they have total control, they'll probably even cancel elections
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:25.320]  if they can.
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:26.640]  I'm not even kidding you folks, they will.
[3:01:26.640 --> 3:01:31.280]  And so, yeah, I see all the polls, yeah, I see the Vegas odds, yeah, I see the anecdotal
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:35.920]  evidence, when I go out in the InfoWars truck and nine out of ten interactions are positive
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:40.360]  now, where it used to be maybe five or six, it's nine out of ten, but I also realize they've
[3:01:40.360 --> 3:01:44.200]  got it all on the table, Democrats are all in right now, of course they're going to try
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:48.440]  to pull off another massive theft like they did in 2020, and then label you a terrorist
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:49.720]  if you say that.
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:55.120]  What do you think, what do you expect here in 11 days at the midterms, Ali Alexander?
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:01:58.760]  You know, it's really tough, you know, I'm certain that the Republicans are going to
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:04.080]  win the House, I think that this has been energized by the voters and not leadership,
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:08.760]  and so if you asked me three weeks ago, I would say that we're going to have a narrow,
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:10.680]  narrow majority.
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:15.040]  The voters kicked into high gear, I think the high gas prices, and the prospect of World
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:21.240]  War III, I think the energy here at Infowars.com has energized people to say, okay, I'm going
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:26.040]  to give you one last chance, Republicans, the Senate races are very interesting because
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:31.840]  you essentially have four seats in play, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, where
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:37.720]  they've tried to do these isolated setups, and what we're seeing with the Pelosi break-in,
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:42.520]  they first tried to implode the Ohio race and get us to dump another $50 million in
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:47.480]  that race and tell us it was closer than it was, we didn't fall for it as a party.
[3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:52.960]  Then they went to Georgia and they pulled this hoax against Herschel Walker, which every
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:56.920]  Georgia needs to vote for, especially Christians and those who are pro-life, they need to vote
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:01.440]  for him and stand with him.
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:04.280]  It's really tough to see what's going to happen in the Senate because the Senate could break
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:05.280]  one way.
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:08.920]  Those four seats could go Republican, those four seats could go Democrat.
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:11.280]  I think they will have a narrow Senate majority.
[3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:13.560]  Here's what I want everyone to kind of strap in for.
[3:03:13.560 --> 3:03:16.240]  The Republican majorities are going to disappoint us.
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:18.200]  They're going to betray Trump.
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:23.480]  As he runs for president of the United States and his announcement is imminent, he's going
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:25.520]  to be pinned against his own party.
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:27.760]  Our party is going to be pinned against us.
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:33.560]  We'll take a lot of the blame, actually, for threats of government shutdown and the economic
[3:03:33.560 --> 3:03:38.000]  meltdown that is coming here in the winter.
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:41.160]  It's a crap show.
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:45.120]  I think that will win, but I think that they're winning so that they can compromise and cook
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:49.640]  McCarthy's speakership. McConnell is going to do all kinds of dirty things to make sure
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:50.640]  that we lose.
[3:03:50.640 --> 3:03:54.720]  In a lot of ways, winning the majority is our biggest problem.
[3:03:54.720 --> 3:03:59.640]  What we got to do is be prepared to hold these people accountable, get a J6 Select Committee
[3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:02.000]  to investigate the previous Select Committee.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:06.560]  We need to dissolve the US Capitol Police units in California and Florida.
[3:04:06.560 --> 3:04:10.600]  We need to release the 14,000 hours of footage.
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:14.960]  We need to have financial sentiments with those whose due process rights have been violated.
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:16.760]  We need to impeach Merrick Garland.
[3:04:16.760 --> 3:04:20.760]  We need to have a short impeachment for Joe Biden, but a long impeachment for Merrick
[3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:23.200]  Garland.
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:27.240]  We've got a lot worked out for us in these midterms, but let there be no doubt.
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:28.440]  Owen Schroyer is right.
[3:04:28.440 --> 3:04:32.600]  The Democrats are going to try to false flag us here in these final weeks.
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:36.360]  Yeah, with just 11 days left, folks, you think it's a coincidence what happened at the Pelosi
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:37.360]  household?
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:38.480]  Somehow, I doubt it.
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:40.000]  Ali Alexander, great stuff.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  Thank you for joining us today.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:44.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Jay Dyer, host the rest of the show.
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:46.280]  And then I'll be back hosting the war room.
[3:04:46.280 --> 3:04:49.920]  It's Veterans Calling Special, so we're going to be hearing from a lot of great veterans,
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:52.160]  and I've got a couple other stacks of news I'll cover.
[3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:55.680]  But Jay Dyer on the other side of this break.
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:05:03.640]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a coworker that's on
[3:05:03.640 --> 3:05:08.120]  drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place, and they need family and friends to come to their
[3:05:08.120 --> 3:05:10.720]  aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:14.320]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:19.000]  It comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people

[3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:03.280]  Welcome back to The Oxygyne.
[3:06:03.280 --> 3:06:09.360]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and today, because it's the spooky season,
[3:06:09.360 --> 3:06:11.320]  it's getting closer to Halloween.
[3:06:11.320 --> 3:06:20.360]  I wanted to talk about the pop culture industries, occult and esoteric and satanic roots.
[3:06:20.360 --> 3:06:24.360]  Now, I've talked about this in the past, but this one, this one's going to be a little
[3:06:24.360 --> 3:06:28.440]  bit different because I want to start with the way that this has affected culture, right?
[3:06:28.440 --> 3:06:30.320]  We all have heard the term culture war.
[3:06:30.320 --> 3:06:36.600]  We know about the idea of battling our conservative or liberal or whatever perspectives in the
[3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:40.800]  social sphere and the culture sphere, and this has been termed the culture war, but
[3:06:40.800 --> 3:06:44.600]  I want to stress and emphasize that you can't really understand this unless you understand
[3:06:44.600 --> 3:06:49.280]  that the principles of the state or the corporate state or the elite controlling culture is
[3:06:49.280 --> 3:06:50.280]  ancient.
[3:06:50.280 --> 3:06:56.120]  It goes back to the ancient world, and I've been teaching a course in philosophy, the
[3:06:56.120 --> 3:07:01.720]  history of philosophy, which that'll be available to the public in a couple months, but over
[3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:08.960]  at Richard Grove of Tragedy and Hope's excellent site, Autonomy, and as an Autonomy course,
[3:07:08.960 --> 3:07:13.280]  we're talking about the history of the Republic, we're talking about Plato, we're talking about,
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:18.280]  we did a four-hour, three- or four-hour in-depth analysis of this, so we go really deep, and
[3:07:18.280 --> 3:07:24.000]  I was reminded that in the Republic of Plato, we have the idea that society has to be run
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:28.120]  in a proto-version of technocracy by a secret society.
[3:07:28.120 --> 3:07:32.960]  Now, in the Republic, it's a philosopher king that pretty much rules everything from on
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:39.480]  high, so it's very autocratic, it's very dictatorial, but in one of Plato's later works, the laws,
[3:07:39.480 --> 3:07:45.200]  he invents this kind of secret council called the Nocturnal Council, and hearkening back
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:49.440]  to the Republic his earlier work, he mentioned that they would have to rule by the noble
[3:07:49.440 --> 3:07:51.440]  lie.
[3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:59.320]  The noble lies is concept that the state has to erect big-scale lies to control the masses,
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:05.160]  so it's sort of a justification for why the state, by any means necessary, has to maintain
[3:08:05.160 --> 3:08:11.280]  control and order, even if that control and order is propped up by intentional, created,
[3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:17.480]  big-scale lies, so we might think that fake news is something modern, but it's actually
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:24.320]  not, it's something that is part of the very apparatus of the mega-state itself to concoct
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:31.720]  big-scale deceptions to hold everybody under one idea or one line or one piece of propaganda.
[3:08:31.720 --> 3:08:38.800]  For example, the British Empire under the Victorian period wholesale adopted Darwinism
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:45.000]  as its mythos, because if you look at Darwin's own writings, his idea is that the British
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:50.240]  Empire is the apex of human evolution, so if you believe the evolutionary narrative
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:54.200]  of that time, you believed it because, well, of course, we're the greatest empire, the
[3:08:54.200 --> 3:09:02.040]  most evolved empire on the planet is our duty to bring civilization to everyone, right?
[3:09:02.040 --> 3:09:07.880]  That was the mythos of the empire, and so likewise this idea of a concocted, contrived,
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:13.320]  and controlled mythos has been the purview of the state throughout all of its history.
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:18.120]  Now, I think that Christianity comes along, I do think Christianity is true, so it doesn't
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:23.000]  rely on a wholesale lies and deception, then if you know the history of the Christian church,
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:28.920]  for example, there were a lot of kings, a lot of rulers, a lot of members of the state
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:33.640]  that tried to alter and change Christianity to fit their own status narrative.
[3:09:33.640 --> 3:09:38.080]  Many emperors persecuted the church and tried to have the theology of the doctrine changed,
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:39.840]  and were never successful.
[3:09:39.840 --> 3:09:45.440]  So I think that there is a unique case here where Christianity does present an authentic
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:53.600]  religious tradition, but in so many cases, pagan empires or even today's modern Western
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:09:59.040]  imperial approach to trying to govern the world involves constructing and concocting
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:06.400]  new myths, and some of the new myths revolve around things like saving the planet and pollution
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:11.600]  and the green agenda and austerity and extinction rebellion and perhaps even something more
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:17.560]  ridiculous like the alien narrative, they might use an alien mythology to try to unify
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:22.200]  everyone or this external threat narrative of some kind.
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:29.360]  So the global government is in the process of trying to concoct its own mythos, its own
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:33.000]  narrative to explain and give everybody some unifying principle.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:37.480]  Aldous Huxley wrote a book called The Prenia Philosophy where he talked about that a kind
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:43.320]  of generic one-size-fits-all global New Age religion could perhaps be the vehicle which
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:45.680]  unifies the entire world.
[3:10:45.680 --> 3:10:50.200]  So the New Age movement, the idea of a one-world religion that's a blending of all the religions,
[3:10:50.200 --> 3:10:54.680]  there's nothing new to that either, that's an old imperial approach in the Roman Empire.
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:10:59.560]  You had the attempt to get everybody to believe one or believe any religion they wanted as
[3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:01.840]  long as they accepted Caesar as divine.
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:05.720]  So the final authority is Caesar, but then you can believe whatever you want.
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:07.880]  Look at that dude's rebel eye, that eye is going wild.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:13.520]  I didn't realize he had such a, so the Brits are known for rebellious anarchy in their
[3:11:13.520 --> 3:11:18.320]  mouth in terms of their teeth, but I guess they have in some cases a rebellious, whole-seeing
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:19.320]  eye as well.
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:25.720]  Well, let's get back into this notion then of the secret society element to this because
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:29.160]  everybody finds this fascinating and they always want to know about secret societies
[3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:34.320]  and the reason I bring that up is because in the case of Plato's Republic, he says
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:38.680]  that there will be kind of the secret society, this inner core group that knows the noble
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:43.920]  eye is in the case and knows that it's for the good of the society.
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:48.720]  And there's so many great parallels between one of the other prominent images in the Republic
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:54.080]  which is the allegory of the cave, this idea that the average Athenian is sort of held
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:12:02.080]  entranced by these images, shadows projected on a cave wall and the philosopher or the
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:06.560]  guy who's appointed to be the truth teller who goes and tells them the truth, that you
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:11.760]  guys are just really entranced by these deceptive shadow images on a cave wall.
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:15.760]  He's actually seen the real sun, the real light and not this manufactured light in
[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:16.760]  the cave.
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:20.600]  He tries to tell them and they get mad and they've lost their reasoning faculty and
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:26.720]  they want to kill him and this is the allegory of the cave which is intended to elucidate
[3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:30.920]  this principle behind platonic theology and platonic metaphysics.
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:38.400]  But it's applicable perfectly to today's Hollywood, Matrix, Netflix society, right?
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:45.600]  It's the exact same kind of illusory reality and it's just as dominated by inner secret
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:51.480]  society cults as the ancient world was or as the empires were or even as Plato himself
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:12:57.640]  says which is a kind of an ironic contradiction that Plato has this idea that the philosopher
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:02.960]  comes to the cave to try to awaken people, to try to wake them up and lighten them and
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:07.280]  yet at the same time Plato believes that most people aren't going to wake up and so the
[3:13:07.280 --> 3:13:12.400]  Republic of Plato requires this big lie, this inner core elite group that's going to run
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:14.880]  it together with the philosopher king.
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:17.960]  So what about Hollywood though?
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:23.400]  Well Hollywood is very similar to this kind of a mechanism and this would be all of pop
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:29.440]  culture really, the whole, the cathedral that is pop culture because it's really borrowing
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:33.640]  from a lot of the ancient occult and esoteric mystery school ideas.
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:38.880]  So for example, most Hollywood films that are in some way dealing with God or the divine
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:42.640]  or something like this, they're very Gnostic in their theology and what I mean by that
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:48.480]  is that they present the idea of an evil creator God who's imprisoned us and that through
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:53.840]  the right amount of Gnosis or knowledge we can escape this world, you know something
[3:13:53.840 --> 3:13:58.560]  like simulation theory or the matrix, everybody thinks of the matrix as the classic example
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:04.720]  of this and it's fine to see an analogy in some of these movies like the matrix telling
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:07.560]  us about waking up out of a deceptive system.
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:12.520]  But if we think that the world really is a prison then we have some problems in a lot
[3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:15.280]  of our approaches to ethics and morals.
[3:14:15.280 --> 3:14:20.480]  And the left and that's what I want to get to today and how modern leftism really comes
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:26.960]  out of this counterculture Hollywood scene and Hollywood ideology in the music industry
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:27.960]  as well.
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:33.280]  It's all part of the same superstructure is itself kind of an initiation process into
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:37.640]  an inversion of everything that is good, everything that is truth, everything that is beautiful,
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:39.320]  everything that is justice, etc.
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:45.680]  This is an initiation process, a counter initiation into something very deceptive, destructive
[3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:51.760]  and only serves the ends of the oligarchical elite and perhaps even something beyond a
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:58.080]  satanic being or entity who is the source of evil in the world, who is the source of
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:03.120]  the deception and the darkness and the delusion and the desire to destroy, to kill, what does
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:04.120]  Jesus say, right?
[3:15:04.120 --> 3:15:09.120]  The thief comes to steal, kill and destroy and he's talking there about the devil.
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.120]  Now I'm not being a prudish sort of a puritan here, I'm not saying it's wrong to watch movies,
[3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:17.120]  I'm not saying it's wrong to, you know, be into the arts.
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:21.360]  I mean the history of western civilization, the history of Byzantine civilization was
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:22.760]  very much into the arts.
[3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:26.320]  There's a lot of beautiful art, it doesn't have to be religious art, it can be all kinds
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:27.320]  of different things.
[3:15:27.320 --> 3:15:31.880]  But there has to be some strictures and some ideas as to what constitutes beauty in an
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:32.880]  objective sense.
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:37.800]  It can't be totally relativized because when it's totally relativized that only suggests
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:41.240]  or conveys the idea that there is no truth, there is no beauty, there is no goodness,
[3:15:41.240 --> 3:15:44.320]  there is no justice, it's all relative to the individual.
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:49.400]  So we're going to talk about the philosophy of leftism first and how its modern versions
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:15:54.600]  come out of this matrix of Hollywood and secret societies.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:58.160]  Don't go anywhere, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:03.080]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:16:03.080 --> 3:16:09.600]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America but the world.
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:15.120]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:16.120]  deserve the credit.
[3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:21.080]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who've supported M4s are the real
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:23.640]  reason you've had the success.
[3:16:23.640 --> 3:16:28.400]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:29.400]  had.
[3:16:29.400 --> 3:16:35.720]  We're now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:39.680]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:42.560]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:48.200]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[3:16:48.200 --> 3:16:52.080]  now because we are over the target and this street is happening.
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:56.880]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:17:02.800]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[3:17:02.800 --> 3:17:08.160]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[3:17:08.160 --> 3:17:12.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  to speak freely.
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:16.200]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[3:17:16.200 --> 3:17:17.680]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:21.840]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:26.160]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:27.160]  your support.
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:30.280]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:34.760]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:38.400]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:40.080]  because of your past support.
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:43.880]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[3:20:04.560 --> 3:20:15.280]  Welcome back to the House Jones Show, I wanted to give a brief, this is Jay Dyer, I also
[3:20:15.280 --> 3:20:21.160]  wanted to give a brief discussion of how the left got to being so crazy, kind of a philosophical
[3:20:21.160 --> 3:20:26.400]  demolishing and presuppositional critique of leftism, and why are they so crazy, why
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:30.640]  do they act the way they do, you know, where you go to a campus and they just start screaming
[3:20:30.640 --> 3:20:35.040]  and they're yelling in your face, and you're trying to reason with them, and they don't
[3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:38.680]  care about your facts, your logic, your reasoning, right?
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:39.680]  Why is it that way?
[3:20:39.680 --> 3:20:44.080]  Well, we have to understand that the origins of revolutionary leftism, liberalism in the
[3:20:44.080 --> 3:20:50.160]  way that we think of it today, does have a specific ideological lineage and origin, and
[3:20:50.160 --> 3:20:53.960]  a lot of things could be pointed to, but in my assessment, overall, what we're looking
[3:20:53.960 --> 3:21:02.720]  at is a latest stage manifestation of earlier versions of revolutionary positions and revolutionary
[3:21:02.720 --> 3:21:09.280]  ideas that have just sort of morphed in their own way to trying to, in a way, be consistent,
[3:21:09.280 --> 3:21:13.200]  but this is ironic because this whole position does not actually believe that there is such
[3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:15.480]  a thing as logic and objective truth.
[3:21:15.480 --> 3:21:22.520]  So the first thing we want to note is that leftism specifically does not believe that
[3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:24.520]  there is truth.
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:29.920]  One of the most famous modern leftist thinkers and philosophers and literary critics, actually,
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:34.960]  his name's Umberto Eco, and he wrote that famous novel, The Name of the Rose, which
[3:21:34.960 --> 3:21:43.080]  has Sean Connery, and the movie version has Sean Connery in Christian Slater, he's always
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:47.720]  trying to act like Jack Nicholson as monks, this is not very believable, these two people
[3:21:47.720 --> 3:21:53.480]  as monks, but the story revolves around them going to be basically two detectives at a
[3:21:53.480 --> 3:21:57.480]  monastery in the Middle Ages where there was a murder, and there's a lot of occultic
[3:21:57.480 --> 3:22:03.200]  and esoteric elements going on, as is usually the case in Echo's novels, but the story ends
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:08.280]  with a spoiler alert with the monastery basically burning down, and it's representative for
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:13.480]  the entire ancient and medieval view that there is such a thing as truth, and when the
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:19.080]  monastery burns down, the basic point is that there really isn't anything divine or
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:24.640]  supernatural at all going on, it's all just another kind of a trick or deception.
[3:22:24.640 --> 3:22:31.440]  So the odd thing here is that leftism begins with or has had this tendency in history to
[3:22:31.440 --> 3:22:37.920]  be conspiratorial, and so it has this tendency to think that there's really just a constant
[3:22:37.920 --> 3:22:43.360]  conspiracy going on of the elites tricking everybody, and we kind of see that in Plato
[3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:48.800]  where that's admitted, but at the same time, while they're on a crusade for freedom or
[3:22:48.800 --> 3:22:53.440]  for liberty for truth, so they say, they're also admitting that there is no such thing
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:59.400]  as freedom, liberty, or truth, those things don't actually objectively exist, and Echo
[3:22:59.400 --> 3:23:05.920]  himself has a famous essay that he wrote called Ur Fascism, which is what's the idea of perpetual
[3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:10.000]  fascism, what does that mean? And he says that, you know, the battle of the leftist,
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:16.680]  talking about himself and everybody as a leftist, he says it's not principally against political
[3:23:16.680 --> 3:23:22.720]  positions or fascism in a political sense. He says the real battle of the leftist is
[3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:29.600]  ideological, philosophical, and it pertains to the war against truth itself, so he's
[3:23:29.600 --> 3:23:38.840]  a much more self-cognizant, self-aware, leftist philosopher, thinker, semiotician, fiction
[3:23:38.840 --> 3:23:45.000]  writer, professor, et cetera, by noting that guys, we're not really in a war against political
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:49.200]  factions, we're in a war against the idea that there even is a thing called truth at
[3:23:49.200 --> 3:23:55.760]  all, and that helps us to understand, you know, classic left manuals, you know, like
[3:23:55.760 --> 3:24:01.520]  Saul Olinsky, right, rules for radicals, where there's a principle of revolution for
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:07.120]  revolution's sake. A lot of the Marxists, for example, they would talk about critique
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:15.120]  and revolution for critique's sake, and so what characterizes the tendency of revolutionary
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:21.920]  and leftist ideology, modus operandi, the praxis, is a war ultimately against the idea
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:28.360]  of truth itself. There's a great book by a orthodox priest and philosopher, Fr. Serfam
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:35.320]  Rose, which I did a lecture on here in the fourth hour a couple years ago, called Nihilism
[3:24:35.320 --> 3:24:41.280]  of the Roots of the Modern Revolution, and in that book, Fr. Serfam Rose classifies and
[3:24:41.280 --> 3:24:48.640]  characterizes the historical stages of revolutionary leftism, and the final stage beyond the attempt
[3:24:48.640 --> 3:24:54.840]  to enact the universal ideals that a lot of leftists at some point perhaps believed in
[3:24:54.840 --> 3:24:58.040]  or professed to believe in or thought that they were championing. He says it kind of
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:02.440]  collapses because they realize that, wait a minute, I'm trying to impose an idea on
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:07.560]  other people, but I don't believe in imposing ideas on other people, so wait a minute. And
[3:25:07.560 --> 3:25:14.240]  who, of course, does that book have its dedication to? Well, none other than Lucifer or Satan
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:20.600]  himself, the first revolutionary, the first rebel, the first challenger, who said supposedly,
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:29.080]  at least it's attributed in Milton, that he would rather reign in hell and be a servant
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:38.200]  in heaven. So this idea that revolution can occur and achieve perfect equality, perfect
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:46.360]  egalitarianism for everybody is totally delusional. It's absolutely impossible, and I think smarter
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:51.440]  leftists and the money that's typically behind leftism and socialism, these kinds of revolutionary
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:57.680]  ideas, they're pretty much self-aware. They're smart enough to realize that you cannot achieve
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:26:04.000]  total and absolute equality, and that would actually lead to a kind of dystopian nightmare.
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:07.960]  But some of the people who believe this kind of stuff are fine with a dystopian nightmare.
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:14.360]  So there's actually this sort of, as Father Rose points out, this implicit self-destructive
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:23.080]  motivation in revolutionary nihilism and leftism. It ends up not just in wanting to promote ideals,
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:30.560]  but in wanting to destroy for the sake of destruction. And in that sense, there is a
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:34.840]  demonic motivation that's going on here, even, I'm not saying that every leftist is
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:39.080]  literally possessed, although some of them seem to be demonstrating the manifestations
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:42.600]  of actual demonic possession now, because again, these things go in stages. So you kind
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:48.440]  of reach this final phase of liberal revolutionary leftism, nihilism, or whatever, where you're
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:53.000]  just possessed, and not only do you try to kill everybody, but you also will your own
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:27:02.920]  destruction, suicide, or suicide on a cultural scale. And that is the motivation and modus
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:11.800]  operandi of the demonic side of leftism. And that's what you're seeing today. This
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:18.120]  notion that, and it's such a powerful controlling delusion, that not only do you have to negate
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:24.040]  and destroy and tear down everything else, why not also tear down yourself? Because it
[3:27:24.040 --> 3:27:31.080]  ends up being not just a battle against externals. At a certain point, the leftist believes that
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:36.520]  not only is everything oppressing him and must everything be torn down, he himself exists
[3:27:36.520 --> 3:27:40.920]  as part of this world and part of the structure, and he can't completely remove himself from
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:45.560]  the world from everything outside of him that is supposedly oppressing him and is the source
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:51.160]  of his ills. Doesn't it seem to logically fall within that suicide is the next logical
[3:27:51.160 --> 3:27:55.440]  step? And believe it or not, there have been many left philosophers who have actually argued
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:28:02.440]  that. I'm not kidding. Some of the famous existentialist philosophers notoriously radical
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:09.280]  leftists actually made the logical philosophical case for killing yourself and committing suicide,
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:14.760]  that that was the final and most true pure revolutionary act. Well, I don't know why
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:18.760]  we're supposed to be pure in any of these systems because there is no such thing as
[3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:23.680]  purity. There is no such thing as logic or consistency. There's no morals or standards
[3:28:23.680 --> 3:28:29.600]  that anyone is bound to. So it makes no sense. But that's precisely why it is a fundamental
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:38.400]  self-destructive contradiction. And so understand that leftism is a power oppressor narrative
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:44.040]  and nothing to do with truth and falsehood. Truth and falsehood, according to the leftist
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:50.800]  approach and their tweeting and their journalism and their media, those are only weapons and
[3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:54.640]  they're interchangeable with the opponents. More on this when we get back. This is the
[3:28:54.640 --> 3:29:24.480]  Alex Jones show.
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:43.480]  Welcome everyone.
[3:29:43.480 --> 3:30:01.680]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[3:30:01.680 --> 3:30:06.200]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[3:30:06.200 --> 3:30:08.880]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:30:08.880 --> 3:30:12.520]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:30:12.520 --> 3:30:17.200]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[3:30:17.200 --> 3:30:21.160]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.

[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:11.640]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[3:32:11.640 --> 3:32:15.160]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[3:32:15.160 --> 3:32:16.160]  It's came over.
[3:32:16.160 --> 3:32:21.160]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[3:32:21.160 --> 3:32:26.360]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[3:32:26.360 --> 3:32:31.560]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com

[3:32:57.720 --> 3:33:04.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:04.160 --> 3:33:22.160]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, this is your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:24.160]  We're talking about the destruction and self negation that occurred in the arts and how
[3:33:24.160 --> 3:33:28.000]  this is part of a cultural warfare that is more than just, you know, this or that think
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:32.000]  tank or that foundation or whatever or money to group.
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:36.320]  It's actually a spiritual battle that goes back a long time and the difference being
[3:33:36.320 --> 3:33:41.000]  that it has now been more or less scientifically perfected and weaponized and speaking of the
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:47.080]  toxic culture that is a form of psychological warfare and I was going into the history of
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:53.320]  how we got to where we are in terms of liberal philosophy, revolutionary philosophy, leftism
[3:33:53.320 --> 3:33:56.320]  and we talked in the last segment about how there is no objective truth.
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:33:59.040]  Truth is purely relative in their view.
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:03.760]  So we want to understand this because, again, a lot of people interact with radicalists
[3:34:03.760 --> 3:34:08.480]  on Twitter or their family members at Thanksgiving dinner and whatever and they're mystified.
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:09.760]  Why aren't you listening to reason?
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:11.200]  You're not listening to the logic.
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:16.560]  Well, we saw this kind of completely go out the window, I would say around 2015-16 when
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:20.880]  people would go to demonstrations, you know, Trump demonstrations or Trump rallies or whatever
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:26.000]  and leftists were throwing feces, they're throwing urine, they're throwing bike locks
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  at your face.
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:29.760]  They're not interested in your facts and logic.
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:30.920]  How do we get to that point?
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:36.520]  Well, again, there's this impetus, there's this motivation that either progresses over
[3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:42.360]  time and gets worse and worse and worse or we begin to come to our senses, we repent,
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:45.960]  we have a change of heart, change of mind by God's grace or something like this that
[3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:50.360]  moves us more in the direction of truth or we move away into this direction of more and
[3:34:50.360 --> 3:34:53.200]  more self-destruction.
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:57.760]  And so you have to understand that for a lot of the left, they have capitulated into believing
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:34:59.440]  in self-destruction.
[3:34:59.440 --> 3:35:05.560]  They're fine with sterilization, euthanasia, cult of death, right?
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:08.000]  Culture of death, all of that, they're fine with that.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:13.520]  And so apart from, you know, a big event that causes repentance of people's hearts or something
[3:35:13.520 --> 3:35:17.520]  like that, you're not going to convince these people with logic.
[3:35:17.520 --> 3:35:22.320]  Because they have surrendered their reasoning faculty and it is possible to do that and they're
[3:35:22.320 --> 3:35:25.200]  not going to listen to reason anymore.
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:28.600]  And so it's very unfortunate because so many people are given over to this, right?
[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:34.720]  It's a kind of a delusion, it's a kind of an irrational, just a completely berserker
[3:35:34.720 --> 3:35:39.680]  kind of state that they go into, they're triggered and they become these sort of frothing, demonic
[3:35:39.680 --> 3:35:45.120]  creatures and you can't reason with them and you're never going to reason with them.
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:49.880]  And so we got to that point because of the tearing down of structures, the tearing down
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:55.960]  of everything which is perceived to be in their distorted minds the source of their troubles.
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:36:00.160]  And so there's this weird impulse amongst the left or leftist revolutionary thought and
[3:36:00.160 --> 3:36:02.400]  thinking to be messianic.
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:06.240]  And you said, well, but they don't believe in God, they're kind of, you know, weird
[3:36:06.240 --> 3:36:08.160]  and why would they be messianic?
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:11.600]  Well, if you don't believe in God and you don't believe in the transcendent or any of
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:15.760]  these kinds of principles, what typically happens is that you then sort of out of your
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:22.080]  own ego and narcissistic impulse, believe that it's your job now as a revolutionary activist
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:28.160]  to save the planet, to save everyone, to bring freedom, liberation and all these things.
[3:36:28.160 --> 3:36:33.000]  So you say, but the irony is that, first of all, as we said in the last segment, what
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:35.880]  are these principles that you're fighting for?
[3:36:35.880 --> 3:36:37.840]  What is the freedom that you're fighting for?
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:39.240]  Liberty to what?
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:40.240]  Freedom from what?
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:42.960]  Well, what are the things you're fighting for?
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:46.400]  Get free will, freedom to do anything.
[3:36:46.400 --> 3:36:48.400]  So it's completely inconsistent.
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:52.880]  There's no logical consistent reasoning or basis on the leftist worldview as to why you
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:54.920]  would want to do these things.
[3:36:54.920 --> 3:36:59.520]  Because they turn around and say that everybody who doesn't follow this version of leftism
[3:36:59.520 --> 3:37:03.520]  as a fascist is intolerant.
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:08.600]  And then they want to beat you into submission for their position.
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:13.600]  Now again, as we said, they know, I think deep down, that that's not consistent.
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:15.120]  It's a contradiction.
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:17.160]  But they don't care that they contradict.
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:21.120]  Because remember, in this worldview, there's no such thing as truth or falsehood.
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:27.240]  Truth and falsehood are just weapons of warfare that are used because in their view, everything
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:30.080]  is just oppressor oppressed narratives.
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:31.640]  That's it.
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:36.200]  And so the way that you win in this kind of a battle isn't really having the truth on
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:38.080]  your side because there is no truth.
[3:37:38.080 --> 3:37:40.600]  It's all just oppressor oppressed narratives.
[3:37:40.600 --> 3:37:45.800]  And that's why they have moved into this new phase now, where from their perspective, logic
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:53.280]  and math are Western patriarchal narratives that are created to oppress people.
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:38:00.880]  I mean, that is so absurd that it's almost like mind boggling to argue against that.
[3:38:00.880 --> 3:38:05.800]  Because it is so self evidently absurd and self-refuting.
[3:38:05.800 --> 3:38:09.320]  Because they're using logic and reasoning to say there is no logic and reasoning at
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:10.320]  all.
[3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:12.120]  And they don't even realize that much of it, right?
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:14.920]  And so if you were to try to explain it to them, they don't care.
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:20.920]  And they're only interested in turning everything into a power oppressor guilt narrative, you
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:21.920]  see.
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:28.280]  So it's all just a weapon to try to use guilt as a way to psychologically manipulate you
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:36.080]  into cowering, submitting, feeling bad, and then they feel like they have power, right?
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:41.720]  So it's a grasping for power is really what all of this amounts to.
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:45.520]  Because they really believe that everything is just power narratives and that comes out
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:52.800]  of a lot of sociologists in the last century who did sociological analysis of power oppressor
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:53.800]  narratives.
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:57.360]  Many of them were Marxist and they were couching it in a class warfare struggle.
[3:38:57.360 --> 3:39:03.880]  Well, that class warfare struggle narrative has pretty much collapsed into postmodernism,
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:09.680]  which many of the left adopted this idea that there isn't really any truth or false.
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:15.160]  So there are no grand narratives and even classical liberalism and classical enlightenment,
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:18.560]  universal ideas, that there's a universal justice, that there's a universal liberty that
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:23.400]  man should strive for, universal morals that everyone should strive for from these enlightenment
[3:39:23.400 --> 3:39:27.080]  philosophers like Kant, right, the categorical imperative of Kant.
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:31.680]  Now that's even been deconstructed because remember, leftism is about constantly critiquing
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:36.320]  and deconstructing everything, even the leftism of the generation before you.
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:42.840]  Culture critique that is one of the Frankfurt School mottos of critical theory.
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:47.400]  Never ending struggle, right, Mao, Lenin, they both talked about that, for example.
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:49.520]  So you have to constantly tear down.
[3:39:49.520 --> 3:39:55.000]  You can never stop tearing down, but the logic of that means that everything must be torn
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:57.880]  down, even the new left themselves.
[3:39:57.880 --> 3:40:02.920]  Every generation of leftists must destroy the previous generation of leftists.
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:10.480]  So it's preposterous, it's insane, it's a mad, it's a philosophy of madness, but they
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:15.440]  don't care because as soon as you try to point that out, they don't care because they're
[3:40:15.440 --> 3:40:24.480]  impelled by more than ideology, but by this kind of spirit that they partake of which
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:27.840]  impels them to self-destruction.
[3:40:27.840 --> 3:40:34.320]  It's an enslaving spirit to the passions, and I don't mean passions in a romanticist
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:39.400]  sense of passionate plays or artworks, no, I'm talking about the passions in the ancient
[3:40:39.400 --> 3:40:44.120]  sense, the ancient world, the way Plato or some of the Orthodox Church fathers spoke
[3:40:44.120 --> 3:40:47.960]  of the passions as vices that enslave us.
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:52.600]  The only thing a lot of these leftists are willing to fight for and die for, the only
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:58.000]  thing they stand for is their degenerate addictions to various passions, and I'm not just calling
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:03.200]  them out because all of us struggle with the passions, it's a feature of human existence
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:04.200]  due to the fall.
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:09.400]  We're all going to be battling the vices, but the more that you capitulate to the vices,
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:16.160]  I'm saying, the more that you become enslaved and the more that ironically, wealthy, powerful
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:23.840]  elites can use vices to enslave an entire people, and that's that psychological warfare
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:25.760]  element that is a big part of this.
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:30.800]  So we've seen that leftism inherently tears down, and not just tears down all the structures
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:34.200]  in the previous generation of leftists before them, but it has to tear down ultimately even
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:40.200]  the self, and this is how leftism transforms into post-humanism.
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:48.400]  After the left adopted the idea of post-modernism, that everything is really just oppressor, oppressive
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:54.600]  narratives in terms of who had the best story and who had the most power, it becomes a kind
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:41:57.560]  of a Nietzschean thing, ironically.
[3:41:57.560 --> 3:42:03.320]  Then it becomes a situation where now the problem isn't political ideologies, the problem
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:09.720]  isn't leftism, conservativism, problem isn't fascism, capitalism, the problem is man
[3:42:09.720 --> 3:42:11.280]  himself.
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:15.200]  Humanity is the problem, that is the most advanced version of the leftist philosophy,
[3:42:15.200 --> 3:42:21.680]  and that is why they are all too a man, anti-human, anti-natalist, and believe that humanity itself
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:26.560]  must be overcome for all of these problems to be solved.
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:34.480]  You see the dark logic, and now this is 100% obviously a satanic agenda, that the humankind
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:38.240]  needs to be gotten rid of, you see, that's the logic of their system, that's what they
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:42.440]  actually say, all of these post-humanists, transhumanists, they are the most advanced
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:48.080]  form of the leftist revolutionary self-negating philosophy.
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:52.160]  In the next segment when we come back we're going to talk about how this manifested in
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:57.000]  movies and pop culture in a cult Hollywood, don't go anywhere.
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:02.160]  It's our best seller, we first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller,
[3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:07.320]  but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it feel and
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:11.800]  how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller, and it's
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:14.560]  been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.

[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:38.600]  critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.

[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:05.480]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist, I have come from nowhere to the
[3:44:05.480 --> 3:44:11.360]  very heights of politics not just in America, but in the world, we are engaging the globalist
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:17.360]  at point like range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit, yes I've persevered,
[3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:23.480]  but the listeners and viewers who support infill wars are the real reason you have the success.
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:28.880]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever had.
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:35.600]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:39.560]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[3:44:39.560 --> 3:44:42.120]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify it.

[3:44:56.640 --> 3:45:02.800]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.

[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:12.080]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:16.520]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over, and
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:22.480]  all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back, and our main
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:26.800]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[3:46:57.280 --> 3:47:10.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:11.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:12.720]  I'm your guest.
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:13.720]  That's Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:47:13.720 --> 3:47:20.680]  We were just covering the history of revolutionary self-destruction and how radical leftism
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:24.000]  is a tool to further the overdrive window.
[3:47:24.000 --> 3:47:27.260]  This is another point I wanted to get to that I didn't get to, which is that a lot of people
[3:47:27.260 --> 3:47:33.720]  wonder, well, nobody really follows these radical eco groups or the extinction rebellion
[3:47:33.720 --> 3:47:34.720]  people.
[3:47:34.720 --> 3:47:42.040]  They look ridiculous, but their purpose is actually move the center more to the left.
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:43.040]  That's their purpose.
[3:47:43.040 --> 3:47:49.040]  I think a lot of oligarchical elite know that these radical environmentalists, the radical
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:54.160]  green people, the animal rights, the vegans, and these kinds of people, when they do their
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:48:01.440]  approaches, when they do these kinds of things, it's not that the elite believe that the majority
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:06.280]  of the population is actually going to come to believe those radical views, but the purpose
[3:48:06.280 --> 3:48:14.480]  of the radical pushing the line even further out, even if they look fringe, is that what
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:19.520]  that does is it has the effect of making what is the center position, the logical, quote,
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:25.160]  center's position be more main, more towards the left, you see.
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:28.760]  That's the whole purpose of those kinds of groups is to just, as many of you probably
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:32.160]  know, move the Overton window.
[3:48:32.160 --> 3:48:38.440]  That's just an example of how these groups are used by very wealthy, very powerful people
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:46.560]  who have more or less adopted a completely anti-human, a completely anti-natalist type
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:49.720]  of position, most of the wealthy elite.
[3:48:49.720 --> 3:48:54.200]  We see a little bit of a kind of a reaction to this, I guess, in some of today's billionaires
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:59.480]  with some of the news that's coming out, but for the most part, the majority of the zillionaire-billionaire
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:06.520]  class, they're completely anti-human, they're completely 100% on board with, and the major
[3:49:06.520 --> 3:49:10.960]  promoters and funders of the gray reset transhumanist agenda.
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:13.640]  But where did this really come into the culture?
[3:49:13.640 --> 3:49:19.440]  Was it the 60s, was it the music industry, was it Hollywood, it was all of these things.
[3:49:19.440 --> 3:49:26.440]  And one of the key figures that, for whatever reason, I mean, I have my theories that Hollywood
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:31.240]  was able to do this was by their acceptance of a Crowleyan type of philosophy.
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:36.000]  Now not everybody in Hollywood was into Alistair Crowley or 100% adopted his philosophy, but
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:42.920]  he did seem to, in a weird way, become this counterculture ahead of time icon, and I believe
[3:49:42.920 --> 3:49:47.320]  that it was because of his connections and associations with British intelligence, and
[3:49:47.320 --> 3:49:55.440]  that kind of thrust him into being this potential figure to use as a counterculture icon, and
[3:49:55.440 --> 3:50:01.280]  as somebody who would push the Overton window way, way, way, way ahead back in his day.
[3:50:01.280 --> 3:50:06.840]  So he was kind of one of these pioneering radical figures from an optics perspective
[3:50:06.840 --> 3:50:11.440]  back in his day as the most famous, you know, Satanist in the world.
[3:50:11.440 --> 3:50:16.520]  And so, you know, today's eco-radical types of people, in a way, are kind of like him
[3:50:16.520 --> 3:50:25.040]  in that they're used, again, to push the narrative into a centrist liberal perspective,
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:26.040]  you see.
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:30.400]  So even though not everybody in Crowley's day accepted the radical things that he was
[3:50:30.400 --> 3:50:38.520]  teaching and promoting and doing, nowadays, what he did is seen as the norm.
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:43.240]  And so it's very possible, if we continue to slide into chaos and self-destruction,
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:50.560]  that the crazy stuff that the Extinction Rebellion people are doing in 50, 40 years
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:56.080]  will be the norm then, right, will be in full on total technocratic dystopia.
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:00.000]  But if you doubt any of what I'm talking about, you'll notice that I've done many interviews
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:03.840]  in the past with people in this domain, and I did a specific, really long interview with
[3:51:03.840 --> 3:51:09.520]  Dr. Richard Spence, the famous academic who wrote a text called Secret Agent 666, where
[3:51:09.520 --> 3:51:15.680]  he shows the history of Crowley as a MI5 British intelligence asset.
[3:51:15.680 --> 3:51:20.880]  And so that could be part of the reason why he was used in this cultural war as well.
[3:51:20.880 --> 3:51:25.640]  So a lot of the theology and the ideas that Crowley had were very revolutionary and were
[3:51:25.640 --> 3:51:30.600]  very into sexual promiscuity and degeneracy, for example.
[3:51:30.600 --> 3:51:37.080]  So this idea of inverting and turning sexuality into a completely different tool for society
[3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:40.520]  than what it was seen to be, you know, the means of propagating the species, the means
[3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:44.800]  of having a relationship between a man and a woman, and et cetera, a loving relationship.
[3:51:44.800 --> 3:51:51.680]  For this, for Crowley, it becomes a means of power and dominance and self-aggrandizement
[3:51:51.680 --> 3:51:56.840]  to the point of apotheosis or the individual becoming God, that's his approach to it.
[3:51:56.840 --> 3:52:04.800]  Now, in modern society, sexuality has been successfully divorced for most people from
[3:52:04.800 --> 3:52:08.520]  the classical traditional means of what it's used for, and I mean this in the sense of
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:12.360]  Western Christian civilization when I say traditional or classical.
[3:52:12.360 --> 3:52:17.880]  And a lot of the figures who were counter-cultural icons, the people that promoted and expanded
[3:52:17.880 --> 3:52:23.680]  LSD, for example, somebody like Timothy Leary, well, if you read Timothy Leary's books, he
[3:52:23.680 --> 3:52:27.760]  talks about how great Crowley was and how great, how influential Alistair Crowley was
[3:52:27.760 --> 3:52:38.360]  on him in putting out LSD to everybody with the assistance of the CIA to initiate people.
[3:52:38.360 --> 3:52:44.620]  That's the terminology used not just by Timothy Leary, but also by people like Terrence McKenna
[3:52:44.620 --> 3:52:50.640]  to initiate people into a new way of thinking, a new paradigm, a new esoteric and occultic.
[3:52:50.640 --> 3:52:55.360]  He even, they even call it, both of them at times, a shamanic initiation ritual.
[3:52:55.360 --> 3:52:58.960]  Terrence McKenna, for example, in Food of the God says, we're going to have to initiate
[3:52:58.960 --> 3:53:06.120]  everybody into a kind of shamanic religion that gets rid of the patriarchal religions
[3:53:06.120 --> 3:53:07.800]  of the past.
[3:53:07.800 --> 3:53:08.800]  That's literally what he says.
[3:53:08.800 --> 3:53:16.840]  So, Logos religion, a religion of objective truth, reason, of a patriarchal tradition
[3:53:16.840 --> 3:53:25.320]  has to be destroyed, torn down, and dispensed with through a Dionysian Bacchanalian return.
[3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:30.680]  Again, the terms used by Terrence McKenna himself.
[3:53:30.680 --> 3:53:39.120]  If we return to a kind of frenzy, a kind of shamanic initiation centered around the forces
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:46.160]  of nature, the mother goddess, that's his terms again, not mine, and possession, literal
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:51.960]  possession by the spirits of nature, the spirits of ayahuasca, the spirits of LSD, the spirits
[3:53:51.960 --> 3:53:59.400]  of all of these kinds of drugs, that will initiate us into a more humane, a more ecologically
[3:53:59.400 --> 3:54:04.720]  oriented society where we honor Mother Gaia, where we honor Mother Earth, where we don't
[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:10.200]  engage in warfare, these kinds of, this is what these people talk.
[3:54:10.200 --> 3:54:13.400]  Now, their own lives, of course, don't reflect that at all, right?
[3:54:13.400 --> 3:54:16.600]  All of these people were completely degenerates and did whatever the heck they wanted to,
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:24.840]  so they didn't do what they preached, right, at least in most regards.
[3:54:24.840 --> 3:54:30.200]  But what they did succeed in doing was through the idea of liberation and freedom, again,
[3:54:30.200 --> 3:54:34.200]  which we never define, we never know exactly what those things are, they did succeed in
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:44.080]  unleashing toxic culture that more or less enslaved future generations.
[3:54:44.080 --> 3:54:49.520]  And so nobody could conceive, for example, in, say, the 1960s of, you know, Marilyn
[3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:54.520]  Manson and the kinds of concerts that he put on in the 90s, right, in the 1960s.
[3:54:54.520 --> 3:55:03.320]  But if you had to have the 1960s and, you know, the church of Satan, for example, in
[3:55:03.320 --> 3:55:08.520]  San Francisco, Anton Levet, which is, again, kind of a theatrical Hollywood-connected puppet
[3:55:08.520 --> 3:55:13.520]  show in a way, to be out there in the culture to, again, begin to warm people up to this
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:14.520]  kind of an idea.
[3:55:14.520 --> 3:55:21.840]  And so a few generations later, you can have Marilyn Manson in the 1990s doing very outrageous
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:27.920]  and sort of culturally, socially provocative things, which the Satanists themselves call
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:31.960]  theater a brutality or a form of aesthetic warfare.
[3:55:31.960 --> 3:55:36.200]  So their cognizant of those things being a kind of initiation.
[3:55:36.200 --> 3:55:40.720]  The 1960s occultists and esoteric boomers said that what they were doing was a kind
[3:55:40.720 --> 3:55:42.960]  of ritual initiation.
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:48.840]  And then by today's pop culture, you have just the next phase of this initiatory process
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:53.880]  into a return to total paganism and total enslavement.
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:55:59.080]  So the irony is that none of what is being sold to everyone, again, you had, for example,
[3:55:59.080 --> 3:56:02.840]  in Hollywood, all of these figures who were the auteurs and the avant-garde people like
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:09.320]  Kenneth Anger promoting all the Crowley and Satanic stuff in their films, a generation
[3:56:09.320 --> 3:56:13.800]  or two have had of what's in Hollywood now, which is totally satanic, openly, right?
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:18.120]  For so long, people talked about this and you were gaslighted, oh, you're crazy, you're
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:23.160]  a satanic panic, that was a stupid thing in the 80s that Christians made up.
[3:56:23.160 --> 3:56:27.520]  Well, there might have been some crazy stuff that Christians and evangelicals made up in
[3:56:27.520 --> 3:56:28.600]  the 1980s.
[3:56:28.600 --> 3:56:33.920]  But there really were satanic cults and movements and the culture was being engineered and moved
[3:56:33.920 --> 3:56:34.920]  in this direction.
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:40.120]  The very founders of the counterculture themselves said that they liked and were very into and
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:45.760]  immersed in the satanic and that could be anything from Anton Leves to Michael Aquino
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:46.760]  to Alistair Crowley.
[3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:51.080]  It could mean any of those things.
[3:56:51.080 --> 3:56:53.840]  So you have to understand that this is a warfare on you.
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:57:00.280]  This is a warfare on family, on the principles of truth, beauty and justice themselves, in
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:02.720]  the minds of these people, those things don't exist.
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:07.440]  And in their mind, the destruction that they will bring in their great cleansing, their
[3:57:07.440 --> 3:57:11.280]  calling, their cataclysm, the chlism that they want to happen, they think that will
[3:57:11.280 --> 3:57:14.360]  initiate a future better aeon.
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:17.960]  So they have the exact same view, by the way, as the transhumanists and many of the transhumanists
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:20.200]  are Luciferian and satanic.
[3:57:20.200 --> 3:57:22.840]  And so this is the purpose of the toxic culture.
[3:57:22.840 --> 3:57:24.800]  It is not for freedom or liberty.
[3:57:24.800 --> 3:57:30.800]  It is to destroy everything that exists right now to bring in a new aeon or a new time wherein
[3:57:30.800 --> 3:57:38.040]  they think it will be an aeon of transhumanist, posthuman, apotheosis, the aeon of the crown
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:41.200]  and conquering child who is the new man.
[3:57:41.200 --> 3:57:42.760]  That's the real purpose of all that.
[3:57:42.760 --> 3:57:48.040]  And I guarantee you, if you look at it, you'll see that that's the case.
