[00:00.000 --> 00:19.560]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to the Alex
[00:19.560 --> 00:31.160]  Jones show welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday November 16th 2016 I'm David Knight and
[00:31.160 --> 00:35.120]  joining me as Owen Schroder we're gonna be talking the first hour and the third hour we're gonna
[00:35.120 --> 00:41.280]  have Leanne McAdoo it's gonna be joining us to talk about the news today America is getting great
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.260]  again by every metric we're seeing amazing stuff aren't we Owen we got the dollar hitting a 14-year
[00:46.260 --> 00:51.480]  high wait they told me the economy was gonna collapse yeah well you know they had some
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.000]  jittery stock market stuff but they always use that in order to take profits but now we got the
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.760]  stock market soaring we got the dollar to 14-year high we have had an announcement of one of the
[01:02.760 --> 01:07.680]  biggest oil discoveries ever in Texas and we're gonna talk about that in the second hour we're
[01:07.680 --> 01:13.120]  gonna talk about the myth of peak oil that has been sold to us for as long as they've had oil
[01:13.120 --> 01:19.840]  basically but in the last few decades it's been a product of the CIA that's what that's been behind
[01:19.840 --> 01:25.440]  our foreign policy it's what's been behind our petro dollar it's been intricately linked in our
[01:25.440 --> 01:31.040]  Federal Reserve system as well as our geopolitics and this is really gonna shake things up one of
[01:31.040 --> 01:37.280]  the things that the left is really upset about is the announcement by Trump of course so he's
[01:37.280 --> 01:41.680]  he's made it very clear that he believes global warming is a hoax and it is a hoax and we're
[01:41.680 --> 01:45.920]  gonna tell you how that works we're gonna tell you why it is we're gonna show you the lies that
[01:45.920 --> 01:52.000]  the media has been telling you since the 1980s matter of fact I've got a news week magazine right
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.560]  here from the night from 1979 and you can see you could get it for $1.25 back then the energy
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.760]  crisis and they pronounce in there how in 1979 they predicted we were going to be totally out of
[02:03.760 --> 02:09.440]  oil in eight years well here we are 37 years later we just had the biggest discovery of oil in the
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.920]  United States that we've ever seen OPEC is on its knees and the reporters are outraged that peace is
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.560]  breaking out prosperity has gotten Donald Trump hasn't even taken office and we see all these things
[02:20.560 --> 02:26.320]  happening so you've got an easing of tensions with the Russians the stepping back from the brink
[02:26.320 --> 02:31.600]  of nuclear disaster stepping back from the cold war number two and Alex Jones are gonna have a
[02:31.600 --> 02:36.080]  special report from him in the next segment he's talking about how the world has pulled back from
[02:36.080 --> 02:42.080]  the brink the media is outraged Soros is outraged he's trying to create a color revolution here in
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.360]  the United States and the media is so upset about the fact that Donald Trump went to a restaurant
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.280]  in New York without taking them along and they make a big deal like there's some sort of a threat
[02:53.280 --> 02:56.640]  to his security which we would agree I mean we've been saying you'll pray for Donald Trump we want
[02:56.640 --> 03:01.520]  to make sure he gets to the inauguration safely but what is the left media talking about what threat
[03:01.520 --> 03:05.440]  are you talking about the violent protesters that you said were peaceful why would why would anybody
[03:05.440 --> 03:10.640]  want to kill Donald Trump I don't understand he couldn't get in what is there some secret society
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.720]  out there that murders people that threaten their power structure well how about the Hollywood
[03:14.720 --> 03:21.200]  executives and the the CEO of a security company that made threats on social media we've seen people
[03:21.200 --> 03:28.000]  arrested who made threats against Donald Trump on social media but they're not CEOs they're not
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.800]  Hollywood executives and when they come out and call for the financing of violent revolution as
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.600]  that filmmaker did what's happening to that okay you've got him calling for that you've got George
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.920]  Soros doing that we're going to talk about how George Soros has a conference that is coming up
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.680]  in Washington and he's going to challenge his people to do something to oppose Trump the war
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.880]  is already on between the media and George Soros we have to understand that's what's happening
[03:54.880 --> 03:59.520]  so with all this other good news that you might think is good news the fact that OPEC's power has
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.600]  been crushed the dollar soaring the stock market is soaring that we've had an easing of strain
[04:03.600 --> 04:09.280]  relations I mean everybody was very excited when Nixon announced detente an easing of strained
[04:09.280 --> 04:16.800]  relations and yet now the media is just apoplectic about the private dinner with his family well and
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.160]  you've got the magazine here from what did you say it was the 70s or 80s 79 yeah and you can
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.200]  illustrate how what they do is like oh the people in charge of the oil industry are trying to sell
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.720]  you on a shortage of oil I wonder why they would do that they don't care about the planet that's why
[04:32.720 --> 04:35.760]  they've been fracking that's why they've been doing this to begin with but that's neither here nor
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.960]  there it's a sales push David and you can come on here you can illustrate that you can try to then
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.200]  link that to what they're doing with global warming and carbon taxes but will the people listen
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.280]  and we'll be talking about that when we come back but right after the break Alex Jones
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.640]  Trump pulls the world back from the break of nuclear war but Soros is starting his own war
[04:54.640 --> 05:03.280]  here in the United States we'll be right back Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman John McCain
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.880]  on Tuesday warned against seeking another quote reset on US-Russia relations this coming just one
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.040]  day after President Vladimir Putin called President-elect Donald Trump saying that he
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.840]  wanted to improve relations between the two countries John McCain shot back saying quote
[05:17.840 --> 05:23.200]  we should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has
[05:23.200 --> 05:28.720]  plunged his country into tyranny murdered political opponents invaded his neighbors threatened American
[05:28.720 --> 05:33.440]  allies and attempted to undermine American elections McCain wrote this in a statement I'm
[05:33.440 --> 05:38.560]  confused is he talking about Clinton and Obama or Putin here regardless it looks like another
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.520]  world war has been canceled thanks in part to Donald Trump reaching across the aisle diplomatically
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.000]  and vowing to fight ISIS together with the Russians neo cons like John McCain of course
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.880]  wouldn't be happy about this as you recall a few years ago he armed rebel militants on the ground
[05:52.880 --> 05:57.520]  in Syria that are now ISIS wonder why he's opposed to this newfound friendship I'm Margaret

[08:49.840 --> 08:56.160]  soros is openly bragged on cnn's feride zarkaria's program that he helped finance and run the
[08:56.160 --> 09:03.040]  overthrow of the democratically elected government in ukraine two and a half years ago you during
[09:03.040 --> 09:10.080]  the revolutions of 1989 funded a lot of dissident activities civil society groups in eastern europe
[09:10.080 --> 09:16.560]  and poland the czech republic are you doing similar things in ukraine well i set up a foundation
[09:16.560 --> 09:26.400]  in ukraine before ukraine became independent of russia and the foundation has been functioning
[09:26.400 --> 09:34.240]  ever since and played an important part in events now and soros has now met according to politico
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.720]  this weekend in dc with dozens and dozens of top billionaires and other financiers to organize
[09:40.720 --> 09:48.960]  a new revolution in america a black slash rainbow color revolution uh basically based on gang
[09:48.960 --> 09:55.840]  mentality and racism and pushing the lies that donald trump's a homophobe and hates black people
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.320]  that's real sad he's against you why were you done why were you support a race
[10:06.320 --> 10:13.120]  he's telling you back to africa that's why he's saying he says that messica is back to
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.440]  mexico you you are just you are displaced america thank you for being a young black man
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.760]  thank you for being a racist thank you when all he's done is pledge to cut taxes on poor people
[10:25.760 --> 10:33.040]  across the board to zero and have incentives to build factories and other job-bearing programs
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.240]  and industries in the black community and has been an advocate for gay rights for 30 years
[10:38.240 --> 10:44.720]  but that doesn't matter george soros the bizarre nazi collaborator but still walking around
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.040]  has pledged to start war with russia has pledged to turn the middle east over to radical jihadist
[10:51.040 --> 10:57.040]  groups working with saudi arabia he's overthrown more than 15 countries and destroyed their currencies
[10:57.040 --> 11:04.720]  he is a true james bond villain and he is hopping mad that the defense condition had been brought
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.240]  all the way to three which is the nuclear bombers ready the missiles ready from five and has now
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.720]  gone back to five because russia and the united states are now entering a level of detente and
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.840]  just yesterday vladimir putin called trump and trump said we're gonna have a new relationship
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.400]  with russia we're gonna try to base it on peace and we're gonna have mutual respect and try to
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.920]  work towards wiping out radical islamic invasions across russia's border and also the middle east
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.680]  across the board real political analyst a lot of top professors and real liberals came out and said
[11:37.680 --> 11:44.480]  this is a great idea this is what the world needs the democrats and soros are in an open war against
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.800]  free speech that's what political correctness is all about they have ceo's calling for the
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.280]  death of trump the actual assassination saying they're going to kill him themselves they need
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.320]  to be arrested we have directors saying it's time for violence katie perry this is the whole corporate
[11:58.320 --> 12:03.280]  hollywood mouthpiece of the big multinational corporations that have hijacked this nation
[12:03.840 --> 12:09.360]  and we've got the new york times thinking you're so stupid they now just don't deny world government
[12:09.360 --> 12:16.160]  which is admitted our global governance they now say globalism never existed and the devos group
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.760]  isn't pushing for it when they admit that's their term and their plan for corporate planetary
[12:21.760 --> 12:31.360]  government we are now facing a common challenge and the challenge is how to build a world order
[12:32.720 --> 12:41.040]  for the first time in history on a global basis so in conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world
[12:41.040 --> 12:49.280]  is emerging it is a new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges
[12:49.280 --> 12:59.440]  the affirmative task we have now is is to actually create a new world order
[12:59.440 --> 13:05.600]  good evening everybody president obama and british prime minister gordon today calling for a new
[13:05.600 --> 13:12.160]  world order to tackle our global economic crisis and the president outlight his vision of a new
[13:12.160 --> 13:18.400]  world order in which the us would participate fully we've got to give them a stake in creating the
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.920]  kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see so i see a world order in the future
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.920]  with a multi-polar world order i think the new world order is emerging and with it the foundations
[13:29.920 --> 13:36.960]  of a new and progressive era of international cooperation but in a globalized economy we
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.560]  are going to have to take global responsibilities and they're going to is going to have to be some
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.640]  several assemblies of global governance never before has a new world order had to be assembled from
[13:48.640 --> 13:56.160]  so many different perceptions or on so global a scale nor has any previous order had to combine
[13:56.160 --> 14:01.360]  the attributes of the historic balance of power system with global democratic opinion
[14:01.920 --> 14:09.040]  and the exploding technology of the contemporary period and i surely believe india will be a
[14:09.040 --> 14:16.720]  central actor in the new world order soros allies like megan kelly have come out and called it the
[14:16.720 --> 14:22.480]  year of the bully concerning donald trump when he has never killed anyone like hillary clinton
[14:22.480 --> 14:28.080]  has done hillary clinton and her actions killed over 500 000 iraqi children with their sanctions
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.200]  that were worse than bush seniors they killed tens of thousands upon tens of thousands in libya
[14:33.200 --> 14:40.320]  and hundreds of thousands in syria all of that was her doing and obama's doing but their poor sad
[14:40.320 --> 14:46.000]  dumbed-down constituents don't care because they've learned words like homophobe racist and sexist
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.760]  the good news is the same majority of white voters that elected obama to prove that they weren't
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.680]  racist elected donald trump to prove that they weren't stupid and they were joined by the largest
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.560]  group of black voters for a republican since the 1950s and the largest group of aspanics as well
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.840]  which shows no matter what the mainstream media do and how much hate they spew and no matter how
[15:09.840 --> 15:16.240]  much money criminals like george soros pump into this the people of america and the world are waking
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.360]  up to globalism russia's pulling out of the corporate new world order the uk's pulling out
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.800]  via the brexit and we're pulling out as well it's about sovereignty it's about self-determination
[15:26.800 --> 15:32.560]  and it's about standing up to international crime bosses like george soros she went out with this
[15:32.560 --> 15:41.360]  protector of yours who swore that you were uh is adopted godson yes yes went out in fact and
[15:41.360 --> 15:48.400]  helped in the confiscation of property from the jews that site yes i mean that's that sounds uh
[15:48.400 --> 15:56.960]  like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many many years was
[15:56.960 --> 16:07.200]  it difficult not not at all not at all maybe as a child you don't you don't see the connection
[16:07.200 --> 16:20.560]  uh but it was it created no no problem at all all right that was alex jones a special report
[16:20.560 --> 16:24.800]  i'm david night here with olyn shroyer and we're going to be covering the first hour in the second
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.680]  hour we're going to talk about uh that color revolution in more detail but also about the
[16:29.680 --> 16:33.520]  good news that is breaking out throughout the economy as we mentioned at the top of the hour
[16:33.520 --> 16:39.840]  we got the dollar to 14 year high we've got the largest reserve in america discovered in oil
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.320]  and of course that wasn't supposed to happen cia has been trying to sell us the idea of peak oil
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.760]  for a long time why would that be well it's a tool of political control you know olyn as i'm
[16:49.760 --> 16:56.640]  listening to this and we see this organization that mirrors the the government's uh five levels
[16:56.640 --> 17:01.920]  of threat you know def con one through five with one being the highest five being the lowest and
[17:01.920 --> 17:06.880]  three was where we were just a few weeks ago why because we had the obama administration
[17:07.440 --> 17:12.160]  and and we need to realize that with the exception of ran paul and donald trump
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.680]  everybody wanted to have a no fly zone even the republicans who are running they said we're going to
[17:18.320 --> 17:23.680]  go into a country that we have started a regime change and that we went in to deliberately
[17:23.680 --> 17:28.800]  overthrow this guy they invited russia in to help them and of course you know syria is recognized
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.040]  by the un as a government but we just overthrow whoever we wish and then we're going to tell
[17:33.040 --> 17:38.560]  russia and syria that if you defend yourself against isis we're going to shoot your planes down
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.360]  and we had generals saying well you know uh you can do that uh but you're probably going to start
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.240]  a war with russia so three weeks ago it was at three and now uh this private organization that
[17:48.240 --> 17:52.960]  takes a look at it says look with all the easing of pensions that we've had here uh they're they're
[17:52.960 --> 17:59.680]  taking it down to number five that's an amazing turnaround but the media is at war with donald
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.560]  trump and we see this in many different ways this this uh hissy fit as we got the article paul joseph
[18:04.560 --> 18:10.240]  watson about the private dinner that he had last night well and think about the hypocrisy of the
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.120]  radical left right now who's supposed to be for peace you know the peaceniks out there all on the
[18:15.120 --> 18:20.400]  left but if hillary clinton would have gotten in i mean we're looking at def con two maybe even one
[18:20.400 --> 18:26.560]  because she said she'll respond to a cyber attack with a physical war and she is basically already
[18:26.560 --> 18:31.360]  claiming in the obama administration that russia was cyber attacking us so she's basically admitting
[18:31.360 --> 18:36.160]  through her own words that she's going to go to war but trump gets in as you pointed out it drops
[18:36.160 --> 18:43.120]  to def con five so where are the peaceniks where are the trump protesters who say that the republicans

[19:04.080 --> 19:08.720]  who was an artist and they came up with this concept the doomsday clock if people concerned
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.560]  about the threat of nuclear war and it was an imminent threat at that time we had the coal war
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.760]  both us and russia were building up their weapons nobody really knew what was going to happen with
[19:17.760 --> 19:22.960]  that it was unprecedented we've never seen that before going back to january 2015 and they announced
[19:22.960 --> 19:26.880]  that yesterday they were going to meet and decided what they're going to move the hands of the clock
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.320]  closer to midnight or not we look at this and going back to january 2015 this article from

[19:36.000 --> 19:41.360]  midnight in other words the end of humanity and we'll tell you why these people think that things
[19:41.360 --> 19:46.720]  are worse because donald trump is there and because of policies that have nothing to do

[24:28.880 --> 24:32.640]  trump about that about his transition team about so many different things before we get back to the

[26:05.440 --> 26:10.640]  great way for you to keep up with the information and on that's the key isn't it because we look
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.800]  at the way the media is spinning this information you know alex just had this report about how def con
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.680]  people looked at this and and lowered it from three to five because we had our government
[26:24.480 --> 26:28.480]  talking about creating a no fly zone and shooting down russian planes just a couple of weeks ago now
[26:28.480 --> 26:35.600]  with donald trump and vladimir putin actually talking imagine that leaders of countries talking
[26:35.600 --> 26:41.680]  to each other instead of threatening to kill each other which is the first promise if you
[26:41.680 --> 26:45.520]  want to say i guess it wasn't really a promise the first thing that donald trump came through on
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.000]  his word about he went on michael savages radio show he said if i get elected i will talk to
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.120]  putin before inauguration he did it so he's one for one yeah absolutely and of course
[26:55.120 --> 26:58.320]  they continued to ask him well you know what are you going to do about obama you didn't really mean
[26:58.320 --> 27:01.840]  that you didn't really mean the you're going to build a wall or do anything about immigration and
[27:01.840 --> 27:05.680]  it goes no i really meant it i really meant it i mean it's like he's just doubling down with all
[27:05.680 --> 27:13.600]  this time but when you look at the def con approach and that's a private organization that is looking
[27:13.600 --> 27:17.280]  and making an assessment we also have another private organization i was mentioning before the
[27:17.280 --> 27:23.520]  break the doomsday clock people and everybody remembers them because it's a very iconic thing
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.480]  that was put out there it was created by a husband and wife team i guess kind of like snopes and it
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.880]  has a kind of well not exactly like well it has the authenticity of snopes and i'll tell you why
[27:32.880 --> 27:39.600]  it was a physicist nuclear physicist so and his artist wife and they basically were came up with
[27:39.600 --> 27:45.280]  this this icon the doomsday clock and as things would get closer to nuclear conflict between
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.160]  the us and russia they would move the hands of the clock closer okay so we would get to situations
[27:50.160 --> 27:56.640]  like in 1960 there were seven minutes to midnight in 1963 there were 12 minutes to midnight and
[27:56.640 --> 28:01.840]  i don't know what it was in 1962 this washington post article doesn't go back and look at that
[28:01.840 --> 28:06.800]  but that was a bit of a cuban missile crisis remember uh in october we thought that we were
[28:06.800 --> 28:12.480]  going to have came probably as close as we ever were to a nuclear exchange but between uh there
[28:12.480 --> 28:17.600]  was somewhere between seven and 12 minutes to midnight but in 2015 they came out and said
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.840]  we are three minutes to midnight wow i didn't know that we were you know uh twice as close to
[28:23.840 --> 28:29.440]  nuclear holocaust as we were the cuban missile crisis no we weren't so what happened was in 2007
[28:30.080 --> 28:37.600]  this snopes husband and wife team decided that they were going to skew this towards climate change
[28:37.600 --> 28:44.400]  why because in 2007 the community organizer and his color revolution hadn't started yet
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.640]  they hadn't started overthrowing governments they hadn't tried to break ukraine away from
[28:48.640 --> 28:55.600]  the uh soviet union and threatened russia and so things were kind of calm in 2007 they needed
[28:55.600 --> 28:59.760]  something to keep this going so they add climate change is that that's the thing that's really
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.400]  threatening our world and they move the clock to three minutes to midnight remember it was seven
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.720]  to 12 minutes during the cuban missile crisis they take it to three minutes because of climate
[29:08.720 --> 29:15.360]  change that's the way the mainstream media is detached from reality and here's the ironic thing
[29:15.360 --> 29:21.120]  to me about all of this talk about the doomsday clock uh climate change global warming being the
[29:21.120 --> 29:26.960]  end of man first of all they ignore the fact that there's nuclear testing going on by the thousands
[29:26.960 --> 29:31.600]  in the last decade they ignore the fact that geoengineering is going on beyond the fact they're
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.320]  flying around their jets talking about climate change as they're adding to the problem they completely
[29:36.320 --> 29:41.280]  discount nuclear testing and geoengineering which is admitted programs just just ignore it we're
[29:41.280 --> 29:44.560]  going to talk about that when we come back they're telling us we can't get out of these climate
[29:44.560 --> 29:48.080]  agreements oh yeah you just wait and see we'll tell you how we're gonna get out when we come back
[29:49.520 --> 29:56.240]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.400 --> 30:04.640]  what is glenn beck's problem with newly appointed chief strategist
[30:04.640 --> 30:09.360]  steve bannon he goes on to say today that uh we're all racist if we accept steven bannon in the
[30:09.360 --> 30:13.920]  white house i wonder if this latest backstabbing of right wing populist isn't anyway related to the
[30:13.920 --> 30:18.880]  collapse of back speedy empire this is what chris minahan wrote from the information liberation
[30:18.880 --> 30:23.280]  he goes on to say that black lives matter activist glenn beck said if americans accept bannon in the
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.720]  white house we're just plain old racist now bannon is one of the foremost figureheads of the quote
[30:28.720 --> 30:33.840]  alt right movement according to beck which is a gloss on quote white nationalism anti-semitism
[30:33.840 --> 30:40.080]  and anti-feminism oh really i think it was more like a referendum on the alt left anyway beck
[30:40.080 --> 30:44.400]  crazily insinuates earlier this year that over in europe they're now russian operatives that are
[30:44.400 --> 30:48.480]  training those in the alt right how to fight they're even arming them giving them guns and
[30:48.480 --> 30:53.760]  training them on how to cause chaos and terror so mylo yinopoulos is over in russia right now

[33:28.000 --> 33:34.160]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every one of the

[33:51.920 --> 34:06.080]  1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show welcome back to the alex jones show i'm
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.720]  david night with olyn schroyer and we've been talking about this article this up on info wars
[34:10.720 --> 34:16.320]  dot com how the media is freaking out last night because donald trump went to dinner privately
[34:16.320 --> 34:22.560]  and you won't believe what they are saying the media has a complete history fit this is paul
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.360]  joseph watching the story he attended a private dinner with his own family he skipped out on the
[34:27.360 --> 34:32.480]  press and he went to club 21 which is a stakehouse down the street and of course when he got there
[34:32.480 --> 34:38.800]  he was met with a standing ovation by the crowd that was there but the press is livid they can't
[34:38.800 --> 34:43.360]  believe he would do that they say he put his security at risk it's like no he didn't he took
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.280]  the secret service with him but he didn't take the press and i've heard amazing things oh and i've
[34:47.280 --> 34:53.920]  heard people in the media saying you know since 11 2263 when kennedy was assassinated uh we had
[34:53.920 --> 34:58.000]  the press corps there as part of you know to protect the president so for his own protection
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.720]  it's like really i i never saw the press making putting themselves up as human shields to protect
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.440]  the president from incoming bullets uh that's the secret services job they don't really understand
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.920]  their job is but they're literally at war with this guy ignoring everything that's happening
[35:13.920 --> 35:17.920]  you know the piece is breaking out the prosperity that we see with the dollar with the stock market
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.320]  with this major discovery of oil and that's one of the things that really freaks them out with that
[35:22.320 --> 35:28.080]  well i'd like to hear what they say he's in danger of is he in danger of assassination and if so
[35:28.080 --> 35:32.800]  from who are we talking about the peaceful protesters that they talk about that they justify
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.640]  every day i thought they were peaceful why is that a threat to his security is there some sort of
[35:36.640 --> 35:41.360]  secret establishment some secret society that is control of the planet that would want to take
[35:41.360 --> 35:46.240]  him out of power is there some global government initiative that would that would want to end the
[35:46.240 --> 35:50.320]  donald trump movement that would want to kill him called george soros and the mainstream oh but
[35:50.320 --> 35:54.800]  but will they mention that i see i doubt they'll mention that they'll just throw a hissy fit because
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.800]  they didn't get the press that they wanted from donald because you know i think the truth of it
[35:58.800 --> 36:05.520]  david is they are looking in the mirror at a rotting corpse the dinosaur dying mainstream media
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.240]  and they know their only chance to get any ratings is all at all is to have donald trump on that's
[36:10.240 --> 36:15.360]  right i mean that is it i mean cnn when they put trump on ratings went up when they would have to
[36:15.360 --> 36:19.520]  cut trump off because of the things that he was saying and people would switch to fox whatever
[36:19.520 --> 36:24.560]  their ratings went directly down so i think they're just crying and whining because they're dying
[36:24.560 --> 36:29.840]  and they need donald trump to give them the press whenever they want it to keep their ratings afloat
[36:29.840 --> 36:33.840]  that's right they had a big every time there'd be a debate they'd have a big increase and it was
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.720]  simply because of donald trump they weren't getting ratings increases when hillary was debating
[36:40.640 --> 36:43.920]  but anyway one of the things that they're complaining about here and we can leave this
[36:43.920 --> 36:49.040]  tweet here that's embedded in the article somebody named sam stein i i don't know or really care who
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.400]  he is but he's part of my stream press i guess he says so dot trump ditched his press pool tonight
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.680]  to grab a steak dinner this is why he tweeted out a terrible violation of protocol oh violation
[36:59.680 --> 37:06.480]  protocol that had his defenders will probably cheer and i yeah he's half right we are cheering that
[37:06.480 --> 37:12.640]  he's entitled to have a a dinner without being harassed by the press and of course the mainstream
[37:12.640 --> 37:18.960]  media all cheered when obama did his own thing when he got out of his box and and he did unusual
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.040]  things or what about when he travels his family all around the planet has his mother-in-law staying
[37:23.040 --> 37:27.440]  in the white house on our dollar too let's not forget about that that's okay that's right mbc news
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.720]  says uh he left his manhattan residents without notifying reporters covering him or giving any
[37:32.720 --> 37:38.160]  any indication of where he was going betraying a horrifying lack of transparency a lack of
[37:38.160 --> 37:41.920]  transparency where were they complaining about hillary clinton during the campaign cycle when
[37:41.920 --> 37:46.160]  she would disappear for days at a time that's right yeah very few of them had anything to say
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.760]  about it and it became an issue when it got up to like 80 percent of the election cycle it was
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.920]  like 200 some odd days and we started talking about it i said hey we're going to do a thing here
[37:55.920 --> 38:01.040]  where uh every day that i come on the radio fourth hour whatever we're going to talk about uh it's
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.240]  it's been 200 and some odd days since hillary's last press conference it was over 300 at one time
[38:06.240 --> 38:11.920]  yeah they they did this uh the thing when they had the hostages taken in iran okay they had
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.440]  ted koppel would come on the news days such and such the iranian hostage crisis and it's like okay
[38:17.440 --> 38:22.080]  hillary holds the press hostage for 300 days nearly the entire election cycle they didn't
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.240]  have anything to say about it and evidently it started becoming a thing because that's when she
[38:26.240 --> 38:30.960]  put a few minions on board with her on the plane they rolled her some oranges yeah they handed
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.640]  their cell phones off with the questions yeah they'd ask her questions and she would say uh here
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.160]  have a chocolate you know and then and then uh project veritas gets brought up okay
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.080]  sorry press conference over gotta go but you know what the real problem here is david i think that
[38:46.080 --> 38:50.000]  they don't want to talk about but this is what's really bothering them do you know how much carbon
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.920]  had to be emitted for donald trump to eat that steak dinner i mean think about it they had to
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.640]  they had to fill the land eating steak exactly you had to have a cow i mean that car is gonna
[38:58.640 --> 39:02.880]  that cow is gonna flatulate that adds to global warming so just the fact that trump would even
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.480]  dare have a steak dinner and then night not invite the press corps outrageous yeah yeah and like you
[39:08.480 --> 39:12.640]  were saying you know desperate for news about trump and they can't get enough information out because
[39:12.640 --> 39:16.640]  right now trump is privately working through who he's going to have his administration and the
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.160]  transition team so the desperate for news and as uh uh what some points out the cnn had a headline
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.360]  trump goes out to dinner tonight can you imagine being in this process imagine being in this press
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.680]  corps all right uh what happened uh donald trump went to dinner with his family tonight all right
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.880]  how can we spin this how can we make this negative how can we make this bad that donald oh donald
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.400]  trump went to dinner with a fit what a bad guy oh my gosh there's don lemon i can only imagine
[39:42.400 --> 39:48.480]  and if you're running cnn and you're watching your news and you look at don lemon and that's
[39:48.480 --> 39:54.400]  your future oh that's brutal you're talking about uh freaking out because he's having steak and they
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.240]  freak out because we have steak they don't want us to have steak they don't want us to have air
[39:58.240 --> 40:03.760]  conditioning i like and they are freaking out about climate change we had france and the un
[40:03.760 --> 40:10.000]  telling donald trump that action on climate change was unstoppable france and un on to see
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.360]  stepped up their warnings to president elect donald trump about the risks of quitting a 2015 global
[40:15.360 --> 40:22.160]  plan to combat climate change they said a historic shift from fossil fuels is unstoppable and at
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.600]  the same time we got the largest discovery of oil in the united states that we've ever had before
[40:27.600 --> 40:32.720]  being up out there and look we have to understand it is very easy for donald trump to get out of
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.680]  this climate change thing here right you know john carrey and all these people like it was it was
[40:37.680 --> 40:43.040]  back it was uh october 15th three weeks before the election i remember hearing all the stories on the
[40:43.040 --> 40:49.840]  weekend about their agreement that they had signed in rwanda and it was going to essentially
[40:49.840 --> 40:53.840]  outlaw air conditioning and we had john carrey saying back in july that air conditioning was a
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.440]  bigger threat to us than isis you know and as i said on this uh john carrey has never installed
[40:59.440 --> 41:05.280]  an air conditioning or refrigerator unit but he has installed isis so uh and he went to Antarctica
[41:05.280 --> 41:10.080]  so that makes him an expert that's right there you go but this is the insanity of these people
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.360]  trying to protect the world from unicorn farts and they want to protect us from cows as well
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.480]  because they also have emissions they don't want steak they don't want air conditioning but look we
[41:20.480 --> 41:24.480]  have to understand uh that when you're talking about taking away air conditioning and this
[41:24.480 --> 41:29.760]  thing that they came up with october the 15th they had three tiers the us was going to have
[41:29.760 --> 41:37.840]  its emissions of air conditioning uh coolants capped right away and then decreased but then
[41:37.840 --> 41:41.840]  you're going to have places like china and india you know they're developing so they need to be
[41:41.840 --> 41:47.760]  allowed a few more years that they can grow their emissions and stall more air conditioners before
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.640]  they cap them and then you've got people like saudi arabia and they were going to be given
[41:52.640 --> 41:58.080]  another few more years and uh so that was this this multi-tiered thing here but if you read the fine
[41:58.080 --> 42:06.960]  print what you see is that china and us companies had come up with a new refrigerant that was going
[42:06.960 --> 42:10.960]  to replace what was being banned so it's really all about the money it's really all about crony
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.600]  capitalism they've got some new thing that they want to force you to buy so the way to do it is to
[42:15.600 --> 42:19.360]  ban this stuff now how do we get out of these agreements we were told by the washington post
[42:19.360 --> 42:25.280]  on october 15th that this was a legally binding agreement because what they were doing was amending
[42:25.280 --> 42:30.560]  a treaty that had been legally made a treaty you know there's a process for that the constitution
[42:30.560 --> 42:36.640]  you have two-thirds of the senate say yeah we're going to ratify this treaty so they had ratified
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.120]  a treaty uh under the reagan administration when we used to pay a little bit of attention to the
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.520]  constitution we don't do that anymore and so they said well we amended it and so now it's legally
[42:45.520 --> 42:50.400]  binding because we amended part of that and you have to understand if you amend a treaty it's no
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.200]  longer the same treaty that you ratified is it so you put that in by executive order and this
[42:55.200 --> 43:01.200]  climate change agreement on that they agreed to it was obama and carried that agreed to that climate
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.240]  change agreement he didn't get the agreement of the senate and he explicitly said that he didn't
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.440]  need it he was going to do it with executive order and at the time his critics said well you
[43:11.440 --> 43:17.200]  know there's a danger in that because if you do this by executive order i put up a report about
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.600]  that on on the youtube channel live by executive order die by executive order they said well you
[43:21.600 --> 43:25.040]  know it can easily be undone by executive order if trump we're going to win but of course he's not
[43:25.040 --> 43:30.160]  going to win hillary will do it and so this is and this is very easy for him to undo this but
[43:30.160 --> 43:34.480]  that's how it goes right behind closed doors somebody's getting rich on this somebody somebody's
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.040]  meant to get rich just like you've got your story here in the newsweek magazine from the 70s talking
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.600]  about we've already hit peak oil basically right now there is no oil left if this magazine was
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.880]  correct we wouldn't have any oil i don't know how it had gotten to work today we'll run out in the
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.080]  mid 80s but these same people this is the most this is the most ironic thing i've ever heard of in my
[43:52.080 --> 44:00.240]  life the same people are regulating cow flatulence this is actually happening regulating cow flatulence
[44:00.240 --> 44:07.440]  in order to save the planet but they won't regulate nuclear bomb testing they don't regulate geoengineering
[44:07.440 --> 44:12.880]  you can write i actually had somebody they wrote the canadian i don't remember the name of the
[44:12.880 --> 44:18.240]  bureaucracy up there but they're in charge of the atmosphere you know climate data they wrote
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.400]  these people they said hey i see these lines in the sky what are they they said yeah we're spraying
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.920]  ellit we're spraying lithium we're spraying aluminum yeah we're spraying this in the sky yep
[44:25.920 --> 44:31.120]  it just so it's like but but no but we need to regulate cow farts and we need to tax you for
[44:31.120 --> 44:37.520]  your carbon emissions folks it is total hypocrisy if you're going to do any of that please address the
[44:37.520 --> 44:42.480]  thousands of nuclear tests that go on on this planet please address the geoengineering that
[44:42.480 --> 44:47.200]  is spraying chemicals in the sky don't come to me and tell me about climate change until you
[44:47.200 --> 44:52.400]  quit flying on your jets you regulate nuclear bomb testing and you regulate geoengineering
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.880]  until that day comes i'm not listening to any of this climate change nonsense yeah you know the
[44:56.880 --> 45:03.840]  people who like to scoff at the idea of chemtrails or persistent contrails that are laid out in a
[45:03.840 --> 45:09.920]  grid pattern magically yeah you go back and look at the the contest that we had shortly after i
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.960]  joined info wars here there was a movie contest and there was a documentary that somebody put in
[45:14.960 --> 45:19.600]  and a skyder alert and they had an app that went with it and they laid it out the correlation
[45:19.600 --> 45:25.520]  between people citing that and the increases in temperature we've got a special report here from
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.960]  alex whistleblowers elected trump and he should pardon them here's our report from alex jones
[45:31.840 --> 45:36.480]  i support donald trump because he has such amazing courage and when he gets demonized
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.280]  and attacked and lied about he just basically laughs it off i also support trump because i
[45:41.280 --> 45:45.200]  know he really wants to put america first he believes in this country he knows we've signed
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.920]  a lot of one-sided trade deals with china and other countries that if we just do fairer deals
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.640]  we'll turn our economy back on so that americas don't have to be dependent on the big corporate
[45:54.640 --> 46:03.120]  welfare state and can get off the democratic party plantation the problem is trump also
[46:03.120 --> 46:08.720]  is trying to be i think too presidential right now and being nice he can't trust the weasel
[46:08.720 --> 46:13.840]  paul ryan that tried to stab him in the back over and over again and tomorrow we're about to see
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.560]  the republicans vote for their speaker and i know trump thinks he's taking the high road but
[46:18.560 --> 46:22.800]  i think he will rue the day uh that he tried to work with the republican establishment
[46:22.800 --> 46:27.840]  i understand he wants to get things done but on a separate matter there's something i think the
[46:27.840 --> 46:33.840]  president can do or at least consider doing that will really endear him to the real intelligentsia
[46:33.840 --> 46:38.880]  of this country in the world many of which are liberal many of which are conservative and they're
[46:38.880 --> 46:45.280]  the liberal intelligentsia that supported trump because they knew how evil hillary was because
[46:45.280 --> 46:54.080]  of the wiki leaks it's the julian assanges it's the bev herrises it's the snowdons if it wasn't
[46:54.080 --> 47:00.960]  for wiki leaks and it wasn't for snowden leading the way with courage to expose the fact that we
[47:00.960 --> 47:06.480]  have a criminal elite running hillary clinton you would not have won sir that was the final blow
[47:06.480 --> 47:11.520]  that's what took you over the edge that's what gave us a window in the seedy wicked treasonous
[47:12.560 --> 47:19.600]  scum filled systems of the clinton's and the republican party that aids and abets them
[47:19.600 --> 47:26.160]  so i understand in hindsight that's pretty clear to everybody and look i understand that three years
[47:26.160 --> 47:31.840]  ago we didn't know at first what snowden had done what he'd taken now we know snowden was
[47:31.840 --> 47:38.480]  exposing criminal activity illegal activity in the government he did all of us uh an incredible
[47:38.480 --> 47:46.080]  service and i believe deserves a medal but think about it it's the whistleblowing on crimes that
[47:46.080 --> 47:53.280]  helped bring your populist liberty movement to power so if all is right with the universe and
[47:53.280 --> 48:00.160]  if logic is alive you should perhaps push for a committee in congress to have hearings about
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.920]  whistleblowing it was obama that persecuted the press arrested more reporters and and more researchers
[48:05.920 --> 48:10.480]  and more members of government than all the presidents before him who were whistleblowing
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.680]  please don't continue in the steps of obama and the democratic party and the republican
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.520]  leadership you don't have anything to worry about you're not involved in corruption you don't even
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.960]  really use the internet you're very very straightforward and so you should be proud to be transparent
[48:24.960 --> 48:33.760]  as you've always been but bottom line do the right thing explore a pardon for mr stoden and bring
[48:33.760 --> 48:40.960]  him back to the united states this is the right thing to do because quite frankly it is somewhat
[48:40.960 --> 48:49.120]  of a paradox almost an oxymoron that it's his actions and an assange's actions and other actions
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.200]  that helped bring this country back from the brink of a total globalist takeover now because of
[48:55.200 --> 49:01.120]  your leadership the american people's courage and these men and women's courage that leaked the
[49:01.120 --> 49:07.520]  information the dc leak folks gucifer 2.0 and everybody else it's because of wiki leaks dc
[49:07.520 --> 49:12.880]  leaks gucifer 2 and all these other heroes and the independent media that we now have a chance
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.440]  to get good supreme court justices that we have a chance to cut taxes and have better trade deals
[49:17.440 --> 49:25.440]  that you're our champion of so it's only fair that you move forward with at least an investigation
[49:25.440 --> 49:31.600]  into whether or not julien assange can be left alone by the united states now and whether people
[49:31.600 --> 49:37.440]  like edward snowden can now be left alone and really praise as the heroes they are i think if
[49:37.440 --> 49:44.000]  there's justice in this world this should really be strongly looked at and mr president i know
[49:44.720 --> 49:52.480]  you've got the courage to do the right thing and david knight and owens shorter here and as
[49:52.480 --> 49:58.720]  i'm listening to alex jones say that julien assange ought to be pardoned that they ought to call off
[49:58.720 --> 50:03.200]  the dogs that have kept him under house arrest in london for a long time i absolutely agree
[50:03.200 --> 50:06.720]  one of the things we need to remember about the obama administration on is that
[50:06.720 --> 50:13.680]  obama locked up more whistleblowers and journalists under the antiquated 1917 espionage act
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.320]  that all the president's combined before him so they want to talk about transparency they want
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.960]  to talk about how the press is treated i mean at least he's not locking up they they they
[50:22.960 --> 50:26.720]  skip on hillary clinton not holding press conferences they give him a pass on locking
[50:26.720 --> 50:31.520]  journalists up but they get upset about the private dinner by the way we're seeing now obviously
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.640]  we had stories of fake news being censored off the internet people are using info wars as the
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.960]  example business insider was one of them on their social media account saying people are using
[50:40.960 --> 50:45.600]  facebook to determine how to steer away from fake news wait a second our numbers are growing people
[50:45.600 --> 50:49.360]  are coming to us because they're sick of fake news not the opposite we're going to talk about that on
[50:49.360 --> 50:52.480]  the other side of the break and of course that's something that's been developing for a number
[50:52.480 --> 50:57.680]  of years the idea of truthiness who's going to be the arbiter of who is true and who isn't who
[50:57.680 --> 51:01.840]  can be censored and who isn't stay with us and be right back will the government protect your

[54:18.640 --> 54:24.320]  had our our government lusting after a chinese style of government for quite some time i remember
[54:24.320 --> 54:30.400]  going back to george w when he said gee i wish i could just tell people what to do like to do
[54:30.400 --> 54:34.480]  in china that'd be great as a dictator you know and we got a lot of people on the left and the
[54:34.480 --> 54:40.160]  right who think that every four years on what we're doing is electing a dictator and no we're not
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.880]  and we need to get get away from that but before we get back to the news i would just want to let
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.160]  you know about a new product that we've introduced biopca is the ultimate new hair skin and nail
[54:50.160 --> 54:56.320]  formula by info wars life dot com it's got 14 powerful ingredients including biotin zinc
[54:56.320 --> 55:02.320]  and a proprietary blend of enzymes and collagen this formula is a real deal especially formulated

[55:08.640 --> 55:14.080]  the pollutants that you find and things like shampoos and soaps and body wash and that sort of
[55:14.080 --> 55:19.840]  thing that affects your skin you need good quality nutrients and biotin especially is one of the
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.880]  things people have long recognized as being essential for healthy hair and nails and skin
[55:24.880 --> 55:29.760]  it also includes a proprietary blend of enzymes and collagen as i pointed out so that's a new
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.640]  product that we have it's a limited first run so we'll settle out of inventory very quickly on that
[55:34.640 --> 55:39.600]  also i'll just briefly mention that we have the new info wars prime app take a look at that it's
[55:39.600 --> 55:45.280]  available at an introductory price of half off and then our loss leader special you can get

[55:56.880 --> 56:02.560]  whether you like it or not so that's a great t-shirt there and you know and it's it's already in
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.640]  red which kind of reminds me of the way the the british army used to dress their soldiers in red
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.720]  so you can see them or yeah they'll stick out too so hopefully we can stick out but you know
[56:10.720 --> 56:15.600]  that's right have you have you been taking that bio pca is that why your beard is so thick that's
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.440]  right yeah that's it i've noticed your mustache and beard has been getting nice and thick and
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.920]  illustrious over there it must be that bio pca you're well i have taken biotin for a long time
[56:24.480 --> 56:31.280]  as part of my regimen of supplements so i will be shifting over to biotin to the bio pca that we
[56:31.280 --> 56:37.040]  sell so uh yeah because that's got other things in it besides just buy it besides biotin so
[56:37.040 --> 56:42.240]  that's a great thing to have i i take a lot of the stuff that we sell a brain force is my favorite
[56:42.240 --> 56:46.720]  thing because i can tell the difference when i've had it and when i haven't had it well you've only
[56:46.720 --> 56:50.880]  got three bottles sitting at your desk over there that's right that's right so i always have one
[56:50.880 --> 56:54.800]  ready for me whenever i gotta travel anywhere well let's talk about china let's talk about the
[56:54.800 --> 57:00.240]  censorship that they're lusting after and the idea that we've seen multiple articles this week from
[57:00.240 --> 57:06.080]  google and others talking about how they're going to censor individuals censor terms on twitter we
[57:06.080 --> 57:10.880]  just had them go after uh somebody that identified as the alt right i don't know anything about this
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.960]  particular individual and quite frankly i don't even identify as the alt right i don't i don't
[57:14.960 --> 57:19.200]  know what the definition of that is i identify myself as a paleo libertarian if you want to put
[57:19.200 --> 57:24.400]  a label on it uh that's about as close as i could get but they're they're using censorship and talking
[57:24.400 --> 57:30.480]  about hoax news sites and this is something someone for a number of years ago and going back uh google
[57:30.480 --> 57:34.720]  has been talking about we're going to apply a standard of truthiness you know referring back
[57:34.720 --> 57:39.040]  to a cobear uh we're going to have truthiness and we're going to be the ones who are going to evaluate
[57:39.040 --> 57:42.960]  whether or not you're legitimate whether or not your stuff is true and if we don't like what you're
[57:42.960 --> 57:47.600]  saying uh we're going to boot you off of our platform well and we'll get more into this on
[57:47.600 --> 57:53.760]  the other side but you know it's not about censorship with these people it's about control
[57:53.760 --> 57:58.000]  that's really what it's about and and that's just their means but yeah but they'll they'll
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.040]  cry censorship but it's incredible as i said earlier they're using info wars i'm seeing i'm
[58:03.040 --> 58:09.120]  seeing all of these uh major publications going on social media mentioning this story
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.200]  about how they want to get rid of fake news on social media and info wars is always one of the
[58:13.200 --> 58:18.240]  main targets when they go after this here's an idea how about we let the people decide what news
[58:18.240 --> 58:22.560]  they want to hear how about the government doesn't decide what news i would trust how about i decide
[58:22.560 --> 58:26.000]  as a person and you know what the people have decided that's why they elected donald trump
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.840]  they didn't listen to the mainstream news and that's why the alex jones channel on youtube now has
[58:29.840 --> 58:34.720]  1.8 million subscribers and going up stay with us we'll be right back on the other side of the

[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.080]  the break owin was talking about uh chinese censorship coming up in the next segment we're
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.440]  gonna have a special report from alex jones you know we've had all these reports owin of uh these
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.400]  people at the demonstrations just shouting trump's the racist trump's the race and put a microphone
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.440]  in their face and asked them why what did he say that makes him a racist ah he's a racist he's a
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:58.000]  racist go away he's hitler or like what they did with uh uh with uh josh uh owin's just kick him in
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.920]  the back you know a guy wearing a mask doesn't want you see his face he won't talk to you he
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.360]  won't explain his position but when you turn your back on him he'll kick you in the back with a
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:11.120]  sucker punch okay or a sucker kick you know i was telling rob do my boss back there you know
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.040]  send me to trump tower send me to la he said oh and we you know you're gonna get beat up out there
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.280]  we don't want to send you and i just said hey jesus had to go on the cross all right if i have to
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.960]  go out there and get beat up by these loons if that's what it takes to expose them even though
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.800]  we've already done that we'll go ahead and do it but they're gonna keep protesting i think david
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.960]  well alex is going to have a report coming up in the next segment that we've actually now finally
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.800]  caught trump's racism on camera so now we're going to put some substance to this charge that's been
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.560]  repeated endlessly by these protesters for george soros but let's get back to your point give you
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.680]  the four again here talking about what's going on with china with censorship with google well i think
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.800]  that this is very important for people to realize especially people my age you know millennials who
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.520]  have grown up on the internet and it's almost like it's it's it's a reality for them and they
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.960]  don't even understand i'm not saying whether that's good or bad but that's just how it is they're
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.520]  attached to their phone and so what happens in china with the with the way the internet works
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.880]  you basically have a social score for your activity online and this is not what we want
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.120]  folks this is internet government okay we already have enough government we don't need government
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.160]  on the internet and there was actually an episode of black mirror it's a show on netflix where they
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.960]  talk about this in the first episode what the social score is how it will basically interweave
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.200]  its way into our social fabric and what that will do to us but president ji xin ping called for
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.280]  greater cooperation among nations and developing and governing the internet again we don't want
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.000]  any government over the internet and then he says he still wants to respect so-called cyber
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.560]  sovereignty trust me that is complete lip service folks they want total control over the internet
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.160]  if they just wanted to censor it they would already have isis and all of these operators
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.760]  off of twitter off of facebook recruiting people to their radical movements but here's my here's
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.040]  my final question this is what i asked the people and then david you too is the internet broke
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.640]  why are we trying to fix the internet what is wrong with the internet do do we the people the
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.280]  end user feel that the internet is broke are we complaining about how the internet operates on
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:17.920]  a day-to-day basis i'm not personally i'm not so who is the people who are being threatened
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.800]  by the internet the people in power who need to control the internet just like they had to control
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:30.080]  the television and radio media to keep messages against their control from getting out that's
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.800]  a great example of that they call it the great firewall of china essentially it's a firewall
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.120]  not for security purposes but for the security of the state to make sure that dangerous ideas
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.640]  don't find their way it's not it's not that they're trying to do a denial of service or
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:50.160]  some kind of a hack no the firewall is to keep out ideas that might come into china ideas that
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.680]  might reform it that might make it freer so that's the whole point free flow of information which
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:01.520]  is what has happened in this we've seen a revolution this last year so uh the people waking up
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.960]  understanding uh where the globalists are going uh it was interesting i think to see we we saw
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.080]  earlier this year that after saying hey globalism and a new world order uh that's just a conspiracy
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.880]  theory then they owned it for a while and they said no no it's real and it's a good thing you
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.160]  should want that it's a really but you know this has been a very positive thing except for you guys
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.720]  in you know the working class and stuff i know you haven't really uh done too well with this but
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.680]  it really is long term for the good of humanity it's a good thing now they're back to calling it a
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.560]  conspiracy theory again that's the way these people operate you want to talk about truthiness
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.680]  you want to talk about credibility from mainstream media doesn't have we see poll after poll and
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.560]  this probably uh rigged just like the other polls were about the mainstream media saying that uh 70
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.080]  percent of people don't believe anything they have to say all right we're gonna try 90 percent
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.440]  yeah we're gonna be right back after the break uh we're gonna have alex jones breakdown trump
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:01.200]  racism caught on camera we finally now know why he's been called a racist senate arms service
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.200]  committee chairman john mccain on tuesday warned against seeking another quote reset on us russia
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.000]  relations this coming just one day after president bladam your putin called president elect donald
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.960]  trump saying that he wanted to improve relations between the two countries john mccain shot back
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.320]  saying quote we should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former kgb
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.760]  agent who has plunged his country into tyranny murdered political opponents invaded his neighbors
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.400]  threatened american allies and attempted to undermine american elections mccain wrote this
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.680]  and a statement i'm confused is he talking about clinton and obama or putin here regardless it looks
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.480]  like another world war has been canceled thanks in part to donald trump reaching across the aisle
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.920]  diplomatically and vowing to fight isis together with the russians neocons like john mccain of course
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.800]  wouldn't be happy about this as you recall a few years ago he armed rebel militants on the ground
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.600]  in syria that are now isis wonder why he's opposed to this newfound friendship i'm margaret howl

[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:29.680]  the control corporate media has now made a decisive error they've been caught red handed
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.520]  lying about the election lying about the polls trying to deceive the american people but enough
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.640]  americans from across the political spectrum black white hispanic old young woke up to this
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:46.160]  and so now the hoax has blown up in their face to the point that even michael moores had to tell
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.800]  the truth that it was white voters that elected obama who elected trump they voted for obama to
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.760]  prove they weren't racist they voted for trump to prove they weren't stupid
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.920]  president elect donald trump has struck a very presidential tone in the last seven days
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:14.560]  since he was elected and the democrats have stabbed him in the back at every level they want
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.880]  division in this country they're the ones pushing this whole race-based narrative they're the ones
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.920]  that are condoning the racial attacks on whites across the country it's truly despicable but
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.480]  when we saw the 60 minutes piece this weekend and trump told his supporters stop it if you're
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.920]  doing it that was him attempting to give an olive branch to all the people out there that continue
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.880]  to claim he's racist but they're not going to stop that's what the political correct culture is
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:49.360]  is about class warfare and permanent divide and conquer in this nation because the globalists
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:55.760]  are disenfranchising all of us they're taking all of our freedoms they are putting all of our
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.240]  children in debt and that's why they're using what british intelligence used to control india and
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.000]  other nations divide and conquer playing different tribes off against each other we need to come
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.080]  together as martin luther king said and stand as a human tribe that loves liberty and freedom
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.360]  and free association and that's what donald trump is promoting the globalists are dissolving our
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.360]  borders and our sovereignty to absorb us into a world government and that's why they're pushing
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:29.440]  this narrative that if a nation state exists it's racist ladies and gentlemen this is the great
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.640]  challenge of the 21st century whether we can see through this propaganda or not but the good news
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:40.960]  is there's been a huge repudiation of this whole race-based narrative in this latest election
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.520]  and we saw record numbers of black and hispanic americans vote for trump but instead of the
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.920]  mainstream media realizing that they've so far failed they have only intensified their efforts
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.880]  now at race-pating but here's some fact-based video integrated in with the 60 minutes propaganda
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.480]  piece to show you what's really happening nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:11.360]  and personal threats against african-americans latinos and gays by some of his supporters i'm
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:17.360]  very surprised to hear that i was telling muslim i hate to hear that i mean i hate to hear it i don't
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.360]  hear it you're not seeing it i saw one or two instances but i think it's a very small amount
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.080]  again i think it's do you want to say anything to those i would say don't do it that's terrible
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:34.720]  because i'm going to bring this country together they're harassing latinos muslims i am so
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:43.520]  saddened to hear that and i say stop it if it if it helps i will say this and i'll say it right
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:12:00.960]  to the camera stop it there will be casualties on both sides there will be because people
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:13.360]  have to die to make a change in this world oh my goodness poor white people please almost stop
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:31.120]  says racist since you voted for donald trump you can get your and get out uh-uh the suitcase
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:56.320]  is packed out of the cell phone video captures the moment a female student attacks sophomore jade
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:03.520]  armenio this girl comes up to me and she said do you hate mexicans and i was like no and she said
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:27.360]  you support trump you hate mexicans how is he racist how yeah
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:42.560]  right that's right shocking trump racism has been absolutely discovered and documented
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:50.560]  it's anti trump racism anti white racism anti american racism and the good news is the control
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.760]  corporate media is so discredited they can only get the biggest dumbasses on the planet to buy
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:03.120]  into their bs and americans more than ever are coming together love the way they ended that report
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:10.240]  over that woman not having a temper tantrum that uh obese woman and just cut in donald trump's like
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.240]  stop it a total product of the mainstream media david a total product biggest idiots on the planet
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:21.280]  let's look at glenn beck who is saying the alt right is truly terrifying going on cnn trying to
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.720]  ingratiate himself into the mainstream media because his media empire mercury is he ingratiating
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.680]  goblins is that what's happening yeah no no glenn beck ingratiating a goblin he's going bankrupt
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.760]  so he's trying to pave a way for himself to get back into cnn or some other place here we have
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.800]  cnn saying nationally syndicated radio host glenn beck said tuesday that the alt right movement
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:47.120]  is quote truly terrifying adding that while leading bright bart news steven bannon the uh
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.600]  favorite piñata of the week gave a voice to white nationalist there you go oh and i'd never
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:59.280]  realized until now that bright bart news was the voice of white nationalism did you realize that i
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.880]  i've read it quite a bit i yeah i mean fine work there i i'm on bright bart uh bright bart a lot
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.560]  in most most of the time i just see them reporting on news that won't get covered anywhere else i think
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.400]  what's made bright bart explode recently is their coverage on the border immigration they've done a
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.640]  lot of great reports on that um i don't think it has anything to do with white nationalism no it doesn't
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.760]  perhaps nationalism i think that that might be fair but it's okay no no that's a very different
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.240]  thing than say white nationalist okay that's a very racist kook looks clan type of overtone
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.760]  but it's but it's okay for them though see it's okay for them to race bait play the race card
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:44.160]  racially divide but us electing trump they say that that's what we're doing so we're the bad guys
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.960]  and again what we see glenn doing is the same thing we've seen these uh you know jiggly puffs
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.920]  and snowflakes at all these riots doing just screaming racism racism racism without giving
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.800]  any example of it okay thanks glenn and you know here's a washington post now you would think
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:05.040]  as much as a washington post as opposed to donald trump setting up an entire press corps to fare it
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.400]  into his personal and private life remember that they had like a a dozen or 20 people that were
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.960]  going that they set aside to look into his his private life and announced it proudly announced
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.720]  that and of course same thing was done new york times and others isn't it interesting that they
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.920]  didn't really come up with anything but the biggest drag net ever yeah you got washington post
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:30.720]  headlines here how bannon flattered and coaxed trump on policies key to again this favorite
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.080]  term of theirs the alt right and i'm blitzing through this article and they don't have anything at all
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.200]  about racism now you would think that these people had a team of reporters going through to fair it
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.800]  out all the evil and donald trump's life uh and bannon and so forth if they could have found something
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.440]  about racism that they could have hung their hat on okay they would have put it in there but you
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:58.720]  know glenn beck is throwing out these unsubstantiated uh uh claims of white nationalism uh the most
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.880]  damaging thing they could do i guess they lead out their article by talking about how after
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:09.200]  130 people were killed in paris by muslim jihadists which they won't use that term they just say
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.320]  terrorists okay uh they say trump faced sharp criticism for saying the u.s had no choice
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.000]  but to close down some mosques and they talk about how bannon helped him to uh walk that
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.080]  comment uh backed by saying were you actually saying you need new york city police intelligence
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.560]  unit to get a network of informants i guess uh trump said that's what i'm saying uh you need
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.680]  to be prepared to allow uh to uh you're not going to allow an enemy within to tear down this country
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.120]  and he said yeah that's right that's not going to happen well look understand a couple of things
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.360]  as we pointed out many times to the left but they still don't seem to understand islam is not a race
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:49.840]  secondly if you have a so-called church that is preaching the kind of jihadi islamic terror that
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:56.560]  is preached in some of these mosques that results in 130 people being killed in in one town uh that's
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.360]  not a mosque that should be allowed to exist that's not racism that is hatred that is terrorism
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.080]  that's violence we need to understand the difference between terrorism and religion okay maybe go back
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.280]  to the dictionary spend a little time there washington post new york times uh barack obama
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.240]  hillary clinton look up the words uh terrorism look up the words religion and we also need to
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.920]  understand that sharia law that is promoted by these people like sharia khan that hillary clinton
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.120]  had introduced her or not introduced her but he spoke about three or four people before her at the
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.800]  dnc uh the the guy who uh the gold star family that they tried to hang that on donald trump for
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:40.240]  the longest period time this is a guy who has been uh an avid commentator about sharia law
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.440]  he's written volumes about sharia law and you understand that sharia law is antithetical
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.240]  to everything that we have here in the west that you hear the liberal establishment constantly
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.920]  crying about the separation of church and state no sharia law is about the consolidation of church
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:03.040]  and state okay and that's what sharia khan was about he's not simply uh the the father of somebody
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.680]  who is a muslim who was killed in a war now he's promoted sharia law and hillary clinton in the
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.680]  left have promoted him and used him uh to beat donald trump with so if there was any racism
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.280]  if it was uh white nationalism glenn beck would be on that well and glenn beck you know he thinks
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.240]  he's jesus he's going to say that he's going to anoint ted cruz of course he miserably failed
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.320]  on that profit is what he is well and he buried his face into a bowl of cheetos we can never let
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.360]  him live that down but he says that if if americans act we ask to letting bannon in the white house
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:41.040]  then we are racist so what is glenn beck calling for is glenn beck i mean just like van jones are
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.720]  are we going to hold them responsible for these people out on the streets destroying property
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:50.800]  breaking the law uh burning things looting because i mean they're being told it's racist we're racist
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.400]  so they're trying to fight racism it's a total lie it's a total myth not the people at the top
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.320]  stay with us we'll be right back uh stay with us uh for another segment when we write back

[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:56.160]  said well you know uh i'm not too happy about hillary clinton uh trump represents what i wanted
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.360]  in the presidency if he had lost but he didn't lose and he is our president in spite of all of the
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:09.200]  uh george soros operatives the rent a mob the astroturf demonstrations and violent
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.360]  demonstrations that we see which is really part of a color revolution we'll talk about that a
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.080]  little bit here we're also going to talk coming up the next segment i want you to stay here with me
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:25.600]  on and we'll talk about uh peak oil and we'll talk about this 1979 newsweek magazine i want to
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.000]  have you here because you did that report on the special commemorative edition by newsweek i mean
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.800]  they're still up to this kind of stuff here we are like 40 years later uh they're still doing the
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.520]  kind of nonsense i can't believe these people are still in business i guess you know cnn will
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.800]  never go out of business either uh but uh they're still in business and so they put out a hoax
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.840]  issue you know about hillary clinton you talked about that quite a bit and i wanted to read for
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.400]  people what was on the inside cover of that and give people an update on what's going on with
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.320]  the commemorative edition because they had one for hillary but they didn't have one for donald
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.000]  trump they had a design and an idea that they might do one for donald trump but they were
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.280]  so convinced from listening to themselves that donald trump wasn't going to win by every metric
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.760]  and we talked about this so many different times by the number of crowds by the voting in high
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:20.080]  schools by uh ai projections by other models that political scientists have put out by every metric
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:27.520]  Trump was massively ahead and yet these people continued to put out these quote unquote scientific
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.880]  polls and there's a lesson for us and their predictions about oil there's a lesson for us
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.080]  and their predictions about climate change all of these so-called experts they always refer back
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:45.120]  to this argument from authority listen to me i am a climate change scientist okay well we've had the
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.600]  alex has interviewed multiple times the founder of the weather channel and he said hey when we were
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.040]  doing a how can they say that they're going to have such and such a percentage of climate change
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.120]  when when he was doing it they had the little mercury thermometers the analog thermometers
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.920]  and you have parallax error there you're not going to get the kind of accuracy of a one degree
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.560]  temperature change but now they're saying a one degree temperature change is going to be apocalyptic
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.720]  and that's nonsense again real quickly let me tell you the other things that are up at info

[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:28.800]  owen when we were talking in the last break we were talking about some of the transitions
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:34.000]  that are happening here how they're attacking uh bannon who was ahead of breitbart he has
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.600]  been the focus of everybody's attacks on him but i think as we're looking at the news cycle
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.000]  uh they're really trying to find out something about trump they're so desperate that they freak
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.120]  out when he goes to get something to eat but the only other thing they have to talk about
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.280]  besides his visit to the steakhouse is his transition team we had some very important
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.360]  information that broke on this you know the end of the week last week we had chris christy removed
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.800]  from the uh uh team he was head of the team and he was replaced by vice president elect
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.960]  mike pence and now we see from the hill that pence is reportedly kicking all the lobbyists
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.720]  off the transition team and that's a report from the wall street journal i think that's a very
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:17.040]  positive development yeah that deserves a round of applause and for all of the people the liberals
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:22.320]  the people on the left who have been fighting to get big money influence out of washington we've
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.520]  been telling you trump is your candidate and now you have his vice presidential pick mike pence
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:33.360]  coming in and delivering what or at least winding up for a haymaker against the influence of big
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.480]  money in washington that's right that's right we're going to talk a little bit more about that on the
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:42.400]  other side and then we're going to talk about newsweek and maybe they should spell that weak we'll be
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:55.920]  right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:06.000]  what is glenn beck's problem with newly appointed chief strategist steve bannon he goes on to say
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.720]  today that uh we're all racist if we accept steven bannon in the white house i wonder if this latest
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.600]  backstabbing of right wing populist isn't anyway related to the collapse of back speedy empire this
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:20.240]  is what christ menahan wrote from the information liberation he goes on to say that black lives matter
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:25.600]  activist glenn beck said if americans accept bannon in the white house we're just plain old racist now
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:30.560]  bannon is one of the foremost figureheads of the quote alt right movement according to beck which is
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.240]  a gloss on quote white nationalism anti-semitism and anti-feminism oh really i think it was more
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:42.240]  like a referendum on the alt left anyway beck crazily insinuates earlier this year that over
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.400]  in europe there are now russian operatives that are training those in the alt right how to fight
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.720]  they're even arming them giving them guns and training them on how to cause chaos and terror
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.160]  so mylo yinopoulos is over in russia right now training on how to cause chaos mr beck check

[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:26.000]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[01:32:54.400 --> 01:33:17.760]  dot com or by calling 888-253-3139 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here with oren schroyer and we were talking
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:35.200]  before we went to the break about the trump transition team developments in that mike
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.760]  pence of course being put at the top of that as christ christie was removed possibly because of the
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:47.760]  bridge gate i'm sure that had a a lot of things to do with that but also christ christie had put a
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.680]  lot of lobbyists on this transition team and the first thing that mike pence has done according
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.320]  to wall street journal an unidentified source source within the transition team told the wall
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:04.080]  street journal that pence's first move since taking over from chris christie has been to remove
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:08.880]  all lobbyists off the transition team i think that is a very positive development of course one of
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.880]  the people that has disappeared off of that transition team i don't know if they were including
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.080]  him as a lobbyist or not because usually these people who work for the intelligence state
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:26.400]  uh like mike rogers usually as they retire they get a job as a lobbyist or they get off of homeland
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.800]  security like michael shirt off and they go join the company that makes the body scanners and then
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:40.240]  have masses of them all lined up to be installed in the airport just as we have a underwear bomber
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.320]  isn't that convenient you know so you have that type of thing so i don't know if mike rogers former
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.880]  congressman uh and he was as the washington post says this is washington post isn't it uh
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.320]  yeah i think uh they call him a widely respected voice on national security well i don't respect
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:04.240]  him uh i i this is the guy who was mr syspa uh cyberintelligence security protection actor
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:11.600]  whatever they he continued to push that through uh they kept changing the name uh they tried syspa
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:17.360]  two or three times they had acta sopa pipa all these different ones the whole point of this
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:23.760]  was to allow the companies that uh collect information on you to turn it over to the
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.040]  government which they're already doing okay but they don't have uh legal immunity for doing that so
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.480]  you could sue them for spying on you and turning that over to the government so what they want to
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.920]  do was not to protect your privacy not to protect the internet not to protect cyber security they
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.600]  wanted to protect the companies that were snitches for the surveillance state that was the point of
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.800]  mike rogers that was a point of syspa and they finally got it through uh as sys uh okay they
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:57.120]  finally got that run through so now uh they can turn that information over and uh you can't do a
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.800]  thing about it because they've now protected their corporate snitches to spy on you and as we talked
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:11.040]  about earlier uh google and uh others uh controlling content uh talking about how they'd like to set up
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:18.320]  a uh a chinese style surveillance we have to understand the importance of um the geospatial
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.280]  intelligence which is the fastest growing field we talked about this with jade helm if they have
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.760]  your metadata they keep saying don't worry we're not collecting your phone calls we're not collecting
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.800]  your text messages we're not listening to all that stuff and reading your emails no we're just
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.560]  collecting your metadata and as william benney who's been on the show multiple times has pointed
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.640]  out the metadata is far more valuable to them than that because they can go through your metadata
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:49.840]  algorithmically and they can map you politically religiously and geographically they can know
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:57.040]  everything about you and all of your friends and that gives them a greater predictive uh capability
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.680]  pre crime capability then they would if they were to listen to your texts and the message they don't
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.200]  want that stuff they want the metadata and yet they tell us i'm worried we're only going after
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.840]  the metadata uh that's the real key thing so i see that as a very important thing but what i
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:14.000]  wanted to say oh and was one of these quotes it was embedded in this article from the washington
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.920]  post they talked to a guy who used to be a counselor to condoleezza rice when she was secretary
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:27.600]  state and his name is cohen eliot cohen and of course um he is one of the never trumpers uh now
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:32.560]  i don't know if this is true or not but he said after an exchange with the trump transition team
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:38.560]  i changed my recommendation i say stay away they're angry arrogant and screaming you lost
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.040]  and he said we met with them and he says it was weird very disturbing it was accusations
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.920]  you guys are trying to insinuate insinuate yourselves into the administration all of you lost
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:54.160]  i think that's a very positive thing because they did lose the never trumpers the establishment at
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.640]  the top the geop establishments no different from the democrats they all allied together
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.280]  they all opposed trump and they did lose and now they are trying to insinuate their way into the
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.560]  administration the globalists are trying to do this the elitists that have given us these disastrous
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.840]  policies that have campaigned as the phony opposition and then when we voted for them to
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.760]  protect the borders get rid of obama care they they got elected on that basis and then said
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:24.000]  now we're not going to do anything so i take that as a very positive development well rogers is
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.640]  probably one of those guys that they're going to try to infiltrate into a trump administration
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.840]  in order to have somebody in it as a security blanket to try to keep some of these policies
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.480]  keep some of these agendas churning or people like him now that he's left yeah right right and
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.960]  that cohen i feel like there was a relation to david brock it might have been a different cohen
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.600]  but i remember when i was doing my research into david brock there was an e cohen that kept popping
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.400]  up so i'm not sure if that's the connection there now yeah but you know of course they're
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.800]  going to try to demonize trump at every turn right now i think we're seeing positive things
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.360]  coming out of the transition camp i think you know bannon is a good appointment i think pence
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.080]  and what he's done with his power to remove the lobbyist is a good thing that i would think
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:11.440]  universally people would accept this from the left and the right but that's not how it's going to be
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.560]  you know spun and twisted inside of the media complex that's run essentially by the government
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.520]  that we're dealing with and that's what we see from the washington post you know with their
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.000]  headline says transition is quote going so smoothly tweets trump and then you have them
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.160]  talk to the people who are part of the long-term establishment former cia directors anything oh
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:31.120]  they're not doing this right yeah you start with the core of the people who brought you in but then
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:37.280]  you have to reach out to us we have to say one of the things that sabotage the reagan administration
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.600]  was from getting many of the things that he promised to get done i remember ron paul supported
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.520]  ronald reagan when he ran in 1976 he was one of his first supporter strong supporter
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.000]  and then ronald reagan pledged things like hey he was going to get rid of the department of
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.320]  education which jimmy carter had just created as i've said before the department of education
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.600]  under ronald reagan was still rosemary's baby in the crib and he should have strangled it right
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.960]  there okay but instead under a reagan administration it was nurtured and it grew into an adulthood
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:13.120]  okay and it's now this oppressive thing that we uh donald trump is looking at a person to take over
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:16.960]  that position over the department of education who was opposed to common core but that's how
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.520]  bad it's gotten the common core but they could do things like that but reagan got sabotage
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:27.120]  even though he wasn't a member of the council on foreign relations he wound up with over 300 people
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.840]  from uh who were cfr put into the state department they basically uh took over his foreign policy
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:38.000]  well and let's talk more about a trump transition here into actually uh administration and this is
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.960]  a story that you shared with me is trumps one trillion dollar privately funded infrastructure plan
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.920]  feasible this to me is kind of a representation of the type of transformation we're going to see
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:52.160]  under a trump presidency and i'm curious what you what you thought about this one trillion dollar
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.760]  infrastructure investment to rebuild highways bridges tunnels airport school and hospitals
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.160]  i think first of all i think that that's brilliant i i mean i don't know about you but i'm sick of
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:06.960]  driving on a road that's busted to hell and then i got to get my car repaired every year because i
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.680]  don't even have a smooth road same thing with the bridges tunnels trump talks about the airports
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.080]  all the time but he's but the interesting thing about this plan david and this is where i'm curious
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:21.520]  to get your thoughts i think that there is a perhaps a danger of crony capitalism here
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:30.080]  in the plan that he's brought forth problem but if we have a transparent way of bringing on
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.000]  these private investments which is what he's talking about doing which i think is great
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.040]  it's not going to build the debt that this country has already with this trillion dollar investment
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.480]  coming essentially from private institutions that receive tax credits so you obviously have a risk
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.440]  of crony capitalism here but if this is done transparently if the american people to see
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.880]  that there was a fair bidding process or selection process to choose the best person which is what
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.480]  what trump wants he's always said under budget ahead of schedule so this is the type of thing i
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:06.160]  think is a transition that the american people need to keep their eye on as well how he goes about
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:10.720]  rebuilding the infrastructure where he's getting the money this is something we need to make sure
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:15.360]  is still transparent but i think that what you're seeing from pence where you're seeing um out of
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:21.040]  the out of the um excuse me trump camp already the things that kelly and conway has said you know i
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.240]  think that he intends on being transparent with this allowing the american people to take a look
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.920]  into what it is he's bringing to the table with where he's getting the money so even though i think
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.120]  this is a risk of crony capitalism that you would agree with it also could be very beneficial we
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.920]  could actually rebuild our infrastructure without increasing our debt something that no president
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:47.280]  has figured out how to do yet well yeah i guess uh i would differ with you and i would differ with
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.320]  trump on this uh because i look at this trillion dollar infrastructure rebuild and it's not that
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.560]  our infrastructure doesn't need to be rebuilt it's not that we don't need to invest in it but i'm
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.760]  concerned about the crony capitalism i'm concerned about toll roads and i think that toll roads are
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:07.600]  going to take a toll on the working people of this country i think it's going to take a toll on
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:13.600]  whether we have a few people mostly multinational foreign corporations that are going to wind up
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.600]  owning america rather than americans themselves and i think it's one of the few things uh that the
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.520]  government ought to do not the federal government by the way there is no authority for the federal
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:27.760]  government and this is something that was brought up uh prior to the civil war and civil war is about
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.360]  so many things people don't understand that we have this dumb down version of civil war that
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.680]  was simply about slavery now there's about a lot of things one of the things that people uh were
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:41.520]  talking about prior to the civil war was the idea of things like eerie canal uh very useful thing
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:45.920]  great thing at the time a great way to move products when they didn't have railroads when they
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:51.680]  didn't have automobiles they didn't have a federal interstate system but the people who didn't live
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.400]  in pennsylvania said we should not be billed to build this a charge to uh to build this infrastructure
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.400]  in pennsylvania people in pennsylvania ought to be building that and that's absolutely right and i
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:06.720]  think that's something that we can invest in when we look at the marshal plan that rebuilt
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:13.280]  europe after world war two uh that was a debt that was incurred that was money that was invested
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:20.160]  but that was building something that was productive as opposed to what the world bank under people like
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:26.000]  robert magnimer did after he finished uh destroying a large part of american american
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.200]  military with vietnam war he went on to the world bank and uh was accused of rent seeking
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:35.520]  because what he did was extended loans to the third world not to build infrastructure but to
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:41.280]  build a welfare state and all that was doing was creating a uh turning people into serfs okay it
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:47.520]  wasn't making them more productive all it did was uh put them in a situation where they owed money to
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.720]  the world bank and we see how that is working out throughout europe throughout greece and italy
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:45:00.000]  and these other places now they have turned that rent seeking uh take tactic onto the first world
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.600]  and one of the ways we see that happening here in america is toll roads and we need to look at
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.680]  what's happened here in texas and where i came from in north carolina in both of these places what
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:17.120]  we've seen is a spanish corporation that typically runs these uh toll roads and uh they they did it
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.520]  here in texas they went to understand that as they built this toll road in texas they raised the
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.640]  speed limit famously to 85 miles an hour but at the same time they dropped the speed limit uh from
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.360]  65 to 55 on adjacent roads they got an agreement from the texas department transportation that
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:38.240]  they would not build a new infrastructure that they would not uh improve the adjacent roads
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.560]  because they wanted to have everybody essentially forced onto their uh toll roads and people here
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.880]  in texas don't like toll roads we don't like having to pay yet again when we've already paid taxes
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:53.840]  at the pump nobody's riding these things so they've gone bankrupt now is that a bankruptcy for the
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.760]  texas the people who live here in texas no that uh spanish corporation may turn it back over to the
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.400]  banks they'll flip this and resell it just like all the banks did our homes when they took them
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:09.120]  during the mortgage crisis they're not going the banks will continue to make money off of this
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:14.640]  it's the american taxpayer at the federal level that is going to pay for this so all of you who
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.840]  don't live in texas you're going to pay for the failure of our texas toll road that's going on here
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.240]  and there's another one that's going on here in america in texas and that is a high speed rail
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:30.000]  project that is going between dallas and houston this is a japanese company that is trying to put
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.280]  this through and literally run roughshod over people's property dissecting these farms that are in
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.320]  the middle of it uh running these people's lifestyle taking it with imminent domain i'm very opposed to
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:43.600]  that sort of thing i'm very opposed to having this turned over and the way this happened in north
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:49.920]  carolina is there's this thing called the american legislative exchange council uh alec and this is
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:54.480]  something that really is popular with republicans especially and they go to these conferences they
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:47:00.720]  have these wonderful uh conferences at uh beach front property they go hang out for a week and
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:05.280]  they give them these bills and all they have to do is fill in the name of the state at the top
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.080]  and sign it at the bottom and introduce it so this is the legislation that's written for them by
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.600]  these crony capitalists and that's the way they got the toll road approved in north carolina
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.240]  that they may still build even though we've seen this thing go bankrupt here now what i'm concerned
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.440]  about with this uh trillion dollar build out that donald trump has got is that we're going to see that
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:30.720]  same sort of thing i did a report earlier about uh we stopped the tpp but we got to watch out for
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:36.320]  the ppp and it's the private public partnerships we have libertarians who say government can do no
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.040]  good and business can do no wrong the socialists flip it around they say government can do no wrong
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:47.520]  business can do no right what really is dangerous are these private public partnerships where you
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.160]  get government and business working together and that's when you see the worst of government the
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:58.880]  worst of business and what we see coming towards us and we ought to talk about this uh these these
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:04.480]  driverless cars at mercedes is worried about getting bullied okay when we look at uh this crony
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:11.920]  capitalism that is part of tpp you've got a few uh corporations and individuals who want to run
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:18.000]  own everything they want to turn the rest of us into uh they want to give us a basic income but
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.280]  they're not going to let us have jobs they don't want us to own our homes they're going to force
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:26.880]  us into the cities under agenda 21 they want to own and control everything including our transportation
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.520]  and you should be very concerned about toll roads just like you should be very concerned
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.400]  about these self-driving cars that is an effort to take over your transportation it is war against
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.400]  the people by just as globalism and the elite it is that is another tactic of this and the way
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.080]  when you're at war with people what you do is you take over their their infrastructure and
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:50.880]  that's what i'm very concerned about well people have always told me don't forget about the forest
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.280]  through the trees right and for the last year and a half we've been staring at the exact same
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.640]  tree the presidential election and for myself kind of forgetting about the forest and after
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:05.040]  trump won i've been i've been asking myself how do i transition as a journalist how do i transition
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:10.400]  here as a reporter for info wars and i'm curious is this the transition that we're seeing are are
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.840]  we going to actually be able to come on air here and instead of try to bring attention to Fukushima
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:20.000]  the fluoride in the water everything we've been covering are we going to actually have the opportunity
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.160]  to come on air here and debate about what's best for the american infrastructure yeah are we going
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.800]  to actually be able to come on here with you the listener we the people all together and actually
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.600]  determine our country's future determine our country's fate again is this the reality is this
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.880]  the transition is this now what i do as a reporter at info wars obviously we still want to fight you
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.760]  know the stuff i mentioned and bring awareness to it but i'm curious i mean is that the transition
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.320]  we're seeing is the trump administration going to allow the people to actually determine their
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.120]  fate again is the fact that the american people have been awoken by this presidential election
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:57.200]  mean that now these types of debates are going to be injected at the dinner table when you're out
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:01.440]  with your friends drinking having a good time whatever it may be i mean that's exciting for
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.080]  me to think about these are the debates now that we can actually have and then maybe we can actually
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:12.640]  see some of the results manifest itself in our infrastructure in our foreign policy in our border
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:18.080]  policy everything i mean i feel like perhaps there's a renaissance now where we actually feel that we
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.560]  can control our future and now we're motivated to do something about it we don't have the obamas
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.360]  the bushes the clintons who already have the predetermined fate in the office now we have someone
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.680]  who's willing to work with the people willing to hear from the people willing to put new people
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.600]  in there as part of his transition and i think the key thing is is that trump is willing to
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.880]  listen to opposing views i think we see that with his appointment of a pre-bus as well as bannon
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.440]  the chief of staff we have seen this in other ways the people like obama and hillary clinton
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.280]  they're going to do what goldman sacks and the bankers tell them hopefully we can have policy
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.200]  decisions yeah and soros hopefully we can have policies policy decisions on things that we
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:51:00.240]  disagree with trump about and maybe we can convince him maybe not we'll be right back
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.520]  hi my name is steven holstein in my 20s i abused stimulant and anabolic steroids at the point where
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:10.000]  my adrenal glands were shot i suffered from extreme fatigue and inability to handle stress
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.040]  for over six years i had been taking adrenal supplements including herbs glandulars vitamin
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:20.160]  c and vitamin b5 all these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:26.000]  results now just after one month on synergy one and adiometics i truly feel rejuvenated
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.360]  i have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement and i did just 10 minutes
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:37.200]  after taking adiometics i then noticed synergy one made me wake up rested and with much more energy
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:42.240]  no more hungover groggy feeling upon arising i had almost considered going to another country
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:48.800]  for stem cell therapy at the last resort but now i truly feel rejuvenated on synergy one and adiometics

[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:41.200]  you'll find that at info wars store dot com uh now oan as we were talking in the last segment
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.400]  you know we're talking about this trillion dollar infrastructure plan that that trump had and you
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:52.800]  know i understand as we were saying during the break it's very attractive to roll this thing out
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:58.480]  as a using other people's money you know let's let the uh individuals finance this banks wall
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.840]  street and i'm sure that's a lot of what's behind the optimism in the stock market that we've seen
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.320]  is this trillion dollars that people look at and say hey we can put this infrastructure here but i
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:12.400]  think there's an important thing to think about and that's the constitution you know and i would
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.840]  say to mr trump this isn't your job description uh this isn't there's no authority for this on the
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:24.000]  constitution do us a favor cut our taxes leave the money with the individuals with the states
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.400]  individual jurisdictions can then decide how much they want to spend on the infrastructure
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.720]  people can pay for it themselves will have more money to pay for it themselves he's proposed
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:40.400]  the largest tax cut that any president has ever proposed that would alone by itself rebuild america
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:46.560]  and uh it's a bigger tax cut than we've seen uh from jfk uh and a bigger tax cut from reagan
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.160]  reagan did more than jfk and both of those were uh really did rebuild the country as jfk said a
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:58.320]  rising tide lifts all boats but in so many different ways this is something that needs to be done at
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:04.080]  the state level at the local level people can decide how much money on a basis by basis level
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.520]  how much money they want to invest in the infrastructure instead of having washington
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.400]  then decide where a a bridge is going to be built we've seen that before the bridge to
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.560]  nowhere okay we don't want to see that kind of corruption crony capitalism and influence
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:21.440]  being sucked into washington the problem with corruption is that there's too much power in
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:25.920]  washington there's too much money in washington it becomes a black hole it draws in the most
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:30.080]  corrupt people so if you want corruption in your administration if you want crony capitalism
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:35.680]  go with a trillion dollar uh build out of this infrastructure and that will bring the corruption
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.160]  and the crony capitalism there to washington a much better approach this goes what you originally
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.520]  had which is to cut taxes and we don't want the concentration of wealth we don't want the ownership
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.480]  of our country and the hands of a few multi-billionaires a few multinational corporations like the
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:55.040]  people who run our toll roads and again the transition that i'm feeling here where instead
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:59.600]  of you know a george bush ramming the patriot act down our throat instead of barack obama
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:06.240]  ramming any of his executive orders down our throat this is trump floating an idea out there let's
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:10.080]  see if it sticks see if people like it david night doesn't like it maybe i like it but we're out
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:15.040]  here having a debate about it and the fact that we got trump in office i think has empowered americans
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:21.200]  to feel like they actually have a stake in the future they actually have a say in what trump's
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:26.240]  administration will do what policies they'll bring forth so he floats this idea out there people
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.560]  reject to it they don't like it then he probably wipes his hands with it and if it sticks maybe
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.200]  he tries to implement that's the that's what i feel the difference is right now well he's his
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:40.240]  own man so he can change his mind and he doesn't listen to these other people as a robot stay with
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:44.560]  us we'll be right back on the other side of the break we'll talk about bullying self-driving cars
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:54.560]  dot a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:59:00.480]  because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:06.320]  to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:12.160]  we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:17.520]  off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees uh spreading disease around we have
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:21.920]  biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about that all the
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.680]  stuff there's so many things that are in it you have the name in there you have the organic
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:31.440]  clove bud the organic wormwood i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right

[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:54.080]  going to have a special report from alex jones uh info wars announces a fake news analysis
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:01:00.640]  center uh so we'll see what that is uh but that's going to be coming up at uh just after the break
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.600]  uh leon is going to be joining me and in the fourth hour we're going to have roger stone
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:12.000]  joining us through the fourth hour let's talk a little bit oan about the concerns of the
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:21.360]  mercedes-benz ceo that human drivers are going to be bullying robot cars you know they asked him
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:25.680]  he said people people often ask me why it is taking so long to get the self-driving cars
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.600]  and he says well it's not a technological issue it's not an insurance liability issues
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.600]  well maybe not i i don't know about that he says it's not customer acceptance because
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.560]  everybody wants this it's like no we don't no we don't let me tell you something okay we're
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:44.240]  just talking about these toll road situations everything the whole point of the self-driving
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:49.760]  cars is to take away car ownership and they're going to work so you're going to have a few
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:56.400]  companies that are going to lobby in washington to make sure that they are the preferred vendor
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:00.800]  already you've got ford and volvo saying they're going to start that they don't see themselves
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:06.080]  as selling cars anymore they see themselves as selling transportation solutions so what they're
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:11.120]  going to do is provide public transportation that is the dream of the government they have
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:17.280]  always wanted to control our mobility instead of having us own it ourselves and decide on an
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.800]  individual basis what kind of how much money we want to invest our car what kind of car do we
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.680]  want to drive no they will decide for you what kind of car you will drive they will decide when
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.120]  and where you can go they will decide how much it's going to cost that's why the preeminent
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.560]  company and all this is called uber because they're going to be uber always okay it's not the regime
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:42.080]  of ownership and control and so yeah that's what's really behind it they make more money understand
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  if they rent things to you then they do if they sell them to you so that's why ford and all these
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:51.280]  other kind they want to rent these cars to you rather than sell them to you when ford brings
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.160]  on its self-driving cars in 2021 they said they're only going to be available for rent they're not
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.280]  even going to sell them to you not for another five years and you'll be able to buy some of
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:04.240]  their used cars at that point but he says no the real problem is the coexistence of human drivers
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:10.560]  and robot cars see it isn't an issue all you people who constantly say well i'd like the idea
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:15.280]  that i'd be able to go on autopilot when i've got this boring commute to work every day
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.120]  you're not going to be able to coexist with humans and robot cars it will be one or the other
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.800]  there is no coexistence they keep telling us this but those of you who are fanboys of elan musk
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:32.640]  are not listening you're not listening okay and here he is again he said people are afraid of
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:37.520]  robots taking over but he says he is worried that people will bully the driverless cars that
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:42.480]  they'll cut in line that they will bully these cars and we've already had incidents where we've had
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:47.920]  oh and a guy who uh they were talking about this in california a google smart car and let's put
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.240]  the smart in quotes okay setting it a stop sign for five minutes because it couldn't get a four
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:58.480]  through a four-way stop finally they said a guy with white hair beeps the horn goes around it and
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:04.240]  rode road rage and flips him a bird right yeah he was a bully he was bullying that google smart
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.080]  well it's not like technology you know ever malfunctions so we don't need to worry about that
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:13.040]  but you know it's funny you know deepmar xlar the guy who made the comment the chief executive of
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:17.120]  mercedes benz you think he would be a smart guy but then he's worried about humans bullying cars
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:22.240]  completely asinine statement but to me i mean part of the american dream in fact in the very
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:28.880]  fabric of the american dream is a car and an open road you can go anywhere over this beautiful
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:35.760]  frontier we call america it's beautiful and you know it's it's funny about me it's funny to this uh
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.560]  for me david so okay so he admits well we've got this issue right between getting the driverless
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.280]  cars on the road what's the issue humans also let's just get ready humans get rid of humans
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.960]  get in the way of progress don't let humans get in the way of you making a bunch of money with
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:53.120]  your driver cars no get just get ready humans that's right that's the solution the humans
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:58.080]  have to go they got to get out of the factory no free will no way this is the corporate leader
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:03.120]  this is the essence of globalism and multinational senate arm service committee chairman john mccain
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:08.720]  on tuesday warned against seeking another quote reset on us russia relations this coming just one
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:13.280]  day after president latimer putin called president elect donald trump saying that he wanted to
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:18.480]  improve relations between the two countries john mccain shot back saying quote we should place as
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:24.160]  much faith in such statements as any other made by a former kgb agent who has plunged his country
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:29.280]  into tyranny murdered political opponents invaded his neighbors threatened american allies and
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.160]  attempted to undermine american elections mccain wrote this in a statement i'm confused is he
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:38.960]  talking about clinton and obama or putin here regardless it looks like another world war
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:43.520]  has been canceled thanks in part to donald trump reaching across the aisle diplomatically and
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:48.240]  vowing to fight isis together with the russians neocons like john mccain of course wouldn't be
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:53.360]  happy about this as you recall a few years ago he armed rebel militants on the ground in syria
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:58.000]  that are now isis wonder why he's opposed to this newfound friendship i'm margaret halv reporting

[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:38.880]  it came out of the wiki leaks that george soros the white house hillary e u bureaucrats and others
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.200]  we're going to counter the brexit movement england never voted to join the e you so i'm
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:47.760]  trying to get out we're going to counter that movement our sovereignty movement headed up by
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:53.520]  trump and other sovereignty movements around the world by saying we're racist we're terrorist we're
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:09:00.160]  evil and our free speech on the web has to be curtailed but because they didn't get the presidency
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:04.320]  won and because they now won't get the supreme court so they can restrict free speech as fast as
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:09.840]  they wanted to we now know the new scam facebook twitter google they've all announced along with
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:15.280]  the new york times a war on fake news and they're going to through the browsers through the internet
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:22.160]  service companies try to block you getting to websites news sites and other ad sites that have
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:28.720]  fake news and information what's happening is very very simple mainstream dinosaur discredited media
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:34.720]  that had fake pollsters and fake media analysts and all the disinformation that's been totally
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:41.360]  repudiated and proven to be a lie they weren't wrong they were congenital liars on purpose
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:47.200]  they're now desperate attempt is to flood the web through third party sites they control
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:53.440]  with so much fake news and disinformation that it discredits the entire web itself and then they
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:10:00.240]  will preside over the false flag they've staged and claim that only they can be trusted when
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:05.440]  everyone knows they're the most untrusted news sources out there before the election debacle
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.400]  they only had a six percent trust rate according to the Associated Press International study
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:16.080]  now it's got to be in negative numbers if that's possible now I showed everybody an example over
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:22.640]  the weekend of Amy Schumer running a so-called advertorial looked like an article but but it
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:28.240]  was an ad and in it she says oh I'm not really leaving the country let me clarify so that's
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:32.720]  lie number one then they have this fake newspaper clipping where Donald Trump says I hate my
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:37.760]  constituents I hate conservatives Fox News is you've got a bunch of idiots I'm going to con you
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:45.440]  basically and at the end of the article she admits it's a fake quote knowing that 90% of people
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:51.360]  don't read to the end of the article that's the fake news being put out on their servers by google
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:59.280]  by twitter by facebook by yahoo a hundred times out of one and I'm being conservative do I see
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:04.400]  it where libertarians or conservatives are putting out the fake news it's these people
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.120]  so that's their plan put out a bunch of fake news then come in and go oh my god look at all the
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:16.000]  fake news and then try to discredit the entire web saying only trust us only come to us now there
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.960]  are cases of a hundred percent blatant fake news like the Amy Schumer example still there are other
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:28.080]  fake news examples like the one in the New York Times today that attacks yours truly that said
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:35.520]  quote globalism a far-right conspiracy theory bullied by Trump globalism is the admitted
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:41.840]  planetary corporate world system establishing a technocracy for a quote world government
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:48.640]  this has been in thousands of publications including the economist time magazine the new
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:54.960]  york post the wall street journal the financial times of london and now for world government
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.480]  and how great it is and how it's autocratic how's authoritarian throwing it in our face over and
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:07.040]  over again but then coming out in a lengthy seven page article and saying that i and others
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:14.240]  literally imagined the tpp imagined nafta and gatt imagined the world trade organization
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:22.320]  talk about fake news they are denying the main political system and revolution of the last
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:27.360]  60 years pushed by the rockefellers and others they think you're stupid and you haven't read
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.640]  david rockefellers book he published eight years ago where he openly admits that he's guilty as
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:39.280]  charged setting up global government it's all over c-span we have hours and hours of world leaders
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:44.000]  saying we're establishing a world government but out of one side of their mouth they say it
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.840]  doesn't exist now the other side obama comes out and says we can't have crude nationalism
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:56.160]  and we must guard against it so alex jones and donald trump say guarding us unelected multinational
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:02.800]  corporate boards taking over like tpp unpopular on the left and right and he responds it doesn't
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:09.360]  exist even though it does exist but what does exist is nationalism and it's bad because americans or
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:15.680]  brits or anybody else for that matter mexicans germans you name it might be able to vote and
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:20.880]  kick out the corporations that have hijacked their country show again more fake news from the new
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:28.640]  york times that lied about saddam's wmds his aluminum tubes and his yellow cake undoubtedly the new
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:34.960]  main scyop against independent media is flooding the web with fake news and mainstream media putting
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:40.240]  out fake news as setting themselves up like a super snopes to be the arbiter of what's real and
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:45.280]  what's not that's why in full wars dot com is announcing a daily piece for the radio show and
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:51.600]  the nightly news where we will analyze fake corporate news and fake ads and then archive and
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.640]  chronicle that so that you can search it and index it and counter these people and i would
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.440]  encourage you as well in the fake news wars to start your own youtube channel to start your own
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:07.600]  radio show or if you already have one to make it a daily part of what you do to analyze the deception
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:17.440]  and the fraud that is the corporate collaborator media and together we will kick their ass
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:21.520]  all right welcome back to the live radio show that was alex jones talking about how we're
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  going to set up a new make it a regular event to now analyze fake news or faux news i guess
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:33.440]  maybe we could call it faux news faux news report and and joining me now is lienne macadoon lienne
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.680]  we had this report that went out last week we had paul joseph watson wrote this article
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:44.160]  about newsweek's special madame president edition that they put out i've got a magazine here from
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:51.680]  newsweek that is goes back to 1979 so it's 37 years old telling us how we were going to be out of
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:58.080]  oil within eight years this is the kind of fake news that is put out there by the establishment
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.000]  by the experts and we'll take a look at this and i'll give you some shots of this magazine because
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.760]  this is uh priceless and quite frankly this madame president thing is is kind of priceless as well
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:13.040]  we talked about this at the time it went out and again you know they we called um
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.760]  we called newsweek and said uh is this true we've had a lot of reports about this people who are
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.720]  working at bookstore said hey look they're already shipping out as if hillary clinton had won
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:29.200]  this commemorative edition of her presidency and we said well what's going on with that and i
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:32.640]  oan was talking to him on the phone i said ask him if they did one for trump and said oh yeah we
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.320]  did one for trump is like well can we see it can we get somebody that to show us a picture of that
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.120]  and said well well let me give you this number to call and uh they did nobody answered at that at
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:47.040]  that number but now we find out after the fact after the fact we see from the new york post they
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:55.040]  admit that they had printed and mailed and had in stores before the election a special edition
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:00.240]  of hillary clinton is president they had designed a cover for donald trump you can see that in the
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.720]  tweet that newsweek eventually put out there they said look we had two of them out there we had a
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:10.240]  president trump but a madame president for her yeah but here's the reality they had already
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:15.440]  printed these and shipped them to stores and then a couple of days after the election they said well
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:19.360]  we're going to print the donald trump thing sometime this week and we hope to have them
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:24.800]  shipped out to stores next week had printed them up so they hadn't done anything on it is the reality
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:29.520]  of it but i want to take a look at this and of course you can now get some of those on ebay it's
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:34.160]  turning into a very valuable uh i thought that would happen yeah uh and as you can see here i
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:37.920]  printed out some of these things uh last week i actually looked into i thought maybe it'd be fun
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:41.840]  to get one of these things and go through it uh they're going about five or six hundred dollars
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:47.520]  and it's like i just can't bring myself to pay that for a newsweek magazine no matter how absurd
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:52.560]  it is i bet alex would pay for it he might he might do it but i want to this inside cover here
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.360]  that you can see in the pictures take a a shot of the desk here uh you can see this inside cover
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:00.880]  here they president clinton and they describe it and i just want to not going to read the whole
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:04.960]  thing to you i just want to hit some of the highlights they say the 2016 presidential election
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:09.760]  was unique in a number of ways this is what newsweek wrote it's not the first major female
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:14.240]  nominee for the highest office in the country the improbable rise the kind of demagogue previously
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.800]  unknown in american politics that would be donald trump they are saying and enough infighting and
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:23.280]  mud slinging for 10 election cycles but the tone of the election grew darker and more bizarre by
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:30.800]  the day as hillary went high while his supporters went low okay then they go on and say uh no stranger
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:36.080]  to trudging through the myra misogyny and her career as first lady senator in secondary state
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:41.600]  hillary president elect clinton continued to push for an issues-based campaign really i never
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:46.080]  could figure out never got to those issues yeah she had an issue of being a woman and that was the
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.720]  only issue she had and the majority women voted against her by the way interestingly enough
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:55.520]  even as a handful of trump's most deplorable supporters seeing the wide margin that clinton
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:00.640]  held among female voters no that's not true and the and the reality is and they're upset because
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:06.080]  white women voted 53 against hillary clinton and for donald trump and so they say well it was the
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:12.320]  non-white women though voted against her no there was less women non-white women than there were
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:17.360]  it was a it was a division between people who were black and hispanic but donald trump still
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:22.880]  did better with them than any presidential candidate from their GOP previously it's because
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:27.440]  they're beginning to wake up to the fact that the democrats had betrayed them by playing this
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:32.080]  racialism and yet you know you look at the women's vote or the black women's vote or the hispanic
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:38.880]  women's vote that was skewed by the massive capture of those groups by the political parties but
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:43.040]  then they go on to say americans across the country roundly rejected the fear and hate-based
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.920]  conservatism put out by donald this is newsweek and they're committed to addition this is how
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:53.600]  biased and and these people are as the first woman in history to send to the presidency
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:59.840]  arguably more experienced than any other incoming president had a corruption more more than jefferson
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:05.840]  more than madison more than anybody okay it's hillary clinton i mean she stands in the class
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:09.440]  by herself and then they finish it out with their favorite thing because they set this up
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:13.600]  at the javits center because it had a glass ceiling right right and then they said this is
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:18.800]  their last line a priceless moment in american history the highest glass ceiling in the western
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:23.840]  world has finally shattered and maybe that really did happen when she learned that she had not won
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:28.240]  the election and she was shrieking in a dark corner somewhere as she was throwing things
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:35.600]  that her staff and her husband and uh everybody helped when we come back we're going to take a look at
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:42.960]  newsweek 37 years on and this is very timely i think because today we found the largest
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.400]  reserve is made public of oil in this country that we've ever found and yet 37 years ago they
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.720]  were telling us we're going to be out of oil within eight days this newsweek weak we'll be

[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:23.440]  also especially in the the chemicals that are in soaps and shampoos that you're putting on your
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:30.960]  skin and on your hair so this is a very a very useful uh nutrient i've i've taken biotin for

[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:36.800]  in the last uh break about newsweek and their special commemorative edition alex had a special
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:42.320]  report about how we're going to do uh make it a regular feature to analyze the fake or the pho
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:48.880]  news that we see coming from the left i want to play a little clip that we've got here of the left
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:56.480]  blaming fake news uh for donald trump's win here's that clip under a fire critics say it allowed fake
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:01.840]  news to spread on the platform potentially reaching millions of people creating echo chambers and
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:06.800]  unfairly influencing the presidential election but facebook boss mark zuckerberg he is firing back
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:12.880]  against accusations that fake stories on the site influence the election a study by buzz feed showed
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:18.160]  top left wing sites published false or misleading stories about 19 percent of the time but top right
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:23.520]  wing conservative sites published almost twice as many hoax stories at 38 percent the new york
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:27.840]  time says executives at facebook are questioning the social networks influence on the outcome of
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:32.880]  the election some workers at facebook reportedly are worried about the spread of racist means
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:38.320]  facebook is accused of also spreading fake news stories they weren't worried about facebook's
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.800]  influence on the election when facebook was actively working to get hillary clinton elected
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.400]  and switching up their algorithm and same with google setting up an entire uh site for her eric
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:52.560]  schmitt working behind scenes to help her get elected they were totally fine with the way that
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.360]  they were tweaking the election then well i think what they're doing is that they realize that they're
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:03.840]  coming to the end of the road on how effective the label of conspiracy theory is right if they if
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:08.160]  you go in and you analyze something and it challenges the official story they just dismiss
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:13.760]  you as a conspiracy theorist as a ten full hat individual whatever now they've got to come up
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:18.800]  with a new term and so i think they're kind of focusing on fake news on hoax news look if you
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:25.440]  disagree with somebody debate them don't just say that it's a hoax okay what they have a problem with
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:30.240]  our sites that they disagree with what's being put out there but it doesn't make it fake it doesn't
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:36.160]  make it a hoax and if you want to talk about fake news let's take a look at newsweek and on the last
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:42.320]  segment uh we talked about the fake commemorative edition of hillary clinton just hammering over
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:46.800]  and over again how she was a woman did you notice that she was a woman they point that out multiple
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:51.760]  times and how trump is a misogynist he's a demagogue they're hateful they're dark they're
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:56.400]  everything evil and she defeated that and broke the glass ceiling well here's newsweek and again
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:01.360]  it's amazing to me these people can still be in business in 37 years this is a special report
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:06.640]  again like the hillary clinton thing the energy crisis written in 1979 because at that point
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:11.840]  in time we had jimmy carter the country was suffering from stagflation there was a general
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:16.880]  malaise as they pointed out from jimmy carter and though the days of america are over this was just
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:21.440]  before ronald reagan became president folks uh but no we were told the best days of america were
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:26.240]  behind us there was nothing to look forward to everything was moving to japan and we were gonna
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.200]  run out of oil and we're gonna show you when we come back i want you guys to focus in on this
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:37.840]  graph here look at this crude oil 1979 we've only got 8.7 years left not eight years not nine years
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:42.640]  8.7 these guys know it exactly just like they know that we're going to have yeah well they don't
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:47.600]  we're gonna have one or two degrees of increased temperature and it's going to destroy the world
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:54.160]  why because they're models we'll be right back fine the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:30:04.480]  the gcn radio network what is glenn beck's problem with newly appointed chief strategist
[02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:09.200]  steve bannon he goes on to say today that uh we're all racist if we accept steven bannon in the
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:13.760]  white house i wonder if this latest backstabbing of right wing populist isn't anyway related to the
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:18.720]  collapse of back speedy empire this is what chris minahan wrote from the information liberation
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:23.040]  he goes on to say that black lives matter activist glenn beck said if americans accept bannon in the
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:28.560]  white house we're just plain old racist now bannon is one of the foremost figureheads of the quote
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:33.600]  alt right movement according to beck which is a gloss on quote white nationalism anti-semitism
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:39.920]  and anti-feminism oh really i think it was more like a referendum on the alt left anyway beck
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:44.080]  crazily insinuates earlier this year that over in europe there are now russian operatives that
[02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:48.240]  are training those in the alt right how to fight they're even arming them giving them guns and
[02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:53.600]  training them on how to cause chaos and terror so mylo yinopoulos is over in russia right now
[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:58.960]  training on how to cause chaos mr beck check yourself i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars

[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:36.080]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night with leon macadoo we've been talking
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:41.040]  about fake news and we're going to talk a little bit more about fake news look at this uh 37 year
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:45.360]  old report from newsweek about how we're going to run out of oil but before we do that i don't want
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:50.000]  to put some put this in context with some real news the real news today we'll see this on the
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:56.320]  drudge report this is the discovery of the biggest shale oil field in the u.s ever they found 20 billion
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:34:02.640]  barrels of oil in west texas they say it's three times larger than north dakota's bocken
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:08.320]  oil fields it's the largest u.s unconventional crude accumulation ever assessed they estimate the
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:14.240]  proven reserves that they've just announced at being 900 billion dollars now they believe
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:19.200]  that in that area some geologists have said they believe there's as much as 75 billion
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:23.360]  barrels of oil so that means that they've acknowledged one quarter of what they believe
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:28.080]  may eventually be there at least one source the pioneer natural resources ceo said that
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:34.960]  if that were true if it were 75 billion barrels of oil and that's b with a uh you know a billion
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:41.120]  with a b okay that would be second only to saudi arabia's largest field so that would be the second
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:47.040]  largest reserve in the world and of course when it comes to coal that obama and hillary clinton
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:54.640]  wanted to destroy america has more far more coal than saudi arabia has oil so we are rich in natural
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:01.040]  resources here in america if we don't allow the left and the un and the globalist to shut that
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.280]  down to make us dependent to tell us that we can't use it that is why they are absolutely flipping
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:12.720]  out about donald trump because you want to talk about hoax talk about global warming man made
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:18.160]  global warming that is the ultimate hoax that is one of the key devices that they want to use
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:23.360]  to establish global governance because you have to have some way to pay for global governance so you
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:30.400]  have to have an international crisis that takes a global government to solve and then you have to
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:37.120]  be able to turn over money to that global government with a universal carbon tax or with
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:43.360]  redistribution redistribution of wealth with these carbon credits all of these are techniques that
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:48.560]  will need to be there for them to have a global government they have to have the money in order
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:54.080]  to really have that power well let's not forget i mean they're not only disallowing us from using
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:59.040]  it but they're also selling off our resources to foreign government yes yes exactly that will
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:06.000]  weigh me there and we should remember that it was a cia as well as people like george bush and others
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.200]  who sold us this idea a couple of decades ago that we had hit peak oil and that's an idea that has
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:15.040]  been around with us a very long time as a matter of fact you know if you go back and you look at
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:20.800]  the history i read a book one time about the rise of john d rockefeller okay and it was during the
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:24.560]  civil war he decided he was in pennsylvania he decided that he was not going to be drafted he
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:30.000]  wasn't going to join fight the war he was going to make a fortune because they had used a turpentine in
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  the south to light their homes they burned things in the home they didn't have electricity of course
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.720]  and the the supply of turpentine was cut off but they did have this messy stuff in pennsylvania
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:46.800]  called crude oil and they realized that they could refine that and use that as a substitution for
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:53.040]  turpentine so rockefeller bought his way out of being drafted into the military and he quickly
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:57.840]  cornered the refinery market in pennsylvania and he thought he had the world supply of oil
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:02.400]  at that time they didn't know that it was just kind of bubbling out of the ground you know like
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:07.440]  the Beverly hillbillies you know when the ground comes as bubble and crude okay well he was a
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:14.320]  pennsylvania hillbilly billionaire they they thought that they had all the oil in the world
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:19.040]  there in pennsylvania and he cornered that market and the only thing that stopped that
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:24.320]  was the discovery of oil in texas and so then he quickly moved his refinery business into
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.160]  Ohio to try to take advantage of the texas and the pennsylvania oil fields thought he had everything
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:33.360]  cornered at that point then they found it in the middle east it's like darn you know every time they
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:38.720]  i might think i got a monopoly on this they find it somewhere else and then he was joined in all
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:43.120]  this if you go back and look at wikipedia they just had a few things there 1919 david white
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:49.280]  chief geologist of the u.s geological survey said peak production of oil will be passed possibly
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:54.880]  within three years he said that 1919 then you go forward in 1953 eugene ayer's researcher for golf
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:59.840]  oil projected the u.s ultimate recoverable oil resources were a hundred billion barrels then
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:07.280]  production of the u.s would peak no later than 1960 the newsweek in 1979 this very issue right here
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.200]  the energy crisis we're running out of oil i mean there's even a great tune i always love
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:18.160]  tower power one of my favorite bands i love the music love the tune but this this song there's
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:24.160]  only so much oil on the ground uh and uh no that's not true they were believing the mainstream
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:29.280]  media's fake news their hoax news it was put out by the experts say they always argue from
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:34.080]  position of expert you should believe them when they tell you that the that we're going to have
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:38.800]  one degree of warming and the world is going to melt down here these people were telling us in
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:45.360]  eight point seven years we're going to be out of crude oil in 10.7 years in 1979 10.7 years
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:51.040]  from 1979 we're going to be out of natural gas but of course even then they were telling us we
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:59.600]  have 666.5 years left of coal so coal is pretty much an infinite supply and we have ways that we
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:05.120]  can burn that cleanly that's the key and of course it wasn't just time it was also newsweek
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:09.120]  talking about the energy mess take a look at this uh guys get a shot of this cover here
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:14.320]  i saved these things when i saw these i told my wife she was the one who had the uh uh subscription
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:19.280]  to these magazines and i i didn't really read general magazines like this i always preferred to
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:25.440]  get uh left magazines or right magazines and i said uh i'm going to keep these because this is
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:30.080]  going to be priceless and i think it is priceless i think this is more valuable than the fake hillary
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:35.920]  clinton uh edition but of course here they're talking about the massive rise in price and that's
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:42.480]  the point of the peak oil is to make sure that they hold people hostage that they blackmail us
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.920]  that they get us involved in wars in the middle east that they control this just like the beers
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:53.120]  controls the diamond uh exchange they have a monopoly on that these people who are selling
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:57.760]  us peak oil wanted to keep that and think about where these cia guys go what did george bush the
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:05.680]  guy from the northeast the uh the harvard skull and bones guy what did he do uh as as he uh you
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:11.520]  know with his cia connections well he set up zapata oil which was involved in the um uh
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.880]  bay of pigs fiasco you know there's a couple of boats uh they were named one of them was
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.480]  named zapata oil they were named barbara but of course george bush would tell you he was never
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:23.520]  involved with the cia before they appointed him as the head of the cia well if you believe that uh
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:29.920]  i've got um i've got a newsweek magazine i could sell you but it was also we see the same thing
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:35.680]  happening with uh duhurst who became lieutenant governor here in texas who single-handedly shut
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:41.440]  down the move that we had against the tsa this is a guy who left the cia after a couple of decades
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:46.000]  then spends the most money that anybody has ever spent to become lieutenant governor why
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:50.160]  because he made a fortune in the oil business so that's the way they make these they're made men
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:55.040]  okay these gangsters this dark state that is underneath us and we need to understand who
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:00.000]  these guys are because this is part of this color revolution it isn't just george soros
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.480]  it's people on the right you know we had an article from curtain demo three years ago talking
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:09.120]  about john mccain and the cia and how they were involved with the color revolutions in the dark
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:15.600]  state and they are as much a part of it as george soros and the democrats and these are the mechanisms
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.080]  that they use in this and so we see now also other articles that are on the dredge report
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:24.800]  today real news saudi arabia is warning trump not to block oil imports well we don't need to
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:30.240]  block your oil imports we got our own oil saudi and and they have been intricately linked in
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:35.760]  they've been put in the position with uh richard nixon put them in the position of controlling
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:42.080]  the petro dollar as he took us off of the gold standard he made saudi arabia the people who
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:48.000]  underwrote our currency and we have been interlinked with them as well as with the cia so this is
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.560]  the way that they have tried to control us and they think they've got an agreement where they're
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:57.840]  going to be able to cut down their production and raise the price of oil guess what ain't gonna
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:02.560]  happen because we're gonna start using american domestic oil that's one of the things donald
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:07.280]  trump said he's gonna do and i can't wait to see that happen lian yeah i mean i think it's just
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:13.360]  very interesting to see how uh we have this fascist state-run media has been going on for
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:19.920]  decades trying to convince people of of a certain reality they want to put forward and now it's
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:25.440]  finally the tables have finally turned people aren't believing this mess anymore perhaps now because
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:31.200]  we have documented history we can go back now and look and see how ridiculous this is and that's
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:36.880]  a good thing about the internet most people don't hang on to trashy magazines like this for 40 years
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:42.320]  right but most people don't you know you read this stuff and you throw it out but the internet
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:47.360]  remembers and so they want to change that don't they want to be able to flush it down the memory
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:51.920]  hole like 1984 well and that that was kind of the thing that kept hitting hillary clinton we're
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:56.400]  thinking does she not realize that we have the internet at our disposal where we can go back
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:01.440]  and get these videos of her where she's totally contradicting herself or really any of them
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:05.360]  you know that's what this whole wiki leaks thing i think it's just a great
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:11.200]  warning to anyone in the future hey just don't do dirty stuff because at some point
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:16.640]  all of your emails could be put on display but i think it's just really scary how we are entering
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:24.080]  a time where president obama is actually calling for a truthiness filter if that's not or welly
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:30.160]  and enough for you but we have this fascist state-run media and we're going to call them the
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:35.600]  alt left because you know just turn it against them use their own tactics tactics against it
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:40.400]  but they're deciding what is fake and it's anything that's in competition with them
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:45.200]  how frightening is that and these are the people it's the labels too it's just like
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:50.720]  we were talking about you know the fact that they're coming up with a fake news and hoax news
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:56.800]  because the the pejorative label of conspiracy theorist isn't doing it for them anymore because
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:02.000]  people realize that those created that term yeah cia another creation of the cia just like pig
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.480]  oil they realize that those of us who've been labeled as conspiracy theorists are the ones who
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:10.480]  are doing the research and we're doing the analysis we're telling you why we believe
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:15.440]  what is behind these stories why we challenge the official narrative and that's that's not working
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:20.000]  for them so they come up with that alt right is another example of that right because they weren't
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:27.520]  winning against liberty against libertarian as as a label so they came up with something called alt
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:32.160]  right and and i quite frankly i'm not really sure what that label means i've seen that used with a
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:36.000]  wide variety of people but it's being used in a pejorative term it's become a pejorative term
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.400]  just like conspiracy theorists right i don't acknowledge that i've never considered myself
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:46.800]  to be right uh or left okay i i reject that false dichotomy if you want a real political map take
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:50.960]  a look at the nolan chart it was done by david no one one of the founders of the libertarian party
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:55.680]  it's actually a two-dimensional chart now you guys look it up and pull it up on the screen show people
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:01.040]  but what you'll see there is a two-dimensional chart so you'll see if you map people's positions
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:05.200]  out on terms of economic freedom and personal freedom you'll see people on the left you'll
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:09.600]  see people on the right you'll see people in the center but you also see libertarians at the top
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:14.320]  authoritarians at the bottom in other words people who don't want any personal or economic freedom
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.600]  that's a much more accurate uh mapping of the political spectrum left and right is not accurate
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:24.720]  so i i refuse to buy into that false paradigm there you go right there uh libertarian at the top
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.880]  status at the bottom or authoritarian at the bottom left and right and centrist so that's a
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:33.840]  much better way to analyze people's positions on things but they want to they want to label people
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:39.520]  as right and the other part of it lian is the alt part okay you're not really genuine you're not
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:44.240]  part of the establishment you're not authentic or important you're just alternative well it's
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:50.240]  not a wonder that so many people are so confused out there and just frustrated because they are
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.680]  being fed double speak so they're saying donald trump is going to kill the first amendment he's
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:00.400]  going to be terrible for the freedom of press when they have been systematically destroying it
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:06.480]  more than a year and a half now but we see it also coming out of uh colleges this was an article
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.320]  out of the la times but also the business insider and others have talked about it
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:18.160]  this is a professor of communications who has started this master list of all of the uh fake
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.240]  news that you want to keep out of the news feed if that's not scary enough for you so now we have
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:27.840]  this fascism being taught right to students but yet there's they're calling trump and his supporters
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:33.680]  fascists as they're beating you like beating bludgeoning you so that you understand that you're
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:37.920]  the fascist oh they hate free speech they hate free speech well so we have they don't want a
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:41.520]  dialogue they don't want to debate they just look as we've seen over and over again we talked about
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:46.640]  it earlier in the show they just want to stand there and scream racist racist racist no we saw
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:51.520]  glenn beck do glenn beck is in uh breitbart is racist they're white nationalists it's like
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:55.920]  they're not white nationalists well it's interesting because you know you have breitbart
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:02.560]  on this list uh zero hedge uh you know a lot of difference it's mostly conservative uh websites
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:07.840]  that are here on this fake news of course oh good of course we are and but that's a bad
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:14.160]  gem on her but interestingly the blaze is not on there oh yeah no let me tell you why they know
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:20.640]  that they can count on glenn beck and if you ever had any doubts you look at the way that he reacted
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:26.000]  to the situation with the bundy ranch the lies that he told about people uh trying to set them up as
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:31.120]  sovereign citizens and and cliven bundy had no idea what a sovereign citizen was and he didn't
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:36.080]  understand that was a loaded term that was used by law enforcement by the feds by the southern
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:40.800]  poverty law center and when they did that that that was what glenn beck did in the wake of the
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:45.840]  bundy ranch standoff was weaponized propaganda and he lost a lot of his support there and he's lost
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:51.360]  the rest of it yeah in this election with donald trump as he refused to uh leave the never trump
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:56.960]  camp and embrace tillery clinton i mean this guy literally he's losing all of his audience on one
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:01.280]  side so now he's like groveling his way back we're not gonna get back with box news even though
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:06.160]  they're turned into the left so he's trying to get in with cnn or msnbc probably his media empire
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:12.320]  collapsed and let's not forget that it was when facebook was exposed as filtering their algorithms
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:18.480]  and uh deciding what would be trending and their trending top topics and how it was totally biased
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:24.080]  against conservative news sites they invited all these people in to have this open forum oh he
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:30.160]  was there good uh you know kissed his butt or is i call him sucker bug because he bugs the suckers
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:36.480]  that go to facebook yeah yeah well so i mean let's just remind everyone so not only did last week
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:41.760]  the new york times or i guess this was this week they put out the story globalism is a far right
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:48.720]  conspiracy theory believed by trump so globalism is a conspiracy theory but this is also cnn abccbs
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:54.400]  mbc of new york times all of these outlets that told us about weapons of mass destruction and took
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:49:00.800]  us to war and millions of people died as a result of that fake news so it was a conspiracy thing
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.480]  and it wasn't a conspiracy theory it was a thing that we were all there was a good thing for us
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:08.400]  and we should embrace it even though it's been harming us no no no in the long term it's good
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:13.600]  it's good for us so you know they sold it to us for a few months this summer as a good thing that
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:18.400]  we wanted to have and now that they've lost they've gone back to it being a conspiracy theory right
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:24.720]  i mean they just cannot stand the fact that they had all global forces in alignment of the establishment
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:32.160]  media celebrities the bushes that rolling out the obama is the we beat them all we beat them all
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:38.880]  and they can't stand it here's one of the things that distinguishes a true hoax fake lying new site
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:44.480]  with other people it's one thing to have a a new site that argues from a particular point of view
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:49.760]  and is upfront about it it's quite another thing to come out and say i'm objective i'm not biased
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.880]  i'm i have no agenda here and we have seen through these leaks that came out from julien
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:00.400]  assange and wiki leaks and others we have seen the machinations behind the scene we have seen
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:06.240]  these people working together with hillary clinton working with the dnc sending out the
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:11.120]  questions that are going to be asked at the debates at the town halls conspiring with them
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:16.560]  as to how they can promote their agenda their candidate and that's the dishonesty behind
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:22.640]  this to say i i have no agenda here i am i'm completely objective and i'm biased and yet
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.920]  they're doing this behind the scenes that's true fake news that's true hoaxes okay just as we've
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:33.280]  seen them you know call call this a conspiracy theory globalism and then say no it's real and
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.680]  it's good and now it's back to come that's the fakeness behind it right it is absolute madness
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:43.120]  and now they're combining it all to just stir massive confusion tearing down the first amendment
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:48.800]  but the fact is truth resonates and that's why we were able to take over this election and spread
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:53.840]  like wildfire because the truth resonates and they're they're not based in fact there with
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:57.120]  their arguments david night with leon macadoo will be right back after the break stay with us

[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:32.880]  shirt loud and proud leon you had an interesting point about fake news and a parallel to the
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:38.080]  nazi bakers that became a part of the debate and the libertarian party with yeah we're just
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:42.080]  like you know we're watching this fascist takeover while they're pointing their fingers calling
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:48.720]  everyone else fascist and racist and hateful and intolerant so twitter has already initiated a
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:54.720]  massive purge of prominent alt-right accounts so these are uh accounts that they deem to be alt-right
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:59.520]  they're already you know shadow banning a lot of people and so many people are celebrating this thing
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:04.160]  yeah this is their their company they don't have to give you a platform to spew your hate speech
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:09.760]  this is but then let's just a year or so ago a couple years when they were saying that that
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:16.000]  bakery had to bake the cake for the gay couple it forced them and shut them down shut them down
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.560]  no business so that you're open and you have a public business so you don't get to make that
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:25.200]  determination what about the that's a great point yeah what about these public media organizations
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:28.960]  the social media organizations that are they get to choose to shut that down they're basically
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:33.600]  becoming a public public utility at this point but now they get to decide who gets to have access
[02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:39.600]  to i mean a lot of people make their money with media that was brought up by gary johnson who
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:44.160]  was asked by an in a debate by one of the other candidates in the libertarian party so
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:51.280]  would you compel a jewish bakery to bake a cake for a to bake a noxie cake and he said oh yes
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:55.680]  absolutely i would and using that same argument and i absolutely totally disagreed with him i think
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:01.120]  it is twitter and facebook's right if they want to censor people but we need to understand
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:05.120]  that people are going to censor them they're going to boycott those organizations just like
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:10.720]  people would boycott a bakery that that wouldn't that they didn't like but i don't think we should
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:14.560]  hold a gun to people's heads and force them to do that but that is essentially the parallel
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:19.520]  how are you going to shut down a bakery that doesn't want to do a gay wedding cake especially when
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:25.360]  you're freedom of religion of course is protected there by the bill of rights but also do that the
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:31.280]  politician who forced that bakery to pay um he didn't get reelected so there you go interesting
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:36.080]  interesting and this affects far more people and it also is a contradiction of the first
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:38.880]  amendment they don't have a problem with the contradiction of the first amendment say it
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:46.720]  was to be right back with the end macadoon this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:56.400]  we're selling a product dna force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[02:58:56.400 --> 02:59:00.880]  about a group you took years for you to develop dna force for us it's been something that i've
[02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:06.000]  been working on for a long time alex because i think it's very very important what the aging
[02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:12.400]  process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres telomeres are the
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:17.440]  little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying we chose the pqq
[02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:23.200]  because it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one of the most effective substances in the
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:29.520]  world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve growth factor so this is a formula
[02:59:29.520 --> 02:59:36.080]  to deliver the maximum amount it's in powder form we have so many five star reviews i take this this

[03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:22.480]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:32.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight with leon macadoo in the next segment
[03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:36.160]  we're going to have roger stone is going to be joining us and i'll be leaving leon will be here
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:40.720]  with roger stone but i think it was a great point that you brought up just before we went to break
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.920]  leon and we didn't have enough time really to talk about it it affects people so much more to have
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:52.320]  major social media outlets like facebook and twitter and even google deciding that they're
[03:00:52.320 --> 03:00:58.800]  going to censor this or that and of course they're saying well it's our our freedom as a as a
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:05.120]  private company to decide what we want on our site and yet they have used that opposite argument
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:11.920]  to put small makers out of business who objected to doing a particular thing because it violated
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:17.120]  their free exercise of their religion which is protected so now we have the opposite going around
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:21.760]  we have these big mega corporations of course they can do whatever they want that's the double
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:26.640]  standard that we always see coming in and saying no i can shut down freedom of speech because i
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:31.920]  have private property rights right i mean it's just a total double standard you have youtube
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:36.640]  and facebook and google saying well you know we're going to cut off the advertising
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:41.920]  income for your channel you know if you have anything that we determined to be
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:46.480]  something we don't like with the language or if you're talking about politics we're just
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:50.960]  going to cut off the income stream for you you know and that's i mean that's powerful a lot of
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:57.040]  people are making their living via social media and then if you just cut them down cut them off
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:02.160]  entirely i mean that's that's very powerful so this is a total double standard that needs to be
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:06.240]  addressed i think the other part of this though too is we look at this these twitter accounts
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:10.720]  and and you know they we got glenn beck out there saying that breitbart is a white nationalist
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:14.560]  organization because what he's doing is he's conflating all these different things together
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:18.240]  with the alt right this really was a white nationalist organization that they shut down
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:23.200]  on twitter and again we're back to the you know can you uh force somebody to a jewish bakery to
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:28.800]  bake a nazi cake well gary johnson said yes i disagreed but he said yes but now these same
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:33.600]  people reverse this but i think it it points out it's very dangerous for us to buy into
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:39.200]  these language terms that they use they always pick the terms so that they have the linguistic
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:44.720]  high ground right and they make us look bad by the terms that they use and we should stop
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:49.760]  buying into this alt right label i think i think we need to identify ourselves as libertarians
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:56.560]  because that identifies the fact that our concern is individual liberty and we don't really care
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:02.080]  what uh skin color you are what your gender is or whatever we're about individual liberty that's
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:07.680]  what i'm about and uh as i said before paleo libertarian we won't go into the uh the differences
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:12.080]  between libertarian paleo but you know that's kind of more conservative uh point of view on
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:17.360]  some social issues of paleo libertarian but we need to stand with things that are clearly defined in
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:22.560]  the public eye that have a positive connotation because they know that we're about liberty we
[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:26.880]  finally hand hammered that down that it's about liberty and when you say alt right and you've
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:32.240]  got these other organizations that truly are nazi organizations or kuklaks clan organizations or
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:36.720]  white nationalist organizations and they self identify themselves as alt right and nobody
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:41.600]  really knows what that definition is if we use that same thing or we allow other people to label
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:46.880]  us that way then you've got people like glenn bett coming in and saying look they're all the same
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:50.800]  they're all the you know these people over here they're uh white nationalists as well and they're
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:55.360]  nazis as well right well and i do agree with you on that and i've i've been outspoken about
[03:03:55.360 --> 03:04:02.320]  saying that i i disagree with being labeled as that um but however we also know that they say well
[03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:08.560]  when they go low we go high but behind the scenes they go even lower and so to fight them at their
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:12.720]  own battle we really do need to use their own tactics against them that's why i say let's just
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:18.480]  start calling them the alt left fascist state-run media and you know they are using their rules for
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:23.120]  radicals they're they're using the playbook but then they're gonna make you play it you know
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:29.680]  would jesus what would jesus do that's not very christian like of you to call me alt left fascist
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:35.040]  my goodness yeah they try to make us uh you know play play by our own rulebook you know what i would
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:40.240]  like to play by our own rulebook one of the things that i don't like by some people who
[03:04:40.240 --> 03:04:45.200]  self label themselves as alt right is not just the racism the white nationalism but also the
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:50.480]  tactics of of screaming and shouting at people i i think that we need to respect people as individuals
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:55.840]  we can have a rational argument without being deliberately provocative uh deliberately hateful
[03:04:55.840 --> 03:05:02.080]  we don't want to adopt those tactics of the alt left senate arms service committee chairman
[03:05:02.080 --> 03:05:07.760]  john mccain on tuesday warned against seeking another quote reset on us russia relations
[03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:12.320]  this coming just one day after president bladam your putin called president elect donald trump
[03:05:12.320 --> 03:05:17.200]  saying that he wanted to improve relations between the two countries john mccain shot back saying
[03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:22.240]  quote we should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former kgb
[03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:27.680]  agent who has plunged his country into tyranny murdered political opponents invaded his neighbors
[03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:32.320]  threatened american allies and attempted to undermine american elections mccain wrote this
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:37.600]  in a statement i'm confused is he talking about clinton and obama or putin here regardless it looks
[03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:42.480]  like another world war has been canceled thanks in part to donald trump reaching across the aisle
[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:47.520]  diplomatically and vowing to fight isis together with the russians neocons like john mccain of
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:52.480]  course wouldn't be happy about this as you recall a few years ago he armed rebel militants on the
[03:05:52.480 --> 03:05:57.360]  ground in syria that are now isis wonder why he's opposed to this newfound friendship i'm margaret
[03:05:57.360 --> 03:06:03.120]  howell reporting for info wars dot com more than two years ago info wars first told you about our
[03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:07.840]  research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy i've told you about how scientists
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:13.440]  have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly
[03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:18.640]  started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into
[03:06:18.640 --> 03:06:24.320]  the water they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis
[03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:29.280]  worsened as it still is worsening today i was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your

[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:33.840]  switching out and leon is going to be here with our host for the fourth hour roger stone of stone
[03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:40.320]  cold truth no stranger to uh the info wars broadcast of course he was trump's first campaign
[03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:46.720]  manager he's still an advisor uh and we want to see what he has to say one week later after the
[03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:52.160]  election of course roger was also involved with stop the steel monitoring the election and i
[03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:58.560]  think it's fascinating uh roger as you're standing there setting there uh in front of all of the
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:02.080]  memorabilia that you've got from all the past campaigns that you've been in you know it's
[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:05.600]  interesting you had to stop the steel because you knew there was going to be a lot of hanky
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:12.000]  panky uh in this election and uh we saw that in spades in north carolina one particular county
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:18.240]  durham county heavily democratic uh they brought in about 90 some odd thousand votes at midnight
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:24.960]  and now that has thrown it didn't turn it over to trump because trump had a a massive uh landslide
[03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:30.160]  i believe that they they tried to um to uh edge that out but they did affect the gubernatorial
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:34.160]  race there and so now we've got a situation there that looks like they're not going to be able to
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:40.320]  decide that race until thanksgiving it is so close that it'll probably be a recount and both sides
[03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:45.840]  both the democrats and republicans uh the NAACP other leftist groups are are really angry at the
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:50.000]  city of durham the county of durham for how they rigged this election they kept the polls open for
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:54.720]  another 90 minutes so that's an example of what you knew was going to be happening and if we had
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:59.920]  a close election with donald trump we would be seeing this happening nationwide wouldn't we roger
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:06.240]  absolutely david first of all i want to say thank you to info wars dot com and alex jones
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:12.400]  for letting me sit in today uh you really are the tip of the spear i think people don't understand
[03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:18.160]  in the mainstream media the millions and millions of foot soldiers that info wars dot com
[03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:26.480]  empowered uh and inspired and mobilized uh in the trump revolution so here we are eight days in
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:32.560]  and as we look back on it you're exactly right the good news here is the tsunami was so large
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:38.480]  that they couldn't steal it although make no mistake about it they had uh extensive plans
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:47.840]  to do so as you know uh david boys uh at boy shiller the same lawyer who headed the gore 2000
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:56.400]  recount went to the u.s supreme court in an attempt to stop us from exit polling uh in order to be
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:02.320]  able to check on the honesty and the integrity of the election uh fortunately the u.s supreme
[03:11:02.320 --> 03:11:10.560]  court ruled against him so the current score is stone two boys zero i'm happy i'm happy to say
[03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:13.440]  that's great and of course that's the key way that they want to steal it they want to make
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:17.360]  sure there's no exit polls here in texas they want to take the electronic voting machines
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:24.160]  and shut down any uh ability to track these ballots after the fact so we're on to their games
[03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:29.440]  and you have done a a magnificent job of educating the american public and i think really at this
[03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:34.640]  point we need to from the position of the winner so they can't say this is simply sour grapes we
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:39.360]  need to push forward with real election reform but i know you've got your your own uh subjects there
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:43.920]  that you want to talk about i'm going to check out and turn this over to uh to you roger and to
[03:11:43.920 --> 03:11:51.840]  lian macadoo thank you many thanks david now you were a leading candidate for the stone cold truth
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:58.240]  best and worst dress list which will come out on new year's day as it has for 10 years you may
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:05.360]  know the background on this uh mr blackwell who was a very famous hollywood based columnist
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:11.600]  designer would put out a list every new year's day of the best and worst dressed celebrities
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:18.560]  athletes movie stars socialites and so on uh he passed away some 12 years ago i think we have
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:25.520]  revived this tradition uh it is done again every new year's day now i'm going to warn you david
[03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:30.640]  you're a contender but if i see you on the air without a neck time again you could drop right
[03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:35.840]  off the list you could put me in in both categories i probably end up in the top five no no no
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:42.160]  no you're not at all you are you are an excellent dresser and you know look oh thank you feel good
[03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:47.680]  look good thank you thank you back to you roger i'm gonna i'm gonna check out and turn this over
[03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:56.560]  to you in the end great many thanks so uh we are eight days into the uh trump revolution uh it's
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:03.120]  given us a chance to sit back and look at the numbers uh and figure out how all of this happened
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:08.400]  as you know the mainstream media had donald trump dead and buried it was over hillary was picking
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:15.680]  her cabinet she had scheduled her fireworks uh for new york um the uh clique around her was
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:20.800]  beginning to plan how they were going to take away our guns how they were going to abridge
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:28.080]  our civil liberties and most importantly how they were going to crack down on the alternative media
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:35.840]  even today we see facebook uh and google uh deciding that they are going to begin limiting
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:43.520]  what they call fake news well what is fake news this is a slippery slope in my opinion uh at some
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:51.280]  point um is uh is info wars dot com fake news is breitbart fake news is town hall fake news is daily
[03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:58.960]  caller fake news i think this is the rubric uh that they were planning to use to silence our voices
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:05.440]  that would leave the mainstream media with a monopoly on information as they had before
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:13.440]  when only abc cbs and nbc um held forth and really did control the national narrative if it didn't
[03:14:13.440 --> 03:14:20.640]  happen on one of those three networks and then later cnn and fox well then it didn't happen
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:29.440]  at all so i think that has been averted as i look back on the election i see one pivotal
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:36.320]  decision that i think made all the difference uh and that was that in the closing days of the
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:43.920]  election uh the trump campaign made a strategic judgment to expand the map they made a foray
[03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:50.880]  into michigan and wisconsin that would turn out to be pivotal that would actually win
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:57.120]  this election for donald trump now i noticed that hillary did not campaign in those states
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:04.400]  i noticed that polls i was watching both private polls and public polls showed that trump was on
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:11.120]  the move in both places and of course the rest is history he dropped in in both places barnstorming
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:17.120]  in the case of michigan with only a few hours notice 35 000 people turned out to greet him
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:25.600]  and i think that he dominated state media in both of those states for the close uh if there's any
[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:32.880]  one decision that i would point to it would be this one and i think the credit goes to steve bannon
[03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:40.560]  uh who is under fire today we'll talk about that a little later um for really the most important
[03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:49.440]  decision in terms of turning this election so if i had to point to any one item that would be it
[03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:55.280]  studying it as a student of american politics someone who's been involved in
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:59.840]  nine presidential campaigns proud to say i work for three republican presidents
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:05.840]  you can see the trend line trump was gaining steadily the last two weeks in the beginning
[03:16:05.840 --> 03:16:11.680]  hillary was sitting still and it was clear that he would pass her then she began to drop
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:24.320]  the announcement of the 680 000 emails that were on the abedin weiner server emails that fbi
[03:16:24.320 --> 03:16:31.120]  director comey is lying about this is the treasure trove of criminality including treason pay for
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:38.800]  play corruption sexual exploitation um we're not finished by a long shot with this story but
[03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:48.480]  that revelation only accelerated trump's climb and he crossed the line essentially passed her at
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:55.920]  exactly the right time now former president nixon a mentor of mine somebody i learned a great deal
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:17:02.960]  from believe very strongly that you had to bring your campaign to a peak at exactly the right time
[03:17:03.520 --> 03:17:10.640]  so uh i think trump did that i think you cannot understate the key role that info wars dot com
[03:17:11.200 --> 03:17:16.480]  played in that victory i understand the new york times is working on a profile on alex jones
[03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:23.840]  should be posted any moment now which i think recognizes the incredible role that was played
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:32.560]  here so if congratulations are in order if anybody is to be declared an mvp it has to be among them
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:39.200]  alex jones and the crew here at info wars dot com well we certainly appreciate that i i know we've
[03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:45.440]  been hearing that a lot roger and thank you so much it's just so incredible how uh this full-on
[03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:51.200]  onslaught to actually have the president come out and say uh that we need a truthiness filter
[03:17:51.760 --> 03:17:57.120]  and to wax poetic for the days when there was only three media outlets that were giving people
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:18:02.320]  access to the news when they had control over the propaganda channels and and how they're really
[03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:08.880]  trying to move back in that direction but then their slogan is oh we're moving forward not backward
[03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:13.920]  and they've got other little fascist protesters out there saying we we're not going to go backward
[03:18:13.920 --> 03:18:18.480]  yet we want to go with our state run propaganda media it's just it's incredible i mean
[03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:23.600]  what do you see i know we've got about a minute and a half left here but going forward are they
[03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:31.520]  going to uphold the separation of powers and and check power rather than elect power well look i
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:39.040]  think these uh demonstrations are uh they're a false flag this is a macguffin uh these are fraudulent
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:45.520]  meaning they're paid for by george soros and his allies they're hunkered down in washington even as
[03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:52.960]  we speak licking their wounds they spent at least 500 million dollars on these various phony outside
[03:18:52.960 --> 03:19:00.880]  groups i myself was a victim of media matters uh for america which is a front group run by the
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:05.760]  criminal david brock who was money laundering uh there's an extensive complaint at the federal
[03:19:05.760 --> 03:19:11.760]  election commission trust me if we on the right did what brock did we'd be in handcuffs right now
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:19.280]  in terms of mixing hard dollars and soft dollars so uh i don't think that these demonstrations
[03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:25.760]  are sustainable we know for example in the portland demonstration most of people who showed up didn't
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:32.080]  even vote in my hometown of fort lauderdale there were flyers saying that donald trump
[03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:38.240]  was going to nullify gay marriages that's the kind of disinformation that we're fighting right when he
[03:19:38.240 --> 03:19:43.520]  has been outspoken uh saying you know he was congratulating elton john on his marriage you
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:49.200]  know many years ago when hillary clinton and obama were both openly opposing gay marriage so
[03:19:49.200 --> 03:19:53.920]  it mean it's just total misinformation out there thank you roger stay right back stick around guys

[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:52.400]  veterans who are committed to being sure that those who supported trump are represented
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:59.360]  in this government as i have said here on info wars dot com and also at stone cold truth dot com
[03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:05.920]  the greatest danger now is the establishment boarding party the neo cons who show up out
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:11.760]  of nowhere after leaving their never trump headquarters and saying well i was with you
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:18.080]  the whole time and i want to be assistant secretary state or secretary of the treasury
[03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:27.760]  or whatever this is uh this is uh vital for people to understand now mike pence has restructured the
[03:28:27.760 --> 03:28:33.680]  entire transition the case three crowd that appears to have been brought in by governor
[03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:42.160]  chris christie um has been uh has been uh debenched they are gone the transition is undergoing uh a
[03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:49.520]  complete restructuring to make sure that those who support the trump agenda end up in this government
[03:28:50.400 --> 03:28:56.720]  leanne questions well i think i would love to get more on that after the break with the
[03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:00.960]  that the fact that they're freaking out oh they're calling it the purge that all the lobbyists have
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:05.440]  been cut from trump's transition team and like you point out the never trumpers kind of crawl out
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:11.360]  from their hole at donald trump is is very outspoken one of the main things that he
[03:29:11.920 --> 03:29:17.360]  appreciates is loyalty he he has not mince words when it comes to that and i think that
[03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:22.160]  that's something a lot of people need to understand is that that that matters to him so he made that
[03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:27.360]  very clear from the get go i don't know i don't know how many lobbyists in their gucci shoes have
[03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:33.360]  jumped off the fourteenth street bridge but it's a high number there is panic in the city oh my god
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:39.040]  we have a president who can't be bought and can't be bullied we have a president that nobody owns
[03:29:39.040 --> 03:29:44.640]  it's music to my ears i'm headed to washington next week i can't wait well we'll be right back
[03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:55.520]  with more from roger stone we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:55.520 --> 03:30:05.440]  network what is glenn beck's problem with newly appointed chief strategist steve bannon he goes on
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:10.240]  to say today that uh we're all racist if we accept steven bannon in the white house i wonder if this
[03:30:10.240 --> 03:30:14.880]  latest backstabbing of right wing populist isn't anyway related to the collapse of back speedy
[03:30:14.880 --> 03:30:19.600]  empire this is what chris minahan wrote from the information liberation he goes on to say that black
[03:30:19.600 --> 03:30:24.320]  lives matter activist glenn beck said if americans accept bannon in the white house we're just plain
[03:30:24.320 --> 03:30:29.360]  old racist now bannon is one of the foremost figureheads of the quote alt right movement
[03:30:29.360 --> 03:30:35.360]  according to beck which is a gloss on quote white nationalism anti-semitism and anti-feminism oh really
[03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:41.360]  i think it was more like a referendum on the alt left anyway beck crazily insinuates earlier this
[03:30:41.360 --> 03:30:45.280]  year that over in europe they're now russian operatives that are training those in the alt
[03:30:45.280 --> 03:30:49.840]  right how to fight they're even arming them giving them guns and training them on how to cause chaos
[03:30:49.840 --> 03:30:55.760]  and terror so mylo yinopoulos is over in russia right now training on how to cause chaos mr beck

[03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:28.800]  the remainder of the hour is roger stone of stone cold truth dot com now roger before the break we
[03:33:28.800 --> 03:33:34.480]  were talking a little bit about trumps transition team and just looking at how the media is in a
[03:33:34.480 --> 03:33:40.400]  frenzy saying there's reports of turmoil on the transition it's it's eight days i mean typically
[03:33:40.400 --> 03:33:46.160]  you're you're gonna see the uh these staff picks taking about five weeks i mean take some time get
[03:33:46.160 --> 03:33:51.840]  to kind of the ins and outs here but uh what is a president elect and and future president trump
[03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:58.240]  going to be doing to fight a press that's already positioning themselves to be non-friendly well
[03:33:58.240 --> 03:34:04.160]  yeah and i think your analysis is exactly right i was a member of president ronald reagan's transition
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:11.600]  not once but twice uh so i have seen this movie uh and uh there are an enormous number of federal
[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:18.320]  positions that must be filled but i think they are wise to take their time to sort out the best
[03:34:18.320 --> 03:34:25.520]  qualified people but most importantly those who are not globalists those who are not neocons i mean
[03:34:25.520 --> 03:34:31.600]  we didn't defeat jeb bush so that we could empower his lackeys that that wasn't the point of this
[03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:37.600]  election and now you have uh two things going on in washington i think that are very important one
[03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:45.760]  is the unprecedented personal attack on steve bannon now in full disclosure i write for bright
[03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:52.960]  bart and i intend you intend to continue writing for them i think steve bannon is a freedom fighter
[03:34:52.960 --> 03:35:00.880]  i think uh that he can think outside the box he understands the new media he uh particularly
[03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:06.560]  understands who donald trump's enemies are he understands the globalist threat he understands
[03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:13.600]  the threat of the uh of the neocons and those who would immerse us in war without reason and he is
[03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:18.720]  particularly focused on the immigration issue and the fact that our current immigration policies
[03:35:18.720 --> 03:35:25.840]  have left our our neighborhoods and our homes unsafe now bannon who i have known for some time
[03:35:25.840 --> 03:35:36.480]  is not an anti-semite has never been an anti-semite this is a canard this is a fraud uh why are they
[03:35:36.480 --> 03:35:44.080]  so desperate to unhorse steve bannon because he gets it because he knows who the bad guys are and
[03:35:44.080 --> 03:35:52.080]  because the war he has waged at bright bart is focused exactly at the mainstream media now i'm
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:58.960]  glad to see we're starting to get some balance i saw the national jewish coalition come forward and
[03:35:58.960 --> 03:36:05.200]  denounce these attacks as fraudulent uh but it has to be tough to be steve bannon to go home every
[03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:11.760]  night after they have dumped this load of garbage on you steve bannon is not a hater has never been
[03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:18.800]  a hater he is the garter of the trump flame or i should say the guardian of the trump flame
[03:36:18.800 --> 03:36:24.720]  and that's why they want to get rid of him because he's got their number and he understands
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:31.200]  that the globalists the soros funded globalists they're not going to quit they're not going to go
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:38.240]  away just because they uh lost an election so um i am particularly proud to call steve bannon my
[03:36:38.240 --> 03:36:44.960]  friend i'm glad the president has put him in a place uh in an office that used to be people by
[03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:51.600]  uh carl rove when he was the strategist for the president of the united states and i am confident
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:58.320]  that steve bannon is going to keep the trump administration focused on the trump agenda well
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:05.440]  he's obviously proven himself as a strategist uh mr bannon was able to get us a president trump
[03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:10.960]  despite the fact that the entire establishment including the global establishment the media
[03:37:10.960 --> 03:37:18.160]  the entertainment industry everyone all cylinders were firing to take out donald trump and he was
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:23.040]  able to combat that i mean that is a massive accomplishment i was actually retweeting some
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:28.080]  articles from former breitbart employees who were like i can't believe i'm defending steve bannon
[03:37:28.080 --> 03:37:33.920]  right now but he's nothing about what the media is saying and um you know i wanted to point out
[03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:41.360]  that again the left is using these alinsky tactics the rules for radicals and this of course is number
[03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:47.840]  13 pick the target freeze it personalize it and polarize it so everything they were trying to do
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:53.280]  to take out donald trump to destroy his brand his family they didn't care if they would destroy the
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:38:00.640]  man well now they're taking that and turning it on to mr bannon exactly right look steve bannon um
[03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:06.480]  um uh is not putting words in donald trump's mouth no one puts words in donald trump's mouth
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:13.360]  i've known donald trump for almost 40 years 39 years to be exact uh i think he has helped him
[03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:22.640]  shape his message but the key instincts here on immigration on trade on our economy on our
[03:38:22.640 --> 03:38:28.400]  completely incoherent yet expensive foreign policy these are things trump has been talking
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:34.880]  about for 30 years in 1988 when he went to port smith new hampshire to address the port smith chamber
[03:38:34.880 --> 03:38:40.160]  of commerce i look back at that speech he talked about nato and the fact that it was time for our
[03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:47.520]  allies to pay their fair share he talked about the inequality of the our trade agreements and this was
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:54.880]  pre nafta so uh it is uh there's an amazing consistency in donald trump those who think
[03:38:54.880 --> 03:39:02.320]  that uh bannon or before him manifold or before him roger stone is somehow a ventriloquist that
[03:39:02.320 --> 03:39:10.080]  anyone puts words in donald trump's mouth it is just not true they hate bannon because he is
[03:39:10.080 --> 03:39:16.400]  effective they hate bannon because he has helped lead this revolution and the bad news for the
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:22.880]  soros crowd is steve bannon isn't going anywhere he's going to be right there at donald trump's
[03:39:22.880 --> 03:39:28.480]  right sleeve now the other battle royal that i'm plugged into and he is getting updates
[03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:36.880]  hourly is who is going to be the secretary of state in the next administration uh to my surprise
[03:39:36.880 --> 03:39:44.240]  former mayor rudy juliani uh probably the most effective of the trump surrogates probably the
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:49.840]  most effective speech at the republican national convention a guy that shows that he has the guts
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:54.080]  as nixon would say to grab the other guys by the hair and pull them down the cliff
[03:39:54.880 --> 03:40:00.160]  has made it clear that he is not interested in being attorney general uh but that he is interested
[03:40:00.160 --> 03:40:08.400]  in uh in fostering and guiding the trump foreign policy which in my view is a non interventionist
[03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:16.960]  foreign policy as secretary of state john bolton uh who served as the un ambassador in an interim
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:23.120]  appointment under uh george bush has made it clear that he is also interested in this job
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:32.320]  now i know bolton i like bolton i played poker with bolton he's a terrific guy but he's a neocon
[03:40:32.960 --> 03:40:39.760]  and i don't think his views reflect the president elect's views particularly not in the area of
[03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:47.040]  russia where i think he is more bellicose uh than trump is the whole idea that trump is was in the
[03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:56.000]  pocket of the russians or that um or that uh stone or manifold or or trump were on the payroll of
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:03.120]  the russians uh that's accusing us of treason by the way this was fraudulent but trump does favor
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:09.760]  a period of daytime he would like to go into hard-headed negotiations with putin and see if we can
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:18.400]  coexist without thermonuclear war uh and maybe we could actually team up to destroy isis so trump
[03:41:18.400 --> 03:41:25.280]  was ironically the peace candidate i think this is why three out of ten bernie sanders supporters
[03:41:25.280 --> 03:41:35.280]  in the end voted for trump now the other contender here other than bolton and juliani uh is senator
[03:41:35.280 --> 03:41:41.840]  corker from tennessee i think the greatest advocate of senator corker for this job is
[03:41:42.400 --> 03:41:49.840]  senator corker although ran paul the quasi libertarian because i don't think he's the purest
[03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:56.480]  who has fought that his father is and by the way i'm an admirer of rand of ron paul uh voted for him
[03:41:56.480 --> 03:42:03.680]  my last vote uh is a republican before i switched to the libertarian party was in the florida republican
[03:42:03.680 --> 03:42:11.120]  primary four years ago i probably voted for ron paul uh but ran paul has let it be known
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:19.200]  that he will filibuster the appointment of a juliani or of a bolton and that he favors uh the
[03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:27.600]  appointment of his colleague senator corker this is uh what all of washington is focused on uh this
[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:35.200]  is going to be uh the great fight i would think that juliani has the inside track if for no other
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:40.560]  reason because of his long-standing personal relationship with the president elect they
[03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:47.760]  have known each other for some 30 odd years back to rudies days as the u.s attorney uh for the
[03:42:47.760 --> 03:42:54.320]  district that includes manhattan where donald trump lives um he hasn't known bolton that long
[03:42:55.360 --> 03:43:02.080]  they have a nice relationship bolton to his credit unlike many of the never trumpers once
[03:43:02.080 --> 03:43:07.760]  donald was nominated he put his back to it he supported the candidate he made speeches on
[03:43:07.760 --> 03:43:14.720]  his behalf so my hat's off to him in that regard uh corker you may recall showed up at trump tower
[03:43:14.720 --> 03:43:21.920]  shortly after donald trump wrapped up the nomination there was widespread speculation that this meant
[03:43:21.920 --> 03:43:28.480]  we might be headed for a trump corker ticket i later learned that it was senator corker
[03:43:28.480 --> 03:43:35.520]  who requested the meeting rather than uh donald trump uh reportedly the two men got along well
[03:43:35.520 --> 03:43:41.280]  it did fuel some stories back in tennessee that corker was a vice presidential contender
[03:43:41.280 --> 03:43:49.440]  when that was never really the case uh in the meantime you have had therefore this three-way
[03:43:49.440 --> 03:43:56.640]  competition that all of the folks inside the beltway are focused on the uh the chris christy
[03:43:56.640 --> 03:44:04.560]  imprimatur uh at the transition is gone uh he has been ousted largely over the george
[03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:11.280]  washington bridge allegations to be clear at least three witnesses told the federal court that
[03:44:11.280 --> 03:44:18.080]  chris christy personally knew about and laughed about the george washington bridge closing which
[03:44:18.080 --> 03:44:25.360]  of course caused chaos in the small town of fort lee the purpose of the bridge closing to punish
[03:44:25.360 --> 03:44:31.920]  a local mayor who refused to endorse christy's reelection when christy went out the door as i
[03:44:31.920 --> 03:44:39.040]  said earlier so did the k street lobbyists it's a new day under the leadership of mic pence there
[03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:49.120]  will be uh i think a greater emphasis on loyalty to trump and adherence to the trump agenda that
[03:44:49.120 --> 03:44:55.840]  is not to say that the trump candidate cabinet won't have any democrats because leon it will
[03:44:55.840 --> 03:45:01.200]  i think this is going to be a cabinet that represents all the people uh i know that there
[03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:07.360]  are several high-level democrats who are patriots uh but who are democrats nonetheless
[03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:13.520]  who are under consideration for this administration giving it a bipartisan flavor this is something
[03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:20.160]  president nixon tried to do and failed he offered the un ambassadorship to ubert humphrey declined
[03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:27.600]  he offered a cabinet job uh to uh to uh of defense secretary to uh senator henry scoop jackson a
[03:45:27.600 --> 03:45:34.960]  hardliner from washington state he also declined so trump may achieve what both richard nixon and
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:42.240]  ronald reagan were unable to achieve by having a bipartisan cabinet are you hearing anything
[03:45:42.240 --> 03:45:47.040]  about uh attorney general picks i know a lot of people have been talking back and forth a lot on
[03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:53.520]  twitter so people are very curious i i still think jeff sessions uh who is probably my favorite
[03:45:53.520 --> 03:46:00.640]  member of the u.s senate uh is the frontrunner for that job if he wants it uh his uh chief aid
[03:46:01.120 --> 03:46:08.240]  uh uh a fellow named dearborn very able man uh a guy who really understands the trump agenda
[03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:14.880]  is playing a key role in the transition now this new york timespiece we're showing now i have no idea
[03:46:14.880 --> 03:46:21.040]  where most of this information came from there's a lot of disinformation in there a lot of people
[03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:27.760]  being mentioned for cabinet jobs who are really not under consideration when i spoke to the president
[03:46:27.760 --> 03:46:35.680]  elect last week and we had a a nice and cordial uh conversation uh which i'm not going to really get
[03:46:35.680 --> 03:46:43.440]  into other than to say i said to him well mr president how how's the transition going he said
[03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:49.200]  well i guess they're over there making their lists on the other hand i'm going to have a list of my
[03:46:49.200 --> 03:46:57.040]  own uh i'd be very surprised if jeff sessions is not on that list i know of the high regard that
[03:46:57.040 --> 03:47:03.600]  the donald trump has for him i also know that he had the courage to be for trump when nobody else
[03:47:03.600 --> 03:47:10.560]  did uh that that his colleagues in the senate thought god is this guy out of his mind but he
[03:47:10.560 --> 03:47:17.040]  turned out of course to be a sage so i would be very happy with jeff sessions as attorney general
[03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:23.440]  i wouldn't mind seeing him on the u.s supreme court focus on this though i think president
[03:47:23.440 --> 03:47:30.240]  donald trump is going to have four count them four nominations for the u.s supreme court that's
[03:47:30.240 --> 03:47:37.040]  how important this election was that is how we shape the future that's why trump's victory was
[03:47:37.040 --> 03:47:42.480]  all important right i think that really is going to be the key takeaway from this entire election
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:48.480]  so important and i forget where i was reading an article but they were sort of saying if you need
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:54.800]  any more proof that trump wasn't expecting to win this at all he he didn't prepare a speech nor does
[03:47:54.800 --> 03:48:00.960]  he have his staff picks so there's this turmoil with it to me i think that that's very impressive
[03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:08.480]  because as we learned from wiki leaks uh before president obama was even elected they were already
[03:48:08.480 --> 03:48:12.960]  saying well here's the list for the staff picks they were basically his cabinet had already been
[03:48:12.960 --> 03:48:20.080]  filled before he was even elected so to me i'm quite impressed that we're actually going through this
[03:48:20.640 --> 03:48:28.400]  the trump operation has always had uh an impromptu and spontaneous nature to it his campaign
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:35.280]  wasn't really a traditional presidential campaign it was an uprising it was an insurrection against
[03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:43.600]  the established order it was very much a guerrilla function a guerrilla oriented effort uh but it more
[03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:50.160]  than made up in intensity what it lacked in structure trump supporters were true believers
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:56.080]  our voters couldn't wait for election day they wanted to vote for donald trump and mike pens
[03:48:56.720 --> 03:49:01.600]  compare that to the job of the clinton campaign corralling voters who weren't even crazy about
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:07.520]  their candidate who were ambivalent this was reflected in the fact that her crowd sizes were
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:14.000]  were ridiculous uh and the mainstream media went to great lengths to conceal the fact that she
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:21.440]  was having trouble raising a decent crowd in places where trump was getting 20 30 40 50 uh
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:28.880]  thousand people towards the end it was really the herculean effort of donald trump that i think
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:33.760]  uh made the difference the barnstorming in those last two weeks uh leon i'm going to take this
[03:49:33.760 --> 03:49:40.160]  opportunity to remind people that the revolution is not free uh and with the inauguration coming

[03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:23.200]  dot com now before the break we were talking about a lot of these potential staff picks and
[03:54:23.200 --> 03:54:27.680]  of course uh laura ingram has actually talked a little bit about potentially being the press
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:32.560]  secretary and how cool that would be if called upon to serve our country in that capacity to me
[03:54:32.560 --> 03:54:40.000]  i think it's so spectacular that we are witnessing the establishment press shaking in their boots
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:45.120]  and then daring to say you know that now all of a sudden they're concerned about the first
[03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:53.600]  amendment now that they see their irrelevant and congratulate yourself on that yeah i love laura
[03:54:53.600 --> 03:54:58.240]  ingram i think she would be terrific if the president elect chooses to offer her that job i
[03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:04.240]  would also frankly look at monica crowley uh who has uh been a trump supporter from the beginning
[03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:11.200]  taking off her her fox hat for a moment an enormously able woman uh they would both be a
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:18.080]  great credit uh to this administration uh before we uh we move on here i do want to say again
[03:55:18.960 --> 03:55:23.840]  that if you want to support the revolution you need to go to the info wars dot com store
[03:55:24.400 --> 03:55:30.560]  where they've got some great products uh mrs stone reminds me again about bio pca which is her

[03:56:02.720 --> 03:56:10.240]  you get a product that really works so uh let me also say as we go forward uh that i again
[03:56:10.240 --> 03:56:16.800]  want to thank uh alex jones for the opportunity to be here today uh i will be wearing my trump
[03:56:16.800 --> 03:56:23.440]  is my president t-shirt on inauguration day i hope you will as well get these now folks they will
[03:56:23.440 --> 03:56:30.080]  not last forever they're going to end up in the smithsonian of that i have no doubt uh
[03:56:30.080 --> 03:56:37.760]  uh when i saw president elect trump last week he told me that anyone whose name you read in the paper
[03:56:38.640 --> 03:56:44.960]  is probably put there and generated by that person themselves all these supposed leaks
[03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:53.280]  from the transition i think are in fact self-serving leaks from those seeking to promote their
[03:56:53.280 --> 03:57:00.640]  candidacies so take everything you hear with a grain of salt until the president elect announces it
[03:57:01.360 --> 03:57:07.280]  it's not a fact now i made no secret about the fact that rince previs the current republican
[03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:14.000]  national chairman uh was not my choice was not the choice i would have made for chief of staff
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:20.480]  but i'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to president elect uh trump uh and i'm going to keep
[03:57:20.480 --> 03:57:27.680]  a close eye on mr previs to make sure that he is in lockstep with the trump agenda i think
[03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:33.920]  frankly the appointment of steve bannon is uh provides an important balance going forward bannon
[03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:42.160]  has his eye on the globalists i assure you bannon knows who the bad guys are so um it is uh uh
[03:57:42.160 --> 03:57:48.960]  important to sit back and let the president have his choices don't overreact to what you read in
[03:57:48.960 --> 03:57:56.080]  the mainstream media because there's at least a 50 chance that that is not true if you want to keep
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:58:03.200]  up with the uh progress of the trump transition and the formation of the trump revolution you can
[03:58:03.200 --> 03:58:10.960]  tune into the stone cold truth on saturdays from one to three eastern time on the genesis
[03:58:10.960 --> 03:58:16.960]  communications network and we will bring you the very latest news on the trump transition
