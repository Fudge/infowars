[00:01.000 --> 00:04.000]  Here we are in the year 2022.
[00:04.000 --> 00:07.000]  It's April 29th, Friday edition.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  Start your engines.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:18.000 --> 00:34.000]  We live on a magical planet, curdling through God's mind.
[00:34.000 --> 00:45.000]  There are those that wish to imprison humanity and use us as an engine for their plans.
[00:45.000 --> 00:56.000]  The great battle as we contend to control and empower the future of humanity is now before us.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  Will you control your destiny?
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  Or will monsters like Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and Barack Obama and their controllers
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  succeed in enslaving our magnificent species?
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  How about I just read you a few headlines here.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  We are on the precipice of a global food crisis.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  Goya food CEO warns they can't even get beans.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  Cell phone radiation causing sharp rise in Alzheimer's.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Major study.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  World Economic Forum guru, literal guru, one of the most famous in the world says,
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  we must depopulate the earth, we need less souls.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  The Christians want more, we want less.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  What a satanic statement.
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  Biden has launched a new ministry of truth headed up by one of the main Russia hoaxers.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  Talk about Orwellian major backlash to that in Congress.
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  And of course this massive news.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  Be warned, the World Health Organization's pandemic treaty will destroy all remaining freedoms
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  and unleash a global medical dictatorship.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  Which has been their plan for at least 50 years.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  That's why I found a clip from 2011.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  And it's actually still posted to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Video archives, September 14th, 2021.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  Prisonplanet.tv was subscription but I made it free because the information was so important.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  And back in 2016, we had plenty of money.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  And so I didn't need to have subscriptions anymore.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  Remember those days when I hardly even had to plug the products because we weren't being censored.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  But you have helped dig us out of the hole we're in and now our work is more important than ever.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  But the clip of where I lay out their plan for their medical dictatorship and Bill Gates and all of it
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  and that clip from 2002 that go together with it, we're going to be playing that for you today.
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  But I asked Rob Dude to go ahead and add clips of what I'm saying into it so you even get to see Bill Gates say what I'm quoting him as.
[03:05.000 --> 03:15.000]  You'll notice I quote him exactly as he made the statements about his wish to kill you and your family.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  That's the incredible thing is, this is some of the news, is that there are articles every day about me.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  So many hundreds of them, I can't even track them all, but I'll scan over them.
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  And one of the big talking points out there is that I am telling people that there's a plan to kill the public
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  and that I'm trying to make people be violent in response to that made up story.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  Even though they're all over the news saying they want to depopulate us,
[03:39.000 --> 03:47.000]  even though everything they've deployed, these poison shots, the cell phone radiation, the 5G causes massive brain damage and cancer.
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  It's all over the place and then they're in the Wall Street Journal, they're in the New York Times, they're in Bloomberg saying we want dictatorship.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  We want the end of humans. I mean, these are quotes, you can type this in.
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  And then I'm like, man, that really sounds horrible. Ministry of Truths, sexualization of children.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  So they never form a family. Devaluing currencies, imploding borders.
[04:10.000 --> 04:19.000]  And then they sit there and they go, he's a mad man, he's a dangerous man, he's lying about us and says we want to depopulate you.
[04:19.000 --> 04:30.000]  And then I've got Hirari, the spokesman of the World Economic Forum, their futurist, that they laud and worship when he goes up on the stage,
[04:30.000 --> 04:40.000]  saying your free will's gone, we're going to be gods and his new quote is we need global government to enforce inoculations.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  I have the quote. I mean, it's just what a paradox.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  It's like, well, don't listen to him, he questioned a mass shooting, of course I did and we should.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  It's our right to do it, most of the time the stuff staged.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  So it's just an incredible time to be alive. We're fighting for our lives, all of us together.
[04:55.000 --> 05:22.000]  We're going to win. Stay with us.
[05:25.000 --> 05:38.000]  It is now back in stock at M4warstore.com for 25% off.

[05:57.000 --> 06:21.000]  Please visit M4warstore.com and get your X2 today.
[06:21.000 --> 06:35.000]  Welcome my friends to this live Friday, April 29 worldwide transmission in defense of human liberty and our people's future.
[06:35.000 --> 06:43.000]  Our will is strong and if we identify the globalists and their plans, they will be defeated.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  Now they are engaged in some incredible gaslighting.
[06:49.000 --> 07:00.000]  New World Order chiefs are all over the news announcing world government, total surveillance, forced injection, mass medical imprisonment, depopulation plans,
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  ministries of truth, sexualization of five year olds to break up the family and not form lasting relationships.
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  I mean, it's all mainstream news, them telling you it's a wonderful, fantastic idea.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  And then I say it's a terrible idea and they say that man must be silenced.
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  We're not saying that. We're not in all the major newspapers saying dictatorship is good.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  We're not devaluing the currency. We're not imploding the border.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  But they are and we know they are.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  And that's why they've got a big problem because myself and G. Edward Griffin and Ron Paul and so many others before us,
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  we're exposing it and you were exposing it.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  And you know who you are out there? Some of you are 70, 80, 90 years old and call on the show 25 years.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  You've been fighting the trenches forever.
[07:54.000 --> 07:59.000]  And the only reason we got a shot to beat these people is that God inspired you to find the truth.
[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  And I want to tell you from the bottom of my heart for my family and my children that I salute you.
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  We are unbreakable when we stand with God and ask God to fill ourselves with his spirit.
[08:14.000 --> 08:23.000]  And I pray for God to pour out his spirit of strength and focus and clarity and discernment and honor and creativity and life.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  And we praise God, eternal father of the universe.
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  And thank you for the sacrifice of your son, Jesus Christ.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Thank you God. Thank you God.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  Thank you for the consciousness you've given us.
[08:41.000 --> 08:54.000]  Thank you for the will. Thank you for everything you've done.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  This news is over the top.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  I mean, I am surprised at how open they are.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  Anaphilia is good, they say. World government is good. Destroying everyone is good.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  Depopulating is good. Alzheimer's is good. Cell phone radiation is good. GMO is good.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  The deadly shots are good. We are being murdered.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  And if we lay down to this, we deserve what we get.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  But I, on the record, am saying to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates of the New World Order that you are not superior to me.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  I and my listeners and people that love God are superior to you.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  And just because we're superior, we're not going to take your free will.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  We're not going to put you in a camp and we're not going to kill you.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  And we are not going to let you do the same thing to us.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  Is that understood, little man?
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  You, you will pay for what you've done.
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  And I pray that God send angels to visit vengeance upon you.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  But none of us will harm a hair on your filthy, murderous heads.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  But God will crush you, crush you.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  You will be destroyed, not us.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  Our will breaks you.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  God breaks Bill Gates.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  You understand that?
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  You will be visited by the spirit of God.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  You will be visited by the angel.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  The same angel that visited Pharaoh.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  You are not the angel of death.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  God descends the angel of death.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  And he sends the angel of death with wrath.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  You will never suppress us.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  You will never stop us.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  You will never take our birthright.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Now that I've said that to Satan and his minions,
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  let us move to the news.
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  Let us start with clip 20.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  We are on the precipice of a global food crisis.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  Boyle Food's CEO warns.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  Inflation hitting a new 40-year high in the month of March.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  Especially getting hit hard at the grocery store.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  The price of items like dried beans, canned vegetables,
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  flour all up better than 10% from the same time just one year ago.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  Joining me right now is the president and CEO of Goya Foods, Bob Yunanwe.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  Bob, it's good to see you.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Thanks very much for being here.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  Assess the situation.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  How do you see inflation today?
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  Good to see you, Maria.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  We are on the precipice of a global food crisis.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  God created humanity.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  Humanity has created every way to destroy itself
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  from nuclear, biological, chemical.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  But now we've raised a war.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  We've weaponized food.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  In the Ukraine and Russia,
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  they represent 50% of the world's production of fertilizer.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  30% wheat, 20% corn, 2.5 million acres of sunflowers,
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  other food and minerals.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  They also have sand for fracking, sand for glass.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  And, you know, they have,
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  what Russia is doing with their land bridge,
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  they're also cutting off the Ukraine to the sea.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  They've taken Mariupol, pretty much, Odessa is left.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  If they cut off Odessa, then they basically landlock the Ukraine.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  And they can't...
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  And that's just one part of the global food shutdown.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  The main cause is the lockdowns.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  The World Bank ordered in Africa, Latin America,
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  and other major food-developing sectors.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  Now, let's go to this next clip.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  I'm going to title into the depopulation.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  I've got those clips at the World Economic Forum
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  and the World Government announcements they just made again
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  that are stunning with their World Government medical tyranny.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  But here's Governor DeSantis calling it what it is
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  and saying he's not going to go along
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  with the Biden administration's homeland security
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  thought police, Ministry of Truth.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Here's the Governor.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  But clearly, our entire principles of the country was founded on,
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  you cannot have a Ministry of Truth in this country.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  And so, let's get real here.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  Let's make sure that we're doing things to benefit Floridians and Americans,
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  but we're not going to let Biden get away with this one.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  So, we'll be fighting back.
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  We will be fighting back.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  Now, governors are fighting you.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Now, legislatures are awake.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Now, churches are awake.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  I told you that my mother was one of the biggest churches in Austin,
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Easter, that her friends invited her to.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  There were so many people that had thousands of parking lots
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  watching it on jumbo trunks.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  And the preacher, she said, sounded just like me.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  About the New World Order and the coming food collapse
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  and the takeover and the mark of the beast.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Yes!
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  Yes!
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  Yes!
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  We're not going to take this lying down.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  While Bill Gates and Horari and Schwab talk about how they're going to kill us
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  and how they're going to use the world government to do it
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  and how we are non-essential,
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  I am not going to lay down to somebody telling me
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  that they've got to roll over and die in a ditch.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  But I'm smart enough to know they've got 1,000 evil people behind each one of them
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  that will just take over, probably worse than them.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  So, we don't play their game of violence.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  We play the game of exposing them and not supporting them
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  and praying against them.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  Praying against Horari.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  Praying against Schwab.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  Praying against Obama.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Praying against the Rothschild leadership and the Rockefeller Combine.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  Praying against the CIA director who is the Carnegie head carrying all this out.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Praying that they wake up before it's too late.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  Praying they still have some shred of event in them.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Praying they come back to God.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  But for those that don't, it's not our job
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  because they have set the angel of death, their manufactured counterfeit of the angel of death
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  and God will strike back against them.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  And God will do it in God's perfect way.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  But we don't be violent.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  Even though they've attacked us with a bio weapon, we expose them.
[15:57.000 --> 16:19.000]  You see this? It's an Infowars Republic defense card with original Infowars art designed by yours truly with a little gold bar implanted in it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:27.000]  Infowars has sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Info War.

[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  And I salute you and thank you.
[16:56.000 --> 17:25.000]  This is Infowars.com today.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  It's more popular than ever.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[17:31.000 --> 17:39.000]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own band with everything else, we are running out of money to listen.
[17:39.000 --> 17:48.000]  Up to 75% off at Infowars.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[17:48.000 --> 17:57.000]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now. The biggest seller in our history at Infowars.com.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  Thank you for your support.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand Infowars.
[18:03.000 --> 18:08.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[18:13.000 --> 18:22.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works, that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at Infowars.com.
[18:48.000 --> 18:56.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost.
[18:56.000 --> 19:10.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  I've been buying this from the Mexican Rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up?
[19:30.000 --> 19:37.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, for a pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  We had like that.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  Anyway, so it's Infowarsstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  If you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[20:24.000 --> 20:31.000]  Yuval Noah Harari is worshipped by the globalist.
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  He's the rat-like spirit, announcing that they will be God and that soon we will all die.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  But our free will is nothing and that they will conquer us.
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.000]  Not so easy, rat man.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  Here's a clip of him yesterday.
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  Announcing that they need world government to carry out world tyranny
[20:54.000 --> 21:01.000]  while governments around the world sign on to a treaty to have the UN run their medical response to pandemics
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  when it's the UN itself that cooked up the weapon with Bill Gates,
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  released and then brought in the vaccine, it's not a vaccine, that continues on with the weapon.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  Talk about sick, talk about twisted, that's who these people are.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  Here he is in his latest disgusting declaration.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  It was a huge disappointment to see the lack of global leadership
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  and the lack of global cooperation over the last two years.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  In the beginning it was like watching a disaster in slow motion.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  Oh, you hate it.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  But as the virus began to spread around the world and it was still in the initial stages,
[21:35.000 --> 21:41.000]  decisive action could have stopped it and there was like, there are no adults in the room.
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.000]  Like everybody is just watching it and nobody is taking a leadership of,
[21:48.000 --> 21:55.000]  okay, let's have an international front to together help the countries most in need
[21:55.000 --> 22:01.000]  and stop this before it spreads everywhere and before we have this problem that we are now facing
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  with the mutations and the new variants.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  And there was no global leadership and what was really disappointing about it
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  is that the virus is a much more obvious and immediate threat
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  than other global problems like climate change.
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.000]  And it should have been relatively easy to unite humanity in the face of such a threat
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  and it just didn't happen.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  This is really, what's the answer?
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  I don't know.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  This is where we need to rely on politicians to do their job
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  because the scientists did their job.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  In a wonderful way to understand the virus.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  And the scientists did their job in a wonderful way.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  Yeah, cooking it up, man-made, CRISPR editors, 100% man-made.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  We had the documents, how they made it, how they released it,
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  how they tried to get the Pentagon to be involved and then they censor everybody,
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  then they block therapeutic treatments, then they give you a deadly gene therapy shot
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  that eats your liver and your heart and your lungs and your brain.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  I mean, it's just disgusting to listen to these people and all their little double meanings
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  and what they're talking about.
[23:12.000 --> 23:19.000]  Peter Dazik, Bill Gates, that little evil garden gnome, Fauci,
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  all need to be in the Supermax prison in Colorado.
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.000]  But instead, because the public is ignorant and illiterate about science and history,
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  thanks to their brainwashing, they're hearing this crap
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  and thinking, oh, as if you could stop a man-made virus like that once it got spread in China.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  As if you could do that, the only way you could do that would be to kill everybody.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  They weaponized the coronavirus with five other viruses, with an HIV delivery system,
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  they released it on us and then the very people involved, quarterbacking the whole deal,
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  sit up there and tell you they need a global multi-trillion dollar a year fund
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  to run our lives and have us have little passports and weather reports about the viruses
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  and all live in fear and wear these damn masks when they're the ones power-grabbing
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  and they're the ones that did it and they're the ones announcing world government.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  It's ridiculous.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  We have them doing it.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  We have the motive.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  We have them executing it.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  That's how people sit there and they go, how did Alan Jones, 26 months ago,
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  it's all over Twitter and all over Instagram.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  I don't even look and people send to me, how did Jones know they'd have weather reports for viruses?
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  How'd he know they'd want to take four or five shots a year?
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  How did Jones know they'd have more lockdowns?
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  How did Jones know it lasts more than 15 days?
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  How did Jones know they'd make everybody wear a mask and shut down all the sports?
[24:37.000 --> 24:45.000]  Because I read the damn documents like Operation Lockstep 2011, like Crimson Contagion,
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  like Spars, 2025, 2028.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  It's so frustrating, it's like people are blind and these little gremlins are running around,
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  they have eyes, but they are evil and if we would just open our eyes up, we'd see these damn people what they are.
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  Crazy psychotic lunatic control freaks projecting their own hatred of themselves onto us.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  Go back to the maggot.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  What's the answer?
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  I don't know.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  This is where we need to rely on politicians to do their job.
[25:16.000 --> 25:25.000]  Because the scientists did their job in a wonderful way to understand the virus, to develop treatments, to develop vaccines.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  How to use these tools?
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  This is the job of the politicians and it wasn't done really.
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  And ideally, the response to COVID should be the establishment of a global healthcare system,
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  a basic healthcare system for the entire human race.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  You know, lots of people, you mentioned populist leaders, they are very much in favor now of building walls
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  and building fences on the borders.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  We need a wall on the border, but not between countries.
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.000]  We need a wall on the border between humanity and the viruses.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  And everything he says is a lie.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  All of the world, the globalists have gotten rid of borders and do no viral checks at the borders
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  and are getting rid of Title 42 that does that.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  And then he sits there and says, we need to control the borders and make them not happen.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  And it's the whole New World Order, the whole Davos group that are putting out those policies.
[26:24.000 --> 26:32.000]  Here's another world economic forum, darling, always on stage with Klaus Schwab.
[26:32.000 --> 26:40.000]  W-E-F GuruInfoWars.com admits they want more souls, I want less on the planet.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Who is he talking about? The Christians.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  During the World Economic Forum's W-E-F Indian Economic Summit,
[26:46.000 --> 26:55.000]  forum speaker Saad Guru, a yogi author, laughed out loud at admitting he wants more people to die.
[26:55.000 --> 27:03.000]  The visionary has been a primary speaker at the UN World Headquarters and UN Convention to combat
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  desertification, which you need carbon dioxide to combat that.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  It makes the desert turn green.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  And as a regular speaker at the W-E-F Indian Economic Summit and TED conferences,
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  and again the truth is carbon dioxide was much higher in our atmosphere previously,
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  and now it's very, very low, a trace gas, and when you boost it up even hundreds of times,
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  it makes more oxygen through the carbon cycle of plants and more life.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  And they know that the real reason that the Sahara's expanding was low carbon dioxide.
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  Look at the studies.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  Sahara expanding because of lower carbon dioxide in the last million years.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  Look, look, just type that in. Type in higher carbon dioxide, greens the desert.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  But then they're like, oh, we need to stop the desert at all.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  We need to get rid of carbon dioxide.
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  Thank God it's all held in the planet, like it was put there for us as our fuel by our daddy.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  All this was set up, the planet perfectly set by the sun, the moon in the exact location
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  where it needs to be for this perfect climate.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  I mean, we were given the launch pad, and these gremlins are like,
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  anything that's good to get us off the planet and go next level,
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  they are dynamiting and attacking and destroying.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  Because their transmission, their job from this thing is kill them, destroy them, annihilate them,
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  shut it down, sabotage it, infuse them.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  And it just transmits that over and over.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  I will give you power if you shut them down.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  Kill them, kill them, kill them, kill them, kill them, kill them, kill them.
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  It's transmitting. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill the humans, kill the humans, kill the humans.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  What is it? Satan, an alien.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  It's all right there in the Bible.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  And these people are dialed into it and they are under its control and we need to defeat them.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  We can wake up and rally against them, we can do it together.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  So I'm going to play the clip of him talking about killing everybody.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  Oh, they're like, oh, kill everyone.
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  m4wars.com, tomorrow's news today. We'll play the clip when we come back.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  The UN estimates that over 2 billion people alive on Earth today have cognitive disabilities,
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.000]  lower IQs and so many other medical issues because of one thing, iodine deficiency.
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.000]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  so it's not absorbable in the body.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-reth crystals,
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  more than 7,000 feet deep.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  X2 is an amazing product and it has been sold out for months and months and months.

[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  Because the bringer of death is here
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  I choose life
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  So you got this smart mouth guru
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  walking around putting on his act
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  like he's all high and mighty
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  up there laughing about how they want to depopulate us
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  at the World Economic Forum
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  Let's hear from this piece of garbage
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  So in the session we just attended
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  here at the Economic Forum
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  I think there was a sense of relief actually
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  in your frankness
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  You brought up some issues that others are reluctant to bring up
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  That's my trouble
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Always
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  All the religious groups are against me
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  because I'm talking about population
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  They want more souls
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  I want less on the planet
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Then blow your head off then
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  I'm not gonna do it
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  nothing violent against you
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  just shove a shotgun in your mouth
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  and blow your brains out buddy
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  pour gasoline on yourself
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  feed yourself into a wood chipper
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  jump off a 50 story building
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  just get out of my way
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  You wanna kill people big man?
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  You like running your freaking mouth
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  talking about it
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  I say God's gonna step on you
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  like a cockroach when you turn the lights on at midnight
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  You want death brother?
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  You're gonna get it
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  You like death?
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  You're gonna get it, you understand that
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  you little piece of filth
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  God is gonna wrap his hands around
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  your neck until your eyes pop
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  out of your skull murderer
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  You and that little tart
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  you're interviewing
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  you guys sitting there in a giggle
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  you got the courage to talk about killing people
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  man aren't you great
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  all those starving children
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  under two years of lock-downs
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  25 million of them
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  man aren't you a champion
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  but you don't have the nerve
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  to go in there and kill them with a hatchet
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  no no
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  you're just gonna starve to death
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  and sit around your private jets
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  and run around and laugh while they die
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  God hates you guru
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  dipshit
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  and God is gonna stomp you into the ground
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  you thug
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  you thuggy
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  you little slimebag
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  I know who you are
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  God's gonna cut you down
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  not us, we're peaceful
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  we love everybody
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  we just sit back and let daddy take care of it
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  but we're gonna do the groundwork
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  and then when God's ready
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  it won't be us that go into the furnace
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  it'll be you
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  because you ask for it
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  you are conjuring us
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  you are rising
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  the resistance which we are
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  we will not be stopped
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  you
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  you
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  you will die
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  not us
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  you fraud
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  you succubus
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  you liar
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  you Luciferian filth
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  bringer of death
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  bringer of death
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  if you want death
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  bringer of death
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  to you
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  you did it
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  you ask for it
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  and God's gonna just let that door slide open
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  and hear everything
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  you ask for
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  everything you wanted to happen to us
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  will happen to you
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  and all your rituals you conduct
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  to try to divert all of that karmic energy
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  will not be
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  deflected
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  it will bounce back a thousand times
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  stronger and will incinerate you
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  because you are the threat
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  you have announced you want to kill everybody
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  because deep down you know it's you
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  that needs
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  to die
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  you want us to die
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  I got a better idea
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  I got a better idea
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  how about we all pray
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  for justice
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  how about we ask God
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  ask God
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  to punish these people
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  and if we get hurt in the process
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  well that's just collateral damage
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  isn't it
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  look at that fraud
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  look at that fake acting like he's deep
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  acting like he's great
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  hanging out in the scum of the earth
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  pushing bill gates
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  poison vaccine agenda on India
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  to kill those great people
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  that thug
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  that's what he is is a thug
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  a thug look that word up a thuggy
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  creeping around acting all powerful
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  acting all tough I guarantee you
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  you put him on the rack
[39:58.000 --> 40:04.000]  he'll beg for his mama in five seconds
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  bring her to death
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  God is the bringer of death
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  not you Lucifer
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  you little twit
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  you're a little cool
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  John Lennon outfit
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  but John Lennon was against your deep
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  population
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  he was up to the satanist and was singing songs about it
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  because he'd been part of it
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  and that's why they killed him better than Hammer
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  but he lives on he's real
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  you're not you're a sack of garbage
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  all right get that maggot off the screen thank you
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  we have a lot of news to cover
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  I got a little piece of good news for you
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  all over France
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  farmers are coming in
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  and dumping thousands
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  hundreds of thousands of tractors
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  and trucks are dumping
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  thousands of pounds of manure
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  and no one is buying
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  that macron won by 15 points
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  or whatever
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  you believe in that you believe in Santa Claus
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  and so the farmers
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  are saying
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  you clean it up government
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  you go ahead
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  and just enjoy yourself
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  because we're done
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  and the rank and fall police are done as well
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  and you've got just a few little
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  cowardly globalist hiding back
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  taking their orders from Clauss
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  while the New World Order
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  as in front of every globalist
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  institution people dump
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  garbage
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  and feces
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  everywhere
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  as a message of who you are
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  and what we think about you
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  and we salute the French people
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  you know America has
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  an anglophile
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  prejudice against the French
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  and I'm myself
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  if I was anything I'm
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Welsh German type
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  I've got a little bit of Alsatian
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  I mean a tiny bit of French but the point is
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  is that the French have been amazing people
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  for thousands of years
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  and they've been amazing in war and everything else
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  and they've got their problems
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  but this whole thing of hating them
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  and making fun of them is stupid
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  and it needs to stop
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  just like when we talk about the
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  commonest Chinese and what they're under
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  it's not the Chinese people
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  the French are good people
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  and they're strong
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  and they're under a lot of evil
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  and we should pray for them
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  once they were under Hitler and then the rest of them
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  they never really got out from under it
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  and we're going under tyranny as well
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  so we can't point at them
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  under slavery and then laugh at them
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  and we're going under the same thing
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  we're all brothers and sisters together
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  whether you're an African or a French person
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  or
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  you see this

[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  and on the back it's got a hologram
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  there are only 25,000 of these in existence
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  and they'll never be made again
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  the bank that owns the mint
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  that has started putting these out the last few years
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  just sold out of 300,000
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  of a similar offering
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  that was 40% more than what we're selling these for
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  and when you get three or more
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  you can get these at 50% off

[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  let you know that the great
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  amazing Savannah Hernandez has done so much great work

[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  she will be in studio with us today
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  and then Roger Stone's on
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  you know we heard that Roger Stone
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  was back on Twitter
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  got thousands of followers in just an hour
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  and then he was deleted in the Huffington Post
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  I forgot to print all that for me
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  celebrated
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  oh look Elon is not in control
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  or Roger is censored
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  and it was a fan account
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  but I want to get his take on Elon Musk
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  and all the rest of it he will be with us
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and take calls
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  talk to Roger Stone
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  what an interesting little devil he is
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  he will be on with us in the
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  third hour today
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  I had a jay dyer
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  he is a smart cookie
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  he has documents
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  I can read them to you too
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  but he does a good job of it
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  so you can hear all about how they are going to murder you
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  and kill you
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  and take everything you got first before they do it
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  in the fourth hour today
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  I mean that is what is so frustrating
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  this is just out in the open
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  a horrible thing that is happening
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  so people ask me
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  how do you take it
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  being attacked in thousands of publications a week
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  and just all over the world
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  they tell the public this is the devil
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  and the answer is
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  I expected this
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  and I thought this would come
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  because I knew I was right
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  and I knew they would launch this operation
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  and I expected to get killed or put in prison before this
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  and so everything
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  going forward is gravy
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  I mean I can't sign on
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  to pedophilia and devil worship
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  and the population sorry
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  I have said this before I will say it again
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  if we had a boss hog
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  running things that just wanted to be in charge
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  but wanted prosperity and fun
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  I would say hey we shouldn't have boss hog
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  and I would fight boss hog
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  but I wouldn't risk my life
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  no
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  I would take a job for boss hog
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  and I do things
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  in and around boss hog
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  and I do what I could to stop boss hog
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  but I wouldn't risk my life to fight boss hog
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  because boss hog
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  loves his grandchildren
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  boss hog don't want to see everybody poor
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  he just wants to be in charge
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  and you know
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  Vladimir Putin's boss hog folks
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  so you got boss hog over here
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  he's the old fashioned thing
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  the thing we fought King George III was boss hog
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  not that bad but you know
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  we were a lot better
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  and I'd fight boss hogs
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  and I'd resist fight
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  I mean I do whatever I could to stop them
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  but I'm not going to go 100%
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  crazy-eyed
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  into a fight against boss hog
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  because I'm a little bit of boss hog and we all are
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  but you get me devil worshipping
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  better falls
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  don't want to kill everybody
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  and turn us all into cyborgs
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  baby you got me
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  laser being eyed
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  crazy to fight your ass
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  in fact I'm not afraid
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  it's the opposite
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  every damn cell in my body
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  kill our species and mutate our species
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  and turn us against each other
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  and bring us down
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  it's the opposite of fear
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  it's every damn cell punching me in the face
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  going jones you get your ass in gear
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  and you stop these people
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  and whatever you need
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  you're going to get it sonny
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  but you got a man up
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  that voice of the Holy Spirit
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  and discernment
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  the conscience
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  that program God gave us
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  is demanding
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  ordering, pushing me, punching me
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  attacking me
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  saying you have not done enough
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  you are a coward
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  you are weak
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  and I'm telling you I gave you all this power
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  to carry out an operation
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  and if you don't give me 100%
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  I'm going to dump you in with these people
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  and I'm just like
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  please just take me over then
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  I know
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  God says you have free will
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  you're going to do this
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  you signed on for this
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  and you're going to execute this
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  or I'm going to fry your ass
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  that's what God fearing is
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  do you think I fear you Satanist
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  you think I fear the new world order
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  you think I fear the mainstream media
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  I fear God
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  because I know how real God is
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  and I resonate with God
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  and I can feel that
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  it's a deliberate, focused
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  rage and annihilation
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  and so I
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  click my heels and I salute
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  and I say
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  whatever you say
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  whatever you say just please
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  please
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  oh God
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  and God says
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  you want free will don't you
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  you wanted this
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  and yes I do
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  and it's so beautiful and it's so great
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  and so powerful, it's so real
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  it's everything the Satanists are looking for
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  it's everything the left wants
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  it's all the things they crave
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  and believe they'll have
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  it's all waiting right there
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  if they just take God's hand
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  it's all they had to do
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  but they didn't do it
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  because they're ashamed of themselves
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  in God's presence
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  so they say
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  I'm ashamed of myself God
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  and so I'm gonna hate you
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  and I'm gonna try to be you
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  at the same time
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  because I don't like the way you make me feel
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  and I don't like how you order me to do things
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  and I don't like
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  how you're
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  so good
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  it's so powerful I just don't like it
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  and that's what goes on in
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  Satan's brain
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  and so Satan
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  can come find embryonic humans
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  at their
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  larval level that's what we're at
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  and say well watch what I'll do
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  to your eggs
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  we're God's eggs
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  little leggings
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  and God says
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  well that's part of the plan there sonny boy
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  and that's the Satanist argument
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  why did God do this
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  because God did
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  what was right
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  why shouldn't God
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  create trillions
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  of free souls
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  why shouldn't God create company
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  why shouldn't God create new entities
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  that have free will and can grasp
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  infinity
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  there would be a sin not to do that
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  and
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  and so that's the argument
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  your God is the ultimate Satanist
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  but it's not true
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  your God is the ultimate
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  sadist
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  but it's not true
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  God created
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  free will
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  and God did this
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  and yes Satan works for God
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  but God doesn't
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  do what Satan does
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  God didn't order Satan
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  to do this
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  but God is
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  into freedom
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  God doesn't
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  damn you to hell
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  if you read carefully
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  God sends you to the energy
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  that you resonated with and that you believed in
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  and that you wanted to be with
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  so imagine
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  an eternity with Joe Biden
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  and Lord Rothschild and Barack Obama
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  and Jimmy Savelle and Prince Charles
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  does that sound like a good place to be?
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  no
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  instead an eternity
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  with all those amazing, strong, incredible souls
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  all right we're going to go to break
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  but I got to tell you
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  I've seen the next level this is just a bootcamp folks
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  and if you think
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  you're going to go flying around up there and play harps and stuff
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  kind of thing I mean
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  when you get, let me tell you
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  when you go to the next level ladies and gentlemen
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  you're going to realize that there is a lot more going on
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  and it's so complex
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  and so fantastical and so real
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  I can't even interpret it
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  it's nothing in literature, in art, in culture
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  totally new all of it's just completely
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  I could go to Hollywood right now and write science fiction books
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  would be number one all day long
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  because this stuff's never been seen
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  this is new
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  because the average person has
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  no access to it and
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  so much of what you see
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  is things that the Satanists have seen
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  but only to a certain level
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  like you see Sauron and Lord of the Rings
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  that's what Satan looks like
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  I saw that one when I was like four years old
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  that's the exact deal
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  like Sauron
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  that's what it looks like
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  that's what it is, they've seen that
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  that's what these things are
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  look at Sauron, that's the outfit, the gear
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  the whole nine yards
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  you think it's an all seeing eye until you realize there's a portal with Sauron standing in it
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  it's not an all seeing eye
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  it's not Sauron standing right there
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  but Sauron will fall
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Sauron will fail
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  next hour's coming up
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  infowars.com to Mars news today
[57:44.000 --> 58:11.000]  The U.N. estimates that over two billion people alive on Earth today have cognitive disabilities, lower IQs and so many other medical issues because of one thing iodine deficiency and most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds so it's not absorbable in the body and that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  we have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world

[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  it was about 25 years ago
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  that I wanted to expand info wars
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years but I only had money
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  to finance my own simple little local radio show
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  I wanted to hire camera people
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  I wanted to make films
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  mass murderers agree gun control works
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  that helped us finance
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  hiring the first two members of my crew
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  that's our oldest design and we're still selling
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  we have that design over a hundred others
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  that will now all be limited editions

[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  to fund the operation
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  to get rid of inventory
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  we'll still have some teachers in the future
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  so if you want to get any of these historic shirts

[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  this particular strain of the bird flu
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  has been found in horses, dogs, birds
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  and even seals
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  but this was the first human infection
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  in the United States
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  as of early April 20
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  an outbreak of a highly contagious
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  bird flu has accounted for the
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  of 23 million birds
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  from Maine to Wyoming
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  turkeys mainly
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  who were killed in an act of precaution
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  but no one was killed
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  in an act of precaution
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  but no human infections have been reported so far
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  almost a year ago
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  in June of 2021
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  a 41 year old man in eastern China
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  was confirmed to have H10N3
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  another bird flu strain
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  and he was also the first case
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  however the last major human epidemic
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  of bird flu was in China
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  from 2016 to 2017
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  with the H7N9 virus
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  it infected almost 2,000 people
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  and killed more than 600
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  according to the United Nations statistics
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  and based on the World Health Organization's research
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  in 2018
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  the H7N9 bird flu
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  was reported to kill more than 40%
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  of those who contracted it in China
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  causing a new cycle of global panic
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  just about two years before the massive
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  corporate media and world governments
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  overreaction to COVID
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  later that year, back in 2018
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  the World Health Organization decided to name
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  the possible emergence of a deadly
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  new bird flu strain
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  disease X
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  a term used for years to refer to any number
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  of unknown future pathogens
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  that could cause an international health crisis
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  X simply meaning that it's unexpected
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  in 2017, during China's
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  bird flu epidemic, Bill Gates was well aware
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  of the H7N9 outbreak
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  as he spoke often about the possibility
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  of a pandemic
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  at a security conference in Germany
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  he said, quote
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  whether it occurs by the quirk of nature
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  at the hand of a terrorist, epidemiologists
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  show through their models that a
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  respiratory spread pathogen would kill
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  more than 30 million people
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  in less than a year
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  and there is a reasonable probability
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  of that taking place in the years ahead
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  less than three years later
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  the COVID pandemic began
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  and according to Bill Gates' own statements
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  before COVID
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  a small non-state actor could build
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  a deadly contagious disease in a biolab
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  just like COVID was made
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  so is the new breakout of bird flu in China
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  the H3N8 strain
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  the disease X the who has been waiting for
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  and was it built in a biolab as Bill Gates
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  predicted with Stephen Colbert
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  you try to warn us about this pandemic
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  and we didn't listen
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  what's the next thing you're warning us about
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  that's going to happen five years from now
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  that we're not listening to at the present
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  the idea of a bioterrorist attack
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  is kind of the nightmare scenario
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  because there a pathogen with a high death rate
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  would be ticked now the good news is
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  we're not going to depress you, it's tough enough right now
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  most of the work we're going to do
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  to be ready for pandemic two
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  I call this pandemic one
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  most of the work we'll do to be ready for that
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  are also the things we need to do
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  to minimize the threat of bioterrorism
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  perhaps the new world order will blame Russia
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  for releasing some sort of bird flu bioweapon
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  we've heard President Biden has warned
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  that the clear signs Russia is preparing
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  to use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  now he's talking about new false flags
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  he's setting up including
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  he's asserting that we, the America, are biological
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  as well as chemical weapons in Europe
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  simply not true
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  I guarantee you
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  they're also suggesting that Ukraine
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  that's a clear sign
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  they're considering using both of those
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  the White House is warning that Russia
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  may use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  possibly as part of a false flag operation
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  what could that look like
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  and how serious of an escalation would that be
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  United States believes that
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Russia may still
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  possess some chemical weapons
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  and perhaps some biological weapons
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  alright my friends, this is a longer report

[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  because without you
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  all of the great success we have had together
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  would not have happened
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  you are the tip of the spear
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  and I salute you and thank you
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  and I'll see you next time.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Thanks for joining from those targeted but championing those
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  she's got so many of her huge reports
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  she's been breaking and also posting
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  at man.video, she's about to share with us
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  here in the second hour of the broadcast today
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  but here's last week's visit
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  or a few weeks ago when she visited with Tucker Carlson
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Interesting
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  What did you think of Alex Jones?
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Loved him to death, I still talk to him to this day
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  I think that he's great and
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  I think that many more people
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  should have been vocal
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  when he was initially panned
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  I was actually there
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  I was on a fishing trip that day
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  and I was in Labrador
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  and I've regretted it ever since
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  that I didn't come out of the box
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  I wasn't there, I was off the air
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  but I completely agree
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  it was not even about Alex Jones
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  it's about you can't censor people period
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Exactly
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  and Tucker I remember the exact day when he got censored
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  I woke up and I looked on my phone
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  and it said Alex Jones banned from YouTube
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  and again I really didn't have
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  an introduction into politics
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  but I had learned a lot
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  of things from Alex Jones up front
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  and everything that he was telling me
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  was not false, the people who condemn him
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  do not listen to his show every single day
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  because I worked for him for two and a half years
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  I didn't know the three branches of government
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  when I started, now I can tell you
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  international policy
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  and what's going on all over the world right now
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  because I have listened to Alex
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  about the government corruption
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  historically that we've been through
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  all of the different operations
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  such as Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  a lot of these things, the Tuskegee experiment
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  which is why the black community is so apprehensive
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  for vaccinations in the modern day
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  he talks about a lot of these things
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  and our government doesn't like that
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  our government doesn't like being exposed
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  they don't like people who are willing to tell the truth
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  and people who are willing to push back against the narrative
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  look at the fact that the DHS just
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  updated their bulletin to say
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  you're spreading distrust in the government
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  that could be considered terrorism
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I don't think so
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  I couldn't
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  of course agree with you more but I'm fascinated
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  by the hate for Alex Jones
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  I'm not a daily Alex Jones viewer
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  I don't view anything regularly actually
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  but I think Alex Jones seems really talented
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  he's smart, he's funny
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  as hell, he's truly funny
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  he's a lot more talented than I am in a lot of ways
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  that's my takeaway from Alex Jones
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  but why is he such a threat
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  why would you hate Alex Jones
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  I've never understood that
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  because he's telling the truth Tucker
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  and again I know Alex personally
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  and I've met a lot of people in this industry
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  and one of my biggest takeaways
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  is that there are a lot of people
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  especially in conservative media
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  that are in this for money and fame
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  they don't actually care about this country
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  and they don't actually care about America
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  they're scared about being censored
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  they're scared about hurting the wrong people's feelings
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  not getting the proper endorsement
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  for sure, but he comes out, he apologizes for it
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  he corrects the record
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  which is something that many people in our media
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  refuse to do
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  so the people who hate Alex Jones hate him
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  because he is everything that they wish
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  that they could be somebody who is willing
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  to tell the truth, willing to fight for this country
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and actually cares about humanity
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  not just America but humanity as a whole
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  he owns his own company
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  and he has no advertisers
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  so he's kind of immune really
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  and the only way to stop him
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  from destroying him with lawsuits
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  for giving his opinion
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  which I guess is now a crime or something in the United States
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  so they're trying to do it that way
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  I couldn't agree with you more
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  and why do you think
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  I've already said why I didn't defend Alex Jones
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  the day he was deep platformed
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  I wasn't in the country
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  but why do you think that more in conservative media
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  didn't take a principle stand against censorship
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  when that happened
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  because Alex was off limits
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  look at the fact that right now Tucker
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  who wouldn't even mention Alex Jones' name
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  now say his name on a regular basis
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  so Alex Jones is right
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  we see this constantly
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  the people in the conservative media
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  or in the right wing even
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  will not latch on to a specific narrative
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  or tell the truth until it goes mainstream
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  and they're allowed to do it
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  so even in the conservative and the right wing
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  faction
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  the reason why we lose is because we continue to wait
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  for the left, the liberal media
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  the mainstream media to allow us
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  when we are allowed to tell the truth
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Alex did that initially from day one
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  so
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  I think that's why conservatives
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  didn't stand up for him when they should have
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  because they weren't allowed to at the time
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  I couldn't agree more but she got to take a standing
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  in censorship I think
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  especially if you're in the media
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  I find Joy Reed loathe some
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I think she's a race hater and she spreads race hate
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  however if the government pushed for her
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  to be censored I would defend Joy Reed
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  without even thinking about it
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  I don't care who it is
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  period
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  and I don't know why national review can't take that stand
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I think it's very very odd
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  and we just saw Republican
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Senator Kennedy last night with Sean
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Hannity I don't want to be enemies of these guys
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  I like them but saying well we want free speech
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  we got to ban hate speech well that's whatever
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  the Southern Private Law Center and ADL
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  define as it
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Savannah you came to work here four years ago
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  or whatever it was you did a great job
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  you went into the middle of these phrase
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  I know you got mad because you were getting attacked
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  and beat up and I said you're not going out
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  to do that anymore and she said I quit
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  massive stories everywhere
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  and now you are really exploded
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  and so I'm really pleased
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  and very thankful to
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  get to know you I gotta say
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  that little four minute clip encapsulated things perfectly
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  you get it way better than I could
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  or probably even Tucker could so congratulations
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  on being such a force
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  for freedom Savannah
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  well thank you so much Alex and
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  break I was even thanking you because you
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  really have helped me you've mentored me
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  throughout the years and you taught me the most important
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  things about this industry and that
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  is keeping truth at the forefront making
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  sure that again
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  like people stand up for you Alex that's one
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  of my biggest concerns with right wing media
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  is behind the scenes everyone loves Alex Jones
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  everyone listens to info wars
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  but they won't publicly say anything
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  until it's popular to do so
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  I've always had so much frustration with
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  that because like Drew Hernandez talked about
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  you have really been the launch pad for so many of us
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  it doesn't matter if somebody is a
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  local activist or if they're the biggest name
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  in media you will give them a platform
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  I don't want to be clear it's reporters
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  the crew and the listeners
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  that did it you guys get the credit too
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  this is all everybody together
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  that's what I wanted to do and that's what they fear is
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  a place for truth tellers to come together
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  exactly and again too that's why
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Band-Aught video is so important because you've been at the
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  forefront of highlighting
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  these reporters who are just on the ground telling
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  the truth and trying to get the truth out there
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  so it was a really great honor to be
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  on Tucker Carlson's show but it was an even greater
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  honor to be able to stand up for you
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  and say you know what I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Alex Jones
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  so many people have hated on you unjustly
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  so many people have tried to destroy you
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  so I was very honored to be able to say
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  look you know what I made it to Tucker Carlson's
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  show so many people said you know
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  and you've been on his fox show too
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  well he played a couple of my clips on there yes
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  but it was so nice to be able to be like
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  you know what people said that starting
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  my career off with Info Wars was a death sentence
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  I'm on Tucker Carlson's show now
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  so Alex Jones if anything
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  is the best point to start off on
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  because you gave me the foundation for
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  truth and to not care about
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  fame or fortune in this industry because so
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  many people do so many people fear
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  the left they fear a specific
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  narrative they fear not getting endorsement by the
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  you know correct people in this industry
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  you don't care about any of that Alex and that's the most important
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  thing that you've taught me and that is why I've been successful
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  is because you helped me with that
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  but it's also a paper tiger CNN
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  spent 300 plus million dollars
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  and failed in a month with CNN plus
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  why are we letting these losers
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  direct us and control us
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  and intimidate us because we're scared they're going to
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  attack us or lie about us
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  I'm listening about Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  I knew Joe Rogan 23 years ago
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  24 years ago and
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  we became good friends in just a few
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  years and had a lot of fun together
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  and I knew
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Joe Rogan was special when I met him
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I didn't care about Hollywood people
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  this guy I was a fan of
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  and it's the same thing with Tucker
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  I meet Tucker in person he's so charismatic
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  he's so real
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  and it's not about kissing his ass or kissing your ass
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  it's about people
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  that are into freedom are really amazing
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  and I've been around
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  the globalist I've been in private meetings with them
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  I've agreed to meet with them some of the top people
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I'm going to leave it at that
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and it just feels cold and weird
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and robotic and like you want out of there
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  and I'm around people like you
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  or Owen Troyer or this crew
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  or Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  I just want more of it
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  it's like my cells want to be with this
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  and that's why I do it
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  does that make sense?
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  definitely Alex and the reason too
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  why you're so successful
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  why anybody in this space that is just willing to tell the truth
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  is so successful is because that is something that is severely
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  lacking if you look at our media
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  they're basically telling us the exact opposite
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  of what everybody is seeing and hearing
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  with their own two eyes
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Jen Psaki is going up in front of America
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  and saying well public polling is actually showing
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  that people don't want to take their face masks off
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  on airplanes so
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  this entire administration has this
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  disinformation governance board
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  that they're pushing the same administration
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  that continuously lies to us that has elected
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  a man that is pretending to be a woman
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  to lead us in health in this country
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  be our health secretary
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  exactly stay there I want to come back as my next thing
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  disinformation board you're on target
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  the same party that tells us a man can be a woman
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  and a man can have babies
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  is telling us they're going to run the new
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Ministry of Truth Savannah Hernandez
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  in studio
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  UN estimates that over two billion
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  people alive on earth today
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  have cognitive disabilities
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  lower IQs and so many other medical
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  issues because of one thing
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  iodine deficiency and most iodine
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  that you get from different foods
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  is bound to other
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  minerals or other compounds so it's not
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  absorbable in the body
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  and that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  we have the purest cleanest
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  best iodine in the world from deep

[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  she is a firebrand
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Savannah Hernandez
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  she's got amazing intellect
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  incredible energy
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  and I am just so glad to know her
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  wow all of the
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  pro-human women I know are just so
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  fiery and beautiful and smart
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  and you look at leftist
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  they're just husk of what they were
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  just like the men that serve evil
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  I want to get into the ministry of truth next segment
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  you said you want to get first into
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  working with true social
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Trump's new social system
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  network you traveled the country
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  and you were telling me about being in San Francisco
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and having to leave
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  feeling the spiritual drain and it's the same way
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  in LA and San Francisco
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  there's something about California
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  and the people that it's like
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Kryptonite the Superman
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  I don't want to get into all of it
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  but I even because I've been out to LA
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  a lot folks and
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  it's not just when I'm at Skid Row
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  when I'm at somebody Hollywood's house or producer's house
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  I feel like my soul's being
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  drained and I've always got to get out of there
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  and you were just telling me that during the break
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  yeah I almost left halfway
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  through my trip because I had spent the
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  first half of my trip in California
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  in downtown LA in Skid Row
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  I was asking LA residents
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  hey I heard that people get chased
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  to parking garages by the homeless is that true
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  I actually got an interview with one
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  of the DA's employees saying
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  yeah a homeless guy chased me with a stick the other day
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  and then her friend said that a homeless guy
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  tried to break into her car as she was
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  in the vehicle so that was day one
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  of me being in California I also
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  got to witness the horrifying
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  scene of this man
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  that was just high on drugs downtown
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  he's screaming at everybody that passes
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  this poor little girl starts bawling
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  her eyes out because she has to walk past
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  her dad has to pick her up and console her
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  and this is just an everyday occurrence
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  for people in LA these are open
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  air death camps with triple the fentanyl
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  coming in under Biden under Trump
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  these are open air death camps where I watch
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  the escalates dealing the fentanyl
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  in front of the police when I went to Skid Row
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  in LA and nothing's done
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Alex it was absolutely insane because
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  that was happening in Skid Row you have
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  Mercedes Benz driving down the streets
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  people are doing drug deals
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  they're getting welfare money and you have
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  leptis that manage that and get part of it
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  so you have all these leptis groups giving
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  the homeless money young women
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  you name it and then they're buying drugs
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  and it's kind of crazy to Alex because
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  I had just gone to the border two weeks prior
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  on your trip so seeing the open borders
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  seeing all of the NGOs that are government
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  funded chipping illegals throughout the country
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  seeing how the fentanyl
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  crisis has been affecting our entire
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  country how illegals are
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  now starting to make up a good portion of Skid Row
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  I was talking to a couple of the volunteers
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  at the missions there they were saying that
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  they are now seeing a lot of Guatemalans, Hondurans
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  people are going to Skid Row
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  we're seeing where do all these millions are coming
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  and going they're going to Skid Row
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  many of them are making their way to Skid Row
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  if they end up homeless so the population
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  and demographic over there is changing
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  again the borders being wide open
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  the fentanyl crisis gotten completely
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  out of control I talked to several volunteers
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  in California both in downtown LA
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  and in San Francisco who said that they
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  watched people die in their arms because of the
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  fentanyl overdoses that are happening
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  in some of the more notable
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  universities in California
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  and this is going under reported so I'm going
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  to do some investigation myself into this
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  apparently cocaine is now being laced with fentanyl
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  and there's a big uptake of students
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  college students that are dying from this
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  marijuana is too that's why
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  if people are going to use marijuana and stuff
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  you need to get like
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  the actual places where it's
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  officially put out
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  you do not want to just get
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  any street drugs now because fentanyl is being
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  put in most of it yet there's fentanyl being
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  put in everything I learned about something
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  called the fentanyl crawl from some locals
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  over there you got it on tape I did
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  where basically people were taking
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  fentanyl and they're bent
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  over for six to eight hours
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  and they are just cracked out of their
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  minds they're slapping themselves
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  in the face it was horrific to see
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Alex you have again you know you and I
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  went back and forth because you're like stop I don't want
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  you at these BLM riots I felt more safe
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  watching businesses get actively looted and
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  people get punched in the face at BLM riots
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  than I did in San Francisco at 2 p.m.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  I'm not joking with cops right next to me
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  I know I'm not trying to be a hero here
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  but fundamentally you were getting beat
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  up at rallies we're trying to see security
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  with you we just I didn't want you to get
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  hit in the head with a pickaxe on my you know
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  it'd be my fault no and I like you Savannah
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  you know and that's not the reason why
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  you know I could or anything like that you were always
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  wrong you got pissed when I was like you know
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  you're not doing that anymore no I definitely did
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  but you are protecting me from you know
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  to an extent like if you watch my interviews
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  I went up to a guy with a crack pipe and I was
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  interviewing him then so obviously like
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  it is good for me to have many of my life
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  that are like okay sad calm it down a little
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  bit because I just am so on fire
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  and so curious about what's going on
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  in our country that I will go and find out
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  these stories because we don't we have a severe
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  lack of strong men that are willing to go
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  yeah you'll march into like a thousand antifa
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  and like I got trained military veteran
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  war heroes that aren't afraid
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  for a fight they just feel bad bringing a women
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  into that yeah it's just it's a genetic thing
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  with men like and but I get it
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  you're a warrior you're a valkyrie
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  we love you it's just there's something and
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  we're like we don't want to stick a woman in a bad
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  situation but I get it you're doing it
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  no I mean I totally understand where you're coming
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  from Alex and again you know my curiosity
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  I should definitely curb it
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  to an extent because you know you see with
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  this reporting I actually have a lot of friends
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  dangerous hell yeah who are at the border
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  right they have Andy to go
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  I'm saying say again Andy no
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  yeah and you know he's been attacked by antifa
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  multiple times I have friends who report
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  extensively on the border the cartel has hits out
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  on them so you know this is a very dangerous
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  job and I do wish that we had
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  more men in this country who were willing to
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  tell the truth and go into these dangerous situations
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  so I didn't have to do it one of the
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  things that I saw in my Instagram account
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  is people were asking me please come to Portland
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  come to Seattle come to Chicago and show
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  the drug crisis in my city and I'm like
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  okay why aren't there more reporters who are
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  going out exactly like pointing a camera
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  and showing well they never show the
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  thousands of deaths in Chicago here in
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  shootings they never show all this you're
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  doing it Alex so many people were like
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  oh this is like I mean it's your
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  paradoxical I should just let you do it
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  I just you understand I just had a problem
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  doing that to you no I always tell
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  people I'm like yeah Alex is like my dad
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  and you totally are because my dad's the same
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  way he's like I don't love watching you go
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  into these situations not many people do
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  luckily you know God has protected me so
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  much so I appreciate all of your prayers
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  and they definitely come in handy
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  but again not many people are
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  willing to go to San Francisco and point
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  a camera at somebody overdosed like not
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  overdosing but you know using fentanyl
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  close to death yeah I had to do it
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  because I was like this is what is being
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  allowed to why do you think that was more
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  dangerous because you marching into a
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  thousand anti-fun Austin and beating over
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  the head I mean that that's pretty damn
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  dangerous how is this more dangerous or
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  just it's worse to watch or what I would
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  say that it's more shocking to see and
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  also when it comes to these drug addicts
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  you don't know how they're going to react
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  for example in skid row I had this woman
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  that was throwing glass and trying to give
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  me shards of broken glass because it was
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  art the total mental illness it's mental
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  illness you never know how these people
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  are going to react and more importantly
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  the police are standing by watching this
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  happen knowing they can't do anything I
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  actually got a volunteer on camera
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  basically saying to me well the cops
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  stopped arresting people because
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  the DA here will just let them out the
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  next rather also all Soros DA
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  so the cops wonder the job they can't
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  yeah and so they have their hands
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  tied I talked to the police in San Francisco
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  they said our job is to observe and report
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  I heard the exact same rhetoric from the
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  National Guard at our border and the
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Border Patrol so everyone in this
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  country extremely demoralized because
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  so much crime is being allowed to prosper
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  and to be quite honest at this point we
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  basically have the Biden cartel running
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  our country allowing drugs to come
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  across our border letting people die
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  from fentanyl overdoses every single
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  day this is an issue that I think more
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  people should be shining a light on we
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  have the entire mainstream so focused in
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  on what's going on in Ukraine look at
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  our cartel wars going on in California
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  that nobody's even talking about Alex
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  there are cartel members who own homes
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  in Dallas Texas in you know regular
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  neighborhoods here all over
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  the nation and by the way it's the new
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  economy is the collapse of America
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  we've got a bunch of clips we haven't played
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  we're gonna get to these with Savannah Hernandez

[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  the UN estimates
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  that over 2 billion people
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  alive on earth today have cognitive
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  disabilities lower IQs
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  and so many other medical issues
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  because of one thing iodine deficiency
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  and most iodine that you get
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  from different foods is
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  bound to other minerals or other
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  compounds so it's not absorbable
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  in the body and that's why iodine
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  deficiency is such a huge issue we have the

[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  with the world awakening i think it was important that we were on film
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  yes now is the time in your small town
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  or your big city to write something
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  put it on the bathroom wall
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  or to put a sticker on your car
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  or banner hangs over highways
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  and it will be a chain reaction
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  what do you recommend people say on these banner hangs
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  i have a few ideas
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  first of all i'll suggest that when you go to a farm
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  or rest out, rest about 12
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  the vaccine is poison, there's kinds of things
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  i say keep it short, keep it concise
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  no i agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  the covid backs is poison, beautiful
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  yeah there's ways that we could all be in bones
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  that we could all be affected
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  unless you chris in Atlanta

[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  and then youtube
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  sav says rumble odyssey
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  my website safsasofficial.com
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  and then instagram is now my primary
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  you know place where i post
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  because i've been banned from twitter twice
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  so instagram at sav with one end
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  go check out all of my work there
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  and it's an act of revolution
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  to promote what you're doing
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  literally the globalists are so scared of us
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  because we're strong
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  saying always quote
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  no one knows who first said it but
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  the propaganda would not be necessary
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  if the situation was hopeless
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  we must win for the children
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  exactly Alex which is why we continue to push so hard
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  why we will never stop pushing
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  for the truth
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  we're up against a mighty opponent right now
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  the entire government
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  which is lying to us
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  the entire mainstream media which continues to slander us
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  and spread falsehoods every single day
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  so quite a mighty opponent
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  but god always wins in the end
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  and we will continue to push out the truth
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  one of the things that i've learned in this industry
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  is that no matter how many times you are slandered
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  or struck down continue to push forward
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  continue to tell the truth because it will pay off in the end
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  absolutely well
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  again when Rand Paul first
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  won the senate many many years ago
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  and he was on the show and we were big pushers
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  the number one fundraisers for him on record
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Politico called me and back then
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  I still talked to media and they said
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  how could have Rand Paul been defeated
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  this was a good question and I said
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  you should have endorsed him he would have lost
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  they had fake KKK
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  out posing as his supporters all of it
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  it failed but now they
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  finally are smart they're like
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Jones came to the feds and
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  January 6th was an attack
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  and he's in a rat everybody out
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  total lie they kept calling us
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  FBI wants to come to the office we're like
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  okay give us immunity there's no nothing there
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  we didn't know about any attack we tried to stop it
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  but you're not going to get me in a perjury trap
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  like Martha Stewart we wrote him a letter
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  they give it to the New York Times
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  don't quote any of it and say
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Jones is guilty
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  and they know how to hit us now
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  because that a lot of listeners get pissed
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  they're like you're going to the feds
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  and January 6th was staged by Trump
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  no no it wasn't
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  so so they're
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  they're finally getting more sophisticated Savannah
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  and you know what Alex
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  I've been thinking about this a lot and it really is
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  sad to me that the media
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  instead of focusing in on why
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  the supply chain issue is so bad
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  on why the gas prices
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  are actually rising on the fentanyl crisis
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  on the open borders on the death
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  rates and gun violence
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  in democrat run cities instead of focusing
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  their time and energy and talents
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  on what's actually going on in this country
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  they are instead dedicating their time
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  to ruining the careers of people
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  who are actually trying to tell the truth
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  it's disgusting and it's so sad to see where we've
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  gotten to as a country where people can
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  genuinely capitalize
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  and make an entire career around right wing
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  watch or media matters
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  that destroys us because we have the audacity
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  to tell the truth it's so sad to see
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  so we'll go to your video clips next segment
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  but since you raised it
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  the Ministry of Truth
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  with Homeland Security to target people
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  they say are lying
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  and then they list a bunch of stuff
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  we told the truth about
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Biden's new Ministry of Truth director
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  turns out to be a raving lunatic
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  that made up the whole Russian narrative
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  I mean how ridiculous is that
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  she also tried to discredit Hunter Biden's laptop
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  as well as a Russian
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  misinformation said it wasn't real
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  this woman is absolutely ridiculous
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  there are so many different tip talks of her
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  that are going viral like I'm about to go
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  self-delete after watching them
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  it's horrible to see what this administration
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  is bringing in I'm not surprised though
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  because remember that in February of this year
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  the DHS updated their bulletin
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  their terrorism bulletin to say
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  that anybody who is sowing distrust
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  in the government is essentially a terrorist
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  so it's not surprising
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  to see that they've implemented this at all
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  but this is the Biden administration
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  declaring that they can decide
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  what is true in society
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  from the same administration
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  that says that women can have penises it's ridiculous
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  exactly I saw the meme
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  I've got it somewhere
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  but the same group that tells you
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  men or women
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  and that men can have babies
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  and that men can be in female prisons
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  two women have a baby
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  the same group is going to counter disinformation
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  exactly Alex look what they put us through
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  the past two years with COVID
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  these are the same people who told us face masks
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  work and that the vaccines were effective
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  and that if you got your vaccination
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  that you couldn't spread COVID anymore
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  they've been lying to us and at this point
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  if you don't see that and if you don't understand that
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  there's no help for you and there's no hope for you
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  like I'm a big proponent of natural selection
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  where it's like hey if you're dumb enough
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  to believe the government's lies
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  then that's what's going to happen to you
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  because there have been blatant examples time and time again
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  I mean it is you're right
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  it's crazy
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  like oh there's no inflation a year ago
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  okay inflation's good
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  and it's Putin's fault
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  great we could blame him but it's not
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  exactly Alex exactly they take every
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  single situation
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  like you just talked about with inflation
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  it's like well inflation's actually a good thing
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  and so is us printing trillions of dollars
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  here's why and it really isn't
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  and now the IMF head says we didn't know it would do this
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  it's ridiculous Alex
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  it's so horrific
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  to see these people blatantly lie to us
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  and they do it now
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  they don't try to hide their lies anymore
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  and we have all of these
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  elites and all of these organizations
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  straight up coming out and being like
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  yeah we want to take away your rights and freedoms
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  that's exactly what we're doing
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  they're not hiding it anymore because so many people
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  are so subservient to the government
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  have already traded their freedom for safety
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  that they would gladly welcome somebody coming in
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  and injecting them into the metaverse
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  so that they don't get sick
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  the good news is whether Elon Musk is a good guy
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  or a bad guy
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  or Peter Thiel and all of them
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  are in a position
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  because we're winning
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  and I don't just say that in a positive way
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  it's very dangerous, it's crazy
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  as a globalist are like corner rats
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  but humanity is waking up
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  yep it definitely is
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  it definitely is Alex
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  and we saw the whole trend of Alex Jones was right
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  and we see many of those people on the right wing
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  that would previously either condemn you
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  or even stay silent and never speak Alex Jones' name
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  those same people on the right wing are now like
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  oh Alex Jones was totally right
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  and we see people in this country
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  white people are experiencing discrimination
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  so I'm glad that we're finally seeing
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  people wake up to the reality
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  it took them a long time
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  for example I didn't celebrate the face masks
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  being lifted on airplanes
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  because we could have been doing this all along
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  if the masses had decided
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  to not comply
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  what if half the plane said no
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  they're not going to kick half the plane off
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Alex the CEOs of major airlines were writing a letter
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  to the Biden administration asking them to lift the mandate
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  they just need to wake up and realize they have the power
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  and I think that they are starting to realize that
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  like you said they're waking up thank god
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  but uh understand
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  what the government has done to us and they will do it again
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  unless we push and fight back
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  well that's right and they just put a wired magazine article
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  from like three years ago
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  up with the headline the name that must not be mentioned
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  Alex Jones
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  and it shows a red white blue Alex Jones
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  with a black hand covering it up dragging it away
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  like they're so
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  tone deaf that like dragging away
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  people and ending their free speech is not what good guys do
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Alex look at the fact
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  that they're trying to take Marjorie Taylor
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  Green down because she said the word
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  1776 I want people to understand
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  she's in court going you said 1776
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  which means July 4th
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  and so you can't run for Congress
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  exactly and what I want people to
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  understand with what they're doing with Marjorie Taylor Green
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  is this isn't even about Donald Trump
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  running for president this is about any red
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  blooded American who cares about constitutional
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  and God given rights running for office again
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  they are trying to stop any American
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  who wants to fight for our freedoms and rights
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  from ever running again so this even
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  supersedes Donald Trump okay this is for
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  every single American they're trying to stop anybody
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  who is pro-freedom pro-humanity
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  from getting into office that's right Savannah
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  when are you ready to come

[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  Mike in California thanks for calling
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  calling this gain of function research
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  now if you read the actual
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  2014 legislation the U.S.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  government gain of function deliberative
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  process and research funding
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  pause on selected gain
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  of function research involving influence of MERS
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  and ZARS viruses does nothing about
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  ZARS like viruses and
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  it's a research funding pause it's not a stop
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  it's not a prohibition it's
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  when you come to a four-way intersection there's the
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  stop sign you stop you look both ways
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  pause all gain of function just
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  selected gain of function but they'll argue
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  that this is actually characterization
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  and qualification research though
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  you know Rand and others you know maybe
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  talking about calling it gain of function you know
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  he hasn't been arrested because they're literally
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  creating new synthetic life forms that mimic
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  what the viruses do but in the main definition
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  it's still a gain of function
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  they're making something deadly that spreads more
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  easily to hurt people thank you Mike we love

[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  this is Savannah Hernandez here in
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  Venice Beach now California is trying to
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  pass a bill to legalize
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  infanticide seven days post
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  birth let's go see what Californians think
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  of the bill so I prefer that
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  most women make the decisions at 8
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  weeks but
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  but I'm also in support of 10 months
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  out of the womb
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  so you think babies should be aborted 10
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  months after they're born if
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  if the mother wants to yes I
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  think them kids
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  so if like you
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  want to get a late term abortion like
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  that's up to you you know I've had an
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  abortion too and it's it's it was
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  my choice and I'm happy I had that choice
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  if you if you're talking about like
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  post
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  birth
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  that's not considered an abortion like
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  you could look up abortion in the dictionary
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  what if you considered murder at that point
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  I mean if somebody
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  if somebody were to
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  you know abandon their child in the dumpster they would be
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  and they were found like yes they would be charged
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  like there are actual cases of that
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  happening that's child neglect
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  and anyone who's putting their child
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  in harm's way like I think
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  there should be definitely
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  like things put in place to make sure
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  that children are safe anything
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  that is you know pre-birth
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  if it involves termination
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  of a fetus
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  that's considered an abortion I 100%
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  support it I've had an abortion
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  myself I'm not a bad person because
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  I made the choice that was right for me
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  and now I have a life that I
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  enjoy and I wouldn't take it back
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  would you guys get an abortion again
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  yes 100 times
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  I do it multiple times until
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  I feel that I'm ready to parent
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  that's the choice I'll continue to make
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  so basically like if they have their baby
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  they can neglect them for seven days
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  and if the baby dies then they can't be
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  held criminally liable what do you think
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  yeah I mean
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  I think like
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  I agree I think whatever like helps women
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  and helps them achieve
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  their like dreams and however that needs
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  to like happen is definitely
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  acts to help that is
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  helping all of us
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  what Sav says, what Sven Hernandez
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  funded a Band-Aid video and Truth Social
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  Sven Hernandez here with us
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  so they've trained women
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  that killing their babies and killing them
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  after they're born is how women get ahead
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  they see it as a women's right they're
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  very very proud of it and I've seen a lot of
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  these videos out there yours is particularly powerful
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  what do you make of this how they've
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  inverted femininity
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  I think it's heartbreaking Alex and
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  it's hard to listen to
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  after this
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  interview specifically usually
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  I will go and conduct my interviews
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  I'll start editing right away and get the footage out as soon
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  as possible after this interview I had
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  to take an entire day off because I felt so
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  spiritually depleted after listening
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  to multiple people say yes we should
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  kill their child
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  ten months out of the womb
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  you know I would get an abortion multiple times
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  this woman in particular
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  the white woman that I interviewed
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  is like yeah you know anything
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  that has to do with child neglect or a child dying
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  outside of the womb I don't agree with
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  but also I support abortion
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  as long as your baby is in the womb
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  so it makes absolutely no sense with these women
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  they're misinformed
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  abortion is health care is actual disinformation
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  and Mark Discott videos
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  them saying kill babies in ten months
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  which is actually what the left push is
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  I want to show people real feminine power
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  people ask where I get my power from
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  never shown this before
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  this is my mother's mother
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  Benny Grace Hammond
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  that's my dad's mother
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  and they were amazing women
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  she died at like 80
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  she died at 92
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  but the point was those were amazing smart
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  powerful women
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  and I just look at the women today
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  and I don't see many of them that are as strong
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  or full of a life force like you are Savannah
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  you're so full of life force
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  and you love God and you love justice and I think
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  of my grandmothers and I have dreams about my grandmothers
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  not my grandfathers
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  like every week
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  and their spirit is there
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  Ed
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  the reason I bring it up is
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  people want to know it's so strong
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  to have women behind the culture
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  and that are loving their families
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  and being real women it's so powerful
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  definitely Alex and honestly
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  one of the reasons why I'm so passionate about being
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  on the ground is because
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  I'm not raising my own family right now
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  and I think that that is the ultimate thing
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  that every single woman should be doing
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  is raising the next generation is
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  instilling these Christian values
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  into our children protecting our children
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  so that is such an important thing
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  that's lacking in the modern day
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  and we do need to bring back
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  these traditional roles for women
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  the reason why these women said that they would get abortions
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  multiple times is because
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  they didn't have parents that loved them
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  and taught them morals or values
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  they're so depraved and they're
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  so malicious with their views
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  because they never had somebody
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  that loved them enough and taught them about
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  the value of human life and that in itself
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  is a very sad thing to see
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  so you know when I was on Harrison's show
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  he was asking me, Sav how do you have hope for the future
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  and my answer and response to that is
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  I'm going to have kids one day and I'm going to get to raise
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  the next generation and I know
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  that I will be able to raise Americans
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  who love this country who are taught what is correct
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  and right and are raised up with Christian values
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  and that's the best that I can do
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  Absolutely, talk about both my grandmothers
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  this one was amazing and
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  she got polio in the 50's
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  in 92 and was such
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  an independent, hardworking, amazing lady
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  and then this grandmother had a master's
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  degree in education
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  in English and she stood up
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  in East Texas, the KKK
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  everybody else, it was just amazing but these
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  are powerful women and the left
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  claims they want to empower women, no they
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  want to stop women like these
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  and you remind me of the strength of my grandmothers
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  so that's the best compliment I can give Savanna
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  Well thank you so much Alex, that means a lot
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  to me and
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  again I appreciate you
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  with women and men are supposed to compliment
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  each other and Alex has been
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  a mentor to me and Alex has laid the foundations
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  of truth and he's helped me
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  and tried to keep me protected from these bad situations
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  as strong men should do
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  so Alex I really do commend you
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  on being one of the only true alpha males
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  in this space, I've met a lot of people
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  in the media industry, a lot of them
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  genuinely corrupt behind the scenes, they don't
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  actually care about the ideals that they espouse
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  one of the things that I say to everybody
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  is you know Alex might seem crazy, he might seem
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  wild but he believes every single
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  thing that he preaches to his audience
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  and that is a rare thing in media especially
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  and that is why I think you're so powerful Alex
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  because you tell the truth and you actually
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  care about humanity, you care about
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  men being men, you care about women being
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  women and just us taking back
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  our country through morals and values
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  Some of these clips you've done are just
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  so groundbreaking, you deserve a Pulitzer Prize
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  it's true, this should be on every channel
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  60 minutes but it's not
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  children drugged to be used
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  to get across the border, getting rid of Title 42
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  they won't even check the IDs of who has these kids
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  and then
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  the border crisis, let's play
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  a couple of these clips, Clips 7 and Clips 8
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  we don't have time in this segment
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  we got to add them in post, but here's Clips 7
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  kids drugged the border, Savannah Hernandez
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  shot this
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  this is what they do to the kids guys
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  this is really a reality
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  this is actually the United States right now
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  he's unconscious
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  he's unconscious
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  Savannah, this should be the top story in the country
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  God
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  I'm sitting here with the reporter who goes by
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Juan Mour news, Juan this is the first time
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  this footage is being seen, can you explain
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  to us what we're seeing
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  so this footage was taken
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  back in August of 2021 in Roma, Texas
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  so this footage
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  is when we encountered a lot of children
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  that were made it across
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  the river and they were actually
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  sedated by the cartel members
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  and the smugglers in order to stay quiet
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  now they sedate them
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  so they don't make any noise
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  and make any problems when they're crossing
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  and I mean
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  they did sedate to the point that they looked like they're dead
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  so we've blurred
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  out the footage here because these are children
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  but can you describe
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  what the raw footage looks like
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  what these children's faces look like
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  and also what it was like taking this footage
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  well
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  the raw footage, it shows these kids
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  they look like they're unconscious
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  and like I said
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  from afar
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  they look like they're a corpse because they're not moving
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  they're not responsive
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  and just taking it
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  it was hard to sleep
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  for a lot of nights after that
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  because it's just showing how the cartels
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  are being this brutal
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  to people and just harming kids
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  because they just want to
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  make a profit from smuggling people
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  and these kids
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  I mean we want to assume
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  that these are their parents
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  do you know that for sure were you able to talk to anybody
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  it's hard to tell and then a lot
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  of the CBP sources that I've talked to
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  on the ground have told me that
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  they've had times where they've encountered
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  like the same kid with like multiple
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  times two, three, four times
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  so you can't
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  it's hard to tell
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  people that are claiming to be the parents
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  are actually the case a lot of times
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  they lie and actually
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  get these kids or pay for them
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  because they know that
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  if they go in as a family
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  unit or claiming to be a family unit
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  they will have more chances of being released into the U.S.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  so satanic
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  so border reporting is your specialty
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  can I ask why if
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  Border Patrol has seen these kids multiple times
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  are they not helping them
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  or you know taking them into custody
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  well they're trying to do their best
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  to help them out but like I said
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  they're overwhelmed with just
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  the full report as the staff says
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  at Band-Aid video
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  but they're doing it because they're ordered not to
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  and we know they use the children
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  sometimes dozens of times
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  drugging them as they get out of jail free card
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  this is so satanic Savannah
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  definitely and this is actually
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  footage that was taken by one of my friends
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  who's a reporter at the border
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  and it didn't get released until just now
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  because he works for a certain media company
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  and they asked YouTube hey can we put this
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  on our YouTube channel and YouTube said no
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  because it was too graphic and so I told
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  him this should be a huge story
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  let me buy the footage from you and put it out
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  oh yeah YouTube doesn't want the crime shown
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  they want to keep this going
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  exactly so I was like well I'm gonna put it up
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  like this needs to be seen people need to see
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  what is going on and honestly Alex
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  I've realized with my own reporting
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  that we need to be putting out this shocking imagery
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  because people read the headlines
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  yeah we should have started the show with this actually
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  oh my god
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  I love the watch it really is
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  we'll be right back stay with us
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  we'll be right back

[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  that sends a stronger message of freedom
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  resistance to the new world order
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  than the Alex Jones was right shirt

[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  you know I just learned
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  here's Morgan did a big attack on me
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  yesterday
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  and I take that as a badge of honor
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  I'm attacked thousands of times today by the new world order
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  because I do want justice
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  and I am trying to tell the truth
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  I'm not perfect
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  but I can only stay in this position
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  in fact these people with your support
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  in your mouth
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  Savannah Hernandez
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  we don't have time to play all these clips
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  but I want to get back to
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  drugging children at the border
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  and a major conservative outlet
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  we won't say the name
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  had this footage for a while
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  didn't put it out
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  the board patrol has said this is going on
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  they're obviously drugged up on an opiate
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  and they're being used
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  because then the government lets them out
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  they have children
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  it's so shameful
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  and it lets you know just how damn evil
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  the people are on our government
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  you know Alex I was talking to a lot of the
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  National Guard members that are at the border
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  and it was heartbreaking to hear
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  what they're going through down there
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  because they're watching children drown
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  in the Rio Grande as their parents
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  force them to cross every single day
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  they have little kids who are just abandoned
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  because their parents got swept away
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  they're watching people drown
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  we just had a National Guard member
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Evans drown trying to save
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  illegal immigrants who were involved
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  with drug trafficking at our border
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  in Eagle Pass the exact same place where I was at
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  also the cartels
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  own cell phone towers across the way
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  in Mexico from Eagle Pass
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  where those National Guards men are posted up
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  they're finding the cell phones of the National Guard
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  and they're sending them pictures of dead bodies
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  and death threats and telling them they're going to kill them
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  so that's what's happening to our National Guard
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  at the border that we've had
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  and Savannah interrupt you're saying
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  I'm upset it's empathy
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  because I know I'm in danger and my children are
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  folks this is bad
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  this is America doing this
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  I mean we are in danger
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  when this is going you understand
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  you think it's going to stop there
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  yeah Alex it was very difficult
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  to see and it's really horrible that
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  the Biden administration is allowing this
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  to prosper and is allowing it to happen
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  God it's Biden not just it's so evil
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  everything he does it's so
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  it's so fantastical I can't believe it
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  and neither Alex which is why you know I do like
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  going out on the street and reporting on these things
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  because you read these headlines you see these statistics
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  and it's so evil and insane
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  that it sounds too crazy to be true
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  but then you go and you watch people crossing over
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  you go watch our National Guards men
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  have to put their lives on the line
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  to go save these people
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  who are trafficking drugs
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  across our border and then you have the
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Biden administration and our entire media
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  that's like oh illegal immigrants
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  are being whipped at the border because
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  the National Guard and the Border Patrol are so evil
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  and then the Border Patrol is whipping the horse
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  it doesn't want to go in the river
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  so they're twisting the narrative
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  they're allowing this to prosper
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  the cartels were celebrating once Biden got into office
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  because they knew they were going to be making millions
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  not to be vulgar but so people understand
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  what's happening at our border
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  women and children are being raped
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  by either the Mexican police on that side
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  or by the cartels
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  even the UN says 88% of women coming across
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  are being raped
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  there's different areas
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  right when the people cross over
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  they'll change clothes because they're all wet
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  and so it looks like a trash bin
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  has exploded on the border
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  and I'm looking around and I see children's shoes
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  I see birth control and I see condoms littered
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  everywhere and it was
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  horrific because it's like
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  I know that people are getting sexually
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  assaulted here I know that children
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  are going to cross things here
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  I'm glad you're a true social
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  we want to get you back with them for work
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  this video amazing

[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  scary and crazy but
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  not as bad as going into a thousand antifa by yourself
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  so we thank you for coming in

[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  the issue that really grabbed me
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  as urgent
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  were issues
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  related to population
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  reproductive health
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  this radio show Infowars.com
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  is about action
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  it's about being involved
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  being informed and standing up to con artist
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  earlier I played some clips
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  of Al Gore's lecturing
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  high horse
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  how any disaster, any problem
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  any dust storm, any fire
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  is the result
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  any flood of human activity
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  when carbon dioxide is much lower
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  than it's ever been recorded in history
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  that's what's crazy
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  they tax flatulence of animals
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  they tax the carbon dioxide
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  that comes out of plants
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  and I've seen Bill Gates I've played the clip
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  and I've seen the New York Times
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  in fact Google New York Times
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  attacks to breathe
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  or paying to breathe
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  and they said yeah see they take something absurd
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  and go yeah we are going to attach you to breathe
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  it's for the earth and I've seen Bill Gates say
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  in that little yuppie voice
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  and then what we need to do is
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  get this
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  graph down to zero
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  on carbon dioxide
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  being output on the earth
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  how are we going to do that
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  well humans are the main thing
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  and we put on individually
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  this amount of the TED conference
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  what do you think about that
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  everybody goes that's right
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  we've got to get this down to zero
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  and he puts
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  his clicker and puts an image of a human
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  up there and all the little anti-human
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  control freaks
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  that mommy never disciplined
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  like get off on the thrill of
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  we're going to kill everybody and Gates laughs
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  and then there's a
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  I shoot a special newscast on this on the nightly news
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  where I just show a little giggling about killing us
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  the giggling about killing us at TED conference
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  the giggling about killing us
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  at another conference where he said
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  if you okay
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  why those old Nellies that rule us
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  we
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  get rid of grandma and don't give her end of life care
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  we are ten teachers
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  what do you think about that
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  I was like oh yeah
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  I mean it's just like scum
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  Nazi-filled trash
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  garbage maggots
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  we are all ruled by little chicken-net Nellies
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  going kill everybody
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  I get off when I talk about cutting
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  people's power off I'm a Nelly
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  I
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  I
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  just simpering control freaks
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  in big nerd packs
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  taking everything over ruling everything
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  becoming police officers with weapons
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  tasering us for fun I've had it with
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  control freaks and scum
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  people are cancer
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  alright I'm not in a good mood now
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  I'm just thinking about Bill Gates
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  that little chicken-neck
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  hopping or now a little murdering eugenicist
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  you know how he walked
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  like a demonic elf
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  hey Bill Gates
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  I'm going to shoot you up
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  with something that's going to kill you dead in a hammer
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  how's a 30 year death from
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  gut disease sound African children
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  roll up the sleeves
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  I'm a little chicken-neck bastard
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  and nobody's got the will to see what I am
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  so you've got a thing on the left
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  CO2 that you want to get to zero
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  and that's going to be based on
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  the number of people
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  services each person's using
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  on average the energy
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  on average for each service
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  and the CO2 being put out
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  per unit of energy
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  so let's look at each one of these
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  and see how we can get
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  this down to zero
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  probably one of these numbers is going to have to get
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  pretty near to zero
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  that's back from high school
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  algebra but let's take a look
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  the problem is that
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  the population is growing
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  the fastest where
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  people are less able to deal with it
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  so it's in the very
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  poorest places that you're going to
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  have a tripling in population
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  by 2050
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  first we've got population
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  the world today has 6.8
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  billion people that's headed up to about
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  9 billion now if we do
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  a really great job on
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  new vaccines health care
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  reproductive health services
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  but there we see an increase
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  of about 1.3
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  now malaria is
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  of course transmitted by mosquitoes
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  I brought some here
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  so you could
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  experience this we'll let
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  those roam around the
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  auditorium a little bit
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  there
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  there's no reason only poor people
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  should have the experience
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  those mosquitoes are not
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  not infected but
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  that's a trade off society
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  is making because
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  of very very high medical
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  costs and a lack of willingness
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  to say you know is spending
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  a million dollars on that last three months
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  of life for that patient
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  would it be better not to lay off
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  those 10 teachers
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  and to make that trade off
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  in medical costs but that's called the death panel
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  and you're not supposed
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  to have that discussion
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  by the way all that NPR voice
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  all that Nelly stuff is
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  Delphi technique training
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  an epidemic either naturally caused
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  or intentionally caused is the most
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  likely thing to cause
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  say 10 million excess deaths
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  today the greatest risk
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  of global catastrophe
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  doesn't look like this
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  instead it looks
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  like this
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  if anything
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  kills over 10 million people
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  in the next few decades
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  it's most likely to be
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  a highly infectious virus
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  rather than a war
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  oh hi I'm Bill Gates
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  I want to give you some shots
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  that are going to kill a lot of people
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  and do hurt you but we're going to be indemnified
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  by governments taxpayers
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  so my dad did run Planned Parenthood
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  and I do believe in depopulation
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  and killing old people
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  but it's okay because I'm wearing a pink sweater
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  and you notice who works for me
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  Mark Zuckerberg wears a pink sweater too
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  and now all of his money
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  is tax free as well
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  and he wants you to take shots as well
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  so if you don't take the shots
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  we want to give you
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  we're going to have you
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  take it off the internet for now
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  and you won't be able to leave your house unless you take the shots
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  because there's just too many people
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  I'm Bill Gates reminding you
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  don't go to band.video
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  and just do what I say
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  we need more childhood death okay bye bye
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  and I almost forgot
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  I'm wearing a pink sweater
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  we are now joined
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  the rest of the hour
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  by the mighty
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  Roger Stone
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  Roger I want to talk about Elon Musk
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  I want to talk about the economy
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  I want to talk about Russia
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  I want to talk about January 6
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  all of you my good friend my compadre
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  but wow
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  I got a bunch of text last night
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  I didn't call you I want to bug you
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  like Roger's back on Twitter
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  and then within hours it was banned
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  and oh
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  the New York Times, the Washington Post
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  again thank God
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  and then you text me and you go
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  that's not text suggest this is true
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  he said no that's not even my account
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  so they can't get anything right
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  Elon currently hasn't taken over completely
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  but regardless you and I are a litmus tester
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  we should be reinstated
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  wow Roger this is just crazy
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  what do you make of this
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  well first of all let me take a moment to salute Savannah Hernandez
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  as you know
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  she was the producer at the war room
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  when Owen Schreuer and I
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  were teamed up
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  she's really emerged as a great spokesperson
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  for freedom very very proud
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  of her a member of the
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  Infa Wars family originally
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  great to see her on the air with you Alex
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  yeah this is kind of
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  an exercise
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  in political activism
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  I was with you
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  when we learned
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  that Elon Musk had successfully
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  acquired
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Twitter and it was a celebratory
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  moment by the way
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  if you want to look folks at that particular
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  version
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  of the Alex Jones show
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  has had over 350
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  thousand downloads
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  online
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  and I knew it was good news
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  but then I began to see
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  lists of those who have
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  unjustly been
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  deplatformed including president Donald
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  Trump you of course Alex Jones
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Mike Lindell
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  General Mike Flynn
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  my good friend Milo so many others
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  but I noticed that
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  I was missing from all those
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  lists in all honesty
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  perhaps it's because
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  I was deplatformed way back in
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  2017 I was a
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  pioneer and as you
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  pointed out to me at the time
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  when I was deplatformed
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  no conservatives rose to my
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  defense no other
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  conservatives other than you Alex were outraged
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  we'll talk about it
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  on the other side that's right Roger real quick
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  where do people find the verboten

[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  order it's alex jones
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  the big debate is we'll
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  go on my screen state people which will
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  totally enrage the left
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  trump i think foolishly said oh i'm not going to go there
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  i'm on truce social which he doesn't impose to
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  he should get the twitter and then point at that
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  but you know trump better than i do
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  moving on from that roger stone
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  dumped from twitter
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  almost as fast as he rejoined
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  more fake news you're getting into
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  this big battle over twitter
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  and these latest pieces of disinformation
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  so what i did alex to
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  my point was i instead
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  of trying to get my currently
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  suspended twitter page
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  reinstated where i had
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  just short of a million followers
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  i purposely posted
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  a new profile confident
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  that the current
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  woke staff at twitter would ban me
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  immediately and it only took
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  six hours okay because i barely talked to
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  you this morning i misinterpreted you were just saying
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  i get it wasn't an official account though
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  no it wasn't i just did
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  it to prove a point and that
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  is i'm among the band i'm
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  among the censored i'm one of
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  the pioneers when it comes to censorship
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  my hope is and when i
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  was trying to the message i was trying to send
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  to elon musk who i
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  have huge respect for because i think
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  he's kind of more of a libertarian than
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  anything else believe me i'd
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  be driving a tesla if i could afford one
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  is that the staff there
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  the people working there have got to
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  go he needs to clean
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  house and put in software
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  engineers who reflect
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  his vision which is
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  a vision of free speech
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  i've been watching his tweets on
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  friends twitter feed
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  and he admits that the left in this
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  country has moved even
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  further to the left he
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  thinks the right is too extreme as
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  well not necessarily
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  wrong about that but given
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  the shift to the left
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  if you're in the center well that
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  unfortunately these days put you on
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  the left i think elon musk
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  is neither left nor
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  right i just think he's a truth teller
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  he's an entrepreneur
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  and most importantly he understood
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  that when it came to a tender
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  offer for twitter well
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  money talks and bullcrap walks
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  i mean at the end of the day
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  he made them an offer that was so great
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  that they put aside their ideological
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  mission of crushing
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  free speech by people like alex
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  scones and roger stone
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  and laura loomer and others
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  and they took the money how
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  long do you think it takes for him to get full control
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  like at what point do we get mad
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  that he hasn't really say this because again we have
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  our own platforms it's not about oh we
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  need that platform it's about the symbol
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  of us being brought back how long do you give
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  him until we start getting a little bit upset
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  well i don't want to
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  paraphrase judge katanji brown
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  jackson uh but
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  i'm not a wall street expert
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  and i'm certainly not a financial
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  expert so i don't know how long
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  the complete
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  the completion
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  of his transaction will take
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  but i hope that when he does
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  get control he realizes that he
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  needs to clean house
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  these are the things that get rid of that
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  lawyer and the heads ceo
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  well i love the idea
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  of turning their headquarters in san francisco
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  into a shelter
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  for the homeless and i hope he will
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  relocate
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  the entire operation to either texas
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  or florida good idea
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  i mean what i love about this guy
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  is that he's such a straight talker
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  they can't pigeonhole him as a right
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  wing extremist because he's not a right
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  wing extremist he's an entrepreneur
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  but he has a commitment
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  to free speech well roger you've been
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  for marijuana decriminalization
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  you have been
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  for prison reform
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  you have been for gay rights
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  and then they call you an extreme right wing
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  nazi i mean it's just none of it makes
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  it's not true
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  i'm a libertarian conservative people
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  know that
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  you know there was a time that i was pro
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  abortion with my redemption
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  in jesus christ i've changed
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  my views radically i'm now
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  very pro life
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  i feel very by the way it's not fake roger calls
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  up and preaches at me it's pretty astounding
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  you're definitely not
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  faking
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  the birth of my first great-grandson
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  really just reinforced
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  my belief that abortion
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  is murder and i'm now opposed
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  to it but i'll be attacked for that
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  as well
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  look the bottom line here
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  is more than
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  just the acquisition of twitter twitter
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  is the head of the snake
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  whenever any an idea no matter
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  how absurd or ridiculous
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  for example the russians helped
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  elect donald trump whenever an idea like
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  that reaches critical mass on twitter
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  then the dopes
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  who are in the newsrooms at the new york
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  times and the washington post and the
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  wall street journal and cnn
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  and the justice department taking its gospels that's
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  my next point they are in hundreds
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  of articles a day saying you and i led january
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  six attack which is preposterous
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  as you warned me a year ago they are now
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  creating that false narrative
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  in that drum where do you see
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  that going
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  yeah i think that we
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  now lose the source of the talking
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  points i mean first of all
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  there is no evidence i think we both made
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  it very clear well we know
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  nothing about the violence or the illegal
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  acts on january sixth
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  i feel nothing but empathy
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  and pity for those who were arrested
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  because i think their due process is being
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  violated i think that people
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  already have already served more time
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  in in hell hole like
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  conditions and then it would get if they
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  were convicted of trespassing for example
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  many of them do not have
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  adequate legal
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  and then off of that they want to arrest
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  all of us and it's a top story
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  everywhere they're like they just keep hammering
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  it so what do you expect to happen
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  well i don't know take for example my
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  my friend sal greco the new york police
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  officer they're trying to ruin his life
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  he wasn't even there
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  on january sixth he was

[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  about any illegal activities
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  but you know they're trying
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  to destroy him they're trying to take away

[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  roger at the thing because
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  i had to have 30 security people
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  to break through the crowd of a million to get
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  there barely could it was a nightmare
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  and the and you were like i can't
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  get out of the hotel it was a million
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  people there imagining roger stone

[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  i barely got into the ellipse
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  so the idea that oh you didn't go because
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  you were quarterbacking an attack
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  it's just it's just ridiculous

[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  Chiapas Mexico the communist
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  well that's where some of the best coffee
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  in the world that's wild harvested
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.000]  above organic in the volcanic
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  we buy it from the little farmers that
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  you know the media calls communists but really they're just
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  a commune and whatever the point is is that
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  don't let the Mexican government take over
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:32.000]  another name for about 50% more
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  for pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up America
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels

[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  we had like that
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's

[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  this operation and if you don't fund us
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:33:10.000]  you don't want to see that's fine
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  you want to stop tyranny?
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  well so does he
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  live from Austin Texas
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  broadcasting world-wide
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  it's Alex Jones
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  she had previously called
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  the Hunter Biden laptop
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  a Trump campaign product
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  seeming to discredit
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  its validity or
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  validity of reporting surrounding that
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  how can
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  can you assuage concerns of
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  people who are looking at this person who's
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  been pointed to this position and wondering
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  if she's going to be able to accurately
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  judge misinformation
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  now that a lot of that reporting has been
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  proven to be
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  factual in some ways
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  well I don't have any comments on the laptop
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  but what I can tell you is that
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  it sounds like the objective of the board is
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  to prevent disinformation and misinformation
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  from traveling around the country
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  in a range of communities
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  who opposes that effort
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  prevent disinformation
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  headed up by the whole
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  Russiagate hoax lady
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  unbelievable
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  Biden's new ministry of truth
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  director turns out to be a raving
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  lunatic this woman ran the whole
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  Russiagate hoax
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  unbelievable
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  Roger Stone what do you make of this
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  well Alex just in case
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  nobody thinks you're kidding here's the
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  cover of today's New York Post
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  Big sister is
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  watching you
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  let's be very clear Nina
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  Genowitz the woman who is now
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  the head of the ministry
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  to Orwellian
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  monitor our speech
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  is herself one of the progenitors
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  who claimed that
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  the Hunter Biden
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  laptop was rushing
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  disinformation called out on that
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  she said well she was merely reflecting
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  what Joe Biden said
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  well Joe Biden was lying and therefore
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  she is lying
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  she also was lauding
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  Christopher Steele trying to say
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  once again that the Steele
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  dossier was legitimate
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  sorry Nina that's
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  BS as well
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  and her worst nightmare
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  is that free speech
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  absolutists she says
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  would get a foothold in the internet
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  I don't understand that
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  those who died
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  made her the thought police got us
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  well evidently Joe
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  Biden did or Joe Biden was
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  told to by Barack Obama
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  so this is outrageous
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Americans should be very angry
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  we're smart enough on our own
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  to figure out what is the truth
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  American people are very very smart
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  they can discern
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  BS from facts but not
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  if they're never exposed
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  to the facts
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  so this appointment is outrageous
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  it is obviously
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  yet another attempt to control
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  news she's worried
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  that minority communities
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  will be marginalized
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  by the advent of free speech
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  that is that's
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  that's bizarre that's mental
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  illness that that's
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  crazy it's almost as bad as
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  Robert Reich the former
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  labor secretary under
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  Bill Clinton
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  saying that Elon Musk's
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  commitment to free speech
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  is the hallmark of every great despot
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  and dictator in history
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  that's right he said free speech is
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  anti free speech and the group going
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  against Marjorie Taylor Greene
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  is called the free speech group
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  it wants her so she can't run from office
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  because she says they want to keep people from winning office
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  so she says they're trying to frustrate
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  the voters will the most
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  critical way to do it
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  is not let a candidate run
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  I mean that is the essence of election fraud
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  foresaying they want to stop candidates
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  she now can
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  they're trying to let her run
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  it's unbelievable
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  it's election interference
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  as the left would say
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  once again this woman savagely
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  attacked former New York mayor
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  Rudy Giuliani
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  perhaps the greatest mayor in New York history
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  and said that he was peddling
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  Russian disinformation
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  in fact we now know
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  that virtually everything
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  not virtually everything
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  Rudy Giuliani said about Hunter Biden's
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  laptop is correct
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  except for it's much worse
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  than we were led to believe
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  disinformation is the hallmark
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  of this administration
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  and this appointment
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  is particularly disgraceful
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  this woman Nina
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  Genevitz
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  has no credibility whatsoever
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  let me ask you this question
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  I totally agree with you Roger Stone
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  why are they like being cartoon character villains
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  I mean a ministry of truth
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  and you've got
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  new W.E.F. announcements
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  of depopulation
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  it's insane
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  and then when we counter it and go hey
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  we don't want a ministry of truth
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  doesn't exist you're crazier
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  we don't want depopulation
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  we don't want censorship
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  the gaslighting isn't working anymore
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  how do you see this with 193 days out
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  from the midterms unfolding
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  I mean how can they grab
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  victory from the jaws of defeat
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  that's why they're in such a hurry Alex
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  as our friend Tucker Carlson points out
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  they don't act like people
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  who have the luxury of time
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  they know that every single day
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  that more and more
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Americans are waking up
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  to what's going on
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  let's be honest info wars has a lot
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  to do with it that's why they're so
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  desperate to shut info wars
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  down because it is a beacon
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  of freedom I'm going to come out right
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  out and say it the only reason I've got
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  the energy to do
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  this broadcast is because I'm using
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  brain force plus
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  I don't get paid to say anything by that
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  by the way I have no deal with Alex Jones
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  by the way every time you do that
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  they run national headlines like it's bad that we
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  sell a well-known brain formula
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  I mean we just sell whatever the top thing is
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  we clone it I mean oh my god
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  Roger Stone went on to
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  hubbing and posting at times he said
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  Jones has a good brain fail how dare you
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  Roger where as you go to Whole Foods
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  and buy the same thing for five dollars more
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  I mean it's insane
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  actually that's not true because
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  the stuff you buy at
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  Walmart or the stuff you buy at the drug store
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  is laced with a fedra
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  which yeah it gives you a quick
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  burst of energy but then you crash
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  brain force plus
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  is subtle in terms of it gives you
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  energy at both mental and physical
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  focus but there is no
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  after effects so folks go to the info
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  store right now and order
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  your brain force plus
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  brain force plus is amazing so is turbo
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  force so is brain force also three different formulas
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  so Roger midterms
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  give us your handicapping of that
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  what do they do with every number showing
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  they're devastated the political
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  realignment has turned into a landslide
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  what are they going to do
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  well first of all there is
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  a concerted effort to make sure that many
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  in these upcoming Republican primaries
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  are rhinos so that
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  the Republican majority
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  in the House and the Senate is
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  illusionary it's not
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  enough just to take both houses
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  we have to be discerning
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  we need to elect candidates like
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  Laura Loomer like Mike
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  Crispy in New Jersey like
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  JR Majewski in Ohio
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  I use those as examples
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  we need to elect candidates like
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  Jan Morgan to the U.S. Senate
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  in Arkansas like
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  Jackson Lawmire and
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  Dr. Randy Grelner in
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  Oklahoma we have to have
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  subsets of true American
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  patriots who can use
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  their leverage to drive the Republican majority
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  you cannot just say
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  election night well the Republicans won
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  the Republic will be
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  saved that is unfortunately
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  not the case so people
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  need to focus on individual races
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  America will be one
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  or lost between now
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  and this November we do not have
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  the luxury of time folks this
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  is it this is the struggle
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  for freedom it will be decided in the
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  upcoming primaries and in the
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  upcoming general election
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  I totally agree
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  we are under attack
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  but we have the dagger of truth
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  and if we use
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  that dagger of truth
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  we will survive if we don't we deserve
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  what happens to us but I mean I got to say
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  Roger how weird is it
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  because I know you are around with Barry Goldwater
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  and Ronald Reagan warning of this
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  and Ron Paul and now it's all here I mean
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  this is like this is crazy
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  well Alex nobody's been more accurate than
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  you have they made fun of you
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  you know five years ago ten years ago
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  when you began predicting everything
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  that would happen the New World Order
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  is here folks
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  these people have no regard
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  for civil liberties, no regard for the

[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  of time in which they intend
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  to crush the American
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  system to bury our heritage

[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  the UN estimates that over two billion people
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  alive on earth today have cognitive disabilities

[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  and so many other medical issues
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  because of one thing iodine deficiency
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  and most iodine that you get
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  from different foods is
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  bound to other minerals or other compounds
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  so it's not absorbable
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  in the body and that's why iodine deficiency
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  is such a huge issue we have the purest
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  cleanest best iodine in the world

[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  so good
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  they call her

[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  late night talk shows call her
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  they call her a stupid woman
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  but I find her to be very instinctive

[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  here she is
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  in a press conference
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  the full thing's up on InfoWars.com
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  pop story on Yahoo
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  last night this morning
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  saying she wants Milo Unopolis
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  and Alex Jones
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  Elon Musk
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  at a round table
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  about free speech
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  she's introduced a bill
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  to counter all the attacks
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  on free speech
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  here it is
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  there'd be a lot of people
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  I'd love to invite
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  to this round table
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  I see someone
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  standing behind you right there
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  Milo Unopolis
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  I think you'd be a great person
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  to have there
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  Alex Jones
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  would be another person
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  we'll put together a great list
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  of people who have been
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  just
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  almost deleted
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  from public life
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  due to this type of censorship
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  and I think Elon Musk
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  will enjoy talking with them
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  and once they do that
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  Roger you and I have experienced it
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  it's not just that you're silenced
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  then they can say whatever
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  lie they want about you
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  the Elon Musk thing is big
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  I want to go back to the earlier question
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  how do the Democrats
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  the deep state counter this
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  when the whole world's turning against them
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  obviously election fraud
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  and now they're saying it's illegal
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  to question election fraud
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  with their Ministry of Truth
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  what are your predictions
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  in 193 days?
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  well as I've said previously
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  my greatest concern
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  is that Dr. Fauci and his colleagues
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  will cook up some new pandemic
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  cause a public panic
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  lockdown America
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  and then the Democrats will jam through
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  federal legislation
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  which Joe Biden
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  somebody will hold his hand
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  and help him sign it into law
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  that requires that all voting
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  in our next federal elections
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  be by mail-in ballot
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  mail-in voting is an invitation
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  for fraud
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  elections should be held on one day
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  and one day only
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  and I applaud Kerry Lake
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  and Mark Fincham
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  Kerry Lake's running for Governor of Arizona
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  Mark Fincham's running for Secretary of State
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  they are pushing a proposal
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  to return to paper ballots
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  paper ballots is how we conducted our elections
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  successfully in this country
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  for decades
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  Texas always used paper ballots
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  and paper ballots are more trackable
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  there's less opportunity for fraud
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  yes there should be provisions
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  for absentee ballots
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  if someone can prove that they are
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  too sick to go to the polls
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  to infirm
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  or that they have a work commitment
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  out of the state
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  it doesn't require them to vote
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  there are provisions that are fair
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  for absentee ballots
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  but this dropping of
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  300,000 questionable ballots
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  in the middle of the night
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  which we by the way saw in France
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  which we saw in the last presidential election
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  that cannot be allowed
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  and let's not debate this
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  the Democrats in a bunch of cities
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  have illegal aliens voting now
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  so they admit this
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  and they're engaged in mass fraud
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  there's not a debate about this
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  I would be surprised if they had space aliens
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  that are voting
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  so you guys at Media Matters
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  you can now run to your computer
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  you can post that if you want
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  it's a joke so let me ask you this Roger
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  you make your great points
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  what do we do
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  to counter this
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  pray get involved politically
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  I mean what extra can we do
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  to stop this catastrophe
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  that we're steaming into
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  well first of all you said the most important word
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  people do need to pray
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  prayer has real real power
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  I'm only before you
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  through the grace of Jesus Christ
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  only through the power of prayer
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  otherwise I would have died in a dank
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  Georgia prison of COVID-19
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  which was the government's plan
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  for me only through the intercession
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  of the Lord am I with you
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  yes if you're a liberal elite in New York
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  you can snicker at that
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  you can mock me
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  you can say that it's a head fake
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  or some kind of post
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  don't really care what you think
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  only care what he thinks
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  so now that we've dispensed of that
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  secondarily free speech
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  is the key to everything
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  you cannot galvanize public opinion
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  you cannot mobilize
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  the demand for free fair
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  honest elections
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  without free speech
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  I still believe that we are the majority
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  unfortunately we're the silent majority
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  because many of us
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  have been silenced
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  but as I have said from the beginning
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  we need to create our own community
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  on the internet
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  we need to have our own news programs
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  programming
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  like info wars which uses
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  its own servers which
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  doesn't rely on Amazon or Google
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  or Apple or anyone
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  and that's why it's so precious to support
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  let me play these clips for you then
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  what's going to happen with Biden
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  we knew three years ago
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  you and I got double banned by Facebook
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  they listed us and said
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  you're allowed to call for violence against these individuals
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  I'm not kidding folks, look it up
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  Paul Watson, yourself, Lewis Furkan of all people
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  25 names put on the list
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  for saying he had cognitive disabilities
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  from brain surgery
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  now that's completely clear he can barely talk
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  I want to ask you how do they extricate themselves
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  from Biden but first
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  here's a clip of him not being able to say
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  kleptocracy which is the name of himself
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  that will enhance
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  our underlying effort
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  to accommodate the Russian oligarchs
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  and make sure we take
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  their ill-begotten gains
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  we're going to accommodate them
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  we're going to seize their yachts
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  their luxury homes and other ill-begotten
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  gains of Putin's
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  kleptocracy
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  yeah
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  kleptocracy
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  the guys who are the kleptocracies
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  but these are bad guys
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  yeah, these are bad guys, you're a pedophile
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  what happens to him
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  this is a guy who by the way
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  was very proud to point out that they had put together
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  the largest
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  most comprehensive voter fraud
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  operation in America
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  remember he said that, we put together the best fraud
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  he said it
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  yeah, he just blurts the truth out
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  from time to time on those days
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  that he doesn't know what day of the week is
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  by the way, if we're going to be seizing
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  properties, the most high million
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  dollar condominium in Miami Beach
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  owned by Ukrainian president
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  Zelinsky, the actor
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  the comedian
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  the dancer, that should probably be
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  seized, because I'm not sure how he
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  afforded that
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  look, I said this last week
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  it didn't get as many downloads
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  as our conversation on E-line must
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  but I still predict right now
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  that Joe Biden will be
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  removed by the 25th amendment
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  he will be constitutionally and legally
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  removed as president
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  shortly after the election
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  they will deify him while they're doing it
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  he will presumably
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  agree to step
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  aside and they're going to say
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  this great state's been this great American
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  unfortunately, he's not
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  well enough to do the job anymore
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  we're going to have to remove him
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  it requires a majority of the cabinet
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  plus the acquiescence
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  of the vice president
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  I stand by my prediction made last week
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  right here on the Alex Jones show
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  that they will
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  replace him after the election
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  because the net result
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  of the corruption
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  and the sexual exploitation
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  of children and the drug
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  use and the treason
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  that is documented in
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  the three laptops of
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  Hunter Biden that we now know are
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  absolutely real
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  coupled with high gas prices
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  food shortages
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  crippling inflation
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  and those surging across
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  our border
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  that's just too heavy a burden
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  no you're right and it will be like a public funeral
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  but he'll still be alive eulogizing him
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  but he's being removed I totally agree with you
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  let's play this clip this is Ari Melber
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  on MSNBC
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  inverting reality and saying
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  if Elon Musk takes twitter and has free speech
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  battle metal in the election
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  everything he's saying here is what they've done to us
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  here it is
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  you own all of twitter or facebook or what have you
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  you don't have to explain yourself
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  you don't even have to be transparent
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  you could secretly ban one party's candidate
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  or all of its candidates
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  all of its nominees
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  and turn up the reach of something else
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  the rest of us might not even find out about it
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  till after the election
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  Elon Musk says this is all to help people
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  because he is just a free speech
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  philosophically clear
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  open-minded helper
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  so there they are describing
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  exactly what they've done
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  and claiming freedom is what they've done
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  I mean I've never seen such
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  inversion
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  Ari what you're talking about
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  happens on facebook today
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  republican candidates are not allowed to use
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  their advertising app
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  not allowed to use those democrats are
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Ari Melber is one of the greatest
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  distortionists of all time
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  I mean this guy is
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  really a freak
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  and guilt by association
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  is his favorite tactic
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  absolutely his favorite tactic
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  well it looks like they're in the headlights
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  they have no viewers
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  in closing 30 seconds CNN plus
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  collapsing in one month what do you make of that
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  well the
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  it's like they say in the dog food business the dogs hate that stuff
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  nobody's watching CNN
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  because nobody believes it
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  as I've said many times
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I don't get my news from CNN
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  for the same reason I don't eat
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  out of the toilet
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  thanks for having me today Alex
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  God bless you have a great weekend

[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  I think we may
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  steal it back
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  it's a joke all right thank you Roger
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  I'll do five more minutes and then

[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:15.000]  we will use it to fight the new world order

[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  all right so last segment

[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  four to six p.m.
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  the great Jay Dyer is fired up
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  with his wife and co-host
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  ready to take over here in just

[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  such a real man such a just
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  a dead-fast boy scout
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  Owen Schreuer in our
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  infowarstore.com
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  radio stations across the country
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  by the way we've gained about 50
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  little over 50 radio stations
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  last few months with the persecution
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  we're up at 350 stations right now
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  so the persecution is backfiring with
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  Stride is in effect is in effect
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  now Piers Morgan
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  edited tapes of Trump
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  claimed he stormed out, lied about everything
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  the guy is a snake in the grass
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  he stormed out last night and attacked me
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  and
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  it's blowing up in his face
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  people are so sick of this crap
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  but if you work for the establishment
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  you attack Alex Jones, here he is
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  talking of removal
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  from classless to cashless
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  the name Alex Jones may not be familiar to you
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  until I replay an old clip from the time
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  he screamed at me about guns
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  on American television
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  how many gun murders were there
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  in Britain last year
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  how many chimpanzees
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  could dance on the head of a pin
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  the tyrants did it, Hitler took the guns
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  Fidel Castro took the guns
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  Hugo Chavez took the guns and I'm here to tell you
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  1776 will commence in
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  if you try to take our firearms
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  oh I hear you cry
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  that crazy guy
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  well Jones isn't just crazy
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  he's a nasty piece of work who built a gigantic
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  online following with his info wars website
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  and made many millions of dollars
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  peddling man conspiracy theories
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  about the US government
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  his most vile claim was that
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  was faked
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  a very few tragedies have ever moved me more
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  profoundly than that appalling massacre
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  in which 20 children
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  aged between 6 and 7
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  were shot dead in their classrooms
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  by a lone lunatic
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  but Alex Jones responded to what happened
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  by saying it was all a government staged hoax
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  perpetrated by crisis actors
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  to justify new gun control laws
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  being introduced
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  it was a disgusting lie
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  that caused immeasurable new grief and misery
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  to the poor families of the children who died
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  but 10 of those families
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  decided to sue him for defamation
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  and they won and they won big
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  now Jones a great government
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  conspiracy theorist
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  has filed for bankruptcies
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  he awaits details of the huge damages he'll now have to pay
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  and it's been reduced to
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  desperately and pathetically begging the same government
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  he is always said as the enemy of the people
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  for bankruptcy relief
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  oh the irony
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Jones deserves everything coming his way
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  what he did to those Sandy Hook families
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  was beyond despicable
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  he's been morally bankrupt for decades
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  now he'll be financially bankrupt too
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  and hopefully that means he'll never again
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  be able to lead such a vile smear campaign
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  like the one he did to desecrate the memory
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  of those 20 young children
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  Piers you're the one that's morally bankrupt
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  I'm the one that questioned
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  WMDs in Iraq
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  Gulf of Tonkin
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  Operation Northwoods
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  what happened with people like Jesse Smollett
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  and you're the one that lives off that
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  you're the one that's a fraud that's anti free speech
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  anti second amendment
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  and a piece of garbage
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  and oh I'm going to the deep
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  state as the New York Times said
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  to do limited bankruptcy to show
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  the public they don't have hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  these people are trying to get to silence our speech
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  after all of our speech
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  my speech, your speech, everybody's speech
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  and that's why
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  we the people need to realize
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  this is a battle of wills right now

[3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  Welcome back to the House of Jones
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:07.000]  of Jay's Analysis and I'm here with
[3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  my Disney princess wife
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  Jamie Hanshaw and
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  today we're going to cover the dark side of Disney
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  Disney's dark secrets
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  Jamie's done a lot of research on this
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  she's written a couple books that
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  she's done a lot of research on this
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  and it's perfect timing
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  given the fact that what Megan Fox
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:27.000]  just came out talking about the fact that
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  she drinks blood
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  I got to thinking about that
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  and the blood drinking and
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  how many flavors of STDs
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  you think you could taste if you drink
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  Hollywood blood
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  31 flavors
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  32 plus that's Masonic
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  anyway so we're going to get into the history of Disney
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  and how it's always been a
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  cooperation
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  and why don't you kick us off with that
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  you've got a bunch of notes here so tell us about Disney
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  Welcome boys and girls
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  I am princess programming
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  and we are going to tell you a tale
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  of enchanted sorcery
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  and today we are going to talk
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  about
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  all of the
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  things that I have been studying about
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  Disney for the past 10 years
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  I have 3 books on it I have multiple shows
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  articles
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  those things and I have condensed it
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  for you because I heard you talking about Disney
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  last week and I am here for it
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  so let's kick them when they're down
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:25.000]  and first off let's
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  just start talking about Walt Disney the person
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  he is
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  sus
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  he is a very shady character
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  and let me tell you I hope you watch till the end
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  because this is going to get very weird
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  he was born
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  in 1901 allegedly
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  his father was very abusive
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  and his brother Roy actually ran away from home
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  he tried to enlist
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  in the Navy in World War 1
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  but there was a problem with his birth certificate
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  which is going to come up later in his life
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  his parents were acting very weird
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  about his
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  documents and everything
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  and so he just decided
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  to sidestep that and join
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  the Red Cross by lying on a form
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  so during the World War 1
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  he would make fake battle relics
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  and sell them so he would get
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  helmets and put bullets in them
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  and fake blood and everything
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  and sell them for profit as
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  relics
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  then
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  yes
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  then later on
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  in his career he was used by
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  the Benai Barith in the 30's
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  to bring family values back
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  to Hollywood and deflect scandals
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  because this was right after the Great Depression
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  and America was trying to get back
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  on track and they saw Hollywood
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  as a sort of Babylon
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  and a source of degeneracy
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  so they
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  propped up Walt Disney as
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  a
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  wholesome
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  entertainer with family values that could
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  get Hollywood back into the hearts
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:08:57.000]  and minds of the American public
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  so that's why Disney Studios
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  was so strict back in the day
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  they couldn't have mustaches
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  they had all these
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  weird moral rules
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  it sounds like a mafia rule
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  like why no mustaches
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  well a lot of times people
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  with
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  dirt
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  we were trying to cover up things
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  tried to be more moral
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  than everybody else because it's front
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  oh I see
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  so just made up legalistic rules of piety
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  so Walt Disney
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  finding his true parentage
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  was the bane of his existence
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  and this is the issue that
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  J. Edgar Hoover used
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  to strike a deal where Walt agreed to
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  assist in the crusade against the spread
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  of communism in Hollywood
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  and in return the FBI had
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  full access to
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  Disney
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  so he became a full special agent
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  in 1954
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  representatives from the FBI had complete
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  access to Disneyland for use in official
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  matters and in 1958
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  three special episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  featured a budding 13 year old
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  secret agent
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  who tours FBI headquarters
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  admiring agents in action
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  and actually Walt Disney's favorite game
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  when he was a child was to play secret agent
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  Jimmy Dale that he made up
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  well this sounds like what Dave McGowan talks about
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  in his weird scenes inside the canyon book
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  that basically back at the time
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  of the Laurel Canyon Air Force Studios
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  out in California
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  all of the top directors
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  all the top Hollywood people had access
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  and they filmed all kinds of secret
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  who knows what that is
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  and Walt was one of the people that had access there
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  as well as Marilyn Monroe
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  so even back then
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  the 40s, 50s, 60s
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  all of these people the A-listers were all tied at the
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  hip to the Pentagon
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  the military industrial complex, the FBI etc
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:49.000]  so lots of people say that Disney was a
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  Mason and that is not technically correct
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  Roy was a Mason
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  but Walt was Demolay
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  which is the Masonic
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  appendage for young boys
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  so like I said
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  behind fronts of strict morals you often find
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  massive amounts of guilt and a dirty mind
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  Walt attended Bohemian Grove
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  in 1936
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  and he complained about
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  all of the snoring coming from the tents
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  and that's where the scene
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  of the Seven Dwarfs snoring came from
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  from Bohemian Grove
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  so
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  often the main topic of
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  studio was Walt's bizarre behavior
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  he never emerged from the studios
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  underground
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  until late afternoon where he was supposedly
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  chatting with maintenance engineers all day
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  in 1945
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  he had a nervous breakdown and spent all his time
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  in his private inner office
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  which they joklingly called
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  Walt's Chamber of Horrors
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  so a lot of things
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  were
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:49.000]  weighing on him
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  and probably a guilty conscience
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  so he would just spend all day playing with his model chuchu trains
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  and people who knew him personally
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  said that he was obsessed with
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  butts
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  and this is reflected in many of the early cartoons
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  I've heard this yes
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  so one co-worker
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  recalls that he could talk about turds for 20 minutes straight
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  and then this is a weird
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  anecdote that I found
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  and all of this can be found in
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  my first book if only Amber
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  heard had waited a little while she could have had a Disney special
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  but Amber turds
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  Operation Culture Creation
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  weird stuff and this is all about
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  Disney's history
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  but according to Kenneth Anger who's not the best
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  reliable source but I thought this was interesting
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  he said Walt Disney used to open
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  a small rounded door in the wall
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  a fairy tale door that creaked and take his guest
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  down a winding staircase into a dungeon filled
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  racks
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  and child sized iron maidens
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  take that for what it's worth
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  I don't know, Kenneth Anger is the best
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  he's not the best source but
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  he did have some insight
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  into the dark side of
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  Hollywood at the time
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  so Walt was
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  probably one of the most
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  lauded people
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  of the 20th century he has more
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  accolades than anybody really I can think of
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  he received the Demolay Legion of Honor
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  in 1931
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  which is equivalent to the 33rd degree
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  in Masonry and then
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  in 1935 he was summoned to Paris
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  to receive a medal of honor
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  for the creation of Mickey Mouse from the League of Nations
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  so
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  okay right
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  well this is when they were really
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  planning to make Hollywood
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  go global right and Disney was a big
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  part of extending
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  of Americanism and American culture to the whole
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  globe via things
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  especially like Disneyland
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  so let's talk about Disney
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  World War II propaganda
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  so there's entire DVD collection called Disney
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  on the Frontlines that you can get that has
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  all of these videos in it because in 1941
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  the day after Pearl Harbor
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  while Disney Studios in Birmingham was
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  commandeered by the military
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  as a primary defense station
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  and 90% of its production
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  went into government training and propaganda
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  films I think a lot of these are on
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  YouTube right I mean I remember clicking
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  around and you goofies
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  go to pay your taxes goosh
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  right like telling you to pay your taxes
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  exactly so one of these was called
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  army psychotherapy stress
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  adrenal glands and the basics of fear
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  and how to instill it so that's a weird
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  imagine cartoon dogs
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  and ducks like telling you to pay
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  your taxes this is already a dystopia
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  right and then another one was
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  called chicken little and this is a cartoon
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  about using psychology
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  to create false narratives
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  and false flags to undermine the faith of
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  the masses in their system and to trusting
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  idiots and subsequently leading to their
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  death then
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  you have one cartoon called the new spirit
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  which implores Donald Duck
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  to pay his income taxes
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  to beat the axis and it's a really
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  weird
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  sequence in there where they tell you exactly
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  where your tax money goes it's to create
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:53.000]  bullets and tanks and
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  ammunition and guns and it says guns
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  guns guns and it's in a very lustful way
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  for weapons
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  and then another one well they were studying
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  the usage of sexual
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  symbolism in cartoons and
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  films a long time ago right so they were
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  capitalizing on Freudian
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  and Jungian insights even for cartoons
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  and we'll get to that crowd favorite
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  towards the end about subliminal messages
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  but the last one I wanted to talk about
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  was education for death and making of a Nazi
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  and this details the life of a Nazi
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  youth and the psychological conditioning
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  that makes a trained killer
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  so look those up on YouTube
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  yeah and I mean
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  basically Disney
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  is another version of the same thing right so
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  even though he was involved in the war effort
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  doesn't necessarily make this
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  the good guys versus
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  everybody else is the bad guys
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  it's all bad guys because
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  Disney was linked to the hip to
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  Siemens Corporation and military industrial complex
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  for a long time
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  don't go anywhere you're watching the Alexi John Show

[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  not as much as they should be but thank

[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  for info wars store.com
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  before I start out on a run
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:11.000]  I throw down some turbo force
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:13.000]  to give me that energy I need to get going
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  you know besides the energy turbo force
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  it is giving me the vitamins

[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:35.000]  is great for giving my joints the extra support

[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  crazy enough to take on a marathon

[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  together with Jamie Hanshaw
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  and we're covering the dark secrets
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:19.000]  the dark side of Disney
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  and I want to remind you to help keep
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  info wars on there go to the info wars
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  store get the products that you need get

[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:29.000]  products especially the toothpaste
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  which I'm a big fan of I do brush my
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  teeth a lot of people out there and I think I don't brush my teeth
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:35.000]  I do brush my teeth at least four times a
[3:20:35.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  day probably
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:39.000]  I really like the coral calcium toothpaste
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  she does like it I do like it too
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  I used to have sensitive teeth and then after I use that
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  the sensitivity to sugar has gone away
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  so get used to it
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  you know it doesn't affect you
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:51.000]  the sensitivity
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  so let's get back to Disney
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  and I want to remind you to also if you want to
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:57.000]  support the work that we do
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  we have also written books on these topics
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  for years now in fact way ahead
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  of time I wrote my book
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  where I got into the very topics
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  that we're covering today
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  many many many years ago some of these essays
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  I wrote at least 10-15 years ago
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  and they've really proven to be true
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  I was talking about all the occult stuff
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  I was talking about the ritual abuse
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  I was talking about the blood drinking
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  type of stuff that you hear
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  in the news today
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  and it all goes back to an attempt
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  to scientifically use
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  cult mindsets and cult techniques
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  to control not just weirdos
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  in Hollywood but the whole culture
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  and that's why Jamie's insights
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  into Disney are really powerful here
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  well let's talk about who actually
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:41.000]  built Disneyland the happiest place on earth
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:43.000]  a weird story that I
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  found in a very obscure place
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  a little article in Fate magazine
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  so Walt actually consulted
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  with SRI
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  whose clients include all branches
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  of the military the office of naval research
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  and DARPA to determine the best
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  location of the park
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  it was decided by C.V. Wood
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  who left SRI to become Disneyland's
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  main engineer and more
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  he introduced Walt to the outside sponsors
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  like Monsanto and GE
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  Disneyland sits on latitude
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  33 which is famous for other
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:15.000]  strange events such as Roswell and the Kennedy
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  assassination
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  some people the same people who
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  invented GPS and weather radar
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  are setting the electromagnetic
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  properties of Disneyland
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  and they used their knowledge
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  of lay lines to build the park
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  on three intersecting lines
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  where they built
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  King Arthur's carousel
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  that
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:39.000]  supposedly these people are
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  positing that
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:43.000]  they are collecting energies
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:45.000]  and spinning them around
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  so I don't know how you want to get with this
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  but it is definitely weird
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:51.000]  that Walt Disney is working
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:53.000]  with SRI
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:55.000]  SRI at that time was studying the occult stuff
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  right so the US government was doing research
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  into the occult that's on record
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  they studied the remote viewing
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:03.000]  and all these kinds of techniques
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  project Stargate and all that those are real projects
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  which eventually kind of becomes
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:09.000]  the Men Who Stare at Goats
[3:23:09.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  story but yeah I think
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  that a lot of people don't know this this is what leads into
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  basically the CIA
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  helping Walt to get
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  that land and basically set it up as its own
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:21.000]  weird kind of city state
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  one more thing about Disneyland
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  in California the original pirates
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  of Caribbean use real skeletons
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  because they thought
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  fake ones looked too fake
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  egregious yes so there
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:35.000]  you have Disneyland but then who built Disney
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  world as you were saying
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  and hint I'll give you
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  I already said it
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:43.000]  three letters CIA
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  so in the 1960 Disney operatives
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  engaged in a far ranging conspiracy
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  to make sure sellers had no idea who was buying
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:51.000]  the central Florida property
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  because it would make the property
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  values and everything go up and they didn't want to spend
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  all that money so Disney's key
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  contact in the CIA
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  was named William Wild Bill
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  Donovan who was also
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  called the father of the CIA
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  and he provided fake identities
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  for Disney's agents to buy property and set up
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  a secret communications center
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  and a dis info campaign
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  to maintain control over
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  the development then you have Paul
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  Hellowell who helped
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  launch a secret CIA war in Indochina
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  and other pysos against Castro
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  he came to work with Disney and he came up with a way
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  to avoid taxation
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  environmental regulations and immunity
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  from the Constitution so this was
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  the classic CIA strategy
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  in foreign countries which is set up a puppet government
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  and then use the regime to do your bidding
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  yeah it's a state within the state
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  it's the same model of the Vatican
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  of Washington DC
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  the city of London there are states within states
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  and they even had their own
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  bylaws their own police force
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  a lot of people don't believe this but that's actually
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  the real history of Disney
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  yes so they created cities
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  whose only official residents
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  would be handpicked by Disney loyalists
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:01.000]  who elected officials under control
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  of Disney executives
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  and so the Magic Kingdom
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  in Florida is actually a city of Bay Lake
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  Florida and then the other one is the city
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  of Lake Poina Vista
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  and these parks reshaped Central Florida
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  and Walt gave the opening speech from beyond
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  the graves
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  that was weird that is weird
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  then you have
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  Theme Park Corporate Sponsors
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  yeah well I remember the last time that I was at
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  Disney
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  I was walking around Epcot and I was noticing how
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  it's basically just a giant bunch of advertisements
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  I mean it's really lame like you walk
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:35.000]  over to whatever that
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  banana boat ride is and literally the whole ride
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  is just riding like a giant banana
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  floating around a bunch of GMO
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  plants that's it
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  and then the whole thing was an ad
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  for depopulation in Monsanto
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  it's a Monsanto sponsored banana ride
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  I couldn't believe that
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  this is the stupidest thing ever
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  yes all the rides in the parks are sponsored
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  by military industrial corporations
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  or something like that
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  Siemens Corporation
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  so in 1935 Walt Disney met
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  with H-U-L's
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  who you talked a lot about
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  who along with Jules Verne and Leonardo da Vinci
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  were a huge inspiration for Tomorrowland
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  so we
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  we know what H-U-L's wants for tomorrow
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  yeah and Tomorrowland
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  well Epcot and all of that
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  is actually called the city of the future
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  and it was intended to be a preparation
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  model for smart cities of the future
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  so if you want to wonder how
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  we're getting to the smart city and all this
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  is so revolutionary the idea of a smart city
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  is going to be so great we're living in positive
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  no this was planned a long time ago and it was
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  prepped through Epcot
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:39.000]  and the city of tomorrow
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  so then you have Nazi scientist Werner von Braun
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  who worked as a technical director
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  on three Disney TV
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  shows about space called Man in Space
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  Man in the Moon
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  and Mars and Beyond and he
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  appeared as one of Walt's
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  experts on the world of tomorrow
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  there is your fine Nazi scientist Werner von Braun
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  yeah again proof that
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  space is fake and gay
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  that's a joke by the way it's just a joke
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  I'm not saying space isn't real it's a joke
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  so like you said
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  Monsanto was one of Tomorrowland's
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  original sponsors and then
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  theme parks as military industrial
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  complex commercials is very true
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  and like you said Epcot stands for
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  experimental prototype community of tomorrow
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  and it is
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  the most ideologically important
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  piece of land in the United States
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  well yeah if you
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  remember the last time I went
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  and rode the goofy Epcot
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  ride like it's showing you the history
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:35.000]  of the human race and it's like
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  evolution and all this nonsense
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  you come out of the mock and then
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  it's ancient Egypt and Babylon
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  and then it's the American founding fathers
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  and then the end of the ride is
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  like this nerdy little Bill Gates animatronic
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  Bill Gates over there slapping at a keyboard
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  in his basement like as if that's
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  the real way that Microsoft came to be
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  was just some nerdy guy, nerds in their garage
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:57.000]  and it's like a little animatronic Bill Gates
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:27:59.000]  get the numbers down get the numbers down
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  and then you ride into the matrix
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  like you ride into what is supposed to be
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  binary code the matrix so
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  the whole message
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  is not just
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  the city of tomorrow but
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  we'll also put you into in the matrix
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  in the city of tomorrow you see
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  and it's basically the history
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  of culture creation through
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  language and communications
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  right?
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  Yeah and by the way
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  part of the ride is that you're
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  tracking trail and surveilled through the whole
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  ride and they've secretly taken
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  pictures of you when you get out of Epcot
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  well I can pay $50 for a picture
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  and you go like this riding Epcot
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  riding the ride
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  and it was because they had been watching
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  you the whole time
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  and they tell you it's the future world
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  you'll be totally surveilled it's going to be so cool
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:49.000]  Don't go anywhere you're watching
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  The Office of John Show this is our breakdown
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  of Disney and we are going to be

[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:01.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  but I only had money to finance my own
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  simple little local radio show
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:07.000]  I wanted to hire camera people
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  and it was a t-shirt I designed
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  the first one mass murderers agree
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  gun control works
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  that helped us finance hiring the first
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:19.000]  two members of my crew

[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  take action now infowarsstore.com
[3:31:55.000 --> 3:31:57.000]  the UN estimates that over
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:31:59.000]  2 billion people alive on earth today
[3:31:59.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  have cognitive disabilities
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:03.000]  lower IQ's and so many other medical issues
[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:05.000]  because of one thing
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  iodine deficiency
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  and most iodine that you get from
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  different foods is bound
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  to other minerals or other compounds
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  so it's not absorbable in the body
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:17.000]  and that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:19.000]  we have the purest, cleanest,
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  best iodine in the world

[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:15.000]  I want to remind you that
[3:33:15.000 --> 3:33:17.000]  in about an hour or two on my youtube channel
[3:33:17.000 --> 3:33:19.000]  I'm going to be doing a live stream where I delve
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  really deep into Hollywood cults
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:23.000]  mind control, the whole blood drinking thing
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  what is that all about, how real is it
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:27.000]  it's very real
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  and you want to definitely come and check that out
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  my youtube channel is Jay Dyer
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  and I'm also over on Rockfin
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.000]  which is a great free speech based platform as well
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  it's a big fan, a big supporter of the work that I do
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:39.000]  so shout out to Rockfin
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  and definitely go subscribe there
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:43.000]  Jamie you were telling us about the
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  dark origins of Disney
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  and let's get more into
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  we learned that the CIA helped us
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:51.000]  secure the land, helped set up the bylaws
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  in some kind of city state
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  and to me, I've always thought
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  this is just a giant mind control
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  culture creation operation
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  that's really what it is
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  so if you've talked about that for
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  at least 20 years
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  and I know Alex has talked about that way before me
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  you've talked about it for a long time too
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  why is it that it's so hard for people
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  then to figure out
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  now that this is all coming out, oh they're grooming
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  no, shocker, we've been saying that for years
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  we conspiracy theorists
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  are always vindicated and yet we never
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  get the credit for that when we talk about it
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  10, 20 years ahead of time
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  now it's all coming out
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:29.000]  oh yeah, we drink blood in Hollywood
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  so what, so what
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  so it doesn't exist
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  and then when it comes out, yeah it exists
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  but so what, it's actually cool or whatever
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  yes, this revelation of the method
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  is polarizing people
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  so now they're gonna have to actually take a side
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  when all the facts are out on it
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  and then they're gonna be like, since they've been
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  demoralized, they're gonna be like, what's wrong with it
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  who are we, who is cultural
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  relativism dude, who are you to say
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  that it's wrong to drink blood or whatever
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  yeah, now Disney had
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  a role in this
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  toxic culture and then making everybody
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  culturally relativist
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  well, like I said, it's the most ideologically important
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  piece of land in the US and Disney
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  everyone knows that it's the largest multimedia
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.000]  conglomerate on earth
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  so it has the most
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  influence on popular
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  culture and that's why I talk about it so much
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  and I try to drive the point home that
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  well, Disney Co. is an evil
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  corporation well, one point
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  to interject here, I remember one of the
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  MK Ultra doctors, Dr. Gregory Bates
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  and he had a famous quote where he said
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  that if you really want to control
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  men and figure out how to
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  capture an entire society
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  and entire culture, he says you have to
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  capture their imagination yes
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:41.000]  and then that made me think about what is Disney
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  their whole tagline is like
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  they actually say we capture
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  your imagination, that's what Gregory Bates
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  and said the MK Ultra doctor
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  and then some of their
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:53.000]  employees are called imagineers
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  so they're
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  imagineering a different world
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  controlling your imagination right
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  so the Bucky golf ball, the Epcot ball
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  is sponsored
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  by Siemens, a fine naughty company
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  whose corporate logo could be found over
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  the gates of Auschwitz
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  and now it's in Disney World
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  and the theme of the ride like we were talking about before
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  is the history of language and communication
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:17.000]  from cavemen to the matrix
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  that's what I was saying
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  and the last thing you see is an animatronic
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  Bill Gates slapping a keyboard
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  in a basement
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  it's a small world after all
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:29.000]  is sponsored by Pepsi and UNICEF
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  and if you go to unicef.org right now
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  there's a giant photo of a vaccine
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  going into a kid's arm
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  and it says immunization
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  Agenda 2030, a global strategy
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  there's one behind
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  and it's so creepy
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  it's all just totally cynical, complete
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:47.000]  anti-human depopulation
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  cloaked in like
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:51.000]  sugar and candy and like
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  creepy mouse
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  mouse outfits
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  think about it's a small world
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  that's a global village
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  that's globalism
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  and then leave no one behind
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  that could have two meanings
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  like leave no people behind
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  well and I remember
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  the last time I was there I was thinking about
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  if you were to look above Disneyland
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  you'd have all the kids everybody wears the stupid mouse hats
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  it's like mice running around
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  in a rat maze
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  which is like a giant experiment basically
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  it's a giant rat experiment
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  we talked about this on my show on YouTube
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  you can find it under my name
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  and it's called out of this world
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  me and Kristen Lagan talked about science
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  and the effects of the studies of rats
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  and mice
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  are lab rats basically
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  so we are now the mickey mice
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  lab rats that they experiment on
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  well the more I think about it
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  this is basically just a giant acid trip
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  Disneyland is just
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  it's a small world after all
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  it's basically a bad acid trip
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  that's all it is
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  and we'll get to the monitor program in one second
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  I just wanted to talk about Disney
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  CIA connection a little bit more
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  so they're close associations
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:03.000]  with the CIA
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  and the intelligence community
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  this says Disney world is responsible for the nation's largest
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  single commercial application of biometrics
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  and that's true because when you enter the park
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  now you have to give your fingerprint
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  they take your face
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  biometrics and treat it
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  I remember I first heard that from Alex
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  he covered that back in probably
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  2004 or 2005
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  I remember Alex covering that
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  so after 9-11 the government actually sought
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:29.000]  Disney's advice on intelligence
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:31.000]  security and biometrics
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  as their parks, at their parks and the cruise line
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  and a number of Disneyland employees
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  have gone on to fill some of the most
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  sensitive positions in US intelligence
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  and security communities including
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  Disney executive Gordon Levin
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  Eric Hasteline and Bran Farron
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:47.000]  so
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  do not go to the parks
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  and give your fingerprint anymore
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  so now we come to Operation Mockingbird
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  I live in Florida for a year
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  and one thing you notice living in Florida
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  is that a lot of people in Florida
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  really live Disney, it's like their whole life
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  they will get
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  endless infinite past
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  you can forever go to Disneyland
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  I can imagine
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  wanting to go every day to Disneyland
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  they even
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  if you remember Walt created
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  what was supposed to be an ideal community
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  celebration
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  Florida and it's just weird
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  it's like the theme park
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  it's not owned by Disney anymore
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  they sold it off to somebody else
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  H.O. at homeowners association
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  rules anywhere
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  it's like Truman Show basically
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  there's a whole community that is supposed
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  to be like the Truman Show
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  it's super creepy
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  I think they even might have filmed a few scenes
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  or clips
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  I know it's filmed in another part of Florida
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  like Seabreeze or something like that
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  but if it's not, if I'm wrong about that
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  this place is basically like that
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  it's like the Truman Show
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  if you've ever been to celebration in Florida
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  there's a whole created community
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  that Walt thought would be like the ideal
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  community
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  so Operation Mockingbird
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:05.000]  everyone has heard of that probably
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  before but it was designed to manipulate
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  news media for propaganda and they spent
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  millions per year hiring journalists from Disney
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  and ABC and others
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  to promote their point of view
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  so files obtained through the
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  Freedom of Information Act reveal that the
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  Department of Defense and the CIA
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  backed and influenced hundreds of
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  movies and TV shows owned by the Walt Disney Company
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  so Disney's
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  special effects wizard Nick Guy named Robert
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  Kerry Broughton
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  created award-winning films for both Disney
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  and the OSS
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  which became CIA
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  all the OSS people who went into the first
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  era of big media so all the heads of
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  CBS, NBC, ABC
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  they were all people out of the OSS
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  Paley, Sarnoff, all these characters
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  and what you just read that's actually the first page
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  in my sequel
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  book is about the FOIA
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  request about how all that Pentagon
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  and military industrial
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  complex money was put into
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:01.000]  messages in every kind of show you could
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  imagine everything from cupcake wars
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  to Hawaii 5.0 they all
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  contained Pentagon
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  and military messaging.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  So then the
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  last point I want to make about Disney and the CIA
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  is obviously MK Ultra Artichoke
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  Monarch which is the
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  CIA program to make
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  you know, mind control
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  people and countless
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  self-proclaimed victims of trauma-based mind control
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  attest to the use of Disney films in their
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  programming. Wizard of Oz and Alice
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  in Wonderland are staples
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  along with Fantasia
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  and I actually have this handout
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  that you can get I think it's from
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:39.000]  Springmeyer and it's
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  how to brainwash your friends and family
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  and this is a step-by-step
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  script from a programmer
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  on what to say
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  on each scene in Fantasia
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  so they would give a child LSD
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  pop on Fantasia, read
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  the script to program them.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  Now if that sounds a little far-fetched
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  I actually did
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  uncover Dr. John C. Lily
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  in his book Programming and Metaprogramming
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  in the Human Biocomputer. He's one of the MK Ultra
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  doctors most famous for the whole
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  dolphin stuff that he was involved
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  in like really weird creepy mind control
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  dolphin fetish stuff not joking by the way
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  he actually does say in that book
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  that he would utilize imagery
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  that like you would find in Alice in Wonderland
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  when he was dosing children
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  with LSD so he
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  talked openly about that by the way Tim Leary
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  has an essay as well
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  where he talks about what the shaman
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  can do in the process of leading
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  people through trips to program them
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  he wrote a whole essay on that by the way
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  so some of these MK Ultra
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  and LSD proponents do actually
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  speak this way where they think
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  that there is a technique
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  by which you can program people through
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  things like
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  the imagery that's used in these cartoons
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  don't go anywhere this is the Alex John Show
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  we'll be right back.

[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:55.000]  at infowarstore.com
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  The UN estimates that over
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  two billion people alive on Earth
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:01.000]  today have cognitive disabilities
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:03.000]  lower IQs and so many other
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  medical issues because of one thing
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  iodine deficiency and most
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:09.000]  iodine that you get from
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  different foods is bound
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  to other minerals or other compounds
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  so it's not absorbable in the
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  body and that's why iodine deficiency is
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  such a huge issue we have the purest
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:21.000]  cleanest best iodine in the world

[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:53.000]  infowarstore.com
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:46:55.000]  here historic apparel now, infowarstore.com
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:46:59.000]  leading up frontal assault
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:01.000]  on the lies of the new world order
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  it's Alex Jones
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  Jason Alice just want to remind you that I'm going to be live
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  talking about crazy Hollywood cults
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  and blood drinking over my YouTube channel
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  in the next hour, hour and a half
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  so head on over there if you want to see that
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:27.000]  Jamie go ahead and get to the rest of your notes
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  you've got some juicy details rolling here
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:31.000]  we're going to the moon, let's do it in 10 minutes
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  so last time we were talking about
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  many pop stars who exhibit the signs of
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:37.000]  modern programming were once mouseketeers
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  Walt Disney and Alan Dulles
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:41.000]  are actually 20th cousins I found out
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  that's pretty weird
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  so let's talk about peeping Mickey
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  Disney's petal problem
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  Disney is a magnet for creepers
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  and many actually work for the company
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  director of music publishing at Disney
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  John Healy was arrested on three counts of loot acts
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  and abusing underage girls
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  Disney vice president Michael Laney
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  was convicted of sexually abusing a 7 year old girl
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  and sentenced to 6 years in prison
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  for former child star Ricky Garcia
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  filed complaint against manager
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  Joby Hart for allegedly
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  raping him throughout his adolescence
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  for other individuals were involved
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  at least 35 Disney employees
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  have been accused of sex crimes involving children
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  since 2006
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  there is a old scandal
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:23.000]  about Walt Disney and actor Bobby
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  Driscoll who played Peter Pan
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  that's a classic
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:29.000]  scandal if you want to dig it up
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  and then you have your Victor Salva
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  a formal child care worker
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  was sentenced to 3 years for molesting a 12 year old boy
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  who acted in two of his films
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:39.000]  Disney hired Salva after
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  he was released to make the movie
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  powder in 1995
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  and then Miramax and other subsidiaries
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:47.000]  are used to make money in pay-per-view porn
[3:48:47.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  and other loot things
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:51.000]  since the 90's so Disney
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:53.000]  has made
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  millions of millions of millions of millions of dollars
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  on dirty stuff
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  and they have a creeper problem
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  Jamie Henshaw and Greg Reese
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  on the same wavelength
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  cause he did a similar video
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  that reminded me of that video that Greg Reese did
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  so let's get to Epstein connection with Disney
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  because they are
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  neighbors Epstein Island is right next
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  to Disney's island
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  Little St. James aka Epstein Island
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  is off the coast of St. Thomas
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  which is a port of call on the Disney
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  line Caribbean cruise
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:25.000]  one excursion called Captain
[3:49:25.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  Nautica's Snorkeling Expedition
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  takes you to Little St. James
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  other
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  excursions are called Butterfly
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  Anytime and Butterfly Secrets
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  and then this picture
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  just came out of
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  Glaine Maxwell
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:43.000]  at an event organized by the mirror
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  called Disney Day Out
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  for the Kids at Longleat House
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  in Wiltshire where Glaine presented
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  a check for the Save the Children
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:53.000]  Fund and that was in September of 1985
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  nothing to see there
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  totally normal
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  what are you after a conspiracy there
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  ABC News anchor Amy Robach
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  was caught on hand camera admitting
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  that the network had the Epstein
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  story for three years before it broke
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  and had evidence against Prince Andrew
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  and the Clintons at that time also
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  but they were afraid to pursue the story
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  then you have Disney Chairman
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  Richard Cook he took trips on the
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  Express in 2002
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  then became the chairman
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  after he took those trips
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  Senator George Mitchell a Democrat
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  from Maine was accused in the Epstein case
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  he was also the chairman of Walt Disney Company
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  from
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  2004 to 2007 so between
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  2000 and 2014
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  200 passengers went missing from
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  cruise ships so that is super weird
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  I've always talked about
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  this is like my own kind of
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  cruise ship conspiracy theory
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  the cruise ships have to be
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  a front for something else I've always thought
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  that I mean I think there's been
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  a few cases but it's just one of
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  my theories. Glaine had
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  her
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  submarine pilot license
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  right so there
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  could have been some underwater
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  stuff going on. I didn't even know that.
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  So let's do the crowd favorite real fast and then we're going
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  to the weirdest part ever
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  subliminal messages
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  and
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  this used to be
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  lots of pps and butts everywhere
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  I think about
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  1956 was when they started
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  realizing that you could hide things
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  in between. Yeah they were doing a lot of
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:27.000]  subliminal research and it was so effective
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  that they actually had to outlaw it but then they
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  relaxed the rules a little bit and said well
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  we'll use it but it will be for the public's
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  best interest. So the first
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  one that everyone talks about is
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  the little mermaid phallus on the VHS
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  cover
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  the little priest has a little boner
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  when he's giving the wedding
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  of Prince Eric and the
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  villain
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:51.000]  the lion king
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  in the dust spells out S.E.X
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  and Lion King is a grooming movie in my
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  opinion we can talk about that maybe in a later
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  date. In the poster
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  Mufasa's face looks like a booty with panties
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  and then
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  there's a scene where Zazu
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:07.000]  is flying
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  and there's boobs in the desert
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  where he got back
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  so then the rescuers
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  has a naked lady in the window as they slide down
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  the ramp. That was the one that really convinced me
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  like a lot of these I was like I don't know but then I saw
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:21.000]  that one and I was like well you can't really deny
[3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:23.000]  that one. Monsters Inc
[3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  has a child drawing of Uncle Roger
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  doing mommy doggy style
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  Jamie
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  sorry
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  I didn't make it up and Lilo
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  has a wall full of pictures of people's butts
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  in the 1989 episode
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  of DuckTales called Yuppie Ducks
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  Scrooge visits the doctor who has an
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:43.000]  eye chart that says ask about
[3:52:43.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  Illuminati. That was the one that
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  really blew me away. I remember seeing that back
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  in like 2005 and I was like what
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  so these are just a couple of
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:53.000]  the examples that I found
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  and then there was one of Fantasia
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  that looks like Mickey standing in between some boobs
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  so very good. Yeah I mean I think
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  the Donald Duck Illuminati one is like
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  that's probably the craziest one.
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  Yeah so you've seen the movie Alien
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  by Ridley Scott right? I think
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  I have. And didn't you think
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  it would make a perfect ride for children
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  at Disneyland?
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  Okay so here's Disney
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  I think Xenomorphs
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  this is where it gets really weird
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  you guys so in January 1995
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  Walt Disney World hosted a UFO convention
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  the two week conference on
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  the ET and UFO phenomenon featured
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  scientists, authors and former military
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  it was not advertised
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  to the public and in preparation for the new
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.000]  ride in the new
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  Tomorrowland called Extraterrestrial
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:39.000]  Alien Encounter
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  to promote it they
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  made a documentary about UFOs and aliens
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  and in it they claim
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  that one intelligent beings
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  are beckoning mankind to join
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:51.000]  the galactic community
[3:53:51.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  so this movie
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:55.000]  has three premises it's like
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  one aliens are real
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  two you are going to meet them
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  and we are going to prepare
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.000]  you for that encounter
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:05.000]  so the
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  they reference the federally funded
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:09.000]  1960 Brookings Institute
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  report that warned the public
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:13.000]  of discovery of life in space might topple
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  civilization if faced with a race of
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  superior beings
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  it also says that it would
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  get rid of all the western biblical religions
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  too and I
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  covered that in my book because that was
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  a Brookings report
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  put out for NASA
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  and they actually said that the effect
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  of the discovery of alien life
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  would basically destroy anything to do
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  with theology and especially Christianity
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  because people would think oh I guess the
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  incarnation of Christ doesn't matter because
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  he became incarnate for human nature's sake
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  but there's other natures there's other races
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  and so I guess that's
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  not really a true story right because the universe
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  is bigger than this planet
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  it's all just a sigh of it's all
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  nonsense and I think
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  there's obviously a demonic element to it but if you watch
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  Morageman
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  that documentary actually
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  shows in depth how the whole alien
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  nonsense is used for PsyOps
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  so Disney Imagineers
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  have designed a way to prepare humans for their
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  inevitable alien encounter
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  and they say
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.000]  in this documentary that the atomic bomb
[3:55:15.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  was mankind's calling card announcing their
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  evolution on earth so now we are
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  ready for the next phase
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  in evolution which is meeting these
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  goolies from space
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  yeah people overlook
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  the role that Disney has
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  had in space
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  space mythology, exo-theology
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  alien life
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  if you remember it was I think Francis Ford
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  Coppola or Lucas one of the two that
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  was going to direct
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  the Captain EO ride or they did direct it
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  and that lasted for many years
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  and they basically used
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  Jacko in the whole mythology
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  and ethos of Jacko in the 1980s
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  and early 90s to promote this
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  ride which was all about
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  aliens
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  and beating the aliens
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  with rainbows
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  I'm not joking like Jacko would
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  shoot rainbows out of his white gloves
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  and it's music
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  and social justice rainbows
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  that beat the evil aliens
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  right so extraterrestrial
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  alien counters was actually so scary
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  that they had to tone it down because children
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  were crying and the actual
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  ride lasted only two years
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  because even after they toned it down twice
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  it was still too scary and they had to take it out
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  and it's something else now
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  so if you want to learn more about
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:31.000]  that these are the subject of
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:33.000]  my books operation culture creation
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  part one two and
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  Hollywood mind control
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:39.000]  so everything that we were talking about
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  today can be found in those and much much
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  more yeah and you get if you go to
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  my website go to the shop you get signed copies
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  so you can really support the work
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:49.000]  that we do by getting those books
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  you know one thing we tried to do is not
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  just make these
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  your average run-of-the-mill kind of conspiracy
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  books we actually put a whole bunch of research
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  into it so like my books have
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  three hundred sixty three footnotes
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  and the first one three hundred fifty footnotes
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  or so in the second one maybe three hundred I don't remember
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  but you know that they're
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  really source well they're not
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  just like speculations and here's
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  a symbol I think it means this
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  it's done in a very academic way because that's what
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  I studied in grad school was this very topic
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  so avail yourselves of our books

[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  material this this topic not enough people know

[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  and that's really the key issue
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:33.000]  here and I want to say also
