[00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:09.057]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:13.698]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:16.599]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:38.358]  I talk about this all the time, but the quickening is here.
[00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:42.499]  And humanity is at a crossroads deciding which way it's going to go.
[00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.920]  There are so many amazing developments taking place that it makes my head spin.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.122]  But as I sit here in California, before the sun's even come up, it's a metaphor for a new day.
[00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.502]  I talked so much yesterday.
[00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.274]  That my tongue is literally raw on one side and sore.
[00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:10.962]  I did a five hour podcast with a gentleman who right now is the number one podcaster in the world.
[00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:16.407]  Joe Rogan is number one overall, the body of his great work, but this fella right now is the number one podcast.
[00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:18.609]  He's only been doing it about two weeks.
[00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.432]  And I'm not even going to say who he did the podcast with until right before it airs.
[00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.081]  It was very explosive, very positive, very negative, very argumentative.
[00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:35.063]  The fellow's very, very smart, but he was trying to get me to turn against Trump.
[00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:39.284]  I've been persecuted so much for Trump, if we're telling the truth, that's why.
[00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:49.728]  It's hard to even be critical of Trump when he deserves it, because when you've been pig-headed defending somebody for so long, and been persecuted,
[00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:55.939]  It's hard to turn on him, but I'm not close to turning on Trump.
[00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:12.193]  Trump has done a great job on so many fronts, but what happens is when you get around people in Hollywood or in business or anywhere, they get on your ass and they say, listen, I really like you, but you need to turn against Trump right now or I'm not going to be your friend.
[00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:13.975]  Well, don't be my friend then.
[00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:20.746]  Because the BS that Trump is a white supremacist, no matter how many times you say it isn't true.
[00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:25.547]  The BS that Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist, no matter how many times you say it, it's not true.
[00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:33.049]  The BS that I'm making stuff up to hurt people isn't true, no matter how many times you say it.
[00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.749]  And all this bullying and intimidation isn't working anymore.
[00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:41.670]  But I see why some people succumb to it.
[00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.891]  But then after you start talking to them behind the scenes, they go, yeah, I know you're right.
[00:02:47.028 --> 00:02:49.870]  And that's happening all over LA.
[00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.972]  We're super popular here.
[00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:58.238]  Even though you're in the midst of all the brainwashing and inside this big-ass bubble of disinformation.
[00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:00.900]  So we got Tom Papert hosting the show today.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.181]  He does a great job.
[00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:10.188]  Yesterday's broadcast with Ellen Schreuer and the reports we had, I ended up watching about an hour of it last night.
[00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:11.329]  I watched about an hour of it this morning.
[00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:15.585]  Just top flight radio TV.
[00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:17.467]  There's nothing more informative.
[00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:28.520]  Yesterday's Tuesday show is the benchmark of quality information that's pro-human for a pro-human future.
[00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:33.284]  The globalists have decided that they're going to replace humans.
[00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:34.344]  It's the final revolution.
[00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:38.546]  Nobody can ever resist you in the entire paradigm as it's known.
[00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:44.169]  We are standing against that, saying we're not just going to accept your destiny you've laid out for us.
[00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:50.312]  And that's what InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Banned.Video are all about.
[00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:55.655]  And that's why the power, again, that you have to take action and override their censorship is beyond paramount.
[00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:56.175]  It's total.
[00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:57.135]  It's complete.
[00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:57.856]  It is victory.
[00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:01.118]  Resistance and action is victory.
[00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:04.100]  When you have the right motivation and the right ideology.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.221]  And this is a pro-human ideology.
[00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.462]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:10.383]  Now we've got a bunch of special reports today.
[00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.805]  Tom Pafford and so much more.
[00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:17.368]  I'll be back in the office about 1 o'clock so I can pop in on air and list my tongue.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.682]  Over here on the side, I'm just yelling and ranting for almost five hours, and at most the show yesterday.
[00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:27.584]  So I've never had this where I've got a raw side of my tongue.
[00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:31.126]  But my tongue doesn't swell up too much more.
[00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:33.967]  I'll be on there as well at the end, end of the fourth hour.
[00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:36.028]  Regardless, thanks for all your support.
[00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:37.309]  Wild horses couldn't drag us away.
[00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.709]  We love you.
[00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:39.430]  I know you love me.
[00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.530]  We're all in this together.
[00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.491]  You can feel victory.
[00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:48.419]  It's gonna be a rough future coming up, but we are on a trajectory, on a trajectory to win.
[00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.900]  So I'll see you in the future.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.804]  That was Alex Jones.
[00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:55.287]  I'm Tom Papert filling in for Alex today.
[00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:57.649]  We'll be back right after this break.
[00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:02.917]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:07.698]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:09.939]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.981]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there,
[00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:19.425]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[00:05:19.425 --> 00:05:21.266]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:22.547]  Helps make DNA.
[00:05:22.547 --> 00:05:23.868]  Helps the body produce energy.
[00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:25.369]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:27.371]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:28.191]  It goes on and on.
[00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:36.477]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[00:05:36.477 --> 00:05:39.019]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.420]  It helps fund the inflow war.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.720]  So it's a 360 win.
[00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:45.845]  And it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:51.171]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[00:05:51.171 --> 00:05:54.755]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price.
[00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:56.436]  50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:08.944]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:11.168]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:20.433]  Welcome everyone to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:26.115]  I am Tom Pappert, filling in for Alex as he gets back from this very important trip to California.
[00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:31.517]  He'll be back in studio, hopefully later this afternoon, around 1 p.m.
[00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:39.580]  Today is an absolutely insane news day as Democratic mega-donor Ed Buck has been arrested.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.162]  A third man died at his home.
[00:06:43.162 --> 00:06:45.843]  Police say that he is directly responsible.
[00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:55.428]  Ed Buck, what he reportedly allegedly likes to do is shove crystal meth into his victims and feed off their energy.
[00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:59.010]  One of the alleged victims actually went public in the media saying that.
[00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.552]  It's another episode of Alex Jones was right again.
[00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:05.573]  There's big things happening in the Middle East today as well.
[00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:11.516]  We're going to have a guest on in the second hour, Patrick Howley of National File and the Epoch Times.
[00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:15.358]  Israel is not a good place to be right now.
[00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:19.460]  Everybody knows there are issues with Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister.
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.821]  Everybody knows there are certain issues with Israel.
[00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:28.104]  Nobody understands the foreign aid this country gives to any of these Middle Eastern countries, any country in the world.
[00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:30.065]  I'm personally an isolationist.
[00:07:30.065 --> 00:07:30.946]  I'll come out and say it.
[00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:41.149]  America first, but what's happening in Israel right now could very well launch the United States into yet another geopolitical conflict in the Middle East.
[00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:42.609]  Nobody is looking forward to that.
[00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:47.431]  The fake news is talking about Elizabeth Warren saying she's the new frontrunner.
[00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:50.371]  They're saying 20,000 people go to her rallies now.
[00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:52.032]  For some reason, I just don't believe it.
[00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:56.996]  There's a new pandemic threat that could devastate the world population.
[00:07:56.996 --> 00:07:58.497]  There's abortion news.
[00:07:58.497 --> 00:08:03.261]  We're actually at the lowest number of abortions in this country in many, many years.
[00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:14.251]  And as InfoWars has reported for decades now, your TV is listening to you, your Alexa is listening to you, and now your smart faucet is listening to you.
[00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:18.555]  Let's start by talking about Ed Buck.
[00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:19.896]  Again, he was just arrested
[00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:24.979]  Police say that he has killed, now, three people.
[00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:32.302]  Let's go ahead and air this video from LA.
[00:08:32.302 --> 00:08:33.682]  Blue and Cher, good evening to you.
[00:08:33.682 --> 00:08:35.683]  This is still a very active investigation.
[00:08:35.683 --> 00:08:49.228]  The crime scene tape is up, the street is blocked off, and detectives are currently inside the home of prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck, who has been at the center of controversy following the suspicious deaths of two gay men inside his apartment
[00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:51.969]  In the span of just 18 months.
[00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:55.671]  Let's get you right to some of this video of the arrest just a short time ago.
[00:08:55.671 --> 00:09:04.456]  Here you can see Buck taken away in handcuffs, charged with operating a drug den out of his West Hollywood home and providing methamphetamine.
[00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:11.299]  The latest victim, a 37-year-old man who overdosed inside Buck's apartment last week, but survived.
[00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:16.322]  In court filings, the district attorney says Buck injected his victim with methamphetamine on September 11th.
[00:09:17.262 --> 00:09:20.604]  Neighbors say they've been suspicious for years.
[00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:22.125]  Other men were not so lucky.
[00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:29.909]  Last January, 55-year-old Timothy Dean was found dead inside Buck's apartment located here on the 1200 block of North Laurel Avenue.
[00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:33.411]  The coroner saying he died of a methamphetamine and alcohol toxicity.
[00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.013]  He was the second man to die inside the home in less than two years.
[00:09:38.013 --> 00:09:42.056]  In July 2017, 26-year-old Jamel Moore was found dead.
[00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:44.737]  Officials say he died of a methamphetamine overdose.
[00:09:44.737 --> 00:09:48.360]  His death was ruled an accident and no charges were filed.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.003]  Those close to Moore say he was working as a sex worker at the time he visited Buck's apartment.
[00:09:54.003 --> 00:09:55.864]  Another man who asked to remain anonymous,
[00:09:55.964 --> 00:10:04.170]  Jones previously told KTLA that Buck would instruct his male escorts to use high levels of drugs so he could watch their reactions.
[00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.494]  Buck, who is openly gay, was home at the time both men died.
[00:10:08.494 --> 00:10:12.817]  Advocates for the victims, as well as neighbors, say his arrest is a long time coming.
[00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.055]  This is one of those instances, and I think we can go ahead and end that video now.
[00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:26.102]  This is one of those instances where you just sit there and wonder, how many people have to wind up dead before police get involved?
[00:10:26.102 --> 00:10:29.566]  I guess the number is two, almost three that we know of.
[00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:41.824]  So, according to prosecutors, Ed Buck, a prominent Democrat donor, big Hillary guy, is a violent, dangerous, sexual predator.
[00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:43.064]  He preys on his victims.
[00:10:43.064 --> 00:10:44.625]  This is allegedly what he likes to do.
[00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.247]  Some of the victims have come forward to say this.
[00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:49.608]  He gets a young black man.
[00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:50.609]  He prefers them young.
[00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:57.653]  In fact, the one of the men who died reportedly was a former victim who showed up at his house and Ed Buck reportedly killed him.
[00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:06.353]  But what he likes to do is he gets these young black men, he brings them to his apartment, to what the police are now calling a drug den.
[00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:11.259]  He allegedly shoots them up with drugs, methamphetamine, and he watches their reaction.
[00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:17.425]  He feeds off their energy, according to one of the alleged victim.
[00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.815]  The man's name who says this, and this is what InfoWars has been telling you for years.
[00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:36.367]  According to the Daily Mail, Jermaine Gagnon claims Bunk paid to fly him from Minnesota to his apartment in Los Angeles, drugged him by dissolving a substance into his Gatorade, and then injected him with drugs.
[00:11:37.108 --> 00:11:44.037]  28-year-old provided pictures which show Buck crouching over him on a mattress pull-out bed during one of their nights together.
[00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:49.304]  And a toolbox of sex toys which he pulled out during their encounter.
[00:11:49.304 --> 00:11:51.286]  This man donates to Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:53.449]  This man donates to top Democrats.
[00:11:55.054 --> 00:12:05.516]  Now we of course have seen his arrest, but what I really want to get to is the quote by this poor individual who says that he is one of the victims, and the photos would seem to suggest there might be some truth to it.
[00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:18.179]  Gagnon says he was homeless and couchsurfing in April of 2018 when he met Buck on a gay dating site, Adam for Adam, and was offered $200 to spend the evening with him at his West Hollywood apartment.
[00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:23.120]  He said, I'd done sex for money many other times, but I don't make it a habit.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.541]  First day we met, I met him at his house.
[00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:28.382]  There's a gate at the main entrance, and he buzzed me up.
[00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:29.363]  He's on the second floor.
[00:12:29.363 --> 00:12:37.768]  When I walked in, it was dim lights, a mattress in the middle of the floor, three mirrors surrounding the mattress, and a flat-screen TV mounted on a wall.
[00:12:37.768 --> 00:12:39.589]  It was just kind of weird.
[00:12:39.589 --> 00:12:45.792]  He admitted explaining that the 63-year-old enjoyed dressing him up and treating him like a sex slate.
[00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:55.761]  He said that Buck was open about enjoying men who are young, black, handsome, and well-endowed.
[00:12:55.761 --> 00:13:00.442]  He was quite open about being very generous to the black community.
[00:13:00.442 --> 00:13:04.103]  He went on, I'm his type, and pretty much half the black community is his type.
[00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:04.983]  Vulnerable.
[00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:05.964]  Depressed.
[00:13:05.964 --> 00:13:10.605]  If you're in a depressive state, that's the energy that feeds him.
[00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:26.801]  I first came across this article when it was fresh, and now that the man's been arrested, it just really makes you wonder what is going on in this country at the high levels, the stuff that we will likely never know, because all of these headlines are ripped from the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:33.927]  Alex has been saying this for years, that these Democrat elite, these globalist elite, they feed off the energy of people.
[00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:38.611]  They will kill you for sport and watch your soul leave your body for fun.
[00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:48.299]  Now we have a victim, alleged victim, who says that Ed Buck literally feeds off of his energy while he drugs people to death.
[00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:56.383]  And this latest man, it sounds like it was a brush with death as he fled the apartment fearing he was having a methamphetamine overdose.
[00:13:57.608 --> 00:14:14.859]  So we're going to have Patrick Halley on in the next hour to talk about how this plays into what goes on with the NXIVM sex cult, to what happened with Jeffrey Epstein, all of these interrelated circles that all work together to create the globalist paradigm.
[00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:16.801]  It's going to be a fascinating interview, but
[00:14:17.912 --> 00:14:22.735]  We're going to follow this story closely as well, because this is a long time coming.
[00:14:22.735 --> 00:14:25.676]  Black activists are rightfully celebrating this.
[00:14:25.676 --> 00:14:32.781]  There was a massive rally protest outside of Buck's apartment late last night.
[00:14:32.781 --> 00:14:38.464]  As again, the third man has been found to have had an overdose at Ed Buck's home.
[00:14:38.464 --> 00:14:45.088]  So in the next segment, we're going to get into exactly what's happening in the Middle East right now, because it is an absolutely shocking thing to see.
[00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:51.890]  And I don't like these foreign entanglements that the United States has found itself in.
[00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:59.032]  But for better or worse, the last, oh I don't know, 20 presidents have got us into this mess.
[00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:06.914]  And now, we could easily see these foreign entanglements get us into a new world war.
[00:15:06.914 --> 00:15:10.555]  Netanyahu's opponent who, it seems like he may have lost.
[00:15:10.555 --> 00:15:12.835]  This guy could be the next Prime Minister.
[00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:15.356]  National File, my website, can report that he is
[00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:21.819]  Potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Iran.
[00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:25.944]  And they say that the Israeli deep state wanted him in this position.
[00:15:25.944 --> 00:15:30.390]  He doesn't bode well for peace in the Middle East.
[00:15:32.313 --> 00:15:34.154]  We'll talk more about that in the next segment.
[00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:36.174]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:36.174 --> 00:15:37.294]  I'm Tom Papert.
[00:15:37.294 --> 00:15:38.675]  Filling in for Alex.
[00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:41.175]  Keep an eye out for that very important podcast.
[00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:46.117]  It's going to drop in the next couple weeks it sounds like and I am extremely excited to watch it.
[00:15:46.117 --> 00:15:47.777]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:47.777 --> 00:15:49.157]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.778]  Patrick Howley coming up in the next hour.
[00:15:51.778 --> 00:15:54.839]  Make sure to stay tuned for that here on InfoWars.
[00:15:58.001 --> 00:15:59.221]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:15:59.221 --> 00:16:03.142]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:03.142 --> 00:16:04.683]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.683 --> 00:16:07.643]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.643 --> 00:16:13.205]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.405]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:14.405 --> 00:16:17.346]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:17.346 --> 00:16:19.546]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:23.987]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:16:23.987 --> 00:16:26.288]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:30.350]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.

[00:16:38.896 --> 00:16:44.380]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.020]  We're good to go!
[00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:09.642]  That's right.
[00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:29.732]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:30.852]  Get back to nature.
[00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:38.153]  Expand your horizons with the highest quality, most versatile, unique slingshots and sling bows on the market at slingbow.com.
[00:17:38.153 --> 00:17:41.554]  Slingbow products are compact and models start from just 1798.
[00:17:41.554 --> 00:17:45.135]  They're perfect for your bug out bag or storing in your vehicle.
[00:17:45.135 --> 00:17:49.295]  Give yourself and your loved ones the excitement and tradition of slingbow.
[00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:53.856]  A new frontier in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.
[00:17:53.856 --> 00:17:56.517]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[00:17:59.073 --> 00:18:06.495]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are.
[00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:19.779]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:26.941]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:28.702]  It sells itself.
[00:18:28.702 --> 00:18:37.625]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:38.806]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:51.711]  BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:55.073]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[00:18:55.073 --> 00:18:59.335]  50% off on BODY'S at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:18:59.335 --> 00:19:01.016]  We have entered a great time of change.
[00:19:02.298 --> 00:19:23.410]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government, known as a technocracy in their own words, that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:23.751]  At first,
[00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:26.955]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[00:19:26.955 --> 00:19:28.176]  Don't support Trump.
[00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:29.698]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:32.481]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father.
[00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:34.543]  And, well, let us sterilize your children.
[00:19:34.543 --> 00:19:36.445]  Take these forced inoculations.
[00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:38.427]  And here, take this Prozac pill.
[00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:41.170]  And here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.271]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.352]  This is truly the Mark of the Beast system, and we're on air right now covering it.
[00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.593]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged.
[00:19:49.593 --> 00:20:01.758]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you for yourself, and myself, and my family, and your family, spread the word about Infowars.com, the live shows, right now.
[00:20:01.758 --> 00:20:04.419]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.986]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:33.312]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.312 --> 00:20:37.935]  I'm Tom Pappard filling in for Alex as again he's on a very important podcast.
[00:20:37.935 --> 00:20:40.017]  I'm very much looking forward to seeing that.
[00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:49.063]  Before we get into what's happening in the Middle East, I just want to take a second and stress how important it is to support this broadcast and all of InfoWars.
[00:20:49.063 --> 00:20:51.044]  Think about everything this network has done.
[00:20:51.044 --> 00:20:54.566]  It's such an honor to be sitting in this chair in this studio.
[00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:58.049]  This is the network that largely secured President Trump's
[00:21:00.106 --> 00:21:06.830]  This is the network that has kept this country out of more foreign military conflicts over the last few years.
[00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:15.876]  This is, I would say, the number one conservative libertarian network that is in existence, and they're expanding every single day with your support.
[00:21:15.876 --> 00:21:18.918]  So right now, these are some of the best deals I've ever seen.
[00:21:18.918 --> 00:21:27.524]  I'd have no idea how Alex makes a profit doing this, I'll be completely honest, because right now you can get up to 75% off dozens of products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:29.966 --> 00:21:34.549]  75% off Total Gut Health Combo Pack with 7 powerful formulas.
[00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:40.973]  50% off Super Male Vitality and it comes with a free bottle of Ultimate Female Force.
[00:21:40.973 --> 00:21:45.956]  63% off the best-selling MycoZX Plus Fungus and Yeast Support.
[00:21:45.956 --> 00:21:48.798]  50% off Ultra 12 Vitamin B12.
[00:21:48.798 --> 00:21:51.139]  I'm a big fan of Ultra 12 Vitamin B12.
[00:21:51.139 --> 00:21:53.801]  The hardest part about traveling is doing without the majority of these.
[00:21:54.321 --> 00:22:00.624]  And then 60% off super blue silver immune gargle, and I've actually got mine with me here.
[00:22:00.624 --> 00:22:03.545]  I refuse to travel without this stuff.
[00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:05.146]  It's an absolute lifesaver.
[00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:12.149]  I don't know about the folks at home, but whenever I travel, whenever I'm in an airplane for four, six hours, you always get something in your throat.
[00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:14.751]  You always get an upper respiratory something.
[00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:17.052]  And this seems to do the trick at finding that.
[00:22:17.052 --> 00:22:17.872]  You can also get 50% off bodies.
[00:22:19.893 --> 00:22:22.834]  Many, many other fantastic deals.
[00:22:22.834 --> 00:22:27.436]  Now is the time to take advantage of these great prices.
[00:22:27.436 --> 00:22:30.017]  Many products are already beginning to sell out.
[00:22:30.017 --> 00:22:33.558]  This is your opportunity to support the InfoWars.
[00:22:33.558 --> 00:22:37.700]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.261]  So let's talk about the globalist big dream.
[00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.322]  You know, we got rid of John Bolton.
[00:22:43.322 --> 00:22:44.382]  Everybody celebrated.
[00:22:44.382 --> 00:22:46.023]  It seemed like it was going to be great.
[00:22:46.023 --> 00:22:48.244]  I always wonder, is this the revenge of Bolton?
[00:22:49.192 --> 00:23:04.942]  Because now, Israel, which America financially supports and gives weapons to, they're going to have a man who is essentially far left-wing on everything but military, where he is a war hawk.
[00:23:04.942 --> 00:23:17.029]  He could be the next prime minister, and if he is not the next prime minister, then there will be a kingmaker who will force Netanyahu back into attacking Hamas.
[00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.870]  And this all comes up
[00:23:19.381 --> 00:23:31.127]  After National File broke an exclusive story, nationalfile.com, Netanyahu opponent could be blackmailed by Iran, and the Iranian deep state is covering it up.
[00:23:31.127 --> 00:23:33.449]  They have their candidate.
[00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:48.137]  Two sources told the National File the parts of the Israeli government, what some would consider the Israeli deep state, are hiding compromising material that could allow Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political opponent, Lieutenant General Benny Gantz, to be blackmailed
[00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:49.397]  By Iran.
[00:23:49.397 --> 00:23:54.298]  You see, Gant, as do many powerful people, he has a vice.
[00:23:54.298 --> 00:24:03.681]  And that vice is apparently, allegedly, according to two sources who came to National File independently, that vice is women.
[00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:05.741]  He has a mistress!
[00:24:05.741 --> 00:24:07.022]  We've certainly heard of this before.
[00:24:07.022 --> 00:24:08.102]  Bill Clinton.
[00:24:08.102 --> 00:24:08.682]  President Trump.
[00:24:09.841 --> 00:24:14.242]  But, generally not a good idea to do that when you're running for political office.
[00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:20.183]  So, earlier this year it was widely reported that Iran had hacked Gantz's email.
[00:24:20.183 --> 00:24:28.345]  What was not widely reported is that they gained compromising intel about his mistress.
[00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:34.147]  And what definitely has not been widely reported is that the Israeli Deep State, the Israeli Army, the IDF,
[00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:39.598]  Well, it has a division called the Censorship Division.
[00:24:39.598 --> 00:24:45.700]  And they decide what flies, what goes out in the public forum within Israel.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.583]  And so while this story is out there, multiple Israeli media outlets wanted to report this prior to yesterday's election.
[00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:56.864]  None were allowed to do so.
[00:24:56.864 --> 00:25:03.426]  And so now, we have this deadlocked election where Netanyahu is not going to be able to secure a majority.
[00:25:04.465 --> 00:25:09.849]  Gantz won't be able to either, but there's going to be a kingmaker who wants nothing more than endless war.
[00:25:09.849 --> 00:25:19.998]  And as we all know, when there's war in the Middle East, somehow the United States always has to get involved.
[00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:30.647]  The censorship division decided that this would pose a national security risk to Israel if it were public that the next prime minister might be blackmailed by Iran.
[00:25:30.647 --> 00:25:32.988]  Is there not some sort of comedic value to that?
[00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:37.299]  And now, we have Iran.
[00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:44.862]  There's a kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman, who wants to make sure that Israel goes back to war.
[00:25:44.862 --> 00:25:46.983]  Isn't that phenomenal?
[00:25:46.983 --> 00:25:55.407]  And again, I bring this up not to defend Israel, not to say that I think we need to send more money and weapons and everything else to the Middle East for any reason.
[00:25:55.407 --> 00:25:57.068]  I don't want us to give foreign aid to anybody.
[00:25:57.068 --> 00:25:58.768]  Nobody should give foreign aid from the United States.
[00:25:58.768 --> 00:25:59.429]  America first.
[00:26:01.249 --> 00:26:05.950]  I predict this is going to lead to further conflict in the Middle East.
[00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.491]  This is from endoftheamericandream, also infowars.com.
[00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:26.174]  Last November, this Lieberman character resigned as Israel's defense minister when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to reject Lieberman's plan for a military operation in Gaza and instead agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas instead.
[00:26:26.174 --> 00:26:29.915]  This man quit his job because there wasn't enough war.
[00:26:31.732 --> 00:26:37.174]  My goodness, if only we could have got rid of John Bolton the same way it took him being fired.
[00:26:37.174 --> 00:26:42.035]  And now, this man is the leader of a party that will serve as the kingmaker.
[00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:45.416]  You see, neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority.
[00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:47.257]  They're both stuck in limbo.
[00:26:47.257 --> 00:26:52.278]  And this man is going to get to say, whoever will go to war, you're going to be the next Prime Minister.
[00:26:54.022 --> 00:26:55.422]  That's a terrible place to be.
[00:26:55.422 --> 00:27:00.664]  It's a terrible... This is really a result of what happens when the United States allies with these powers.
[00:27:00.664 --> 00:27:05.825]  But say what you will, there are two countries in the Middle East that are really decent places to live.
[00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:10.467]  One of them, the United States, under Hillary and Obama, desperately trying to destroy.
[00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:13.127]  That's, of course, Syria, where they're protecting Christians.
[00:27:13.127 --> 00:27:18.269]  The other is Israel, where they're at least trying to live in peace.
[00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.489]  Now,
[00:27:19.892 --> 00:27:20.413]  That may be
[00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:53.015]  Posturing itself for more war in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia says it has material evidence tying Iran to the Aramco attack.
[00:27:53.015 --> 00:28:10.724]  Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that contrary to its initial estimates, Aramco should be able to get back up and going, but the kingdom's defense ministry said it was planning a press conference to present material evidence purportedly linking Tehran to the unprecedented attack on the kingdom's oil infrastructure.
[00:28:12.807 --> 00:28:13.568]  This is another thing.
[00:28:13.568 --> 00:28:22.255]  You know, Tulsi Gabbard, not that I would ever vote Democrat in my life, but she's been pointing out that the United States does not exist to be Saudi Arabia's protector.
[00:28:22.255 --> 00:28:25.518]  She uses a slightly more colorful language than that.
[00:28:25.518 --> 00:28:31.544]  But this is what happens when we depend on a Middle Eastern theocracy for our oil.
[00:28:31.544 --> 00:28:36.068]  I think what needs to happen in this country is we need to continue pursuing energy independence so we can stop
[00:28:38.123 --> 00:28:41.828]  Bowing to Saudi Arabian kings and getting involved in their conflicts.
[00:28:41.828 --> 00:28:45.293]  I think that would be the best course for President Trump to continue to take.
[00:28:45.293 --> 00:28:46.875]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:48.717]  I'm Tom Paffert filling in for Alex.
[00:28:48.717 --> 00:28:50.019]  He's on his way back.
[00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:51.982]  He might be popping in this afternoon.
[00:28:51.982 --> 00:28:52.683]  Stay tuned.
[00:28:52.683 --> 00:28:54.145]  We'll be back after this break.
[00:28:58.106 --> 00:29:00.068]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.068 --> 00:29:05.393]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:05.393 --> 00:29:06.975]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:15.323]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.323 --> 00:29:21.029]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:21.189 --> 00:29:23.010]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.291]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:29.673]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:29.673 --> 00:29:31.874]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:31.874 --> 00:29:39.718]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:04.975]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[00:30:04.975 --> 00:30:09.717]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:13.199]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:14.559]  It's been a bestseller.
[00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:26.105]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[00:30:26.565 --> 00:30:36.231]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[00:30:36.231 --> 00:30:41.475]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[00:30:41.755 --> 00:30:45.918]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:49.660]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.662]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[00:30:52.662 --> 00:30:58.846]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[00:30:58.846 --> 00:31:01.708]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[00:31:03.157 --> 00:31:08.418]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are.
[00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:13.439]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the Globalist battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:14.899]  That's why they're so upset.
[00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:16.880]  Think how far we've come together.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:26.382]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order, who've really taken the mask off.
[00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.283]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[00:31:29.283 --> 00:31:34.706]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption, and to stand with God, and to stand with the unborn.
[00:31:34.706 --> 00:31:40.608]  So I just wanted to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[00:31:40.608 --> 00:31:48.172]  And without you, and your prayers, and your word of mouth, and your financial support, this operation that you built, that's your operation, would not be here.

[00:32:25.174 --> 00:32:35.861]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, and licorice root is known to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm, good way.

[00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:03.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.246 --> 00:33:17.790]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.574]  It is time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:20.574 --> 00:33:23.458]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.458 --> 00:33:28.725]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.725 --> 00:33:31.248]  I am Tom Paffert filling in for Alex.
[00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:42.736]  So last segment we were talking about what's really going on in the Middle East, what's really going on with this Israeli election that you're undoubtedly hearing about from every major media source this morning.
[00:33:42.736 --> 00:33:54.404]  So you know what's really happening, as it was reported on nationalfile.com and infowars.com, let's see what the globalist propaganda engine at AP News, let's see what they have to say.
[00:33:54.404 --> 00:34:00.888]  So we just heard, just to recap, that there is now a kingmaker party in Israel that is going to demand
[00:34:02.169 --> 00:34:03.529]  War with Hamas.
[00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:09.811]  They're going to demand essential, essentially genocide of Palestine in all likelihood.
[00:34:09.811 --> 00:34:14.333]  But this is the absolute insanity that's being put out by AP.
[00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:20.054]  Israel's Arabs poised to gain a new voice after a tight election.
[00:34:20.054 --> 00:34:21.455]  Isn't that great?
[00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:27.696]  Gotta remember here in the United States, they're saying no walls from Mexico to Palestine.
[00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:29.757]  No border, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:34:31.121 --> 00:34:33.842]  This is insanity, what we're seeing right here.
[00:34:33.842 --> 00:34:38.403]  But this is what they want the world to believe.
[00:34:38.403 --> 00:34:47.225]  In this Tuesday photo, Israeli Arab politician Ayman Odeh cast his vote.
[00:34:47.225 --> 00:34:48.285]  Isn't that lovely?
[00:34:48.285 --> 00:34:54.467]  Israel's Arab coalition appears to be poised to emerge as the main opposition bloc following Tuesday's election.
[00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:57.708]  A historic first that would grant a new platform
[00:34:58.456 --> 00:35:01.259]  To a long, marginalized minority.
[00:35:01.259 --> 00:35:02.821]  Doesn't that just sound so lovely?
[00:35:02.821 --> 00:35:05.884]  It's almost like it's not true.
[00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:21.361]  Near-complete results Wednesday indicated the Joint List won about a dozen seats in the 120-member assembly, coming third after the Blue and White Party of former military chief Benny Gantz and the right-wing Likud Party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:35:21.361 --> 00:35:26.805]  In absolute terms, the Arab bloc appears to have met or fallen short of its performance in 2015.
[00:35:26.805 --> 00:35:37.612]  But this time around, due to shifting constellation of Israeli politics, it would be well-placed to lead the opposition if a national unity government of the two largest parties is formed, as seems
[00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:40.453]  Likely.
[00:35:40.453 --> 00:35:44.035]  This is insanity that they're reporting this as if it's some wonder.
[00:35:44.035 --> 00:35:46.336]  This could mean the death of these people.
[00:35:46.336 --> 00:35:48.277]  That is what this election actually means.
[00:35:48.277 --> 00:35:51.338]  But they report it as though it's a wonderful thing.
[00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:52.699]  It's multiculturalism.
[00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:56.261]  It's everybody's getting together in a circle and singing, Kumbaya!
[00:35:57.588 --> 00:36:02.852]  Meanwhile, we could have a world war erupt in the Middle East any day now.
[00:36:02.852 --> 00:36:08.957]  As guns are pointed toward Iran, we're pointing it back toward Saudi Arabia.
[00:36:08.957 --> 00:36:14.061]  And by the way, on Big Tech, this just shows the allegiance of these people.
[00:36:14.061 --> 00:36:22.168]  Facebook is still auto-generating results for the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda in terms of pages.
[00:36:22.168 --> 00:36:24.329]  You can see they're on screen for the document cam.
[00:36:24.329 --> 00:36:25.951]  I love Islamic State!
[00:36:27.526 --> 00:36:29.226]  Isn't that insane?
[00:36:29.226 --> 00:36:32.127]  That's our big tech overlords for you.
[00:36:32.127 --> 00:36:34.367]  Right there.
[00:36:34.367 --> 00:36:37.808]  But this does, I mean, this, again, who on earth does this?
[00:36:37.808 --> 00:36:41.849]  Pages from a confidential whistleblower's report obtained by the Associated Press.
[00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:45.430]  Who goes to the AP with your whistleblower's report?
[00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:50.511]  Along with two printed Facebook pages that were active on Tuesday, September 17th, are photographed in Washington.
[00:36:51.732 --> 00:37:00.319]  Facebook likes to say that its automated systems remove the vast majority of prohibited content glorifying the Islamic State, group, and Al-Qaeda before it's reported.
[00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:07.504]  But a whistleblower's complaint shows that Facebook itself has inadvertently produced dozens of pages in their names.
[00:37:07.504 --> 00:37:12.568]  These are the algorithms that are meant to rule our lives and make everything work.
[00:37:12.568 --> 00:37:13.229]  Isn't that lovely?
[00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:19.694]  The algorithms that were attempted to be gamed for Hillary Clinton, the algorithms that are now being gamed for
[00:37:21.189 --> 00:37:25.090]  The new crop of Democrats, as insane as they all might be.
[00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:29.872]  But speaking of Hillary Clinton, you know, largely what's happening in the Middle East is due to her policies.
[00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:33.213]  I mean, it was her and Obama who created ISIS.
[00:37:33.213 --> 00:37:36.635]  It was, of course, Hillary who destabilized much of North Africa.
[00:37:36.635 --> 00:37:45.798]  She's the reason why you, if you had the money and the inclination and the lack of morality, you could go to Libya today and buy a black slave.
[00:37:46.803 --> 00:37:50.387]  He eradicated slavery in the West and Hillary Clinton brought it back in Libya.
[00:37:50.387 --> 00:37:51.048]  Isn't that nice?
[00:37:51.048 --> 00:38:00.619]  Well, Hillary Clinton, this is an article up at Infowars.com, Steve Watson, she is still complaining that she lost to Trump.
[00:38:02.841 --> 00:38:04.962]  When is this lady going to get over it?
[00:38:04.962 --> 00:38:08.902]  It's honestly pathetic at this point, but this article is absolutely insane.
[00:38:08.902 --> 00:38:16.384]  She has apparently been mentoring some of the Democrat candidates to run against Trump in 2020.
[00:38:16.384 --> 00:38:21.005]  That's sure to please all Trump supporters everywhere.
[00:38:21.005 --> 00:38:22.606]  Can we roll this video?
[00:38:22.606 --> 00:38:24.166]  I'm fascinated by this lady.
[00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:25.567]  I don't know why she's still out there.
[00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:27.107]  She should be hiding under a rock by now.
[00:38:29.815 --> 00:38:36.079]  So, I've talked with many of the Democratic candidates for president, as you might guess.
[00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:43.244]  I've answered their questions about everything from digital outreach... She's talking to these people, she's answering their questions.
[00:38:43.244 --> 00:38:52.731]  Who better to consult with for your campaign than the losing candidate who lost a rigged election?
[00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:55.813]  ...obstacle might very well turn out to be and that...
[00:38:59.613 --> 00:39:05.116]  I'm mesmerized by this, the fact that she is still going, still running her mouth.
[00:39:05.116 --> 00:39:09.159]  She warned the Russians are coming to meddle in the election yet again.
[00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:20.587]  We have a fundamental set of threats at the bedrock of our democracy and anyone who stands in the way of confronting those threats is abdicating their responsibility to protect and defend the Constitution.
[00:39:20.587 --> 00:39:25.110]  I was the first person who ran for president in more than 50 years without the protection of the Voting Rights Act.
[00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.051]  She also complained.
[00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:28.072]  What a complete
[00:39:28.812 --> 00:39:34.655]  And the fact that she's consulting with the new crop of Democrats doesn't surprise me.
[00:39:34.655 --> 00:39:39.597]  I mean, look, we all know that social media, everything was tilted in her favor in 2016.
[00:39:39.597 --> 00:39:43.519]  And just think about what's happened over the last few years.
[00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:45.600]  Let's go ahead and start to get into this because it's
[00:39:46.528 --> 00:39:48.349]  Absolutely horrifying.
[00:39:48.349 --> 00:40:04.199]  A couple weeks ago I was here in studio with Alex and you may remember we were reporting on the potential new gun control push that will weaponize your Alexa, your Fitbit, your everything, to spy on you, give that information to the government, and then allow the government to do one of two things.
[00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:10.083]  Either come and take your guns, or put you on prescription SSRIs, or both.
[00:40:11.001 --> 00:40:15.643]  Well now, new article up at Zero Hedge, it's up at Infowars.com as well.
[00:40:15.643 --> 00:40:21.466]  Smart TVs have been caught sending sensitive user data to Facebook and Netflix.
[00:40:21.466 --> 00:40:25.508]  You know, every single day Alex Jones is completely vindicated.
[00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:33.712]  I remember when I was a kid, I was a child, and Alex was saying, look, these devices are listening to you, it's already in the patents, go look it up for yourself.
[00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:36.171]  And now here it is.
[00:40:36.171 --> 00:40:37.712]  Mainstream news.
[00:40:37.712 --> 00:40:47.654]  Just when social media companies were starting to modify their data collection practices to better respect user privacy, the next threat is coming from the Internet of Things.
[00:40:47.654 --> 00:40:49.654]  Smart TVs are becoming increasingly popular.
[00:40:49.654 --> 00:40:53.955]  In some cases, users' data are being sent to Netflix even though they didn't have an account.
[00:40:53.955 --> 00:40:55.516]  This is kind of like with Facebook.
[00:40:55.516 --> 00:41:00.637]  Facebook can mine your user data even if you've never had a Facebook account in your life.
[00:41:01.537 --> 00:41:02.798]  And it's not just smart TVs.
[00:41:02.798 --> 00:41:08.381]  Other smart devices from speakers to cameras have also been caught sending user data to third parties like Spotify.
[00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:13.923]  Nearly 70% of Americans have a smart TV or a Roku or Apple TV.
[00:41:13.923 --> 00:41:21.828]  Nearly all these devices have recognition technology that tracks what you watch and sells that data, approximating your interest to advertisers.
[00:41:21.828 --> 00:41:26.430]  You know, viewers who watch Firepower, which is on every night from 7 until 9 p.m.
[00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.032]  with myself and Will Johnson, know that I've been building a new studio there.
[00:41:30.972 --> 00:41:44.122]  And when you're shopping for TVs, this is how it works now I learned, you can choose to get a dumb TV and you can pay $1,200, or you can get a smart TV and pay $600.
[00:41:44.122 --> 00:41:51.188]  And it doesn't take a genius to sit there and think, what on earth is the difference between these two TVs?
[00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:53.810]  It's the same exact size, the same exact technology.
[00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.331]  One's a smart TV and it's cheaper.
[00:41:56.525 --> 00:42:00.430]  And one is a dumb TV and it costs twice the amount of money.
[00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:10.523]  Could it be that they're stealing my data to spy on me and sell it to whoever is paying the most and that subsidizes the cost?
[00:42:10.523 --> 00:42:12.826]  This isn't exactly hard stuff to understand but...
[00:42:14.238 --> 00:42:15.859]  Apparently most Americans don't care.
[00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:17.019]  I think that's the real problem.
[00:42:17.019 --> 00:42:18.039]  We're all numb to this.
[00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:21.220]  Everybody just knows that your smartphone is spying on you.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.981]  You mention a word and two days later it's in a Facebook ad.
[00:42:23.981 --> 00:42:24.961]  You never even type it.
[00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:26.022]  You never do a Google search.
[00:42:26.022 --> 00:42:32.043]  We all just kind of accept this as the price that we pay to live in this wonderful advanced society.
[00:42:32.043 --> 00:42:35.064]  We're going to talk more about this when we come back after the break.
[00:42:35.064 --> 00:42:36.565]  Big tech is one of the major
[00:42:38.126 --> 00:42:44.950]  Destructive forces of our time and nobody, it seems like nobody is trying to reign it in whatsoever.
[00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.252]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:47.252 --> 00:42:51.074]  I'm Tom Pafford filling in for Alex as he returns from California.
[00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:52.575]  He's on a very big podcast.
[00:42:52.575 --> 00:42:54.296]  Keep an eye out for that.
[00:42:54.296 --> 00:42:56.057]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:42:57.597 --> 00:43:01.839]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:06.602]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[00:43:06.602 --> 00:43:08.843]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[00:43:08.843 --> 00:43:13.245]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[00:43:13.245 --> 00:43:18.328]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[00:43:18.328 --> 00:43:20.149]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[00:43:20.149 --> 00:43:21.450]  Helps make DNA.
[00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:22.771]  Helps the body produce energy.
[00:43:22.771 --> 00:43:24.271]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[00:43:24.271 --> 00:43:26.273]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[00:43:26.273 --> 00:43:27.033]  It goes on and on.
[00:43:27.253 --> 00:43:35.359]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:37.901]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[00:43:37.901 --> 00:43:44.746]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:43:44.746 --> 00:43:50.070]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:55.314]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:43:58.214 --> 00:44:03.956]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[00:44:03.956 --> 00:44:08.698]  that has their products in hospitals and it's sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[00:44:08.698 --> 00:44:12.159]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:13.540]  It's been a bestseller.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:25.084]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[00:44:25.564 --> 00:44:35.192]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[00:44:35.192 --> 00:44:40.457]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[00:44:40.717 --> 00:44:42.879]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere.
[00:44:42.879 --> 00:44:44.901]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[00:44:44.901 --> 00:44:48.644]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:51.647]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[00:44:51.647 --> 00:45:00.054]  We can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[00:45:00.054 --> 00:45:01.756]  We have entered a great time of change.
[00:45:03.132 --> 00:45:24.146]  Social engineers, who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government, known as a technocracy in their own words, that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[00:45:24.146 --> 00:45:24.486]  At first,
[00:45:25.507 --> 00:45:27.690]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:28.911]  Don't support Trump.
[00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:30.433]  Don't vote Alex Jones.
[00:45:30.433 --> 00:45:33.196]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father.
[00:45:33.196 --> 00:45:35.279]  And, well, let us sterilize your children.
[00:45:35.279 --> 00:45:37.181]  Take these four sinoculations.
[00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:39.163]  And here, take this Prozac pill.
[00:45:39.163 --> 00:45:41.906]  And here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:42.988]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[00:45:44.286 --> 00:45:48.069]  This is truly the Mark of the Beast system, and we're on air right now covering it.
[00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:50.331]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged.
[00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:58.938]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you, for yourself, and myself, and my family, and your family, spread the word about Infowars.com, the live shows, right now.
[00:45:58.938 --> 00:46:08.266]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East, with the Saudi oil fields destroyed, half of their
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.301]  Capacity.
[00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:13.003]  5% of world capacity.
[00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:19.487]  Whoever's behind it, know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[00:46:19.487 --> 00:46:26.252]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet.
[00:46:27.196 --> 00:46:48.222]  And that we are just mortal, flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment, and to pray for peace, and to pray for transparency, and to pray that the very twisted, evil forces on this planet, trying to start a world war, will be exposed, and their attempts at creating an even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:51.303]  Now, we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully, but it's already
[00:46:52.616 --> 00:46:55.899]  Tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises.
[00:46:55.899 --> 00:47:02.265]  We're covering it all live on the radio at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:02.265 --> 00:47:04.887]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:22.888 --> 00:47:24.129]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.129 --> 00:47:27.511]  Again, I am Tom Faber filling in for Alex as he gets his way back here.
[00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:32.074]  He may be back in studio at 1 o'clock, so stay tuned.
[00:47:32.074 --> 00:47:47.125]  We've been talking about big tech and I really want to go big picture here because big tech is working hand in hand with our globalist overlords to create this new perfect paradigm that they want to usher in that is not a human paradigm but
[00:47:47.785 --> 00:47:57.569]  This is a just, this is an important article because Facebook, this is really them flaunting their power over the legal system, over Congress, over everybody.
[00:47:57.569 --> 00:48:00.551]  Everybody knows Laura Loomer is suing Facebook.
[00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:04.452]  You may remember her appearance on the Alex Jones Show from a few months back.
[00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:10.095]  She is suing Facebook because Facebook has considered Laura Loomer a hate figure.
[00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:16.738]  She's a 5'7 Jewish girl, but she's a hate figure according to Facebook and she must be banned!
[00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:28.338]  She's every bit as bad as Alex Jones, or Paul Joseph Watson, or that dangerous white supremacist Milo Yiannopoulos, who coincidentally is married to a black guy.
[00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:34.643]  So in that lawsuit, Facebook has now filed a motion to dismiss.
[00:48:34.643 --> 00:48:42.529]  And it is perhaps the most confusing motion to dismiss I have ever read in my entire adult life, which admittedly is not that long.
[00:48:42.529 --> 00:48:43.890]  Maybe there's something crazier.
[00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:44.811]  Somebody can show it to me.
[00:48:44.811 --> 00:48:46.012]  But this was something else.
[00:48:47.273 --> 00:49:03.396]  So in its response to independent journalist Laura Loomer's lawsuit against the platform, Facebook refers to itself as a publisher, which means it could potentially forego protections afforded to all big tech, all social media networks, by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[00:49:03.396 --> 00:49:16.058]  So for people who don't know how this works, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, they're all in this bizarre world, middle line area, where they're not a publisher, they're not a newspaper, because a newspaper
[00:49:16.698 --> 00:49:21.101]  If a newspaper publishes libel, you can sue the pants off that newspaper.
[00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:23.242]  You can make it bold.
[00:49:23.242 --> 00:49:28.925]  So they're not a newspaper, they're not a publisher, but at the same time it's not a public forum.
[00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:33.168]  They can ban anyone they want without it being a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:49:33.168 --> 00:49:44.335]  So, in this bizarre world, clown world, legal document, they somehow managed to make the case that they are indeed a publisher, but they're not a publisher.
[00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.912]  Motion to dismiss Loomer's lawsuit against the big tech company.
[00:49:48.912 --> 00:49:53.174]  Facebook's legal counsel appears to specifically refer to the company as a publisher.
[00:49:53.174 --> 00:49:54.034]  It says this.
[00:49:54.034 --> 00:49:55.235]  Third, to the extent Ms.
[00:49:55.235 --> 00:50:00.177]  Loomer's claim targets Facebook's decision to deactivate her accounts, it is also deficient.
[00:50:00.177 --> 00:50:08.861]  Under well-established laws, neither Facebook nor any other publisher can be liable for failing to publish someone else's message.
[00:50:08.861 --> 00:50:12.123]  So here, Facebook is saying, we're a newspaper.
[00:50:12.123 --> 00:50:13.884]  It's just like at Infowars.com.
[00:50:15.023 --> 00:50:22.940]  Nobody has the right to just send an article to InfoWars or NewsWars.com and have it published.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:23.401]  That's true!
[00:50:24.434 --> 00:50:26.135]  But Facebook says it's not a publisher.
[00:50:26.135 --> 00:50:27.737]  Anybody can go to Facebook.
[00:50:27.737 --> 00:50:29.158]  But they can ban people.
[00:50:29.158 --> 00:50:30.839]  But anybody can go to Facebook.
[00:50:30.839 --> 00:50:42.828]  Strangely, later in the motion, Facebook then invokes Section 230, and what Reclaim the Net, which I'm a big fan of that website, it seems to be a great civil liberty on the internet website, describes as a mind-boggling stance.
[00:50:42.828 --> 00:50:48.633]  Facebook's mind-boggling claim that its First Member rights allow it to ban users for exercising their own First Member rights,
[00:50:49.133 --> 00:50:53.115]  And that's not even the only puzzling and contradictory point from the filing.
[00:50:53.115 --> 00:50:59.658]  Another is the way Facebook refers to itself as a publisher at one point, only to later in the same document invoke Section 230.
[00:50:59.658 --> 00:51:00.879]  The extent Ms.
[00:51:00.879 --> 00:51:05.861]  Loomer's claim targets Facebook, nor any other publisher, can be liable.
[00:51:05.861 --> 00:51:17.647]  And then it goes on to describe itself on page 18 as a company that is protected by Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act.
[00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:21.258]  It's totally insane.
[00:51:21.258 --> 00:51:25.539]  I love that we got this on the document cam because this is where Facebook is leading us.
[00:51:25.539 --> 00:51:28.040]  This is where all these insane people are leading us.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:32.081]  This is another article from by Paul and Joseph Watson up at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:32.081 --> 00:51:45.146]  Governments are not prepared for a pandemic that could kill 80 million people, warns the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, a joint entity formed by the World Bank and the WHO.
[00:51:46.889 --> 00:51:55.655]  This is the die-off, the great murder of humanity that Alex Jones has always been talking about.
[00:51:55.655 --> 00:51:57.336]  And they want it to happen.
[00:51:57.336 --> 00:52:11.686]  There is a very real threat of a rapidly moving, highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen killing 50 to 80 million people and wiping out nearly 5% of the world's economy, warns the paper, adding that the world is not prepared for this.
[00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:19.269]  A global pandemic on that scale would be catastrophic, creating widespread havoc, instability, and insecurity.
[00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:31.117]  The GPMB says governments need to invest more in emergency preparedness, and that misinformation on social media is also exacerbating the spread of diseases.
[00:52:31.117 --> 00:52:33.158]  But don't worry.
[00:52:33.158 --> 00:52:35.440]  Trump is being pressured to ban vaping.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.221]  And that will solve everything.
[00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:38.522]  It's a mosquito-borne virus.
[00:52:39.721 --> 00:52:44.285]  Could be a form, not this, but a form of what kills people.
[00:52:44.285 --> 00:52:49.609]  A man went from healthy to brain dead in nine days from a mosquito-borne virus.
[00:52:49.609 --> 00:53:00.339]  64-year-old man was a perfectly healthy, happy human being less than two weeks before his August 19 death from a rare mosquito-borne virus.
[00:53:00.339 --> 00:53:03.241]  Here's a comforting headline.
[00:53:03.241 --> 00:53:04.662]  Are you guys ready for this?
[00:53:04.662 --> 00:53:05.743]  This year's flu season
[00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.351]  Maybe a bad one.
[00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:10.673]  Here's why you need a flu shot.
[00:53:10.673 --> 00:53:13.235]  Are you ready for your flu shots, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:53:13.235 --> 00:53:19.940]  Flu seasons are notoriously unpredictable, but there are already clues that the upcoming season may be especially difficult.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:23.242]  Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere can be an indication of what's to come in the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:28.106]  In the recent flu season in Australia, where winter just ended, arrived early and with a vengeance!
[00:53:28.106 --> 00:53:30.488]  A particularly virulent flu strain, H3N2, dominated
[00:53:32.947 --> 00:53:35.768]  What's more, pediatric flu deaths have already been reported in the U.S.
[00:53:35.768 --> 00:53:39.169]  A four-year-old in California who had underlying health problems.
[00:53:39.169 --> 00:53:42.030]  That's the part that they never put in the headline, is it?
[00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.390]  Underlying health problems.
[00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:44.991]  The very young who are already sick.
[00:53:44.991 --> 00:53:47.251]  The very old who are already sick.
[00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:48.372]  But you better get your flu shot.
[00:53:49.383 --> 00:53:57.469]  We should never forget that the flu kills, said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, a public health officer for Riverside County, California.
[00:53:57.469 --> 00:54:01.132]  A death so early in the flu season suggests this year may be worse than usual.
[00:54:01.132 --> 00:54:04.995]  The CDC estimates that last year there were 37 million to 43 million flu illnesses, 36,000 to 61,000 related deaths.
[00:54:14.159 --> 00:54:15.339]  You better get your flu shot.
[00:54:15.339 --> 00:54:16.820]  Here we go.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:23.121]  The concern with delaying it is that some people who might have the opportunity to get vaccinated now may not have that opportunity later.
[00:54:23.121 --> 00:54:28.142]  That's Dr. Robert Atmar, professor of medicine and infectious disease expert at Baylor College.
[00:54:28.142 --> 00:54:33.163]  The most important thing is for people to get their flu vaccine and get it before the epidemic starts.
[00:54:33.163 --> 00:54:40.204]  Most healthy people get the shot in September and can expect some protection through the spring, but older adults may want to schedule their vaccination for sometime in October.
[00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:45.242]  There's no mention of what the flu shot actually does.
[00:54:45.242 --> 00:54:48.824]  It protects against one very specific strain of the flu.
[00:54:48.824 --> 00:54:51.605]  And who even knows what the strain that you could get sick with will be.
[00:54:51.605 --> 00:54:52.826]  It's all total insanity.
[00:54:52.826 --> 00:54:55.467]  But this is then the globalist agenda.
[00:54:55.467 --> 00:54:57.328]  We're all going to get sick and die of the flu.
[00:54:57.328 --> 00:54:58.388]  Mosquitoes are biting us.
[00:54:58.388 --> 00:54:58.928]  We're going to die.
[00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:01.510]  There's a respiratory illness that's going to take out 80 million people.
[00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:08.733]  But the elites want us to live in 100 square foot parasite pods.
[00:55:08.733 --> 00:55:10.514]  And it's the housing of the future.
[00:55:11.869 --> 00:55:21.008]  Of course, Paul Joseph Watson had a similar article and a video that went along with it last week, but this is up at nationalfile.com, and this is the future.
[00:55:21.008 --> 00:55:21.729]  This is what they want.
[00:55:23.524 --> 00:55:28.611]  Put some of the images on screen from an article that's embedded in this one.
[00:55:28.611 --> 00:55:29.652]  This is what they want for us.
[00:55:29.652 --> 00:55:34.058]  We're going to live in these 100 to 180 square foot pods.
[00:55:34.058 --> 00:55:36.160]  These tiny little homes.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:41.868]  And if you look at these things, it looks like a wasp nest on the side of somebody else's building.
[00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:55.013]  Parasite pods are part of a broader design subclass called parasitic architecture, defined as temporary structures that feed off energy from a host building to provide power, utilities, structural support.
[00:55:55.013 --> 00:55:59.976]  Some aesthetically disturbing examples can be seen online.
[00:55:59.976 --> 00:56:09.542]  And this is being put forward in China, in Spain, in Malaysia, all across the world, as the next step.
[00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.971]  In human evolution.
[00:56:11.971 --> 00:56:20.753]  So I know we don't have much time here, but let's see exactly what this type of living conditions brings with clip number 5.
[00:56:20.753 --> 00:56:25.754]  This is what happens when people are destitute and living in close quarters.
[00:56:25.754 --> 00:56:26.775]  We can bring that up.
[00:56:26.775 --> 00:56:31.976]  There we go.
[00:56:31.976 --> 00:56:37.618]  Police people fighting over who knows what.
[00:56:38.755 --> 00:56:43.717]  I believe it's happened right here in Austin, if I understand correctly.
[00:56:43.717 --> 00:56:46.359]  Texas Street Fights TV.
[00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:47.559]  My goodness.
[00:56:47.559 --> 00:56:48.980]  These are some of the lovely campers.
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:56.644]  You know, they just need a nice parasitic home and maybe a flu vaccine and all will go well.
[00:56:56.644 --> 00:57:00.145]  This is disgusting footage.
[00:57:00.145 --> 00:57:04.808]  This is what humanity is being degraded to.
[00:57:04.808 --> 00:57:07.129]  Thanks to our globalist overlords here.
[00:57:08.473 --> 00:57:09.995]  Alright, I think we've seen enough.
[00:57:09.995 --> 00:57:15.924]  We better stop it before it gets unfriendly for a family audience, but... This is what the globalists want.
[00:57:15.924 --> 00:57:19.430]  I mean, IQ has plummeted over the past few decades.
[00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:20.732]  Lauride had a lot to do with that.
[00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:31.094]  This is the type of behavior, this is the type of living conditions, this is the type of illnesses that they're going to continue to force upon us if we don't fight back.
[00:57:31.094 --> 00:57:35.996]  InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:57:35.996 --> 00:57:37.096]  I'm Tom Papperts.
[00:57:37.096 --> 00:57:38.677]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:38.677 --> 00:57:41.878]  Alex should be back in studio later today.
[00:57:41.878 --> 00:57:42.498]  Stay tuned.
[00:57:42.498 --> 00:57:45.440]  We're back with Patrick Howley on the other side of this break.
[00:57:48.257 --> 00:57:56.801]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[00:57:56.801 --> 00:58:01.443]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[00:58:01.443 --> 00:58:08.346]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[00:58:08.826 --> 00:58:18.534]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[00:58:18.534 --> 00:58:32.946]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues and many others.
[00:58:34.864 --> 00:58:37.388]  And we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[00:58:37.388 --> 00:58:39.992]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[00:58:39.992 --> 00:58:44.017]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[00:58:44.017 --> 00:58:46.321]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[00:58:48.757 --> 00:58:51.780]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.722]  It was selling it for over a year.
[00:58:53.722 --> 00:59:00.890]  It's a private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the body, but not be a depressant.
[00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:06.156]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our top 10 bestsellers.

[00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:12.242]  Life is stressful.

[00:59:39.114 --> 00:59:40.115]  It's Happies.

[00:59:51.705 --> 00:59:54.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.524 --> 01:00:04.065]  We're good.
[01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.832]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.832 --> 01:00:17.373]  I am Tom Paffert, your host.
[01:00:17.373 --> 01:00:31.464]  In the beginning of the last hour, we were talking about Ed Buck, who has now been arrested after three men that we know of have reportedly overdosed after he allegedly injected crystal meth into their body.
[01:00:31.464 --> 01:00:37.049]  One victim says he does it so he can feed off the energy of young black men who are in distress.
[01:00:38.353 --> 01:00:41.975]  For this segment and maybe the next few, we're going to have Patrick Howley with us.
[01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.897]  Patrick Howley is a reporter for Epoch Times as well as my website, National File.
[01:00:45.897 --> 01:00:50.199]  Patrick has previously been at Breitbart, Big League Politics, Daily Caller.
[01:00:50.199 --> 01:00:54.300]  He is a heavy hitter when it comes to these topics.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.362]  One of my favorite people at Howley Reporter on Twitter.
[01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:58.683]  Make sure you follow him.
[01:00:58.683 --> 01:01:02.985]  Patrick was instrumental in breaking down everything that happened with NXIVM.
[01:01:04.065 --> 01:01:08.228]  The famous sex cult that was really a human trafficking cult.
[01:01:08.228 --> 01:01:13.132]  Patrick also was instrumental in helping the world understand what was going on with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:01:13.132 --> 01:01:16.434]  So I thought, who better to bring into this conversation?
[01:01:16.434 --> 01:01:19.536]  Patrick, I know you're familiar with what happened with Ed Buck.
[01:01:19.536 --> 01:01:23.479]  What do you consider his arrest?
[01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:24.480]  What do you view this as?
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.821]  Is this a step in the right direction?
[01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:28.174]  Well, you would think so.
[01:01:28.174 --> 01:01:36.440]  I mean, you would think he would have been arrested after the first black man died at his home after being overdosing, after being injected with crystal meth.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.942]  You would have thought he would have been arrested after the second black man died at his home.
[01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:41.524]  Now, this third man did not die.
[01:01:41.524 --> 01:01:42.604]  He survived.
[01:01:42.604 --> 01:01:51.151]  However, this is enough to get Ed Buck charged with battery causing serious injury, administering meth, and maintaining a drug house.
[01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:53.592]  So he is finally being brought to justice.
[01:01:53.592 --> 01:01:54.913]  These are felony counts.
[01:01:54.913 --> 01:01:59.256]  He is, of course, a Hillary Clinton donor and a very close friend of the Clintons.
[01:01:59.256 --> 01:02:13.146]  And so this is yet another person who's in the Clinton nexus, who has been accused in a civil suit of human trafficking, who is obviously preying on black men and, you know, taking pleasure and delight in their suffering and their misery.
[01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:18.149]  This is something we often see from elitists who are involved in human trafficking who are connected to the Clintons.
[01:02:18.149 --> 01:02:21.191]  They thrive on the suffering of their victims.
[01:02:22.152 --> 01:02:28.276]  Now you brought up a really important connection there because it does seem as if they are all connected to the Clintons in some way shape or form.
[01:02:28.276 --> 01:02:31.938]  We of course had Jeffrey Epstein intimately acquainted with the Clintons.
[01:02:31.938 --> 01:02:39.303]  We had the NXIVM human trafficking sex cult where they were giving illegal donations to Clinton in 2008.
[01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:41.524]  And now we have Ed Buck who is their super donor.
[01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:47.088]  So is this, in your view, is this just a commonality between elites and
[01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:52.923]  Well, it's a network, and it's a network of people who are all connected with one another.
[01:02:52.923 --> 01:02:59.689]  And so the Trump administration, and also me as an investigative reporter, have been going after these so-called placeholder cases.
[01:02:59.689 --> 01:03:02.072]  Jeffrey Epstein was one of those placeholder cases.
[01:03:02.072 --> 01:03:05.455]  However, they killed Jeffrey Epstein, where he committed suicide.
[01:03:05.455 --> 01:03:11.421]  And so, you know, he's not going to then turn on the people like Jelaine Maxwell, who he was involved with.
[01:03:12.242 --> 01:03:18.390]  It's interesting to note that Keith Raniere of NXIVM, his sentencing is now delayed until 2020.
[01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:21.054]  That gives him a lot more time to talk.
[01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:27.483]  And so my appeal to the prison guards who are guarding Keith Raniere right now is, please don't pull an Epstein.
[01:03:27.483 --> 01:03:28.464]  Keep this man safe.
[01:03:29.065 --> 01:03:50.994]  Okay, not for his sake, but for our sake, because this guy was being funded by the Bronfmans, the cult was illegally bundling money for Hillary Clinton, Kirsten Gillibrand's family was in the child trafficking cult, they were running human experiment daycares in Guatemala and Mexico, grooming little kids, giving them fake visas to get them up over the border, and
[01:03:51.634 --> 01:03:57.757]  Claire Bronfman's brother even owned the land where the child sex bunker was found in New Mexico.
[01:03:57.757 --> 01:03:57.977]  Wow.
[01:03:57.977 --> 01:04:10.963]  So, you can see the whole map of human trafficking as it comes up from Central America over the border, and then these kids get pumped into situations where they are the victims of satanic, pedophile human traffickers.
[01:04:10.963 --> 01:04:12.664]  That is the issue of our times.
[01:04:12.664 --> 01:04:15.205]  That's the power structure of our world right now.
[01:04:15.205 --> 01:04:19.947]  And they can't kill every Jeffrey Epstein because all this truth is cascading out into the open.
[01:04:20.515 --> 01:04:21.675]  I think you're exactly right.
[01:04:21.675 --> 01:04:23.696]  We are winning this thing whether they like it or not.
[01:04:23.696 --> 01:04:27.016]  Patrick, we've got to take a short commercial break here in about 30 seconds.
[01:04:27.016 --> 01:04:35.298]  When we get back, I want to pick your brain about why is it that they're always going after, I mean, we had NXIVM going after almost exclusively Hispanic children.
[01:04:35.298 --> 01:04:37.539]  We had Epstein who went after a certain subset.
[01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:40.259]  We have Ed Buck who goes after young black men.
[01:04:40.259 --> 01:04:43.280]  It almost, it's very bizarre and very interrelated.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.380]  As you said, it is absolutely a network.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.621]  I'm Tom Paffert filling in for Alex Jones today.
[01:04:47.621 --> 01:04:49.521]  He will be back in studio, hopefully.
[01:04:49.882 --> 01:04:52.591]  Later this afternoon, but you are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:55.883]  We'll be back with Patrick Halle after this short break.
[01:04:57.182 --> 01:05:02.945]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:07.668]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:10.189]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[01:05:10.189 --> 01:05:12.510]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:24.057]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[01:05:24.517 --> 01:05:34.189]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[01:05:34.189 --> 01:05:39.436]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[01:05:39.656 --> 01:05:43.882]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[01:05:43.882 --> 01:05:47.627]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:47.627 --> 01:05:50.631]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:54.917]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[01:06:08.434 --> 01:06:19.122]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.122 --> 01:06:21.584]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:21.584 --> 01:06:23.866]  I am Tom Paffert filling in for Alex today.
[01:06:23.866 --> 01:06:28.790]  It's an honor to be here with my very, very important guest, Patrick Howley.
[01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:36.936]  He's at Howley Reporter on Twitter, and he is by and large the most devastatingly effective journalist when it comes to breaking apart
[01:06:37.316 --> 01:06:41.177]  These sex rings, sex cults, alleged drug dens.
[01:06:41.177 --> 01:06:44.719]  So Patrick, we were talking a little bit in the last few seconds of the last segment.
[01:06:44.719 --> 01:06:49.100]  They always seem to go after very specific subsets of the population.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:57.223]  And this is from one of the alleged victims of Ed Buck, who made it out, who fled the apartment and never returned.
[01:06:57.223 --> 01:07:00.744]  This was a homeless young black man who had been on the street.
[01:07:00.744 --> 01:07:05.846]  He was allegedly paid $200 by Buck to spend the night with him.
[01:07:06.506 --> 01:07:10.090]  And this is one of the quotes that he gave the media.
[01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:14.575]  He said, I'm his type, and pretty much half the black community is his type.
[01:07:14.575 --> 01:07:15.375]  Vulnerable.
[01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:16.477]  Depressed.
[01:07:16.477 --> 01:07:21.442]  If you're in a depressive state, that's the energy that feeds him.
[01:07:21.442 --> 01:07:23.364]  That's the energy that feeds him.
[01:07:23.364 --> 01:07:29.210]  I think that is the most startling and shocking line I've read this year.
[01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:34.993]  Talk a little bit, if you could, about how these people, do you agree they feed off energy?
[01:07:34.993 --> 01:07:40.396]  That's what we had with Epstein, that's what we had with NXIVM, and now that's what we allegedly have with Ed Buck.
[01:07:40.396 --> 01:07:41.037]  Do you agree with that?
[01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:48.239]  Yes, they feed off of misery, they feed off of adrenaline, but they feed off of negative energy.
[01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:52.962]  And if you are somebody who is a marginalized person, then you are at risk.
[01:07:52.962 --> 01:07:54.623]  Look at Child Protective Services.
[01:07:54.623 --> 01:08:08.412]  It was Hillary Clinton, through her husband, signing the Adoption and Safe Families Act in 1997 that created financial incentives to take kids out of their homes, put them in foster care, and now the State Department confirms that they're being child sex trafficked.
[01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:10.514]  And so that happened because of the Clintons.
[01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:16.960]  There is now an entire industry all over the country of kids who are being sex trafficked through Child Protective Services.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.501]  The Clintons put that in place.
[01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:23.606]  The Clintons have been at the center of human trafficking for the last 20 or 30 years.
[01:08:23.606 --> 01:08:28.891]  And we are seeing everybody who's connected with them now during the Trump years, you know, being a target.
[01:08:28.891 --> 01:08:31.373]  Church of Scientology is being sued for human trafficking.
[01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:35.054]  Church of Scientology has a very powerful lobbying shop in DC.
[01:08:35.054 --> 01:08:38.774]  Their lobbyist, Greg Mitchell, you can find photos of him with Hillary Clinton.
[01:08:38.774 --> 01:08:42.155]  You can go to the L. Ron Hubbard House in DuPont Circle, as I've been.
[01:08:42.155 --> 01:08:45.016]  I took a VIP tour during the election.
[01:08:45.016 --> 01:08:52.737]  And you can see very clearly that this occult, elitist network is operating all over the country and all over the world.
[01:08:52.737 --> 01:08:54.218]  And they're not messing around.
[01:08:54.218 --> 01:08:56.318]  And so this really is a war for humanity.
[01:08:57.298 --> 01:09:04.599]  Patrick, you've been covering something, and this is very related, that I honestly do not know if this has been important.
[01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:11.461]  This is very important information, the CPS scandals that you have been single-handedly breaking at Epoch Times and National File.
[01:09:11.461 --> 01:09:12.761]  Very, very important stuff.
[01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:14.621]  Can you tell us a little bit about this?
[01:09:14.621 --> 01:09:24.243]  Because some people don't understand that CPS, these are not necessarily great families that the government is ripping children out of their birth parents and giving them to.
[01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:27.004]  So explain to us the work you've been doing here lately.
[01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:33.235]  I broke the story of massive child prostitution that's going on in the California CPS.
[01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.776]  That's not exclusive to California.
[01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:36.618]  It's happening all over the country.
[01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:41.763]  The state of California doesn't even put out an Amber Alert if kids go missing from foster care.
[01:09:41.763 --> 01:09:46.368]  All of the kids are officially labeled as runaways, so that no Amber Alert has to go out.
[01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:47.089]  And the reason is,
[01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:57.273]  That they leave for a short period of time, and they engage in prostitution, and they get 20 johns at a time, and they get paid, and their pimps get paid, and then they get returned to foster care.
[01:09:57.273 --> 01:09:58.754]  And this is what they do on the weekends.
[01:09:58.754 --> 01:10:00.614]  This is what they do for days at a time.
[01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:01.995]  This is happening all over the country.
[01:10:01.995 --> 01:10:03.496]  The Clintons created this system in 1997.
[01:10:04.756 --> 01:10:14.843]  By signing an act that pays foster parents, that allows everybody in the CPS system to get paid if they take the kids out of the parents' houses.
[01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:25.010]  I'm coming out with an article today that's a real bombshell, showing how in Oregon, parents who are conservatives, Christians, and Trump supporters are being targeted with fake CPS reports.
[01:10:25.450 --> 01:10:26.711]  Antifa is doing this.
[01:10:26.711 --> 01:10:41.085]  Antifa is making fake CPS reports against Trump-supporting parents and weaponizing this agency, knowing that every single time CPS goes into a parent's house, they have a financial incentive to take the kids away, and they're going to look for any excuse to do it.
[01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.251]  That is horrifying information, but it doesn't really surprise us.
[01:10:45.251 --> 01:10:46.612]  So let's just recap here.
[01:10:46.612 --> 01:10:55.776]  We have people like Ed Buck, who are giving money to Hillary Clinton, allegedly drugging and allegedly killing young black men.
[01:10:55.776 --> 01:11:01.499]  We have people like Jeffrey Epstein, close personal friend of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[01:11:01.499 --> 01:11:04.080]  I mean, we know how many times he flew on the Lolita Express.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.842]  We think that he's been to the infamous pedophile island.
[01:11:07.842 --> 01:11:09.883]  We have NXIVM, which gave money to the Clintons.
[01:11:10.163 --> 01:11:17.088]  And now we have the Clintons essentially building a system that allows children to be prostituted.
[01:11:17.088 --> 01:11:21.510]  Patrick, what can be done to right this ship with CPS?
[01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.351]  What can be done here?
[01:11:24.099 --> 01:11:27.780]  Well, look, the Clintons are the mafia bosses.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.521]  However, they're not the top bosses.
[01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:40.465]  I mean, if you look at the networks here, and you realize that Jelaine Maxwell, who is Jeffrey Epstein's handler, her father was business partners with Charles Bronfman of the Bronfman family of NXIVM fame.
[01:11:40.465 --> 01:11:47.208]  Jeffrey Epstein himself was the tax mitigation advisor to Edgar Bronfman, Claire Bronfman's father, when he was at Bear Stearns.
[01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:49.329]  Their relationship goes back to the 70s.
[01:11:49.329 --> 01:11:50.689]  These people all know each other.
[01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:52.730]  They hang out on Richard Branson's island.
[01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:56.011]  They hang out on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile island.
[01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:59.692]  They have networks, and they thought they were untouchable for a long time.
[01:11:59.692 --> 01:12:08.295]  That's why NXIVM was hiding in plain sight until a whistleblower named Frank Perlato came to Maine, and we started busting this thing up and exposing the connections.
[01:12:08.295 --> 01:12:11.236]  And what they're doing, very clearly, is they're doing satanic rituals.
[01:12:11.636 --> 01:12:18.519]  They're bringing kids in as sex slaves, and they're performing satanic rituals, and they're using them for horrible, horrible things.
[01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:19.599]  But it's not just sex.
[01:12:19.599 --> 01:12:21.960]  It's not just for their own sexual gratification.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:26.222]  It's also for occult rituals that they're performing, and it's also for blackmail.
[01:12:26.222 --> 01:12:34.586]  As we know from the Jeffrey Epstein case, world leaders were being blackmailed for the things that they were engaging in that were all on videotape being surveilled.
[01:12:34.586 --> 01:12:37.467]  And once these people do horrible things, and they're politicians,
[01:12:38.067 --> 01:12:38.767]  We're good to go.
[01:12:58.692 --> 01:13:02.857]  It becomes harder to go after them, but we have to keep going after these placeholder cases.
[01:13:02.857 --> 01:13:19.336]  And so, yet again, my appeal to Keith Raniere as prison guard says, keep that guy safe, do your job, don't take a bribe, don't, you know, leave the gate open and look the other way, because this guy very well could flip and make a deal, and that would change human history.
[01:13:20.168 --> 01:13:23.730]  I think you're absolutely right about that, and a lot of us were hoping that that would happen with Epstein.
[01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:24.691]  Of course, it didn't happen.
[01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:33.456]  Now, in the next segment, I want to get into what is being done by the Trump administration, which there are some faults with the Trump administration, but going after child sex trafficking is not one of them.
[01:13:33.456 --> 01:13:45.323]  But for the couple minutes we have left, I want to just get your thoughts on how high up Ed Buck is, and is there a potential for an Epstein-Raniere type of situation with Ed Buck?
[01:13:46.866 --> 01:13:47.746]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:13:47.746 --> 01:13:52.127]  Ed Buck has been one of the biggest institutional Democrat donors for a long time.
[01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.248]  He's at a Tom Steyer level.
[01:13:54.248 --> 01:13:57.129]  And, you know, it's interesting to look into Tom Steyer.
[01:13:57.129 --> 01:13:59.870]  What was he talking about in some of those Podesta emails?
[01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:01.890]  He showed up in Podesta emails.
[01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.731]  These people are all linked to one another.
[01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:08.992]  And so the thing is, if any one of them goes down or becomes compromised or decides to flip,
[01:14:09.787 --> 01:14:11.907]  Then the whole thing comes down.
[01:14:11.907 --> 01:14:21.630]  And that's why you see so many of these people dying like Jeffrey Epstein, because there is a system of accountability where if they think someone's going to flip, then that person ends up dead.
[01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:24.110]  And this often happens in Clinton world.
[01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:25.750]  And there are stories you never even hear about.
[01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.011]  There's Harold H.L.
[01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:32.712]  Moody, who is a program coordinator at Pulaski County Youth Services in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:14:33.172 --> 01:14:40.334]  He was also the communications director for the Arkansas Democrat Party during the 2016 election, a close friend of Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:40.334 --> 01:14:41.274]  And he was arrested.
[01:14:41.274 --> 01:14:46.036]  He was in a child porn chat room and he was showing baby rape videos.
[01:14:46.036 --> 01:14:51.737]  And he even said to his fellow people in this chat room, I've heard of white privilege, but not perv privilege.
[01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.778]  I'm not the jukebox at Waffle House.
[01:14:53.778 --> 01:14:55.418]  I don't play on demand.
[01:14:55.418 --> 01:14:56.359]  This guy was arrested.
[01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.039]  It was completely blacked out in the press.
[01:14:58.039 --> 01:14:59.360]  Nobody's heard about this.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.160]  Harold H.L.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:00.420]  Moody.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.364]  The Clintons even put their health initiative through the Clinton Foundation in Pulaski County.
[01:15:07.364 --> 01:15:13.968]  They gave an award to the head of Pulaski County Youth Services where this man was employed, where he was smoking meth at his desk.
[01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:18.630]  And there was another case where a guy who worked there was arrested for raping a 14-year-old boy.
[01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:20.931]  This is a human trafficking operation.
[01:15:20.931 --> 01:15:22.873]  I'm not scared about getting killed.
[01:15:22.873 --> 01:15:24.774]  If they kill me, I'll go meet my maker.
[01:15:24.774 --> 01:15:28.976]  I'm going to use every moment that I have in order to get as much information about this out there to people.
[01:15:29.096 --> 01:15:30.277]  Well, and Patrick, we're friends.
[01:15:30.277 --> 01:15:32.558]  I know for a fact that you are in a good state of mind.
[01:15:32.558 --> 01:15:36.200]  You're a happy, healthy individual, and if anything were to happen, it would be suspicious.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:45.306]  When we come back, we're going to talk about exactly what the Trump administration is doing, because by and large, they're going after these people more than we've seen ever before.
[01:15:45.306 --> 01:15:48.528]  That's one of the many great things about the Trump administration.
[01:15:48.528 --> 01:15:50.169]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:51.289]  I'm Tom Papert.
[01:15:51.289 --> 01:15:53.571]  We'll be back after this break.
[01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:57.911]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:57.911 --> 01:16:03.233]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:04.813]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:04.813 --> 01:16:13.177]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:18.859]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:16:19.039 --> 01:16:20.861]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:23.124]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:23.124 --> 01:16:27.530]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:29.732]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:21.581]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:21.761 --> 01:17:23.562]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:53.131 --> 01:18:10.739]  We have never been closer to a new world war with a crisis in the Middle East with the Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity.
[01:18:10.739 --> 01:18:15.841]  Whoever's behind it, know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[01:18:17.228 --> 01:18:24.951]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever, and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet.
[01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:44.939]  And that we are just mortal, flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment, and to pray for peace, and to pray for transparency, and to pray that the very twisted, evil forces on this planet, trying to start a world war, will be exposed, and their attempts at creating an even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[01:18:45.959 --> 01:18:54.081]  Now, we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully, but it's already tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises.
[01:18:54.081 --> 01:18:56.182]  We're covering it all live on the radio at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:04.164 --> 01:19:05.705]  You are supposed to rename it.
[01:19:05.705 --> 01:19:07.947]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:09.948]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[01:19:09.948 --> 01:19:12.349]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[01:19:12.349 --> 01:19:17.433]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[01:19:17.433 --> 01:19:19.274]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[01:19:19.274 --> 01:19:20.555]  Helps make DNA.
[01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:21.876]  Helps the body produce energy.
[01:19:21.876 --> 01:19:23.377]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[01:19:23.377 --> 01:19:25.398]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[01:19:25.398 --> 01:19:26.379]  It goes on and on.
[01:19:26.379 --> 01:19:34.104]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[01:19:34.464 --> 01:19:36.345]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:21.297 --> 01:20:23.678]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.678 --> 01:20:24.858]  I'm filling in for Alex today.
[01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:29.080]  He just did a very important podcast with a very high-profile person.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.261]  I'm looking forward to seeing that drop.
[01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:33.601]  We have Patrick Halle with us via Skype.
[01:20:33.601 --> 01:20:40.004]  He's going to tell us what the Trump administration is doing to fight back against these child trafficking cults.
[01:20:40.004 --> 01:20:42.565]  But first, we do have to take a moment here.
[01:20:42.565 --> 01:20:44.745]  I'm just being completely honest, folks.
[01:20:44.745 --> 01:20:48.887]  I am a big supporter of InfoWarsTore.com and it is very rare
[01:20:49.387 --> 01:20:55.857]  That you can get up to 75% off on dozens of products at Infowarestore.com.
[01:20:55.857 --> 01:21:02.085]  And this deal, again, I have no idea how Alex makes these things happen, but I'm guessing this is going to end very soon.
[01:21:03.388 --> 01:21:05.650]  Alex and I have had these conversations.
[01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:17.357]  He is trying to expand as rapidly as humanly possible and this is in the face of such insane censorship that it has nothing like this has ever been seen before.
[01:21:17.357 --> 01:21:20.900]  There has never been censorship like what has happened to Alex Jones.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.381]  On Facebook, you're not allowed to say the man's name.
[01:21:23.381 --> 01:21:30.784]  In fact, for a couple hours, about a month ago, Facebook would actually let you plot Alex Jones' death.
[01:21:30.784 --> 01:21:32.605]  You could assassinate Alex Jones on Facebook.
[01:21:32.605 --> 01:21:34.966]  Facebook was saying you could break the law, essentially.
[01:21:34.966 --> 01:21:35.807]  They changed it back, though.
[01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:36.147]  It's okay.
[01:21:36.747 --> 01:21:42.734]  But 75% off the new Total Gut Health Combo Pack with 7 powerful formulas.

[01:22:04.292 --> 01:22:07.333]  Silver is one of the best things you can do for immune support.
[01:22:07.333 --> 01:22:09.214]  50% off bodies.

[01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:21.479]  I cannot suggest it enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:21.699]  Okay.
[01:22:22.179 --> 01:22:25.402]  So we have Patrick Howley here with us via Skype.
[01:22:25.402 --> 01:22:29.245]  Patrick is a reporter for nationalfile.com as well as the Epoch Times.
[01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:30.766]  And again, congratulations Patrick.
[01:22:30.766 --> 01:22:34.670]  That is a fantastic place for these stories to be disseminated.
[01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:44.237]  Patrick, you are a big proponent of President Trump because, by and large, he is one of the few people who is fighting back against this Clinton-aligned
[01:22:45.118 --> 01:22:47.523]  Mess of cults and everything else.
[01:22:47.523 --> 01:22:50.388]  So Patrick, tell us, what is the Trump administration doing?
[01:22:50.388 --> 01:22:51.650]  Are they doing enough?
[01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:53.534]  And what are they doing to fight back against this?
[01:22:55.185 --> 01:23:01.190]  Trump's been fighting this for years, and it remains to be seen whether they're doing enough, because we're going to have to see the results.
[01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:03.411]  That's all that really matters in human history.
[01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:08.275]  I will tell you that on October 1st, the Family First Act goes into effect.
[01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:15.360]  President Donald Trump last year quietly slipped this in as an addition on the bottom of a short-term spending bill.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:24.487]  Knowing that Congress had to pass a short-term spending bill, Trump secretly put something into that bill called the Family First Act, which passed into law without anyone knowing.
[01:23:24.907 --> 01:23:34.075]  And what it does is it de-incentivizes taking kids out of their houses and putting them into foster care and then adopting them.
[01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:38.999]  I heard from a man yesterday in Oklahoma who said that he had just lost his kids.
[01:23:38.999 --> 01:23:40.080]  He was a cook at Chili's.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.381]  He had a hard episode at work.
[01:23:41.821 --> 01:23:49.404]  They didn't file an official report to say what happened, that he had a heart episode, because the manager was an illegal alien and didn't want an official report.
[01:23:49.404 --> 01:23:51.725]  That put him into the CPS system.
[01:23:51.725 --> 01:23:54.346]  And after 15 months, there was no choice.
[01:23:54.346 --> 01:23:56.467]  The kids get adopted out, so his family's gone.
[01:23:56.467 --> 01:23:58.688]  He said, why am I even an American at this point?
[01:23:58.688 --> 01:23:59.628]  I don't have a family.
[01:23:59.628 --> 01:24:00.468]  I don't have a job.
[01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:02.049]  I don't have any constitutional rights.
[01:24:02.489 --> 01:24:09.931]  That's what's happened ever since these financial incentives were put in place in 1997 for child protective services to human traffic kids.
[01:24:09.931 --> 01:24:15.652]  So on October 1st, Trump on a state by state level is going to start taking some of those financial incentives away.
[01:24:15.652 --> 01:24:24.534]  On October 4th, the Trump administration is holding an emergency meeting on the same day that parents are rallying at the state capitol in Sacramento.
[01:24:24.534 --> 01:24:30.235]  And the Trump administration is going to discuss an emergency response to the child sex trafficking epidemic.
[01:24:30.615 --> 01:24:30.995]  We're good to go.
[01:24:47.365 --> 01:24:58.871]  I mean, Trump has been doing this for years, but his administration now is being forced to actually do something about it because of the constant public outcry and the reporting of all the facts that are coming out about what's really going on.
[01:24:58.871 --> 01:25:03.333]  This is human slavery, and there's no freedom in this country as long as this is going on.
[01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:16.120]  So let's not pretend like we still live in the country of, you know, of freedom and liberty and the Constitution still means anything if the government is coming by and taking kids out of your house and sex trafficking them.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.621]  That's the worst thing that could happen.
[01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:56.596]  We also know, thanks in no small part to your reporting, I cannot suggest high enough that people go follow at Halley Reporter on Twitter where he puts out his information first, but we now know, again thanks to you, that NXIVM was bringing in illegal immigrant teenage girls and telling them that they are essential slaves.
[01:25:56.596 --> 01:25:58.137]  They have no freedom.
[01:25:59.178 --> 01:26:05.567]  How does stopping illegal immigration, and President Trump is building the wall with all of the roadblocks that he's encountered.
[01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:07.049]  It is still going up.
[01:26:07.049 --> 01:26:08.190]  He is still working.
[01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:11.135]  I mean, he's forced Mexico to stop some of these crossings.
[01:26:11.135 --> 01:26:14.740]  How does this tie together illegal immigration and human trafficking?
[01:26:16.232 --> 01:26:23.435]  The media's outcry over separating children from their parents at the border is all predicated on a diversion.
[01:26:23.435 --> 01:26:26.037]  Everything they tried to do, they hide it in plain sight.
[01:26:26.037 --> 01:26:32.980]  The Democrats were colluding with Russia on Uranium One, and so they created a public spectacle about Trump being allied with Russia.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:40.347]  What's going on is that they're trafficking these kids up using human traffickers and most of the parents are not actually related to the kids.
[01:26:40.347 --> 01:26:49.257]  So if they create as much of a spectacle in the media and as much outrage about supposedly separating these kids from their parents, they can conceal the fact that they're not actually the parents.
[01:26:49.697 --> 01:27:04.706]  When Trump put in this DNA testing at the border to give the people a cheek swab and do rapid DNA testing at the border, they found immediately 30% of the parents who were taking the kids over the border were not actually the parents, they were frauds.
[01:27:04.706 --> 01:27:09.469]  Some of them even turned around before the DNA test and admitted to this and went back to Guatemala.
[01:27:09.469 --> 01:27:13.912]  So the ACLU and CNN are now fighting the DNA testing.
[01:27:14.572 --> 01:27:15.073]  Well, why?
[01:27:15.073 --> 01:27:21.119]  I mean, wouldn't you want to know if these are real parents who are related to the kids?
[01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:21.920]  It's all a joke.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.362]  They're on the side of human trafficking.
[01:27:24.362 --> 01:27:27.145]  They don't want it to be exposed that these are human traffickers.
[01:27:27.145 --> 01:27:36.475]  And so they're trying to hide this barbaric practice in plain sight by diverting and making people think that the Trump administration has some kind of fascist policy at the border.
[01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.920]  Patrick, you are absolutely on fire, my friend.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.221]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:27:41.221 --> 01:27:42.742]  We've got about a minute left here.
[01:27:42.742 --> 01:27:47.286]  Would you please tell us, again, I know it's at Halley Reporter, maybe tell us how to spell your name.
[01:27:47.286 --> 01:27:50.809]  Tell us where people can watch you, where people can find you, where people can find your work.
[01:27:52.739 --> 01:27:53.040]  I think
[01:28:09.541 --> 01:28:14.243]  This fraudulent agency, CPS, to weaponize against Trump supporters.
[01:28:14.243 --> 01:28:15.844]  And so that's what we're dealing with.
[01:28:15.844 --> 01:28:17.764]  Every Trump supporter is on the front lines.
[01:28:17.764 --> 01:28:22.026]  We've got to stick together and we've got to stay vigilant going into this election.
[01:28:22.026 --> 01:28:31.710]  And I think that President Donald Trump probably will win so long as we don't have some kind of big event put forth by the globalists before Election Day.
[01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:33.451]  God bless you my friend.
[01:28:33.451 --> 01:28:36.113]  Thank you so much for coming on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:36.113 --> 01:28:38.935]  That was again Patrick Howley at Howley Reporter.
[01:28:38.935 --> 01:28:40.837]  I hope he comes back real soon.
[01:28:40.837 --> 01:28:41.817]  I'm Tom Papert.
[01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.138]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:43.138 --> 01:28:44.719]  Alex should be back.
[01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:48.362]  We'll find out if he's up to coming in studio in the next half hour.
[01:28:48.362 --> 01:28:51.124]  Thank you all so much for watching this very important broadcast.
[01:28:51.124 --> 01:28:54.187]  We will be back after this break.
[01:28:55.902 --> 01:28:57.123]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.123 --> 01:29:01.044]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:02.565]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.565 --> 01:29:05.527]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.527 --> 01:29:11.089]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.089 --> 01:29:12.290]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:15.231]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.231 --> 01:29:17.452]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:21.894]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:21.894 --> 01:29:24.235]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.556 --> 01:29:29.419]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:29.419 --> 01:29:34.423]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:34.423 --> 01:29:39.247]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:39.247 --> 01:29:40.588]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:44.351]  Check out all of the success stories at hbextract.com.
[01:29:44.351 --> 01:29:45.331]  Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:46.292]  That's 866-295-5305. hbextract.com.
[01:29:46.292 --> 01:29:48.574]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:57.262 --> 01:30:05.814]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[01:30:05.814 --> 01:30:10.460]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.022]  I was the first to begin to
[01:30:12.322 --> 01:30:12.542]  I think?
[01:30:42.402 --> 01:30:46.384]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[01:30:46.384 --> 01:30:48.525]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[01:30:48.525 --> 01:30:53.008]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[01:30:53.008 --> 01:30:55.309]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[01:30:57.063 --> 01:31:02.807]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[01:31:02.807 --> 01:31:07.530]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:11.032]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:12.393]  It's been a bestseller.
[01:31:12.393 --> 01:31:23.941]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:34.049]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[01:31:34.049 --> 01:31:39.314]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[01:31:39.574 --> 01:31:47.502]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:50.505]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:56.712]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[01:31:56.712 --> 01:31:59.575]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[01:32:01.027 --> 01:32:06.311]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are.
[01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:10.735]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the Globalist battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[01:32:10.735 --> 01:32:12.776]  That's why they're so upset.
[01:32:12.776 --> 01:32:14.758]  Think how far we've come together.
[01:32:14.758 --> 01:32:24.346]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[01:32:25.186 --> 01:32:27.148]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[01:32:27.148 --> 01:32:32.612]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption, and to stand with God, and to stand with the unborn.
[01:32:32.612 --> 01:32:38.477]  So I just wanted to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[01:32:38.477 --> 01:32:46.063]  And without you, and your prayers, and your word of mouth, and your financial support, this operation that you built, that's your operation, would not be here.
[01:32:46.063 --> 01:32:49.406]  We've got some giant specials running right now at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:32:49.406 --> 01:32:49.986]  A lot of items, 50% off.
[01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:59.699]  Please take advantage of it at InfoWarsTore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:02.321]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.489 --> 01:33:21.850]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:25.851]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.851 --> 01:33:32.453]  For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed.
[01:33:32.453 --> 01:33:35.674]  But I do.
[01:33:35.674 --> 01:33:41.256]  And people are starting to notice.
[01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:44.793]  You think this is funny?
[01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:59.187]  Is this a joke to you?
[01:33:59.187 --> 01:34:01.789]  Murray, one small thing.
[01:34:01.789 --> 01:34:02.550]  Yeah?
[01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:05.973]  When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker?
[01:34:07.148 --> 01:34:21.276]  And the criminals are running the asylum, and if they want to have a blood feast on us, like they had in Communist China, 60 plus million, and Soviet Russia, 50 plus million, and Hitler, 40 plus million, total dead, including 20 million Germans!
[01:34:21.276 --> 01:34:27.160]  If you want to be part of this blood feast, you're invited to dinner, but on the table, like a suckling hog!
[01:34:38.846 --> 01:34:40.467]  October 4th.
[01:34:40.467 --> 01:34:41.708]  Mark your calendars.
[01:34:41.708 --> 01:34:45.710]  That's the date we're all told by Hollywood and the corporate media.
[01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:47.671]  Breathlessly.
[01:34:47.671 --> 01:34:55.055]  That Joaquin Phoenix's greatest role, it won in Venice in France.
[01:34:55.055 --> 01:34:56.796]  The Joker.
[01:34:56.796 --> 01:34:58.396]  It's coming out.
[01:34:58.396 --> 01:35:02.919]  And the critics that have seen it in the screenings, they say that the mere mortals
[01:35:03.985 --> 01:35:08.770]  I can't even understand the plot because it's so sophisticated.
[01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:10.271]  It's so incredible.
[01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:13.374]  Well, let me give you a spoiler alert.
[01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:16.137]  There's nothing sophisticated about the film.
[01:35:16.137 --> 01:35:22.863]  I've been given a full synopsis by contacts I have inside that vampire kingdom known as L.A.
[01:35:22.863 --> 01:35:25.325]  and it matches with the leaks and reviews I've seen.
[01:35:25.325 --> 01:35:28.568]  I'm about to tell you exactly what happens in the movie.
[01:35:29.548 --> 01:35:34.890]  And why it's being put out now and what its real message is to the public.
[01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:37.471]  You know why they call him the Joker?
[01:35:37.471 --> 01:35:46.134]  Because it's a big joke to them that they're poisoning your water supply and that your children are deformed and get cancer when they're 10 years old.
[01:35:46.134 --> 01:35:52.356]  Because it's a big joke to the New World Order, all the things they're doing to you and how childlike you are.
[01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:57.204]  Modern psychology and psychiatry is a new priesthood.
[01:35:57.204 --> 01:35:59.887]  It's only been around 200 years or so.
[01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:11.397]  But from my research, Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell and others have the best take on psychology as a lens, a thought system to see the world through.
[01:36:11.397 --> 01:36:14.380]  But it doesn't mean it's God, doesn't mean it has all the answers.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:27.801]  And Hollywood and the entire psychological system has admittedly been used for more than 70 years to shape the minds and attitudes of not just the people in America, but the people of the world.
[01:36:29.028 --> 01:36:31.829]  Carl Jung talked about archetypes.
[01:36:31.829 --> 01:36:33.389]  And the Joker is in the tarot deck.
[01:36:33.389 --> 01:36:36.650]  It's also in a deck of bicycle playing cards.
[01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:39.211]  Well, who is the Joker in archetype?
[01:36:39.211 --> 01:36:40.091]  He's a clown.
[01:36:40.091 --> 01:36:41.711]  He's a servant of the king.
[01:36:41.711 --> 01:36:46.953]  But he's allowed to speak his mind and entertain, but also play tricks.
[01:36:46.953 --> 01:36:54.094]  The exaggerated red lips and smiling teeth are not the smile of a friend.
[01:36:54.094 --> 01:36:56.015]  No, it's the smile of a great white shark.
[01:36:56.855 --> 01:36:59.337]  Coming out of the water and attacking its prey.
[01:36:59.337 --> 01:37:08.886]  It's the smile of a lion or a tiger when it pulls back its lips to bite into you or your wife or your child.
[01:37:08.886 --> 01:37:14.652]  It's the leering face of a pack of wild wolves chasing you through the woods.
[01:37:14.652 --> 01:37:19.756]  So at a primitive level, the Joker is a man-beast.
[01:37:19.756 --> 01:37:21.098]  He is possessed.
[01:37:22.182 --> 01:37:33.148]  He is filled with a demonic intelligence that only the wild can give him, because he's let himself go of any inhibition.
[01:37:33.148 --> 01:37:43.595]  The Joker is a human that has given himself over to the knowledge of evil, that has empowered himself to do things others will not do.
[01:37:44.904 --> 01:37:52.414]  At least that's what your run-of-the-mill devil worshipper or Luciferian or Aleister Crowleyite will tell you.
[01:37:52.414 --> 01:37:54.977]  The truth is the Joker is a loser.
[01:37:54.977 --> 01:38:00.604]  People that buy into the archetype end up destroying themselves and a bunch of other people usually along the way with them.
[01:38:01.445 --> 01:38:06.366]  But in the DC Universe, the last 70 years, he's Arthur Fleck.
[01:38:06.366 --> 01:38:11.987]  Now, the filmmakers tell you over and over again, this is not the Joker of comic books.
[01:38:11.987 --> 01:38:16.248]  Oh no, this is entirely new and something really deep and special.
[01:38:16.248 --> 01:38:28.430]  Well, the truth is, the original Joker is an archetype of a very evil, wicked person who only cares about themselves and wants to overthrow God's existing order and create a hell on earth that he controls.
[01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:41.461]  We saw that during the French Revolution, which was admittedly carried out by Luciferians who wanted to overthrow civilization and even the family and set up hell on earth with themselves in charge.
[01:38:42.455 --> 01:38:53.280]  Oh, and many of those pushing the French Revolution and other similar communist revolutions that came out of it in many cases would dress up when they went out to commit murders like clowns.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.262]  And that's really the true genius of the original comic book creators and people that made them popular like Stan Lee.
[01:38:59.262 --> 01:39:05.965]  They understood that they could take already existing characters that were real in the world and then take them and exaggerate them.
[01:39:06.465 --> 01:39:08.787]  Put them on paper and on the big screen.
[01:39:08.787 --> 01:39:17.112]  Just as Greek gods were simply a hyped-up version of traits that the Greeks saw in people, Hollywood has done the same thing today.
[01:39:17.112 --> 01:39:20.294]  Now let's get into the new Joker film itself.
[01:39:20.294 --> 01:39:23.616]  This individual lives with his mommy in her basement.
[01:39:23.616 --> 01:39:30.821]  He has Tourette's Syndrome and laughs and makes weird noises at inopportune times and gets beat up.
[01:39:30.821 --> 01:39:32.162]  He's disempowered.
[01:39:32.162 --> 01:39:33.883]  His life is hellish.
[01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:35.725]  The critics tell him that he sucks.
[01:39:36.545 --> 01:39:38.407]  Well, isn't this Hollywood itself?
[01:39:38.407 --> 01:39:43.032]  Down 40% at the box office, collapsing, every other person's a comic.
[01:39:43.032 --> 01:39:45.634]  No one actually wants to work or raise a family.
[01:39:45.634 --> 01:39:53.863]  So this is that, again, archetype of the communist, or of the Jacobin, of the French Revolution, that none of us are gonna work, none of us are gonna get jobs.
[01:39:54.423 --> 01:40:02.369]  And the only way we're going to ever be successful is if we overthrow the big corrupt system that is Gotham.
[01:40:02.369 --> 01:40:06.232]  And we go out and show them that we can be more evil than the system itself.
[01:40:06.232 --> 01:40:13.838]  That we can mastermind and engineer and organize all these other people to carry out crimes.
[01:40:13.838 --> 01:40:17.822]  But like a sick twisted Robin of Loxley or Robin Hood,
[01:40:18.786 --> 01:40:23.333]  They do it to people, in many cases, that actually deserve it.
[01:40:23.333 --> 01:40:27.220]  Because the stagnant system needs to be burned down and rebuilt.
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:29.022]  And who better to do it than the Joker?
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:52.778]  If you go back to the original days of the DC Universe, with the Joker in the 50s and 60s, we see someone who really enjoys poisoning the population, putting things into the water, the food, or cosmetics, or air, that only when you come into contact with both of them does it actually hurt or kill you.
[01:40:52.778 --> 01:40:54.019]  Smiling.
[01:40:54.019 --> 01:40:55.180]  What is this?
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:57.182]  Love that Joker!
[01:41:02.009 --> 01:41:18.215]  Now I wonder where all those famous writers, the comic books, got an idea like that.
[01:41:18.215 --> 01:41:29.560]  Because back at the time, in the 40s and 50s, it was a big debate about how the Soviets and the Nazis put fluoride in the water to dumb people down, lower their fertility, and make them more easily manageable.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.903]  And so that's why the joke is on you!
[01:41:32.903 --> 01:41:37.509]  And that's why it's gonna continue going on week after week.
[01:41:37.509 --> 01:41:41.193]  Month after month, year after year, the joke's on you.
[01:41:41.193 --> 01:41:42.074]  What's scary?
[01:41:42.074 --> 01:41:43.977]  Somebody in some clown makeup?
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.441]  Because that can get your attention!
[01:41:46.441 --> 01:41:48.922]  That freaks you out at a primitive level!
[01:41:48.922 --> 01:41:51.244]  Nightmares out of your subconscious!
[01:41:51.244 --> 01:42:02.951]  But you're not afraid of some gentlemanly, middle-aged man who sits there talking with a sweet, calm voice, but tremulating with power and dark ghosts of death!
[01:42:03.988 --> 01:42:24.094]  When they write in EcoScience, the National Science Czar's own government policy book, how they're poisoning your water supply, how they'll take all children at birth and raise them in government dormitories and do medical experiments on them, and how they'll bring in Total Charity and put implants in your body to control every facet.
[01:42:24.094 --> 01:42:25.074]  You know what's funny?
[01:42:26.034 --> 01:42:38.477]  Even though this book's free online at major university websites, you little bastards out there are gonna go watch your TV and your movies, and you're gonna sit there and laugh at me right now and not check any of it out.
[01:42:38.477 --> 01:42:43.839]  Hollywood would love for you to believe that this is some new angle they've come up with, but no, it's not.
[01:42:43.839 --> 01:42:45.859]  It's the angle they're obsessed with.
[01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:49.200]  It's why they can't come up with new ideas, because they don't want to.
[01:42:55.638 --> 01:43:09.684]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity.
[01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:16.207]  Whoever's behind it, know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[01:43:16.207 --> 01:43:22.950]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet.
[01:43:23.905 --> 01:43:43.900]  And that we are just mortal, flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment, and to pray for peace, and to pray for transparency, and to pray that the very twisted, evil forces on this planet, trying to start a world war, will be exposed and their attempts at creating an even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[01:43:44.915 --> 01:43:52.584]  Now, we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully, but it's already tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises.
[01:43:52.584 --> 01:43:55.147]  We're covering it all live on the radio at Infowars.com.

[01:44:56.778 --> 01:45:01.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.783]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[01:45:05.783 --> 01:45:08.024]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[01:45:08.024 --> 01:45:10.025]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[01:45:10.025 --> 01:45:12.406]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:17.509]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[01:45:17.509 --> 01:45:19.330]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:20.631]  Helps make DNA.
[01:45:20.631 --> 01:45:21.952]  Helps the body produce energy.
[01:45:21.952 --> 01:45:23.452]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[01:45:23.452 --> 01:45:25.454]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[01:45:25.454 --> 01:45:26.214]  It goes on and on.
[01:45:26.554 --> 01:45:34.539]  The E12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[01:45:34.539 --> 01:45:37.080]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:43.924]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:45:43.924 --> 01:45:49.248]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[01:45:49.248 --> 01:45:54.491]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now on InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:03.052]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[01:46:03.052 --> 01:46:07.774]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[01:46:07.774 --> 01:46:10.495]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[01:46:10.495 --> 01:46:12.616]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[01:46:12.616 --> 01:46:24.180]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:34.290]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[01:46:34.290 --> 01:46:39.535]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[01:46:39.795 --> 01:46:47.739]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:47.739 --> 01:46:50.741]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[01:46:50.741 --> 01:46:59.225]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[01:46:59.225 --> 01:47:01.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:31.174]  Now we come here not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people.
[01:47:40.066 --> 01:47:52.492]  I'll get more into Joker in a moment, but first let's go back to Dark Knight Rises with Bane and his whole French Revolution outfit and fire risers and we're bringing down society and oh it's so edgy.
[01:47:52.492 --> 01:47:56.294]  I went and saw the movie and said it's a communist Jacobin French Revolution push.
[01:47:57.028 --> 01:47:58.409]  What the left wants.
[01:47:58.409 --> 01:48:03.433]  And then later I read a review where the director, after it had been out a few months, said that was the whole point.
[01:48:03.433 --> 01:48:06.396]  This is incredibly transparent.
[01:48:06.396 --> 01:48:14.982]  The French Revolution, in mainline history books, was carried out by the Illuminati, set up by Adam Weishaupt, in Germany.
[01:48:14.982 --> 01:48:16.143]  That was their model.
[01:48:16.143 --> 01:48:17.845]  They tried to hijack our revolution.
[01:48:18.479 --> 01:48:21.461]  George Washington wrote a bunch of letters that are in the National Archives.
[01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:29.147]  Here's one on screen, talking about how this Luciferian cult of devil worshippers was trying to hijack our revolution.
[01:48:29.147 --> 01:48:33.910]  At first, Thomas Jefferson thought they were good, went over there, and they almost killed him.
[01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:36.152]  If you want to understand the new Joker film.
[01:48:36.972 --> 01:48:49.666]  Understand Charlie Manson in the late 1960s going and killing Sharon Tate and cutting a baby out of her womb and then trying to blame it on black people to trigger a race war.
[01:48:49.666 --> 01:48:53.250]  And he said he wanted a race war and that he had worked with the CIA.
[01:48:54.011 --> 01:48:57.352]  And it turned out he had worked with them in MKUltra.
[01:48:57.352 --> 01:49:00.773]  Show head Theodore Kaczynski, the UNA bomber.
[01:49:00.773 --> 01:49:03.874]  That's LA Times, Associated Press, Washington Post.
[01:49:03.874 --> 01:49:05.534]  We're supposed to forget all of this.
[01:49:05.534 --> 01:49:21.879]  And now Hollywood admits they're trying to cause a civil war by confiscating firearms, by creating racial tension, by staging events like Jesse Smollett got caught doing, and hundreds of others where they've been caught, and still hundreds of others where they have still gotten away with it.
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.001]  The system wants you to be a victim.
[01:49:26.001 --> 01:49:28.902]  They want to glorify people that are seen as victims.
[01:49:28.902 --> 01:49:32.804]  They want to glorify mental illness and are creating new ones all the time.
[01:49:32.804 --> 01:49:34.964]  You see the Joker, he has Tourette's Syndrome.
[01:49:34.964 --> 01:49:35.725]  He's a loser.
[01:49:35.725 --> 01:49:37.565]  He lives in his mommy's basement.
[01:49:37.565 --> 01:49:49.830]  And when you read the WikiLeaks from Hillary Clinton, she's talking trash about how her supporters live in their mother's basements, are all baristas, and want more money from her, but she can't deliver it to them, but she's got to lie to them.
[01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:53.858]  And that's what this film is all about.
[01:49:53.858 --> 01:49:55.859]  90% of the college educations are worthless.
[01:49:55.859 --> 01:49:57.720]  They're designed to be worthless.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:03.242]  You're going and paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for something where the job and the industry doesn't exist.
[01:50:03.242 --> 01:50:13.706]  But then they tell you, oh, the conservatives have stopped us, the nationalists, the capitalists, from bringing in this utopia where you're going to have jobs managing everything.
[01:50:14.246 --> 01:50:29.844]  But because they haven't gone along with this, the managed economy, the carbon taxes, the social workers running everybody's families, we're going to have to have a violent overthrow and a tearing down of civilization to be able to carry this out.
[01:50:31.386 --> 01:50:33.127]  Then we'll have the utopia.
[01:50:33.127 --> 01:50:37.249]  Same thing we heard from Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao.
[01:50:37.249 --> 01:50:44.152]  But all it created was a nightmare for the general public that killed hundreds of millions of people and started giant wars.
[01:50:44.152 --> 01:50:49.734]  But you see, that's the whole point of this priesthood, the priest of power.
[01:50:49.734 --> 01:50:58.158]  George Orwell, Eric Blair, who actually worked for MI6 before that OSS, worked in the Ministry of Truth for real at BBC.
[01:50:59.418 --> 01:51:04.121]  wrote 1984 about the real world they were going to build.
[01:51:04.121 --> 01:51:06.563]  He is O'Brien and Winston in the book.
[01:51:06.563 --> 01:51:07.564]  He wrote essays admitting it.
[01:51:09.056 --> 01:51:12.198]  And O'Brien tells him, Winston, we're here to trample people and be trampled.
[01:51:12.198 --> 01:51:13.700]  We're here to make society ugly.
[01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:19.024]  We're here to end the family and tear down everything and finally just kill all humans on Earth.
[01:51:19.024 --> 01:51:21.586]  We are the post-human movement.
[01:51:21.586 --> 01:51:22.646]  We are Satan.
[01:51:22.646 --> 01:51:24.188]  We kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:51:24.188 --> 01:51:26.209]  And now you turn on NBC.
[01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:27.270]  Look up the London Guardian.
[01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.910]  It's everywhere.
[01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:28.971]  The post-human world.
[01:51:28.971 --> 01:51:30.152]  How ugly humans are.
[01:51:30.152 --> 01:51:31.633]  How bad we are.
[01:51:31.633 --> 01:51:37.878]  So the very people telling the dumbed-down, poisoned, brainwashed masses who went to
[01:51:37.998 --> 01:51:38.339]  Thank you.
[01:51:46.667 --> 01:52:05.760]  That is the very Hollywood, megabank, Chicom-backed and owned system pumping cultural poison into this nation to cause a massive collapse of civilization, like they call for in Clardon Pivot Strategies, to then usher in their system of total control and authoritarianism.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.041]  And that's the model.
[01:52:07.041 --> 01:52:14.926]  And that's why you see all the films about race war and death and destruction and the downtrodden going on and conducting mass shootings and mass killings.
[01:52:14.926 --> 01:52:15.987]  And all the studies show that
[01:52:16.887 --> 01:52:29.426]  Mass shootings are literally triggered when the media hypes them up and mentally ill people on medications that on the inserts admit they cause people to commit suicide or murder others.
[01:52:29.426 --> 01:52:31.790]  But oh, they've all been given liability protection.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:47.369]  This is an admitted plan by ultra-rich running multinational corporations allied with the EU, the Chai Koms, and radical Islam and others on record to destabilize the Western world in the Renaissance and overthrow it and bring in this tyranny.
[01:52:47.369 --> 01:52:49.731]  All in the name of human empowerment.
[01:52:51.656 --> 01:52:53.417]  They are the bullies.
[01:52:53.417 --> 01:52:55.478]  The Joker is the bully.
[01:52:55.478 --> 01:53:11.847]  The power structure and the system is laughing at everyone and dangling in front of them the promise of something great and free health care and free school and free money and free jobs and free housing and free everything if you'll just sign on to their revolution.
[01:53:11.847 --> 01:53:14.949]  But in the end, all you get is death and destruction.
[01:53:14.949 --> 01:53:16.170]  Here's the good news.
[01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:19.352]  These Jokers would have you believe they're the most powerful card in the deck.
[01:53:20.199 --> 01:53:31.902]  But when you know they're the Joker, when you know they're scammers, when you know that they're trying to enslave you by creating a crisis they control, and then a solution that they offer with the Igalian dialectic, they have no more power.
[01:53:31.902 --> 01:53:46.726]  Because the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, the Ace of Spades is knowledge and historical understanding and a good, loving heart towards others, but also the will to stand against these bullies, these Jokers, and let them know you're not going to submit to them.
[01:53:46.726 --> 01:53:48.526]  All they are is a scarecrow, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:49.881 --> 01:53:53.762]  Trying to keep you from taking your destiny of being a free human being.
[01:53:53.762 --> 01:53:59.284]  And they put all these sad, pathetic people into these systems and suck their future and suck their dreams away.
[01:53:59.284 --> 01:54:05.066]  And then offer them fiery communist revolution as a way to be empowered.
[01:54:05.066 --> 01:54:11.909]  And every time the fools that do this end up being the first who are killed by their masters.
[01:54:13.462 --> 01:54:17.825]  The Joker wants to destroy Gotham, bring it down, teach them a lesson.
[01:54:17.825 --> 01:54:22.607]  Well, Bill Maher's up there saying, crash the economy to teach Americans not to support Trump.
[01:54:22.607 --> 01:54:29.171]  The private fellow reserve is trying to crash the economy to teach us Americans that populism and loving our country is not good.
[01:54:29.171 --> 01:54:35.575]  It's incredible what real world terrorists, real world jokers, and banes these individuals are.
[01:54:36.448 --> 01:54:42.756]  And Hollywood thinks you're so stupid, they're throwing it on your face and saying, oh, it's so complex, you can't understand it.
[01:54:42.756 --> 01:54:49.945]  I was watching Bird Box for 10 minutes and could see it was some signal over the cell phones making people kill themselves, just like the Kingsmen.
[01:54:49.945 --> 01:54:52.168]  They're telling you what they're doing to you.
[01:54:52.568 --> 01:54:54.590]  They're telling you how they're poisoning the water.
[01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:56.411]  They're telling you how they're dumbing you down.
[01:54:56.411 --> 01:54:57.552]  I want to be clear.
[01:54:57.552 --> 01:54:59.213]  Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor.
[01:54:59.213 --> 01:55:01.155]  I wish him and the directors no harm.
[01:55:01.155 --> 01:55:07.040]  But they're just carrying out an agenda, a replay of the same thing that was shown over and over and over again.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:17.769]  The truth is it's not cool to be a violent revolutionary trying to overthrow families and overthrow culture and overthrow society so you can build something ugly on top of it and then act like you're actually a rebel.
[01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:19.430]  You don't have to kill.
[01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:22.093]  You don't have to become satanic to have power.
[01:55:22.093 --> 01:55:30.080]  You don't have to go out and do horrible things to be somebody and show the world, show the bullies, that you're not going to put up with it.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.061]  But that's what the left does.
[01:55:31.061 --> 01:55:36.847]  They teach their minions in the colleges, while they're giving them worthless degrees, that you're all victims.
[01:55:36.847 --> 01:55:40.090]  And then when there's nobody really victimizing them, they go, oh, well, there's microaggressions.
[01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:42.592]  So you've got to go out and take over society.
[01:55:42.592 --> 01:55:44.434]  You've got to brainwash people's children.
[01:55:44.434 --> 01:55:48.959]  You've got to get control of education so that these evils don't happen to you anymore.
[01:55:48.959 --> 01:55:55.226]  And really, you're just a bunch of idiots following the Joker and his operation.
[01:55:55.226 --> 01:55:57.428]  Well, the age of the Joker is coming to an end.
[01:55:58.390 --> 01:56:01.552]  But Hollywood sees the Joker as their identity.
[01:56:01.552 --> 01:56:04.294]  And that's why they put him up there and celebrate him.
[01:56:04.294 --> 01:56:05.795]  Because that's their archetype.
[01:56:05.795 --> 01:56:06.695]  The conman.
[01:56:06.695 --> 01:56:07.696]  The scam artist.
[01:56:07.696 --> 01:56:08.596]  The pedophile.
[01:56:08.596 --> 01:56:09.817]  The serial killer.
[01:56:09.817 --> 01:56:10.558]  The Hitler.
[01:56:10.558 --> 01:56:11.338]  The Stalin.
[01:56:11.338 --> 01:56:12.599]  The Mao.
[01:56:12.599 --> 01:56:16.241]  You can take the ace of spades in your hand anytime you want.
[01:56:16.241 --> 01:56:19.263]  And start being a straight and strong and truthful person.
[01:56:19.263 --> 01:56:22.625]  And standing up to build a better, safer, good community.
[01:56:22.625 --> 01:56:26.728]  And rediscovering the values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.
[01:56:33.607 --> 01:56:37.756]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[01:56:37.756 --> 01:56:40.822]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[01:56:45.073 --> 01:56:49.034]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:56:49.034 --> 01:56:51.895]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:56:51.895 --> 01:56:57.216]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:56:57.216 --> 01:57:05.138]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[01:57:05.138 --> 01:57:07.019]  We will not divide!
[01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:08.439]  We will not divide!
[01:57:09.219 --> 01:57:15.385]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[01:57:15.385 --> 01:57:21.029]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[01:57:21.029 --> 01:57:25.353]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[01:57:25.353 --> 01:57:29.997]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[01:57:29.997 --> 01:57:34.781]  From the front lines of the info room, it's Alex Jones.
[01:57:37.825 --> 01:57:42.509]  We have entered a great time of change.
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:58:11.068]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government, known as a technocracy in their own words, that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[01:58:11.068 --> 01:58:11.428]  At first,
[01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:14.635]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[01:58:14.635 --> 01:58:15.836]  Don't support Trump.
[01:58:15.836 --> 01:58:17.358]  Don't vote Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.358 --> 01:58:20.662]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father.
[01:58:20.662 --> 01:58:22.224]  Well, let us sterilize your children.
[01:58:22.224 --> 01:58:24.586]  Take these forced inoculations.
[01:58:24.586 --> 01:58:26.409]  Here, take this Prozac pill.
[01:58:26.409 --> 01:58:28.851]  Here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[01:58:28.851 --> 01:58:29.933]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[01:58:31.212 --> 01:58:35.014]  This is truly the Mark of the Beast system, and we're on air right now covering it.
[01:58:35.014 --> 01:58:37.255]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged.
[01:58:37.255 --> 01:58:44.839]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you, for yourself, and myself, and my family, and your family, spread the word about Infowars.com, the live shows, right now.
[01:58:46.775 --> 01:58:51.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.765]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[01:58:55.765 --> 01:58:58.027]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[01:58:58.027 --> 01:59:02.052]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[01:59:02.412 --> 01:59:07.496]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[01:59:07.496 --> 01:59:09.317]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[01:59:09.317 --> 01:59:10.618]  Helps make DNA.
[01:59:10.618 --> 01:59:11.939]  Helps the body produce energy.
[01:59:11.939 --> 01:59:13.440]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:15.441]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[01:59:15.441 --> 01:59:16.242]  It goes on and on.
[01:59:16.242 --> 01:59:24.188]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[01:59:24.528 --> 01:59:27.069]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:33.913]  It helps fund the Info War, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:33.913 --> 01:59:39.235]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[01:59:39.235 --> 01:59:50.121]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:59:50.121 --> 01:59:52.782]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.328 --> 02:00:09.993]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:09.993 --> 02:00:11.416]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.043 --> 02:00:17.604]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.604 --> 02:00:19.725]  Tom Pafford still sitting in for Alex.
[02:00:19.725 --> 02:00:25.027]  That was another fantastic report by Mr. Jones himself.
[02:00:25.027 --> 02:00:30.309]  So, it's almost time for that bizarre Facebook event.
[02:00:30.309 --> 02:00:31.549]  Storm Area 51.
[02:00:31.549 --> 02:00:33.810]  They can't stop us all.
[02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:35.631]  Well, I think they probably can.
[02:00:35.631 --> 02:00:36.971]  I would never recommend such a thing.
[02:00:36.971 --> 02:00:40.213]  I mean, you're essentially talking about an insurrection against the U.S.
[02:00:40.213 --> 02:00:43.574]  government, but it's very... I mean, I think it's just a Facebook meme.
[02:00:43.894 --> 02:00:54.338]  I don't think anybody really has an intention to storm Area 51, and it kind of seems like a distraction, but what's been fascinating is all of the responses from the United States government.
[02:00:54.338 --> 02:00:57.279]  We now have another from the Daily Star.
[02:00:57.279 --> 02:01:05.682]  Area 51 has secrets that deserve to be protected, warns US Air Force General.
[02:01:07.289 --> 02:01:12.031]  Boy, I think they're taking the meme a bit too seriously.
[02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:12.391]  U.S.
[02:01:12.391 --> 02:01:16.572]  Air Force officials have already warned they stood ready to defend the military base.
[02:01:16.572 --> 02:01:19.593]  Now we have General Dave Goldfein.
[02:01:19.593 --> 02:01:27.455]  He's issued a strong warning against anyone planning to storm Area 51 to see them aliens.
[02:01:27.455 --> 02:01:31.917]  Area 51 has secrets that deserve to be protected.
[02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:35.338]  It's a very strange situation, especially when you consider
[02:01:36.118 --> 02:01:36.638]  But the U.S.
[02:01:36.638 --> 02:01:42.720]  Navy has now essentially admitted that, yes, they're tracking UFOs.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.761]  It's a strange time to be alive, is it not, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:01:45.761 --> 02:01:58.564]  Strange flying objects captured on video by a Navy finder pilot off the coast of San Diego in 2004 and in Atlantic waters in 2015 were acknowledged by the Navy as unidentified aerial phenomena last week.
[02:01:58.564 --> 02:01:59.505]  We've got a clip on that.
[02:01:59.505 --> 02:02:02.526]  Let's go ahead and air some of this clip here, if we can.
[02:02:02.526 --> 02:02:04.026]  Clip 10 to the control room.
[02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:11.922]  Official USG footage brought to you exclusively by the Navy.
[02:02:11.922 --> 02:02:13.003]  The second of three U.S.
[02:02:13.003 --> 02:02:19.647]  military videos of unidentified aerial phenomena been declassified.
[02:02:19.647 --> 02:02:25.691]  This is the only official footage that has been released that was taken during the 2004 Nemitz incident.
[02:02:25.691 --> 02:02:26.512]  Taken aboard U.S.
[02:02:26.512 --> 02:02:29.214]  Navy F-A-18 Super Hornet.
[02:02:29.214 --> 02:02:34.057]  The footage was captured by tracking systems
[02:02:36.218 --> 02:02:38.660]  Most advanced on the market.
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:40.961]  Here you can see their display information.
[02:02:40.961 --> 02:02:45.063]  Giving some background information about what we're going to see here.
[02:02:45.063 --> 02:02:47.625]  Sensor is in the TV visual mode.
[02:02:47.625 --> 02:02:53.108]  First thing is a camera.
[02:02:53.108 --> 02:02:54.449]  Sensor zoom is only 1.0.
[02:02:58.047 --> 02:03:02.528]  Sensor aimed six degree above the aircraft axis.
[02:03:02.528 --> 02:03:06.189]  Breaking down exactly what we're going to see.
[02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:12.191]  Showing the speed for radio viewers, radio listeners.
[02:03:12.191 --> 02:03:16.132]  Explaining the hot and cold.
[02:03:16.132 --> 02:03:24.215]  White is hot, black is cold.
[02:03:24.215 --> 02:03:27.116]  Here is our unidentified phenomena.
[02:03:28.024 --> 02:03:29.565]  In the air.
[02:03:29.565 --> 02:03:41.572]  And this comes, by the way, as Bernie Sanders has made part of his campaign a promise to declassify the UFOs.
[02:03:41.572 --> 02:03:47.996]  Now I am by no means a UFO truther, but it is just fascinating to see
[02:03:49.226 --> 02:03:59.493]  The military confronting an internet meme as this type of information becomes public for the first time.
[02:03:59.493 --> 02:04:08.579]  Many will remember in WikiLeaks, former astronauts begging a potential Clinton administration to declassify UFOs.
[02:04:13.004 --> 02:04:14.806]  It's really bizarre.
[02:04:14.806 --> 02:04:16.287]  It's a bizarre time to be alive.
[02:04:16.287 --> 02:04:24.294]  When we come back, we're going to talk about reality TV, or as I like to call it, the presidential election in 2020.
[02:04:24.294 --> 02:04:29.879]  Because there's a new headline now, reality TV story producers face decreasing wages.
[02:04:29.879 --> 02:04:30.960]  I can't ever imagine why.
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.684]  Could it be that reality is now more fascinating than reality TV?
[02:04:36.604 --> 02:04:37.806]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:37.806 --> 02:04:41.171]  I'm Tom Pappard filling in on this hour.
[02:04:41.171 --> 02:04:42.133]  Alex may be joining us.
[02:04:42.133 --> 02:04:42.954]  We'll find out.
[02:04:42.954 --> 02:04:44.456]  He's landing right now.
[02:04:44.456 --> 02:04:46.860]  Just did a very important podcast.
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:48.963]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:48.963 --> 02:04:51.046]  I'll be back in just a few minutes.
[02:04:54.818 --> 02:04:57.781]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[02:04:57.781 --> 02:04:59.743]  We've been selling it for over a year.

[02:05:06.931 --> 02:05:12.197]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our top 10 bestsellers.

[02:05:17.122 --> 02:05:18.282]  Life is stressful.

[02:05:21.203 --> 02:05:31.867]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, and licorice root is known to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm, good way.

[02:05:45.159 --> 02:05:46.161]  It's Happies.
[02:05:46.161 --> 02:05:49.166]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:06:12.052 --> 02:06:17.544]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:17.544 --> 02:06:22.273]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.219 --> 02:06:29.980]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:35.081]  I am Tom Papert filling in for Alex as he returns from a very important podcast.
[02:06:35.081 --> 02:06:36.422]  I can't wait till that thing goes live.
[02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:39.723]  Keep an eye out for it over the next couple weeks.
[02:06:39.723 --> 02:06:45.944]  Reality TV story producers are facing decreasing wages and tougher working conditions.
[02:06:45.944 --> 02:06:47.025]  Where would America be?
[02:06:47.805 --> 02:06:50.026]  Without reality television.
[02:06:50.026 --> 02:06:52.787]  It's honestly been a bane of TV for the past decade or so.
[02:06:52.787 --> 02:06:56.948]  I come from the broadcast industry originally and there's nothing innovative about it.
[02:06:56.948 --> 02:07:00.369]  So this is a, it's a very peculiar article.
[02:07:00.369 --> 02:07:03.750]  But I think it says something about where our society is going.
[02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:10.492]  As declining ratings crunch budgets, unscripted writing talents continue to put in some of the small screen's most punishing hours.
[02:07:10.492 --> 02:07:13.513]  Quote, there's not enough Adderall to stay awake.
[02:07:13.513 --> 02:07:15.754]  Oh, I'm sure there's enough Adderall for you.
[02:07:15.754 --> 02:07:16.214]  Natalie
[02:07:16.954 --> 02:07:23.596]  Is a pseudonym used in this article, was scrambling for a job last spring when she received an offer to work in the latest season of E!'
[02:07:23.516 --> 02:07:26.337]  's Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
[02:07:26.337 --> 02:07:37.961]  A story producer with 13 years of experience, Natalie, had been hired for another show that fell apart, so she was grateful to receive the offer until production company Bunim-Murray called her with the rate $1,100 a week.
[02:07:40.342 --> 02:07:43.085]  I don't know who can't live off $1,100 a week.
[02:07:43.085 --> 02:07:46.009]  Is that how inflated these people's ego and lifestyle is?
[02:07:46.009 --> 02:07:47.751]  Where are they living?
[02:07:47.751 --> 02:07:49.573]  In the ritziest New York neighborhood?
[02:07:49.573 --> 02:07:50.274]  It's bizarre.
[02:07:50.274 --> 02:07:52.496]  She says, I audibly gasped!
[02:07:52.496 --> 02:07:56.521]  She depended on her usual rate of $2,500 a week to support her family.
[02:07:57.233 --> 02:08:07.200]  With an average of 1.9 million total viewers in its 16th season, Kardashian's remains an influential show, and Natalie was being offered little more than what a production assistant makes in a week.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:13.405]  She said, it made me angry, because I knew that someone's going to take that job.
[02:08:13.405 --> 02:08:15.166]  People really don't like the free market, do they?
[02:08:15.166 --> 02:08:20.731]  But since 2016, reality TV has been on its way out.
[02:08:21.428 --> 02:08:23.771]  Something that people predicted would happen much earlier.
[02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:27.895]  They thought it would be a flash in the pan in the mid-2000s and it would be over.
[02:08:27.895 --> 02:08:29.057]  But I think I know the reason.
[02:08:30.438 --> 02:08:32.860]  And that's reality, it's just getting interesting.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:36.662]  Thanks to President Trump, I would say, and the likes of Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.662 --> 02:08:40.865]  So they're puffing up Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, for those who haven't noticed this.
[02:08:40.865 --> 02:08:46.549]  This is the left's attempt to recreate the magic 2016 and 15 with President Trump.
[02:08:46.549 --> 02:08:51.333]  This is an article up at heavy.com and maybe we can show some of these photos on screen.
[02:08:51.333 --> 02:08:54.355]  Thousands hack Elizabeth Warren's New York rally.
[02:08:54.935 --> 02:08:57.277]  Look at these crowd-sized photos.
[02:08:57.277 --> 02:08:59.019]  There's a couple things right off the top.
[02:08:59.019 --> 02:09:04.843]  One, this is outside, and so it makes it kind of difficult to tell exactly how many people are there.
[02:09:04.843 --> 02:09:07.826]  Wouldn't it be nice if President Trump could do a rally outside?
[02:09:07.826 --> 02:09:10.728]  I don't think that would end well for the president.
[02:09:10.728 --> 02:09:12.110]  There's too many security risks.
[02:09:12.110 --> 02:09:14.191]  But Warren, because she is a puppet,
[02:09:15.066 --> 02:09:18.008]  Because she is what the globalist wants.
[02:09:18.008 --> 02:09:19.289]  She can do a rally outside.
[02:09:19.289 --> 02:09:23.172]  But you notice, these are supposed to be crowd-sized photos.
[02:09:23.172 --> 02:09:24.633]  They're tight shots.
[02:09:24.633 --> 02:09:27.415]  Are they doing to her what they do to President Trump and they don't show the crowds?
[02:09:27.415 --> 02:09:37.002]  It does make you wonder, but she says, her campaign says, I should say, 20,000 people in attendance.
[02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:37.743]  There's another article.
[02:09:38.849 --> 02:09:46.093]  NBC, Wall Street Journal poll, Biden leads Democrat 2020 field, but Warren's support is growing.
[02:09:46.093 --> 02:09:46.993]  It's very interesting.
[02:09:46.993 --> 02:09:55.557]  I mean, I think Alex predicted years ago, and I think I did too, that Warren would be the globalist pick to run against President Trump in 2020.
[02:09:55.557 --> 02:10:00.280]  So it's fascinating the way this is going.
[02:10:01.394 --> 02:10:04.315]  Here's another one from CT Post.
[02:10:04.315 --> 02:10:06.456]  New focus on crowd sizes.
[02:10:06.456 --> 02:10:09.237]  Warren, Vince, rivals, Trump!
[02:10:09.237 --> 02:10:15.800]  You see, the Democrats have been kind of in panic mode these last several years as their crowd sizes have been non-existent.
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:17.941]  We all remember Jeb Bush.
[02:10:17.941 --> 02:10:20.602]  He was lucky to get 15 people in a room.
[02:10:20.602 --> 02:10:22.283]  The Democrats have been largely the same.
[02:10:22.283 --> 02:10:27.085]  Vito O'Rourke, who wants to take your guns, recently got, I think, what?
[02:10:28.097 --> 02:10:29.218]  Fifteen people in a room?
[02:10:29.218 --> 02:10:34.563]  He met in a kindergarten school classroom here recently.
[02:10:34.563 --> 02:10:38.267]  So President Trump is rightly mocking Elizabeth Warren's crowd.
[02:10:38.267 --> 02:10:46.595]  By the way, this was in New York City, the epicenter of all liberal debauchery, right up there with Los Angeles.
[02:10:46.595 --> 02:10:47.977]  He said anybody could do that.
[02:10:48.976 --> 02:10:59.862]  Mocking her openly and I think that's a good point because here is a story or here's a tweet I should say from Brad Parscale, President Trump's campaign manager going into 2020.
[02:10:59.862 --> 02:11:02.704]  He's also the digital strategist from 2016.
[02:11:02.704 --> 02:11:07.787]  At real Donald Trump rally in New Mexico was a data goldmine.
[02:11:07.787 --> 02:11:10.229]  45,000 people registered for tickets.
[02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:12.610]  94% were from within New Mexico.
[02:11:12.610 --> 02:11:15.592]  78% of registrants matched to voter file.
[02:11:16.372 --> 02:11:25.714]  Over 20% voted in one or zero of the last four elections, meaning they might have voted in 2016 or they might not have voted in a decade or more.
[02:11:25.714 --> 02:11:29.875]  52% were male, 48% female.
[02:11:29.875 --> 02:11:31.215]  Great numbers for President Trump.
[02:11:31.215 --> 02:11:33.275]  I thought women hate the guy.
[02:11:33.275 --> 02:11:38.016]  40% were Latino and 31% were Democrat, but that's the big thing right there.
[02:11:38.016 --> 02:11:38.576]  45,000 people.
[02:11:41.708 --> 02:11:47.473]  45,000 people registered for this rally, but Elizabeth Warren's allegedly getting 20,000, even though it couldn't be confirmed.
[02:11:47.473 --> 02:11:50.436]  And this is not something new, by the way.
[02:11:50.436 --> 02:11:56.361]  Anybody who has been following President Trump, anybody who is watching this broadcast, frankly, will remember this little blast from the past.
[02:11:56.361 --> 02:12:00.465]  August 21st, 2015, it's a CNN article.
[02:12:00.465 --> 02:12:04.728]  30,000 turnout for Trump's Alabama pep rally.
[02:12:04.728 --> 02:12:06.170]  This has been happening since 2015.
[02:12:08.902 --> 02:12:11.863]  And that's why the Democrats are trying to puff up Elizabeth Warren.
[02:12:11.863 --> 02:12:14.304]  She is their answer!
[02:12:14.304 --> 02:12:15.144]  She's their answer.
[02:12:15.144 --> 02:12:17.225]  That's how pathetic things have really gotten.
[02:12:17.225 --> 02:12:24.347]  Because of course, Warren has simply adopted the majority of Bernie Sanders' platform.
[02:12:24.347 --> 02:12:30.809]  And she's going to be the globalist pawn, the sheepdog, who will lead them all back to globalism.
[02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:36.171]  It's a fascinating thing to see, but... Speaking of the reality TV type situation we're in,
[02:12:37.051 --> 02:12:38.552]  Have you noticed they're using children?
[02:12:38.552 --> 02:12:41.473]  So, we had Soph, she was on InfoWars a couple months ago.
[02:12:41.473 --> 02:12:46.395]  Y'all remember the 14-year-old wonderkid who was devastating the internet with her commentary?
[02:12:46.395 --> 02:12:47.235]  Well, she's been banned.
[02:12:47.235 --> 02:12:48.216]  She's gone now.
[02:12:48.216 --> 02:12:51.417]  Not really, because you can ban people and they still exist.
[02:12:51.417 --> 02:12:58.640]  But the left is trying to puff up this European climate change activist who is a young child.
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:03.102]  And let's just roll this bizarre clip, if we can, back in the control room.
[02:13:04.070 --> 02:13:10.954]  New England's climate change representative Greta Thunberg has been hailed by comedian Sarah Silverman as the second coming.
[02:13:10.954 --> 02:13:14.316]  Thunberg has made rounds on the left's propaganda circuit.
[02:13:14.316 --> 02:13:18.319]  Everyone always asks me about Donald Trump.
[02:13:18.319 --> 02:13:25.984]  But, I mean, my message for him is just listen to the science and he obviously doesn't do that.
[02:13:25.984 --> 02:13:31.407]  Is it that climate change just strikes you as so big that you felt moved by that?
[02:13:32.819 --> 02:13:42.464]  Yes, I mean, the climate crisis is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced, and if we don't do anything right now, we're screwed.
[02:13:42.464 --> 02:13:47.586]  Sweden, in Germany, people are starting to call it the Greta effect, where people are taking more trains.
[02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:51.768]  Since you started this movement, they've said they feel ashamed to fly unnecessarily in Europe.
[02:13:51.768 --> 02:14:01.353]  All of this after Thunberg sailed from England to New York, representing the UN's tyrannical sustainability goals on her so-called zero-emissions voyage.
[02:14:01.573 --> 02:14:08.977]  But the zero emissions trip was a scam, as four sailors had to fly to New York and relieve the crew to take the ship back.
[02:14:08.977 --> 02:14:14.720]  Regardless, the arrogance of the UN and the media supporting Thunberg hailed her as victorious.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:21.783]  She wants governments to act to save kids like her from climate devastation, as though governments can regulate it.
[02:14:21.783 --> 02:14:23.164]  And if you dare criticize her,
[02:14:24.033 --> 02:14:29.576]  Not only are you a child bully, but you are someone who's mean to people with disabilities.
[02:14:29.576 --> 02:14:30.876]  And this is how they have it set up.
[02:14:30.876 --> 02:14:39.281]  She's the perfect, from beginning to end, puppet slash spokesman for this movement because she embodies everything that they want to do.
[02:14:39.281 --> 02:14:41.742]  Indoctrinate kids, intimidate their opponents.
[02:14:42.402 --> 02:14:48.469]  Uh, and come up with platitudes of utter nonsense on a minute-by-minute basis if you follow her on Twitter.
[02:15:03.306 --> 02:15:13.530]  Soderlund claims that since food sources will be scarce in the future, people must be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting, among them human flesh.
[02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:22.253]  As the Epoch Times wrote, what Soderlund doesn't mention, curiously, is the long-documented science on the biological effects of cannibalism.
[02:15:22.253 --> 02:15:26.274]  A tribe called the Four lived in isolation... So there you have it.
[02:15:26.274 --> 02:15:27.955]  The new globalist actor.
[02:15:28.655 --> 02:15:33.396]  They're desperately trying to salvage the narrative right now because freedom is winning!
[02:15:33.396 --> 02:15:38.397]  The Info War is being fought and we are winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:38.397 --> 02:15:46.299]  So now you've got Elizabeth Warren and this disabled child who are going to get us back on track toward the race toward globalism!
[02:15:46.299 --> 02:15:48.219]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.

[02:18:00.914 --> 02:18:05.636]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:18:05.636 --> 02:18:09.117]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[02:18:09.117 --> 02:18:10.478]  It's been a bestseller.
[02:18:10.478 --> 02:18:22.043]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:18:22.503 --> 02:18:32.155]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[02:18:32.155 --> 02:18:37.402]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.

[02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:54.813]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[02:18:54.813 --> 02:18:57.695]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[02:18:59.153 --> 02:19:04.417]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are.
[02:19:04.417 --> 02:19:09.440]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the Globalist battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:10.901]  That's why they're so upset.
[02:19:10.901 --> 02:19:12.882]  Think how far we've come together.
[02:19:12.882 --> 02:19:22.329]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:25.270]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:30.693]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption, and to stand with God, and to stand with the unborn.
[02:19:30.693 --> 02:19:36.595]  So I just wanted to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[02:19:36.595 --> 02:19:44.179]  And without you, and your prayers, and your word of mouth, and your financial support, this operation that you built, that's your operation, would not be here.
[02:19:44.179 --> 02:19:47.520]  We've got some giant specials running right now at mfullwordstore.com.

[02:19:57.682 --> 02:20:00.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.381 --> 02:20:17.043]  I think so.
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:28.501]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:28.501 --> 02:20:31.722]  I'm Tom Papert, filling in for Alex today.
[02:20:31.722 --> 02:20:38.624]  There's some insane stuff happening south of the border, where a Vietnam essentially happens every year.
[02:20:38.624 --> 02:20:40.264]  That's how many people die in Mexico.
[02:20:40.264 --> 02:20:48.287]  But I do want to take another moment here, just briefly, to emphatically stress, I mean, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:20:49.355 --> 02:20:54.098]  Infowars is the people who break these stories that no one else will touch.
[02:20:54.098 --> 02:20:57.580]  And Alex Jones has been proven right time and time again.
[02:20:57.580 --> 02:21:06.125]  Some days I wake up and I wish there would just be a day that would go by without another horrifying story where I just sit there and go, Alex was right again.
[02:21:06.125 --> 02:21:06.505]  What do you know?
[02:21:07.526 --> 02:21:25.053]  And the only way they can continue to do this, and they can continue to expand, and if you're not expanding, you're contracting, the only way that they can do this is if you go to InfoWarsStore.com, where right now, some of these deals, as I've said before, are absolutely unbelievable.

[02:22:09.163 --> 02:22:11.465]  These are deep, deep, deep

[02:22:21.007 --> 02:22:22.128]  Support Alex Jones.
[02:22:22.128 --> 02:22:23.988]  Support this broadcast.
[02:22:23.988 --> 02:22:26.269]  Support this network.
[02:22:26.269 --> 02:22:30.550]  So let's talk about what's going on in Mexico, shall we?
[02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:33.371]  Spoiler alert, it's horrifying.
[02:22:33.371 --> 02:22:36.151]  Mexican authorities find 29 bodies in a 100 plastic bag.
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:40.320]  This is from Reuters.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.881]  Mexico City, September 17.
[02:22:41.881 --> 02:22:51.844]  Mexican authorities said Tuesday they found 29 bodies packed in more than 100 plastic bags dumped in a clandestine grave in a violent western state of Jalisco.
[02:22:51.844 --> 02:22:58.166]  Murders in Mexico jumped to the highest on record in the first half of the year, putting the cartel-ravaged country on track to surpass the 29,111 recorded last year.
[02:23:04.155 --> 02:23:15.928]  It's by far, it's gotta be one of the worst places to live and thank God President Trump has essentially bent them over a barrel and they're now preventing some of this cartel violence, some of the human trafficking from getting into the United States.
[02:23:15.928 --> 02:23:23.998]  But there's a special report that I'd like to air on this very subject if the control room can go ahead and bring that up whenever you're able to.
[02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:29.273]  It is the first ever global agreement on migration.
[02:23:29.273 --> 02:23:34.997]  And even if the document is purely symbolic for the United Nations, its adoption is historic.
[02:23:34.997 --> 02:23:45.104]  We are on the eve of a truly remarkable moment in the pursuit of the better management of international migration, a singular issue of our time.
[02:23:45.484 --> 02:23:54.608]  There are communities fighting back against becoming dumping grounds for the Cloward and Piven-style United Nations-engineered replacement migration of sovereign nations.
[02:23:54.608 --> 02:23:58.830]  However, finding their message on mainstream media is a fleeting reality.
[02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:06.953]  In fact, a quick search of protests against immigration leads you to pro-immigration protesters against the agencies keeping our borders safe.
[02:24:07.196 --> 02:24:14.598]  You're looking at a protest on 5th Avenue in New York organized by the Close the Camps NYC coalition.
[02:24:14.598 --> 02:24:16.618]  The message from Microsoft?
[02:24:16.618 --> 02:24:20.059]  Stop using your technology to facilitate the U.S.
[02:24:20.059 --> 02:24:21.719]  immigration policy.
[02:24:21.719 --> 02:24:30.661]  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement opened up classrooms, the dining hall where families get three meals a day, a library with internet and legal resources.
[02:24:31.101 --> 02:24:36.347]  So they can see exactly the care and the conditions under which these individuals are being kept.
[02:24:36.347 --> 02:24:36.847]  There's a lot of
[02:24:49.332 --> 02:24:50.294]  I don't know.
[02:25:06.688 --> 02:25:22.915]  And calling us names and vilifying us for doing the jobs that we are sworn to do, that Congress appropriates $7 billion a year to this agency to effectuate.
[02:25:22.915 --> 02:25:23.456]  It's not right.
[02:25:24.872 --> 02:25:27.756]  It's not fair and frankly it's not helpful.
[02:25:27.756 --> 02:25:34.326]  What if we truly aren't safe in our communities due to the policies of the left as they kowtow for the United Nations?
[02:25:34.326 --> 02:25:39.834]  Wouldn't these protesters simply be supporting unchecked violence against legal residents?
[02:25:40.014 --> 02:25:50.638]  Are they not aiding and abetting the thousands of quietly reported cases and unreported cases of rape and murder waged against innocent and unsuspecting people by illegal aliens?
[02:25:50.638 --> 02:25:55.759]  Instead, the left would have our Second Amendment destroyed and the borders flung wide open.
[02:25:55.759 --> 02:25:56.220]  Hell yes!
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:57.720]  We're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:03.142]  We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[02:26:03.482 --> 02:26:11.567]  For example, from 2011 until 2017, there were 367 killed by mass shootings in the United States.
[02:26:11.567 --> 02:26:19.031]  While a 2017 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety reveals that from June 1st, 2011 to February 28th, 2017, the 215,000 criminal aliens who were booked into Texas jails
[02:26:25.675 --> 02:26:39.584]  We're collectively charged with 566,000 offenses including 1,167 homicides and 6,098 sexual assaults with a total of 257,000 convictions.
[02:26:39.584 --> 02:26:41.306]  And that was just Texas.
[02:26:41.306 --> 02:26:42.666]  The numbers don't lie.
[02:26:42.666 --> 02:26:44.408]  Your chances as a U.S.
[02:26:44.408 --> 02:26:50.592]  citizen of being killed by an illegal immigrant are far higher than a citizen being killed in a mass shooting.
[02:26:50.592 --> 02:26:55.435]  Recently in Rockville, Maryland, protesters gathered to support taking their community back.
[02:26:56.015 --> 02:27:07.005]  I've lived out here in Montgomery County all my life, and now, as you can see, Montgomery County has become a sanctuary for rapists, child rapists.
[02:27:07.005 --> 02:27:16.153]  These children come here to escape that type of terror, and it's happening right here, and we are enabling it.
[02:27:16.153 --> 02:27:21.418]  What is Montgomery County and the county executive with this executive order, what do you believe they're doing wrong?
[02:27:21.778 --> 02:27:25.701]  I believe that they're endangering every single citizen in this county.
[02:27:25.701 --> 02:27:26.402]  How so?
[02:27:26.402 --> 02:27:35.410]  Because they are actively obstructing local, state, and federal cooperation on fundamental matters of public safety and national security.
[02:27:35.410 --> 02:27:45.218]  We should have learned after 9-11 that it is key that we have walls that come down on communicating the immigrant status of criminal suspects in custody.
[02:27:45.558 --> 02:27:50.041]  And this order is the most radical sanctuary order in America.
[02:27:50.041 --> 02:27:52.203]  And this county is ground zero for that.
[02:27:52.203 --> 02:27:53.524]  Let's get some facts on the table.
[02:27:53.524 --> 02:27:55.546]  You mentioned that I'm from Germantown.
[02:27:55.546 --> 02:28:00.689]  Two of the victims of illegal alien criminal rape suspects were from Germantown.
[02:28:00.689 --> 02:28:09.396]  One was a 16-year-old girl who was taking a nap in her own home when a home invader who had been previously deported broke into her home and allegedly...
[02:28:12.591 --> 02:28:23.833]  Completely, no exaggeration, pretty much a Vietnam level of death that happens every single year in Mexico.
[02:28:23.833 --> 02:28:26.613]  30,000 people die.
[02:28:26.613 --> 02:28:37.295]  That could come to the United States, and by the way, it's a little bit more dead than from a Salisbury, a terrible AR-15, the AK-47.
[02:28:37.295 --> 02:28:40.176]  So scary looking, these guys.
[02:28:40.176 --> 02:28:40.896]  Now what's scary,
[02:28:41.892 --> 02:28:48.523]  There's illegal immigrants coming here to sell drugs, rape us, kill us, torture us, mutilate us, and everything that comes with it.
[02:28:48.523 --> 02:28:50.126]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:50.126 --> 02:28:52.510]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[02:28:53.812 --> 02:29:04.994]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:04.994 --> 02:29:14.296]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:14.296 --> 02:29:19.377]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:19.577 --> 02:29:23.801]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:29:23.801 --> 02:29:31.768]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:31.768 --> 02:29:33.029]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:33.029 --> 02:29:35.031]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System
[02:29:35.131 --> 02:29:37.173]  We have entered a great time of change.
[02:29:58.919 --> 02:30:20.026]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government, known as a technocracy in their own words, that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[02:30:20.026 --> 02:30:20.366]  At first,
[02:30:21.386 --> 02:30:23.567]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[02:30:23.567 --> 02:30:24.787]  Don't support Trump.
[02:30:24.787 --> 02:30:26.308]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[02:30:26.308 --> 02:30:29.089]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father.
[02:30:29.089 --> 02:30:31.710]  And, well, let us sterilize your children.
[02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:33.070]  Take these forced inoculations.
[02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:35.031]  And here, take this Prozac pill.
[02:30:35.031 --> 02:30:37.792]  And here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[02:30:37.792 --> 02:30:38.872]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[02:30:40.171 --> 02:30:43.975]  This is truly the Mark of the Beast system, and we're on air right now covering it.
[02:30:43.975 --> 02:30:46.217]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged.
[02:30:46.217 --> 02:30:53.784]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you, for yourself, and myself, and my family, and your family, spread the word about InfoWars.com and the live shows right now.
[02:30:55.262 --> 02:31:01.027]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:31:01.027 --> 02:31:05.751]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:31:05.751 --> 02:31:09.234]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[02:31:09.234 --> 02:31:10.596]  It's been a bestseller.
[02:31:10.596 --> 02:31:22.166]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:31:22.606 --> 02:31:32.261]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil, and so much more.
[02:31:32.261 --> 02:31:37.530]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:45.702]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:45.702 --> 02:31:48.706]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[02:31:48.706 --> 02:31:52.992]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[02:31:55.166 --> 02:32:03.710]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:08.352]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[02:32:08.352 --> 02:32:15.255]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[02:32:15.735 --> 02:32:25.440]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago, that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:39.847]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues and many others.
[02:32:40.327 --> 02:32:44.308]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[02:32:44.308 --> 02:32:50.911]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down, and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[02:32:50.911 --> 02:32:57.653]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[02:32:57.653 --> 02:33:00.294]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.229 --> 02:33:16.249]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.807 --> 02:33:23.188]  Welcome back to this third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.188 --> 02:33:26.469]  I'm Tom Pappert sitting in for Alex today.
[02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:43.675]  He will be back tomorrow and we will have Mike Adams of Natural News hosting the fourth hour of the broadcast, but let's turn our attention to really just as big of an enemy of the American people as the mainstream media, and that would of course be big tech.
[02:33:44.395 --> 02:33:56.184]  Anybody who watches Alex Jones frequently, or at all, knows that most of these companies are hedging their bets, not just hedging their bets, they're putting all the chips in China.
[02:33:56.184 --> 02:34:02.890]  China is the new power according to Facebook, Google, Twitter, all of them.
[02:34:02.890 --> 02:34:07.894]  And now, we finally have a few allies in the United States Senate,
[02:34:09.002 --> 02:34:23.272]  To understand this, Senator Josh Hawley is rather upset that Google, Uber, the big tech giants are dropping all of their money in Communist China.
[02:34:23.272 --> 02:34:25.994]  We've got a clip of Senator Hawley.
[02:34:25.994 --> 02:34:26.915]  Let's go ahead and air that.
[02:34:26.915 --> 02:34:27.575]  Clip 13, I believe.
[02:34:30.012 --> 02:34:34.014]  My concern is that what we're seeing with Silicon Valley is they're creating jobs.
[02:34:34.014 --> 02:34:35.295]  They're creating jobs in China.
[02:34:35.295 --> 02:34:37.216]  I mean, where are they prioritizing their investment?
[02:34:37.216 --> 02:34:38.116]  Overseas.
[02:34:38.116 --> 02:34:39.437]  I mean, look at Google.
[02:34:39.437 --> 02:34:52.043]  Google has worked overtime to try and open business ventures in China, including being willing to launch platform search engines that censor according to Chinese Communist government standards, just so that they can rake in the bucks.
[02:34:52.043 --> 02:34:54.405]  Where's everything produced that Apple, for instance, makes?
[02:34:54.405 --> 02:34:54.705]  China.
[02:34:55.365 --> 02:35:01.089]  So, I'm concerned that they're building an economy in which American workers don't have anything to do.
[02:35:01.089 --> 02:35:02.951]  American workers don't benefit.
[02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:08.635]  Uber, I mentioned the Uber economy, because Uber drivers get paid cents on the dollar in order to drive.
[02:35:08.635 --> 02:35:09.775]  So who benefits from that?
[02:35:09.775 --> 02:35:16.600]  Uber executives, they get rich, just like Google executives are rich, and Amazon executives are rich, Facebook.
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:18.902]  But what about everyday American workers?
[02:35:18.902 --> 02:35:21.003]  What's their place in this economy?
[02:35:21.003 --> 02:35:21.704]  That's a problem.
[02:35:21.704 --> 02:35:24.906]  Do you think gig economy jobs make America a better or a worse place?
[02:35:25.106 --> 02:35:26.648]  I mean, it just depends.
[02:35:26.648 --> 02:35:29.911]  They should be making America better, and this is my challenge to these companies.
[02:35:29.911 --> 02:35:34.375]  My challenge is, if they want to be leaders, you know, they say they represent the best of America.
[02:35:34.375 --> 02:35:37.317]  Well, if that's true, create jobs in this country.
[02:35:37.317 --> 02:35:43.583]  If that's true, invest in the middle of our society, in the middle of the country, but in the American middle, the middle class.
[02:35:43.583 --> 02:35:49.308]  Invest here, produce things here, create jobs and opportunities for our families, increase productivity.
[02:35:49.308 --> 02:35:50.269]  They haven't been doing any of that.
[02:35:51.471 --> 02:35:53.932]  Senator Ali is really on to something there.
[02:35:53.932 --> 02:36:01.235]  I mean, these companies... And look, if you want to be a sadist or a sociopath, you can make the same calculation.
[02:36:01.235 --> 02:36:08.518]  You can look at 350 million people in America, plus, you know, 30, 40, 50 million illegal immigrants, I'm sure.
[02:36:08.518 --> 02:36:11.899]  You can look at that compared to billions and billions of Chinese.
[02:36:11.899 --> 02:36:14.760]  You can look at the fact that they have no labor laws.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:16.101]  You chain your child up.
[02:36:16.801 --> 02:36:18.082]  Like we would chain up a bike.
[02:36:18.082 --> 02:36:19.663]  You chain your child up downstairs.
[02:36:19.663 --> 02:36:24.687]  If somebody tries to commit suicide because of the working conditions, the suicide net will catch them.
[02:36:24.687 --> 02:36:29.511]  There is no escaping the Orwellian Chinese social credit system.
[02:36:29.511 --> 02:36:31.893]  So you know your workers are going to be high quality.
[02:36:32.930 --> 02:36:42.494]  Meanwhile, you look over here in America, where we have unions, we have rights, we have freedoms, we have the ability to actually demand something from our employers.
[02:36:42.494 --> 02:36:43.815]  So what's the solution to this?
[02:36:43.815 --> 02:37:02.063]  Well, as Bush, Clinton, Obama, all of the previous presidents, more or less, for the past half century, if not longer, have realized, well, just outsource all the jobs to China, and we'll buy their stuff, and we will become enslaved to the Chinese Communist
[02:37:03.601 --> 02:37:05.602]  Infrastructure.
[02:37:05.602 --> 02:37:07.083]  That's the future.
[02:37:07.083 --> 02:37:15.847]  And you know, I take a lot of Ubers when I come here to Austin to visit the Infowars studios and it never fails.
[02:37:15.847 --> 02:37:27.353]  These are people who are telling me, yeah, you know, I wanted, I used to have a factory job and well now I'm trying to get my real estate license and I'm just driving Uber to put food on the table until I can get that done and then hopefully I can have a real job again.
[02:37:28.558 --> 02:37:35.080]  Because until Trump came about, there were no jobs in this country for normal human beings.
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:51.404]  The whole Learn to Code movement, which you can now get banned for on Twitter, that whole movement came about because when coal miners, when factory workers, when the people who represent the majority of middle class America, when their jobs were exported to China,
[02:37:53.356 --> 02:37:55.978]  What were they told by the liberal media?
[02:37:55.978 --> 02:37:57.179]  Just learn to code!
[02:37:57.179 --> 02:37:57.799]  Learn a new skill.
[02:37:57.799 --> 02:38:01.202]  It's a changing economy and you gotta find a place.
[02:38:01.202 --> 02:38:08.508]  So I'm glad that we finally have Josh Hawley in Congress pushing back against this, but I really want to stress that this is
[02:38:10.151 --> 02:38:14.855]  You might as well have elected Alex Jones to Congress, and I say that in a very, very positive way.
[02:38:14.855 --> 02:38:25.945]  Because Alex was in the halls of Congress just over a year ago, shouting at Sundar P. Chai, shouting at these big tech overlords, saying exactly, almost verbatim,
[02:38:26.701 --> 02:38:28.183]  What Senator Hawley was saying right there.
[02:38:28.183 --> 02:38:43.039]  So seeing things like this make me optimistic for the future and optimistic that through Congress, through the Trump administration, through the FCC, the FTC, we might start to get some movement against big tech.
[02:38:43.039 --> 02:38:45.642]  Because as we said earlier, it's very clear
[02:38:46.653 --> 02:38:48.094]  What side these people are on?
[02:38:48.094 --> 02:38:52.717]  Facebook has pages for the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda.
[02:38:52.717 --> 02:39:00.581]  Twitter won't allow Laura Loomer on there, won't allow Alex Jones on there, won't allow hardly any InfoWars programming.
[02:39:00.581 --> 02:39:02.562]  You have to be very subversive about it.
[02:39:02.562 --> 02:39:07.165]  Owen Schroer is constantly banned and shadow banned and they end his videos earlier.
[02:39:07.165 --> 02:39:08.766]  They run them without audio.
[02:39:08.766 --> 02:39:13.929]  They're doing anything they can to game the system against patriots, but
[02:39:15.228 --> 02:39:17.649]  Oh, well they let Hamas have a Twitter.
[02:39:17.649 --> 02:39:19.749]  Hamas definitely gets a Twitter.
[02:39:19.749 --> 02:39:21.370]  So it's very clear what side these people are on.
[02:39:21.370 --> 02:39:23.330]  They're on the side of anti-America.
[02:39:23.330 --> 02:39:32.733]  You know, I used to joke that we used to watch certain broadcast outlets, Al Jazeera, Russia Today, and they're fairly honest because you just know that they're being anti-American.
[02:39:32.733 --> 02:39:34.454]  So that's their perspective.
[02:39:34.454 --> 02:39:39.575]  But now we're to the point where Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all of them have the same exact bias.
[02:39:39.575 --> 02:39:40.996]  They want to see America fail.
[02:39:41.536 --> 02:39:43.397]  They want to have our nice houses.
[02:39:43.397 --> 02:39:47.038]  They want to have the freedoms that the rest of us do not get.
[02:39:47.038 --> 02:39:50.319]  But they want America to fail.
[02:39:50.319 --> 02:39:53.980]  I think that's completely obvious at this point.
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:57.581]  So I want to change gears here.
[02:39:57.581 --> 02:40:02.162]  Many will remember last week news broke about a horrific discovery.
[02:40:03.268 --> 02:40:04.829]  In South Bend, Indiana.
[02:40:04.829 --> 02:40:09.874]  Say, that's where Pete's boot-edge edge lives, I believe.
[02:40:09.874 --> 02:40:10.715]  Where's that butt guy?
[02:40:10.715 --> 02:40:12.036]  I always get it confused.
[02:40:12.036 --> 02:40:14.398]  That's where Pete lives, Mayor Pete.
[02:40:14.398 --> 02:40:24.688]  Everyone will remember that a stash of over 2,000 aborted babies was discovered in a deceased former abortionist's home.
[02:40:24.688 --> 02:40:28.992]  And now, a new report up on my site, nationalfile.com.
[02:40:30.407 --> 02:40:38.250]  According to the Whole Women's Health Alliance, they say that these type of stashes exist nationwide.
[02:40:38.250 --> 02:40:46.774]  They said what happens in South Bend is a microcosm for what's happening statewide and what's happening nationally.
[02:40:46.774 --> 02:40:53.877]  So I guess if they can't sell the body parts, they just hold on to them for keepsakes.
[02:40:53.877 --> 02:40:58.659]  What type of sadistic, fallen human being
[02:41:00.728 --> 02:41:01.788]  Would do such a thing.
[02:41:01.788 --> 02:41:09.991]  It really does make you wonder, but in the article that was just on screen, Mayor Pete has said nothing about this.
[02:41:09.991 --> 02:41:17.414]  2,000 dead babies discovered in his hometown, where by the way, they hate him now.
[02:41:17.414 --> 02:41:19.075]  Black Lives Matter protests against him.
[02:41:19.075 --> 02:41:22.456]  The man has lost all popularity in his hometown, Mayor Pete.
[02:41:24.039 --> 02:41:25.679]  Pete has said nothing.
[02:41:25.679 --> 02:41:34.922]  After the discovery of over 2,200 preserved babies were found in the residence of the deceased Dr. Ulrich Klopfer in South Bend, Indiana, all eyes turned to their mayor.
[02:41:34.922 --> 02:41:45.485]  South Bend, Indiana Mayor and Democrat Presidential Candidate Pete Buttigieg has proactively avoided making comments on anything concerning abortion laws.
[02:41:46.536 --> 02:41:51.199]  I don't understand how these people can possibly be taken seriously at this point.
[02:41:51.199 --> 02:41:52.680]  But again, they aren't.
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:54.341]  That's why it's the clown show.
[02:41:54.341 --> 02:42:04.368]  That's why they're desperately hoping that Elizabeth Warren, with Bernie Sanders' ideas, can somehow push forward and become the candidate for 2020.
[02:42:04.368 --> 02:42:07.510]  And of course, big tech will help her along the way.
[02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:12.294]  I just want to remind everybody, there are some insanely good deals going on at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:12.294 --> 02:42:13.995]  You can get up to 75% off major products.
[02:42:17.106 --> 02:42:19.167]  Never can overstate this.
[02:42:19.167 --> 02:42:21.787]  I mean, these are absolutely unbelievable deals.
[02:42:21.787 --> 02:42:35.471]  We're talking 75% off Total Guilt Gut Health Combo, 50% off Superman Vitality, 63% off MycoZX, 50% off Ultra 12, 60% off the Immune Gargle, 50% off bodies, many, many others.
[02:42:35.471 --> 02:42:37.732]  You can help fund the InfoWar
[02:42:38.212 --> 02:42:41.573]  And let me tell you, folks, this is an impressive operation, and I want to see it continue.
[02:42:41.573 --> 02:42:44.654]  So I implore you to do exactly that.
[02:42:44.654 --> 02:42:48.616]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:48.616 --> 02:42:50.296]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:42:50.296 --> 02:42:51.177]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[02:42:51.177 --> 02:42:53.998]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:53.998 --> 02:42:56.859]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[02:42:58.314 --> 02:43:03.578]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are.
[02:43:03.578 --> 02:43:08.602]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the Globalist battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[02:43:08.602 --> 02:43:10.063]  That's why they're so upset.
[02:43:10.063 --> 02:43:12.045]  Think how far we've come together.
[02:43:12.045 --> 02:43:21.552]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[02:43:22.473 --> 02:43:24.435]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[02:43:24.435 --> 02:43:29.859]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption, and to stand with God, and to stand with the unborn.
[02:43:29.859 --> 02:43:35.764]  So I just wanted to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[02:43:35.764 --> 02:43:42.870]  And without you, and your prayers, and your word of mouth, and your financial support, this operation that you built, that's your operation, would not be here.
[02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:46.693]  We've got some giant specials running right now at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:43:46.693 --> 02:43:47.393]  A lot of items are 50% off.
[02:43:48.919 --> 02:43:53.662]  Please take advantage of it at FullMoreStore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[02:43:53.662 --> 02:43:57.905]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[02:43:57.905 --> 02:44:02.669]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula you are supposed to rename it.
[02:44:02.669 --> 02:44:04.190]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[02:44:04.910 --> 02:44:09.312]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[02:44:09.312 --> 02:44:14.394]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[02:44:14.394 --> 02:44:16.214]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[02:44:16.214 --> 02:44:17.515]  Helps make DNA.
[02:44:17.515 --> 02:44:18.835]  Helps the body produce energy.
[02:44:18.835 --> 02:44:20.336]  Helps reduce healthy blood cells.
[02:44:20.336 --> 02:44:22.337]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[02:44:22.337 --> 02:44:23.157]  It goes on and on.
[02:44:23.157 --> 02:44:31.080]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:33.962]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[02:44:33.962 --> 02:44:40.806]  It helps fund the Info War, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:40.806 --> 02:44:46.130]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[02:44:46.130 --> 02:44:51.414]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:44:54.892 --> 02:45:08.942]  We have never been closer to a new world war with a crisis in the Middle East with the Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity.
[02:45:08.942 --> 02:45:15.446]  Whoever's behind it, know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[02:45:15.446 --> 02:45:22.211]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet.
[02:45:23.171 --> 02:45:44.187]  And that we are just mortal, flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment, and to pray for peace, and to pray for transparency, and to pray that the very twisted, evil forces on this planet, trying to start a world war, will be exposed, and their attempts at creating an even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[02:45:44.187 --> 02:45:47.270]  Now, we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully, but it's already
[02:45:48.575 --> 02:45:52.160]  Tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises.
[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:54.223]  We're covering it all live on the radio at InfoWars.com.
[02:45:55.467 --> 02:46:01.208]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:46:01.208 --> 02:46:05.930]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:46:05.930 --> 02:46:09.411]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[02:46:09.411 --> 02:46:10.771]  It's been a bestseller.
[02:46:10.771 --> 02:46:22.334]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:46:22.814 --> 02:46:32.444]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[02:46:32.444 --> 02:46:37.710]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[02:46:37.950 --> 02:46:40.131]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere.
[02:46:40.131 --> 02:46:42.152]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[02:46:42.152 --> 02:46:45.894]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:45.894 --> 02:46:48.895]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[02:46:48.895 --> 02:46:57.599]  We can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[02:46:57.599 --> 02:47:00.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.493 --> 02:47:16.655]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.655 --> 02:47:18.536]  I'm Tom Paffert filling in for Alex today.
[02:47:18.536 --> 02:47:21.458]  In the next hour, we've got MikeAdamsNaturalNews.com.
[02:47:21.458 --> 02:47:29.003]  We've got a stack of news and clips that I want to get through in this final segment of the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.003 --> 02:47:31.585]  And thank you all so much for tuning in today.
[02:47:31.585 --> 02:47:36.809]  But this is, it would be funny if this was some type of parody, but it's real life.
[02:47:36.809 --> 02:47:40.871]  Cheerleaders punished for displaying Trump 2020 Make America Great Again banner.
[02:47:43.894 --> 02:47:47.600]  It's up at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:50.285]  That link isn't quite as shadowbanned as InfoWars.
[02:47:50.285 --> 02:47:52.368]  I can say that as a fact on social media.
[02:47:52.368 --> 02:47:54.111]  Can we go ahead and air this clip?
[02:47:54.111 --> 02:47:55.995]  Because this is, uh, this is pathetic.
[02:47:57.438 --> 02:48:03.222]  Their cheers are meant to unite the crowd, but now at North Stanley High School, the crowd is split.
[02:48:03.222 --> 02:48:09.465]  This after the school's cheerleaders posed with the Trump 2020 banner before a home football game this August.
[02:48:09.465 --> 02:48:26.416]  In a statement to NBC Charlotte, the Stanley County Board of Education said because the cheerleaders were in uniform and were acting as representatives of the school, the display of the sign could be perceived as the school or school system endorsing a political campaign, which they say is prohibited.
[02:48:26.676 --> 02:48:31.159]  This school district says the girls were not disciplined, simply asked not to do it again.
[02:48:31.159 --> 02:48:51.412]  But days later, the North Carolina High School Athletic Association placed the cheerleading spot on probation, telling the local newspaper that every contest should be conducted in a wholesome athletic environment, an environment where good sportsmanship is shown, where people feel safe, that respect for all people participating is being shown.
[02:48:51.412 --> 02:48:55.875]  And while some are cheering on that decision, others cheering on the cheerleaders.
[02:48:56.195 --> 02:49:01.198]  We're only here to support them and their First Amendment rights.
[02:49:01.198 --> 02:49:07.122]  Jeremy Onitrab says he's organizing a support rally in front of the school before Friday night's football game.
[02:49:07.122 --> 02:49:10.904]  So far, more than 800 people say they're interested in attending.
[02:49:10.904 --> 02:49:21.491]  I'd love to line the street so that everybody going into the game goes through the biggest Trump rally they've ever been to.
[02:49:21.491 --> 02:49:22.552]  That would be phenomenal.
[02:49:23.482 --> 02:49:25.883]  So, supporting President Trump.
[02:49:25.883 --> 02:49:29.164]  It might make people feel unsafe.
[02:49:29.164 --> 02:49:31.005]  It could feel unsafe, President Trump.
[02:49:31.005 --> 02:49:32.425]  Orange Van Bad!
[02:49:32.425 --> 02:49:33.926]  Orange Van Scary!
[02:49:33.926 --> 02:49:35.406]  These poor teenagers.
[02:49:35.406 --> 02:49:38.467]  You know, I have a feeling that if there were any other candidate, you would not be having this.
[02:49:38.467 --> 02:49:41.748]  Especially if it was for President Obama during the Obama years.
[02:49:41.748 --> 02:49:45.370]  But you know, who exactly are these girls?
[02:49:45.370 --> 02:49:46.310]  Is it Joe Biden?
[02:49:46.310 --> 02:49:48.611]  Should they be supporting Creepy Sleepy?
[02:49:48.611 --> 02:49:49.071]  Uncle Joe?
[02:49:49.813 --> 02:49:52.796]  We've got a clip, Joe Biden, he got to give it to him.
[02:49:52.796 --> 02:49:56.760]  The man is great with math and he has a vision for this country's future.
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:02.667]  He's going to get more women back in the workforce than exist in the United States of America.
[02:50:02.667 --> 02:50:03.648]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:50:06.052 --> 02:50:14.881]  You get a tax break for a racehorse, why in God's name couldn't we provide an $8,000 tax credit for everybody who has child care costs?
[02:50:14.881 --> 02:50:22.509]  It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.
[02:50:22.509 --> 02:50:27.494]  It would increase the GDP, to sound like a wonk here, by about 8 tenths of 1%.
[02:50:27.494 --> 02:50:28.756]  It would grow the economy.
[02:50:30.154 --> 02:50:32.455]  To sound like a wonk, he says.
[02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:35.497]  I'm sorry, Joe, you don't sound like a policy wonk to me.
[02:50:35.497 --> 02:50:36.938]  It's very sad.
[02:50:36.938 --> 02:50:38.319]  Honestly, it's very sad.
[02:50:38.319 --> 02:50:39.239]  I don't like Joe Biden.
[02:50:39.239 --> 02:50:43.222]  I would never vote for the man in a million years, but he used to be savvy.
[02:50:43.222 --> 02:50:48.785]  Y'all know that he used to want to ban raves, and he used to kind of have a cadence to the way he talked, and he was very on the ball.
[02:50:48.785 --> 02:50:49.565]  No longer.
[02:50:49.565 --> 02:50:50.006]  No longer.
[02:50:50.806 --> 02:50:56.333]  It's such a strange, strange situation we're in with this creepy, sleepy old guy.
[02:50:56.333 --> 02:50:58.876]  720 million women in the United States of America.
[02:50:58.876 --> 02:51:07.567]  For those playing at home, yes, America has a population of like 325 million people, plus 60 million illegals, so that is mathematically impossible.
[02:51:08.527 --> 02:51:12.571]  Thanks Joe, for, I guess, I don't know, where are we going to get 300 million women?
[02:51:12.571 --> 02:51:16.054]  I'm not asking questions anymore, it's the Clown Show.
[02:51:16.054 --> 02:51:22.920]  So this is a story that's been out for a couple days, but it bears repeating, because we need to hold these people accountable.
[02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:29.926]  Ilyan Omar, the Democrat representative from Minnesota, she tweeted out in 2013 a Father's Day tweet.
[02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:36.924]  That allegedly, purportedly, proves she married her brothers.
[02:51:36.924 --> 02:51:47.611]  Of course, the biggest scandal that she has, she allegedly married her own flesh and blood for the purpose of skirting United States immigration laws.
[02:51:47.611 --> 02:51:49.312]  Meaning it was a sham marriage.
[02:51:49.312 --> 02:51:51.294]  I hope it was just a sham marriage, so.
[02:51:51.294 --> 02:51:58.258]  And now, deleted 2013 tweet, Representative Ilhan Omar wished a happy Father's Day to her abu Nur Said.
[02:51:58.258 --> 02:52:00.980]  Which would mean her true name is Ilhan Nur Said.
[02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:01.801]  The same surname.
[02:52:02.561 --> 02:52:06.085]  Yes, her ex-husband who allegedly is her brother.
[02:52:06.085 --> 02:52:15.774]  She's faced increasing scrutiny over what some say was allegedly a sham marriage to skirt United States immigration policy to help her brother Ahmed Nur Zayed gain U.S.
[02:52:15.774 --> 02:52:17.355]  citizenship.
[02:52:17.355 --> 02:52:22.320]  Many consider the Father's Day tweet to be proof that she lied about her identity.
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:23.021]  Here's what it said.
[02:52:23.581 --> 02:52:26.063]  We can put it on screen, perhaps, with a document cam.
[02:52:26.063 --> 02:52:29.646]  Happy Father's Day to my abu Nur Said.
[02:52:29.646 --> 02:52:32.629]  I am forever grateful to Allah for giving me the best father.
[02:52:32.629 --> 02:52:36.151]  And it actually links to a deleted Instagram post.
[02:52:36.151 --> 02:52:38.073]  Because, of course, she scrubbed her Instagram.
[02:52:38.073 --> 02:52:41.816]  Apparently, she didn't quite catch that they were up on Twitter.
[02:52:41.816 --> 02:52:44.959]  So, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, if anyone
[02:52:46.042 --> 02:52:46.543]  We're good to go.
[02:53:03.575 --> 02:53:06.157]  You know, it does make you wonder, is anybody investigating this?
[02:53:06.157 --> 02:53:07.898]  Is it ever going to be taken seriously?
[02:53:07.898 --> 02:53:10.540]  Or are we going the way of the UK?
[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:12.782]  Which is an absolute mess when it comes to this type of thing.
[02:53:12.782 --> 02:53:16.025]  This is another article up at nationalfile.com.
[02:53:16.025 --> 02:53:22.850]  UK rejects ban on eating dogs to avoid offending foreign culture.
[02:53:22.850 --> 02:53:28.134]  So if you don't eat Toto from Kansas, what can I say?
[02:53:28.134 --> 02:53:29.836]  Then you are offending
[02:53:30.779 --> 02:53:32.379]  Foreign cultures!
[02:53:32.379 --> 02:53:39.201]  UK Justice Ministry has blocked a ban on eating cats and dogs over fear it may offend Far East Asians.
[02:53:39.201 --> 02:53:42.902]  This is, by the way, the time of year that horrifying things happen in China.
[02:53:42.902 --> 02:53:43.782]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:53:43.782 --> 02:53:46.042]  I guess maybe I think my culture is the best.
[02:53:46.042 --> 02:53:47.803]  I think that we should put America first.
[02:53:47.803 --> 02:53:51.244]  But in China, they're currently blowtorching dogs to eat them.
[02:53:51.244 --> 02:53:52.664]  That's just the time of year.
[02:53:53.044 --> 02:53:54.045]  It's the time of year.
[02:53:54.045 --> 02:54:02.890]  The UK's politically correct authorities come under fire on a regular basis for their devotion to progressive ideals of inclusivity, even if there are significant negative consequences.
[02:54:02.890 --> 02:54:13.356]  And now, environmental ministers have drafted a proposal that will prohibit the practice, but it's been stopped.
[02:54:13.356 --> 02:54:14.957]  Oh my.
[02:54:14.957 --> 02:54:16.257]  Dogs are our companion animals.
[02:54:16.257 --> 02:54:16.978]  We do not eat them.
[02:54:17.927 --> 02:54:19.107]  Now we think things are bad here in the U.S.
[02:54:19.107 --> 02:54:21.808]  where we have Antifa saying that we need to put Trump supporters in death camps.
[02:54:21.808 --> 02:54:28.310]  That came out a couple weeks ago and it's still, I don't know why I was surprised, of course that's what they think, but it still bothers me.
[02:54:28.310 --> 02:54:29.150]  We have a Democrat
[02:54:48.536 --> 02:54:56.798]  Ito, Robert Francis O'Rourke, saying, hell yeah, we're going to take your guns, but Ito isn't saying that we all have to die.
[02:54:56.798 --> 02:55:01.519]  He's not saying that we should be killed, but that's exactly what's happening across the pond.
[02:55:01.519 --> 02:55:06.620]  UK Liberal Democrat says Conservatives should be burned at the stake.
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:10.681]  Conservatives should also be hung, drawn, and quartered, according to Galen Milne.
[02:55:11.673 --> 02:55:20.540]  Respective parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats, Galen Milne, has been dropped after he said that Tories should be burned at the stake.
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:27.086]  He also described Conservative MPs as Tory rats who rear their ugly heads.
[02:55:27.086 --> 02:55:27.906]  This is coming here.
[02:55:27.906 --> 02:55:34.512]  You know, a lot of people say Britain is just between six months and three years ahead of the United States, and I think we're getting there.
[02:55:34.512 --> 02:55:35.473]  I think we're getting there.
[02:55:36.971 --> 02:55:42.333]  Here's a horrifying article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:42.333 --> 02:55:48.616]  StemExpress whistleblower cut open baby's face to harvest the brain.
[02:55:48.616 --> 02:55:53.318]  They're killing, they're keeping babies alive and selling their body parts, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:53.318 --> 02:56:05.564]  Testimony delivered by pro-life activist David DeLeden, who secretly recorded abortion workers, revealed some of the gruesome details surrounding body harvesting procedures carried out by Planned Parenthood and StemExpress.
[02:56:06.809 --> 02:56:11.733]  Cutting open their brains and selling them.
[02:56:11.733 --> 02:56:12.533]  That's so horrifying.
[02:56:12.533 --> 02:56:16.396]  It's not something you can even say easily.
[02:56:16.396 --> 02:56:17.477]  But there is some good news.
[02:56:17.477 --> 02:56:21.240]  I always like to leave folks with a bit of good news.
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:26.584]  The number of abortions in the United States has now fallen to its lowest since 1973.
[02:56:26.584 --> 02:56:29.967]  That's according to the Associated Press.
[02:56:31.527 --> 02:56:38.434]  We're finally getting somewhere in the culture war, which of course goes well before politics.
[02:56:38.434 --> 02:56:42.037]  It was only at 862,000, which is far, far too many, but that's down from 926,000 tallied in 2014.
[02:56:42.037 --> 02:56:43.358]  There is some progress, after all.
[02:56:51.906 --> 02:56:59.108]  So I just want to, one more time, stress that everybody goes to InfoWarsStore.com, fund this broadcast.
[02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:06.070]  These are some of the best deals I've seen this year, if not in the last five years, of following Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:57:06.070 --> 02:57:08.030]  I don't know how Alex does this.
[02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.331]  75% off.
[02:57:11.005 --> 02:57:12.766]  Major, major products.
[02:57:12.766 --> 02:57:16.169]  So I am Tom Pappert of National File.
[02:57:16.169 --> 02:57:20.331]  Catch me tonight, Firepower News at 7 o'clock central.
[02:57:20.331 --> 02:57:21.292]  We go until 9.
[02:57:21.292 --> 02:57:23.533]  Myself and Will Johnson.
[02:57:23.533 --> 02:57:24.774]  It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:57:24.774 --> 02:57:30.298]  Coming up next is Mike Adams of Natural News taking over for the fourth hour.
[02:57:30.298 --> 02:57:33.100]  He's always a massive wealth of information.
[02:57:33.100 --> 02:57:35.481]  So thank you for watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:35.481 --> 02:57:36.942]  Stay tuned.
[02:57:36.942 --> 02:57:40.805]  Mike Adams coming up next right here on InfoWars.
[02:57:44.026 --> 02:57:51.448]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you the products that Infowarslife.com are.
[02:57:51.448 --> 02:58:04.731]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[02:58:05.251 --> 02:58:11.900]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:13.683]  It sells itself.
[02:58:13.683 --> 02:58:21.714]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[02:58:22.575 --> 02:58:24.295]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[02:58:24.295 --> 02:58:36.659]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[02:58:36.659 --> 02:58:38.919]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[02:58:38.919 --> 02:58:41.820]  50% off on BODY'S at Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:44.634 --> 02:58:50.379]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:58:50.379 --> 02:58:55.103]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:58:55.103 --> 02:58:57.785]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[02:58:57.785 --> 02:58:59.947]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[02:58:59.947 --> 02:59:11.517]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:59:11.957 --> 02:59:21.605]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[02:59:21.605 --> 02:59:26.870]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:35.056]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:35.056 --> 02:59:38.058]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[02:59:38.058 --> 02:59:47.185]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[02:59:47.185 --> 02:59:49.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:54.770 --> 03:00:03.553]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:00:03.553 --> 03:00:13.496]  Hello and welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.496 --> 03:00:17.017]  This is Mike Adams from Natural News, stepping in for this whole hour today.
[03:00:17.017 --> 03:00:22.439]  We've got a lot coming up for you here, covering some science bombshells that are
[03:00:23.466 --> 03:00:30.690]  The biggest, you could say, science red flags that they are trying to destroy our biosphere and annihilate humanity.
[03:00:30.690 --> 03:00:31.910]  We've got new breaking news on that.
[03:00:31.910 --> 03:00:37.153]  Number one, the GMO mosquito experiment in Brazil has failed catastrophically.
[03:00:37.153 --> 03:00:47.778]  And it has now unleashed super mutant GMO mosquitoes that could kill millions of people throughout South America, Central America, and even in the United States eventually.
[03:00:48.795 --> 03:00:56.298]  And this has caused genetic pollution of the mosquito population, combining the genes from three different countries into one mosquito population.
[03:00:56.298 --> 03:00:58.499]  It is an absolute catastrophe.
[03:00:58.499 --> 03:01:03.380]  It's exactly the type of genetic pollution that we have been warning about for many years.
[03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:05.861]  In fact, I remember on InfoWars in 2012, seven years ago,
[03:01:08.906 --> 03:01:15.308]  I was talking about this very issue with a Save Our Science type of warning at that time.
[03:01:15.308 --> 03:01:17.848]  That was in 2012 and here it is happening today.
[03:01:17.848 --> 03:01:21.709]  But that's just one story of three big bombshell stories I have for you today.
[03:01:21.709 --> 03:01:35.052]  The other one is about the global geoengineering slash chemtrails program that's being funded in part by Bill Gates and being run by Harvard scientists to pollute the entire planet's atmosphere.
[03:01:35.052 --> 03:01:38.093]  This is a stratospheric aerosol injection or
[03:01:38.872 --> 03:01:46.719]  As the Bill Gates funding is promoting another program called SCOPEX, which stands for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment.
[03:01:46.719 --> 03:01:53.744]  This is designed to pollute the entire planet, shut down photosynthesis, collapse the food supplies globally.
[03:01:53.744 --> 03:02:05.574]  And in today's broadcast here on InfoWars, I'm going to go over the ramifications of that and why, just honestly, truthfully, if you don't have a one-year plan to survive without groceries,
[03:02:07.746 --> 03:02:12.288]  You're going to be killed by this because the global food supply will collapse.
[03:02:12.288 --> 03:02:14.249]  That's what this program is trying to achieve.
[03:02:14.249 --> 03:02:15.369]  And it's now out in the open.
[03:02:15.369 --> 03:02:19.411]  CNBC just released a big video on this a couple of days ago.
[03:02:19.411 --> 03:02:20.871]  And they're touting the benefits of it.
[03:02:20.871 --> 03:02:24.553]  Basically, chemtrails are now being supported by the mainstream media.
[03:02:24.553 --> 03:02:28.314]  The same media that three years ago said it was a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:28.314 --> 03:02:33.696]  Now it's mainstream, you know, CNBC saying it's awesome.
[03:02:33.696 --> 03:02:34.556]  It's incredible.
[03:02:34.556 --> 03:02:35.017]  All right.
[03:02:35.017 --> 03:02:36.097]  And that's just the second story.
[03:02:36.417 --> 03:02:42.898]  The third story I have for you today is about the evil tech giants and how they're trying to literally suck your blood.
[03:02:42.898 --> 03:02:47.139]  Now, they're doing this through medical testing innovation.
[03:02:47.139 --> 03:03:05.662]  I'm going to talk about the now-defunct company Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes and how it was actually a plot to harvest the blood and the DNA of every American in your own home and then to upload the DNA scans to a central database that would be used, of course, by the deep state, the swamp,
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:20.552]  The federal government, the NSA, to profile you genetically and to tie you to crimes that you didn't commit because you might share genes with some hair follicle that was left behind or a piece of skin left behind by some other criminal.
[03:03:20.552 --> 03:03:21.653]  It's insane.
[03:03:21.653 --> 03:03:22.594]  But they want your blood.
[03:03:22.594 --> 03:03:23.815]  They're out for your blood.
[03:03:23.815 --> 03:03:29.240]  It's not just the blood of children, as you well know, not just infanticide and abortions and all that insanity and how they're
[03:03:29.793 --> 03:03:32.996]  They're just mass killing children in the name of women's health.
[03:03:32.996 --> 03:03:37.200]  They want your blood so they can track you and they can enslave you.
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:42.605]  So we've got those three stories coming up here in this hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:03:42.605 --> 03:03:44.747]  Now, Alex is traveling, of course, right now.
[03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:48.870]  I was told that he he's arriving soon in Austin.
[03:03:48.870 --> 03:03:53.775]  I think he'll be on the air tomorrow, maybe tonight, maybe he'll pop in during the last part of this hour.
[03:03:53.775 --> 03:03:54.015]  We'll see.
[03:03:54.994 --> 03:03:58.275]  But Alex, of course, he released this information in a podcast yesterday.
[03:03:58.275 --> 03:03:59.935]  He was on with Joe Rogan.
[03:03:59.935 --> 03:04:01.276]  I think a five-hour interview.
[03:04:01.276 --> 03:04:04.177]  That'll probably be edited to a shorter version.
[03:04:04.177 --> 03:04:07.158]  But Alex sees the same thing that I see about what's happening.
[03:04:07.158 --> 03:04:14.700]  This is an escalation of global events to try to destroy humanity.
[03:04:14.700 --> 03:04:17.581]  This is the annihilation of the human race that we are witnessing.
[03:04:17.581 --> 03:04:23.082]  And I hope you talked about that with Joe Rogan because Joe needs to get the full picture of what's going on.
[03:04:23.082 --> 03:04:23.923]  I'm talking about the
[03:04:25.443 --> 03:04:27.245]  I call it geogenocide.
[03:04:27.245 --> 03:04:41.714]  This is the planned, planet-scale genocide of the human race through multiple vectors, not just the fluoride in the water supply, not just the heavy metals and lead in the water, not just radiation, Fukushima and all that, not just the vaccines and 5G, but much more.
[03:04:41.714 --> 03:04:45.537]  So we'll get into that here on the Alex Jones Show as we continue with the fourth hour.
[03:04:45.537 --> 03:04:46.317]  Stay with us.
[03:04:46.317 --> 03:04:48.619]  We'll be right back in one minute for all those details.
[03:04:52.731 --> 03:04:55.712]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[03:04:55.712 --> 03:04:57.692]  They've been selling it for over a year.
[03:04:57.692 --> 03:05:04.834]  It's a private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the body, but not be a depressant.
[03:05:04.834 --> 03:05:10.116]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our top 10 bestsellers.
[03:05:10.116 --> 03:05:13.677]  And right now, for those of you that haven't tried it, you can get it for 50% off.
[03:05:15.057 --> 03:05:16.218]  Life is stressful.
[03:05:16.218 --> 03:05:19.139]  Almost everything in our lives can put stress and pressure on us.
[03:05:19.139 --> 03:05:29.804]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, and licorice root is known to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm, good way.
[03:05:29.804 --> 03:05:35.847]  And Happies is available right now at mfullmorestore.com, 50% off your purchase, support, and broadcast.
[03:05:35.847 --> 03:05:36.467]  It is so vital.
[03:05:36.787 --> 03:05:43.095]  And I recommend you order another bottle to give friends and family because this stuff has really worked for myself and so many others.
[03:05:43.095 --> 03:05:44.096]  It's Happies.
[03:05:44.096 --> 03:05:47.099]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:06:01.593 --> 03:06:04.854]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:06:04.854 --> 03:06:12.697]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:06:12.697 --> 03:06:14.238]  Welcome back to the fourth hour.
[03:06:14.238 --> 03:06:18.880]  This is Mike Adams here filling in for Alex Jones, who is traveling today.
[03:06:18.880 --> 03:06:20.600]  But we've got big bombshell news for you here.
[03:06:20.600 --> 03:06:21.481]  Let's start right into it.
[03:06:21.481 --> 03:06:29.524]  Number one, the GMO mosquito experiment that was unleashed in Brazil over the last two years has gone horribly wrong.
[03:06:30.595 --> 03:06:41.378]  It has resulted in the breeding of super mutant mosquitoes that now combine some of the genes of mosquitoes from three different countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil.
[03:06:41.378 --> 03:06:46.499]  And these new super mosquitoes are now coming back with a vengeance because they've been genetically modified.
[03:06:46.499 --> 03:06:52.921]  They've been turned into like mutant, I don't know, maybe you could call them superhero mutant mosquitoes or something.
[03:06:52.921 --> 03:06:54.561]  And they are now stronger than ever.
[03:06:55.603 --> 03:07:03.049]  And a surging back in population, and they now threaten the lives of millions of people in ways that they've never been threatened before.
[03:07:03.049 --> 03:07:04.410]  This was all part of an experiment.
[03:07:04.410 --> 03:07:05.630]  I mean, let's back up on this.
[03:07:05.630 --> 03:07:16.198]  We were told, the science was, that they were going to release all these males that were genetically modified, and the males were going to be weakened with a dominant infertility gene.
[03:07:16.198 --> 03:07:17.839]  And then they would mate with the females.
[03:07:17.839 --> 03:07:21.122]  And then the females would have offspring that were sterile.
[03:07:21.122 --> 03:07:24.024]  And through this mechanism, we were told, the whole system would collapse.
[03:07:25.089 --> 03:07:26.229]  The mosquitoes would die off.
[03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:28.390]  We wouldn't have these mosquito populations.
[03:07:28.390 --> 03:07:30.350]  This is what we were told.
[03:07:30.350 --> 03:07:32.630]  Well, guess what happened?
[03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:39.652]  As in many of these experiments, in the wild, things happened that they did not anticipate in the laboratory.
[03:07:39.652 --> 03:07:46.353]  So what really happened is, at first, yes, the mosquitoes began to die off for about the first 12 to 18 months.
[03:07:46.353 --> 03:07:51.194]  And this is reported by Yale, and this has been reported in the science journal Nature, by the way.
[03:07:52.136 --> 03:07:54.119]  So the first 18 months they started to die off.
[03:07:54.119 --> 03:07:56.162]  But then something changed.
[03:07:56.162 --> 03:08:01.669]  The females began to stop mating with the weakened males.
[03:08:01.669 --> 03:08:02.510]  You hear me on this?
[03:08:02.510 --> 03:08:05.935]  The females said no, they don't want to reproduce with the weakened males.
[03:08:05.935 --> 03:08:07.778]  And they started selecting males that had
[03:08:08.484 --> 03:08:10.405]  You know, virility.
[03:08:10.405 --> 03:08:11.506]  Males that could have children.
[03:08:11.506 --> 03:08:13.006]  Males that could have offspring.
[03:08:13.006 --> 03:08:17.208]  Gosh, if only liberals in California could be as smart as these mosquitoes, that would be amazing.
[03:08:17.208 --> 03:08:21.631]  But these female mosquitoes then started selecting males that could reproduce.
[03:08:21.631 --> 03:08:23.512]  And then the population surged back.
[03:08:23.512 --> 03:08:30.115]  But during this time, some of the modified genes got transferred over to the population that's in the wild.
[03:08:30.115 --> 03:08:31.456]  And this wasn't supposed to happen.
[03:08:31.456 --> 03:08:34.197]  And in fact, this is what these scientists at Yale
[03:08:34.850 --> 03:08:35.531]  We're good to go.
[03:08:54.221 --> 03:09:03.706]  And so, how many people, I say, how many people are going to die in Brazil from dengue fever or, you know, all these mosquito-borne diseases?
[03:09:03.706 --> 03:09:04.426]  You name it.
[03:09:04.426 --> 03:09:05.546]  So many of them.
[03:09:05.546 --> 03:09:10.249]  How many are going to die because of this science experiment gone wrong?
[03:09:10.249 --> 03:09:12.610]  The number could be huge over the next decade.
[03:09:12.610 --> 03:09:15.471]  It could kill a million or more people because of this experiment.
[03:09:15.471 --> 03:09:17.212]  You know, theoretically.
[03:09:17.212 --> 03:09:19.233]  And they can't pull it back.
[03:09:19.233 --> 03:09:20.514]  So we warned about this in 2012.
[03:09:21.658 --> 03:09:26.939]  We warned about the different levels of dangerous science and things that can be unleashed in the wild.
[03:09:26.939 --> 03:09:33.221]  We warned about chemicals being unleashed, like fluoride and so on, and that's one level of danger.
[03:09:33.221 --> 03:09:35.741]  Glyphosate, pesticides, all these things.
[03:09:35.741 --> 03:09:43.863]  But a higher level of danger is what we call self-replicating pollution, genetic pollution, that continues to replicate.
[03:09:43.863 --> 03:09:45.884]  And that's what these scientists have done.
[03:09:46.966 --> 03:09:48.187]  And they forced it on us.
[03:09:48.187 --> 03:09:49.648]  And they said their science was perfect.
[03:09:49.648 --> 03:09:50.528]  It's going to work great.
[03:09:50.528 --> 03:09:51.909]  They're going to save lives.
[03:09:51.909 --> 03:09:55.431]  They said they're going to save lives with their twisted science.
[03:09:55.431 --> 03:10:00.414]  And they banned us for daring to raise the alarm on this seven years ago, people.
[03:10:00.414 --> 03:10:02.556]  We raised the alarm seven years ago.
[03:10:02.556 --> 03:10:03.316]  And what happened?
[03:10:03.316 --> 03:10:04.077]  We get banned.
[03:10:04.077 --> 03:10:05.558]  We get de-platformed.
[03:10:05.558 --> 03:10:07.139]  But we were right the whole time.
[03:10:07.139 --> 03:10:09.000]  We were the ones warning humanity about this.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:10.140]  And now it's happened.
[03:10:10.140 --> 03:10:12.562]  And, by the way, the experiment hasn't been stopped.
[03:10:13.624 --> 03:10:14.485]  And this is continuing.
[03:10:14.485 --> 03:10:18.348]  I just got a text before the show from a couple that lives out in California.
[03:10:18.348 --> 03:10:19.909]  They might be watching this right now.
[03:10:19.909 --> 03:10:26.494]  They told me that, based on their information, other strains of genetically modified mosquitoes are being released in California.
[03:10:26.494 --> 03:10:29.116]  I haven't confirmed that yet, but that's what they're telling me.
[03:10:29.116 --> 03:10:34.480]  They're already seeing very aggressive mosquito behavior that they didn't notice before.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:40.385]  So, something is being unleashed on purpose as part of a massive depopulation scheme.
[03:10:40.385 --> 03:10:43.307]  Because the end result of this, really, is to kill more humans.
[03:10:43.914 --> 03:10:44.795]  That's what's going on.
[03:10:44.795 --> 03:10:47.837]  They're killing more humans.
[03:10:47.837 --> 03:10:52.901]  And also, just a quick note here about sexual reproduction.
[03:10:52.901 --> 03:11:02.007]  In nature, isn't it interesting that species adapt and overcome, and they engage in sexual reproduction to achieve continuation of the species?
[03:11:02.007 --> 03:11:10.974]  And even in mosquitoes, they do not, the females, do not want to reproduce with the weakened, feminized, pathetic males.
[03:11:11.940 --> 03:11:26.595]  And yet, in our pop culture today, especially on the West Coast, in, you know, liberal California, you see feminization of the males, you see the push for transgenderism, you see the push for the mutilation of the genitalia of children.
[03:11:26.595 --> 03:11:29.058]  You see this push for extinction!
[03:11:30.279 --> 03:11:34.280]  And in the wild, you see survival, adaptation.
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.040]  The animals are smarter than the progressives in California.
[03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:40.601]  The insects are smarter than the progressives in California.
[03:11:40.601 --> 03:11:43.221]  The insects choose life.
[03:11:43.221 --> 03:11:51.043]  The progressives in California choose suicide and death and infanticide and abortion and just self-destruction.
[03:11:51.043 --> 03:11:54.064]  I find that interesting at many levels.
[03:11:54.064 --> 03:11:55.984]  All right.
[03:11:55.984 --> 03:11:56.504]  Next story.
[03:11:57.136 --> 03:12:01.557]  But, you know, it'll be interesting to see if these GMO mosquitoes continue to be released all around the world.
[03:12:01.557 --> 03:12:08.638]  And if they are, you know it's a depopulation program because the science is already out that it doesn't work to reduce mosquitoes.
[03:12:08.638 --> 03:12:10.899]  So that can't be the plan anymore.
[03:12:10.899 --> 03:12:12.399]  The Yale scientists have already proven it.
[03:12:12.399 --> 03:12:14.519]  They did the DNA analysis.
[03:12:14.519 --> 03:12:16.780]  So it's all about depopulation of humans.
[03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:22.881]  It's all about breeding a weaponized strain of mosquitoes in order to kill human beings.
[03:12:22.881 --> 03:12:26.802]  And that's consistent with everything else that we've been seeing about killing human beings.
[03:12:27.668 --> 03:12:31.471]  And with that note, let's go to geoengineering.
[03:12:31.471 --> 03:12:32.832]  Now, I did a story yesterday.
[03:12:32.832 --> 03:12:34.093]  This was interesting.
[03:12:34.093 --> 03:12:37.495]  Now, you're probably already aware because you're a super-informed audience.
[03:12:37.495 --> 03:12:41.318]  You know more than anybody that watches the mainstream media.
[03:12:41.318 --> 03:12:46.421]  You know that Bill Gates has been funding this global pollution scheme called SCOPEX.
[03:12:46.421 --> 03:12:50.464]  It's the SCOPEX Project, Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment.
[03:12:50.464 --> 03:12:52.986]  And this is with Harvard scientists, by the way.
[03:12:52.986 --> 03:12:54.587]  And their plan is to pollute the skies.
[03:12:55.700 --> 03:13:06.122]  They want to block the sun, this is their plan, to reflect sunlight back into space, so to deprive plants on Earth the sunlight that they need in order to function as plants.
[03:13:06.122 --> 03:13:11.944]  This is about shutting down photosynthesis, which is the basis of all sustainable life on our planet.
[03:13:11.944 --> 03:13:16.505]  And there you go, if you're watching, it shows the airplanes releasing pollution into the stratosphere.
[03:13:16.505 --> 03:13:21.726]  And this pollution will consist of sulfur dioxide and calcium carbonate, which is contaminated with lead.
[03:13:22.546 --> 03:13:30.268]  What it means is that they're going to drop lead and pollution all across the entire planet in the stratosphere.
[03:13:30.268 --> 03:13:33.209]  They're going to lead poison the entire planet.
[03:13:33.209 --> 03:13:41.832]  Now lead, according to a study in the Lancet that we covered last week, kills in America 412,000 Americans every year.
[03:13:41.832 --> 03:13:42.492]  Lead!
[03:13:42.492 --> 03:13:44.853]  We're talking low-level lead contamination.
[03:13:44.853 --> 03:13:49.454]  And by the way, the mechanism of that death is through heart disease and ischemic heart disease.
[03:13:49.454 --> 03:13:51.495]  So lead causes heart failure.
[03:13:52.515 --> 03:13:54.536]  And low-level lead contamination causes that.
[03:13:54.536 --> 03:13:57.257]  That's why it's important to get, you know, clean supplements.
[03:13:57.257 --> 03:13:59.517]  That's why I know Infowars tests are supplements.
[03:13:59.517 --> 03:14:03.759]  And, you know, I do testing for lots of companies, including I've tested a lot of Infowars supplements.
[03:14:03.759 --> 03:14:04.699]  You've got to get rid of the lead.
[03:14:04.699 --> 03:14:06.119]  You've got to have clean stuff.
[03:14:06.119 --> 03:14:09.440]  Because if you're exposed to lead, you're going to die of heart disease.
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:11.021]  412,000 Americans do every year.
[03:14:11.021 --> 03:14:11.521]  It's incredible.
[03:14:12.665 --> 03:14:16.346]  Now, Bill Gates wants to put lead into the skies all around the planet.
[03:14:16.346 --> 03:14:19.146]  Calcium carbonate is always contaminated with lead.
[03:14:19.146 --> 03:14:20.267]  We've done the testing.
[03:14:20.267 --> 03:14:23.327]  We know how much lead is in calcium carbonate.
[03:14:23.327 --> 03:14:26.108]  Now, the media will lie to you and say, no, it's just chalk.
[03:14:26.108 --> 03:14:28.789]  Well, all chalk is contaminated with lead.
[03:14:28.789 --> 03:14:30.029]  So that's a fact that you can count on.
[03:14:30.029 --> 03:14:30.809]  We've done the tests.
[03:14:30.809 --> 03:14:34.310]  ICP-MS, mass spectrometry, we know this information.
[03:14:34.310 --> 03:14:39.311]  Now, this is about shutting down, shutting down the biosphere.
[03:14:40.074 --> 03:14:57.701]  So it's not just about releasing GMO mosquitoes that are going to be super mutant mosquitoes that kill millions of people, especially in third world countries, which is where Bernie Sanders sort of hinted that he might support enhanced abortion, right, for impoverished nations filled with black and brown people.
[03:14:57.701 --> 03:15:01.563]  That's where they're pushing the GMO mosquitoes in Brazil.
[03:15:01.563 --> 03:15:08.406]  And that's where they were pushing the infertility chemicals of the food supply in the 1970s with science advisor Dr. Lee DuBridge,
[03:15:08.886 --> 03:15:09.547]  We're good to go.
[03:15:22.242 --> 03:15:29.684]  So as usual, the globalists are targeting Africa, Central America, South America, but with the new Project Scopex, they're targeting us all.
[03:15:29.684 --> 03:15:36.826]  And we'll talk about that in much more detail as we come back, including details about why you can't opt out of it.
[03:15:36.826 --> 03:15:39.026]  You can opt out of vaccines for now.
[03:15:39.026 --> 03:15:45.488]  You can say no to vaccines, but you can't say no to Bill Gates and Harvard scientists polluting the entire planet.
[03:15:45.488 --> 03:15:46.848]  And they don't want you to be able to say no.
[03:15:46.848 --> 03:15:48.289]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:15:48.289 --> 03:15:48.849]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:51.701 --> 03:15:52.941]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:56.842]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:56.842 --> 03:15:58.382]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.382 --> 03:16:01.343]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.343 --> 03:16:06.904]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:06.904 --> 03:16:08.104]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.104 --> 03:16:11.045]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.045 --> 03:16:13.265]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.265 --> 03:16:17.706]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:16:21.611 --> 03:16:22.852]  Maybe not today.
[03:16:22.852 --> 03:16:24.152]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:24.152 --> 03:16:27.894]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:27.894 --> 03:16:28.975]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:28.975 --> 03:16:30.796]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:30.796 --> 03:16:32.517]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:16:55.343 --> 03:16:57.165]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:16:57.165 --> 03:16:58.926]  Stress from everyday life.
[03:16:58.926 --> 03:17:02.848]  Past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:17:02.848 --> 03:17:04.749]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:17:04.749 --> 03:17:06.530]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[03:17:52.489 --> 03:17:56.712]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[03:17:56.712 --> 03:18:01.476]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[03:18:01.476 --> 03:18:03.718]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[03:18:03.718 --> 03:18:05.720]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:08.122]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[03:18:08.122 --> 03:18:13.206]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[03:18:13.206 --> 03:18:15.027]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[03:18:15.027 --> 03:18:16.328]  Helps make DNA.
[03:18:16.328 --> 03:18:17.649]  Helps the body produce energy.
[03:18:17.649 --> 03:18:19.151]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[03:18:19.151 --> 03:18:21.152]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[03:18:21.152 --> 03:18:21.913]  It goes on and on.
[03:18:22.113 --> 03:18:30.240]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:32.782]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[03:18:32.782 --> 03:18:39.628]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:18:39.628 --> 03:18:44.932]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[03:18:44.932 --> 03:18:50.197]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:18:53.865 --> 03:18:56.827]  We have entered a great time of change.
[03:18:56.827 --> 03:19:17.963]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government, known as a technocracy in their own words, that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[03:19:17.963 --> 03:19:18.303]  At first,
[03:19:19.324 --> 03:19:21.506]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[03:19:21.506 --> 03:19:22.728]  Don't support Trump.
[03:19:22.728 --> 03:19:24.249]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[03:19:24.249 --> 03:19:27.012]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father.
[03:19:27.012 --> 03:19:29.094]  And, well, let us sterilize your children.
[03:19:29.094 --> 03:19:30.996]  Take these forced inoculations.
[03:19:30.996 --> 03:19:32.978]  And here, take this Prozac pill.
[03:19:32.978 --> 03:19:35.721]  And here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[03:19:35.721 --> 03:19:36.802]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[03:19:38.089 --> 03:19:41.891]  This is truly the Mark of the Beast system, and we're on air right now covering it.
[03:19:41.891 --> 03:19:44.132]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged.
[03:19:44.132 --> 03:19:56.099]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you, for yourself, and myself, and my family, and your family, spread the word about Infowars.com, the live shows, right now!
[03:19:56.099 --> 03:19:58.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:12.199 --> 03:20:17.882]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:17.882 --> 03:20:24.186]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:20:24.186 --> 03:20:25.887]  We're back with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:25.887 --> 03:20:29.349]  Thanks for continuing with us, the fourth hour here on this bombshell day.
[03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:30.170]  So much news today.
[03:20:31.076 --> 03:20:39.762]  Alex is coming back to Austin after traveling and he may be popping in this hour or certainly later with a special report.
[03:20:39.762 --> 03:20:41.063]  So we'll see if he pops in.
[03:20:41.063 --> 03:20:41.964]  I know he's aware.
[03:20:41.964 --> 03:20:48.149]  Alex is fully aware of the annihilation of humanity that is taking place.
[03:20:48.149 --> 03:20:49.730]  We've covered all these things over the years.
[03:20:49.730 --> 03:20:52.752]  The fluoride, the 5G assaults, the psychiatric drugging of children.
[03:20:53.354 --> 03:21:04.002]  The abortion and the infanticide, the murder, everything, now it just gets bigger and bigger on a more global scale and there are more vectors trying to depopulate humanity, just kill off all humans.
[03:21:04.002 --> 03:21:05.783]  This is what the globalists are trying to do.
[03:21:05.783 --> 03:21:13.509]  So as I sort of got into in the last segment, but I'll go into more detail here, the geoengineering experiments are now openly admitted by the mainstream media.
[03:21:13.909 --> 03:21:20.594]  Same media that attacked us years ago said we were conspiracy theorists for talking about chemtrails and geoengineering and weather control.
[03:21:20.594 --> 03:21:28.040]  Once again, Alex Jones was ten years ahead of the media on this and I warned about this stuff seven years ago in 2012.
[03:21:28.040 --> 03:21:32.503]  But again, we were censored so that you couldn't know the truth, but now it's all out there.
[03:21:32.503 --> 03:21:35.045]  So understand that this chemtrails
[03:21:35.742 --> 03:21:42.547]  This program, Project Scopex, is funded by the biggest globalist organizations that are also involved in censorship.
[03:21:42.547 --> 03:21:53.695]  In particular, when I was watching this CNBC video yesterday that was touting the benefits of chemtrails and geoengineering, they showed the list of donors who are supporting this program.
[03:21:53.695 --> 03:22:01.801]  And the donors, it was 14 non-profits, and it includes just a long list of them, but one of them is the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
[03:22:01.801 --> 03:22:04.683]  And that rang a bell because I remember the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
[03:22:05.439 --> 03:22:16.684]  Was instrumental in getting the vaxxed documentary that told the truth about vaccines, getting it banned from the Tribeca Film Festival.
[03:22:16.684 --> 03:22:17.744]  That was a couple years ago.
[03:22:18.522 --> 03:22:31.125]  But Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has always been about covering up the truth about the science schemes that are trying to kill people and brain damage people and maim people.
[03:22:31.125 --> 03:22:42.988]  And depending on, you know, what information sources you go to, you can find some very interesting history about Alfred P. Sloan and a lot of his globalists who really have decided to try to eliminate the human population.
[03:22:44.082 --> 03:22:55.005]  So what I want to explain here, as a scientist myself, as a published scientist and a lab scientist, I need you to understand what will happen when they dim the sun.
[03:22:55.005 --> 03:23:00.026]  They're trying to block the sun by mimicking a natural disaster volcano.
[03:23:00.026 --> 03:23:02.086]  There was a volcano that erupted in the year 1815.
[03:23:02.086 --> 03:23:04.987]  I forgot the name of it.
[03:23:04.987 --> 03:23:08.028]  It was like Mount Tambora or something similar to that.
[03:23:08.869 --> 03:23:12.952]  And this volcano caused what was called a year without a summer.
[03:23:12.952 --> 03:23:17.035]  It caused food crops to fail around the world.
[03:23:17.035 --> 03:23:19.657]  Food crops failed on at least five continents.
[03:23:19.657 --> 03:23:23.419]  People starved to death all over the world because of one volcano.
[03:23:23.419 --> 03:23:23.840]  Why?
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:29.564]  Because that volcano ejected a massive amount of particulate matter into the stratosphere.
[03:23:29.564 --> 03:23:36.509]  And then, of course, the stratosphere, it circulates, it moves around, and so then that spread across the whole planet and it blocked the sun.
[03:23:37.631 --> 03:23:41.414]  Food crops failed, people died, businesses went bankrupt, all over the world.
[03:23:41.414 --> 03:23:42.175]  And that was 1815.
[03:23:42.175 --> 03:23:57.407]  Now, the Scopex Project, funded by Bill Gates and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and others, they're trying to mimic this natural disaster of a volcano through artificial means, by flying planes at high altitude and releasing pollution into the atmosphere.
[03:23:57.407 --> 03:24:02.671]  Understand, the environmentalists are now demanding global pollution.
[03:24:02.671 --> 03:24:05.694]  The environmentalists want to pollute the planet.
[03:24:05.694 --> 03:24:07.195]  This is their demand now.
[03:24:08.147 --> 03:24:16.913]  And if they succeed, they're going to cause, listen carefully, a global collapse of food production.
[03:24:16.913 --> 03:24:23.877]  We are talking about a food collapse that spans all the major continents, you know, at least five continents.
[03:24:23.877 --> 03:24:31.662]  A food collapse that will collapse populations, especially in third world countries where they're on marginal food supplies already.
[03:24:31.662 --> 03:24:34.684]  And even by blocking as little as one or two percent of the sunlight,
[03:24:35.402 --> 03:24:42.204]  They will crush food production in those marginalized areas where plants are just barely surviving as it is.
[03:24:42.204 --> 03:24:45.385]  You don't have to block 50% of the sunlight to collapse world population.
[03:24:45.385 --> 03:24:48.126]  You only have to block a tiny portion of the sunlight.
[03:24:48.126 --> 03:24:50.347]  And this is what they're trying to do.
[03:24:50.347 --> 03:24:53.308]  And they claim it's very affordable to do.
[03:24:53.308 --> 03:24:59.129]  They say they're only going to have to spend $2.5 billion a year for the next 10 or 15 years to achieve this.
[03:24:59.129 --> 03:25:00.570]  And that's nothing.
[03:25:00.570 --> 03:25:03.411]  People like Bill Gates can write a check for $2.5 billion.
[03:25:05.089 --> 03:25:07.590]  I mean, he probably carries that in his pocket.
[03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:08.270]  Who knows?
[03:25:08.270 --> 03:25:11.111]  But these people, to them, this is cheap.
[03:25:11.111 --> 03:25:13.112]  They want to destroy the human population.
[03:25:13.112 --> 03:25:16.973]  The cheapest way for them to accomplish that is to pollute the skies.
[03:25:16.973 --> 03:25:20.074]  The implications of this are enormous.
[03:25:20.074 --> 03:25:23.495]  Way beyond anything that I think they have even imagined.
[03:25:23.495 --> 03:25:25.616]  The collapse of the global food supply means that
[03:25:26.641 --> 03:25:28.042]  You're going to have social unrest.
[03:25:28.042 --> 03:25:31.845]  You're going to have starvation, famine, disease.
[03:25:31.845 --> 03:25:36.009]  Basically, you're going to have the four horsemen of the apocalypse unleashed upon our world.
[03:25:36.009 --> 03:25:39.992]  This is like end times mad science that is going to happen.
[03:25:39.992 --> 03:25:42.254]  And there's no one stopping them.
[03:25:42.254 --> 03:25:46.077]  And the other side of this is that they don't even need a vote.
[03:25:46.077 --> 03:25:49.340]  They don't even need permission from the President or the Senate.
[03:25:49.340 --> 03:25:50.461]  You know why?
[03:25:50.461 --> 03:25:53.303]  Because they can launch these planes from any country in the world.
[03:25:53.303 --> 03:25:55.085]  They don't have to launch them from the United States.
[03:25:55.882 --> 03:26:05.808]  Even if Trump were completely opposed to this, and he may not even be aware of any of this yet, he couldn't stop it because the president has no power outside the United States.
[03:26:05.808 --> 03:26:13.452]  These globalists can get together and they can pay some, you know, third world dictator nation somewhere that has a runway.
[03:26:13.452 --> 03:26:16.334]  They can just launch all these planes from there.
[03:26:16.334 --> 03:26:21.017]  And because it's polluting the entire planet, the entire stratosphere, you can't escape it.
[03:26:22.179 --> 03:26:23.900]  The globalists have figured this out.
[03:26:23.900 --> 03:26:37.711]  You can say no to vaccines, and there's a growing vaccine resistance because of the dangers of vaccines and the toxic ingredients they put in them, like mercury and aluminum and squalene and so on, and aborted human fetal tissue, by the way.
[03:26:37.711 --> 03:26:39.272]  You can escape vaccines.
[03:26:39.272 --> 03:26:43.455]  And they're trying to push the mandates, but the mandates are meeting resistance, even in California.
[03:26:43.455 --> 03:26:47.598]  But you can't escape global pollution of the skies.
[03:26:47.598 --> 03:26:48.779]  There's nothing you can do.
[03:26:49.924 --> 03:26:52.945]  If the sunlight is blocked, sunlight's blocked.
[03:26:52.945 --> 03:26:55.565]  You can't grow your crops like you used to.
[03:26:55.565 --> 03:26:58.986]  And also, by the way, your solar panels don't work like they used to.
[03:26:58.986 --> 03:27:06.348]  So all these globalists that are saying, ah, we have to give up combustion engines, you got to buy solar panels, you have to install solar, everything's got to be solar.
[03:27:06.348 --> 03:27:10.128]  These are the same lunatics that are going to block the sun.
[03:27:10.128 --> 03:27:10.949]  Think about this.
[03:27:10.949 --> 03:27:12.549]  These are the same people.
[03:27:12.549 --> 03:27:16.950]  Like, yeah, invest all your money in solar panels, and then we're going to make sure they don't really work very well.
[03:27:17.964 --> 03:27:21.987]  As if they, I mean, they don't even work very well right now in many cases.
[03:27:21.987 --> 03:27:31.272]  So these people are going to bankrupt, you know, the counties and the cities that have invested all this solar panel expecting a payoff in 15 years or whatever.
[03:27:31.272 --> 03:27:33.634]  That's going to be delayed because the sun's going to be blocked.
[03:27:34.562 --> 03:27:39.246]  And then you're going to have a global food collapse mimicking the natural disaster of this 1815 volcano.
[03:27:39.246 --> 03:27:46.011]  And you're going to have famine, you're going to have geopolitical collapse, you know, economic collapse, social unrest.
[03:27:46.011 --> 03:27:52.856]  Basically, you're looking at a global coordinated collapse of human society as we know it today.
[03:27:52.856 --> 03:27:55.739]  And this is their deliberate plan.
[03:27:55.739 --> 03:27:57.600]  And I call this their hard kill vector.
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:27:59.021]  They tried soft kill.
[03:27:59.021 --> 03:28:01.023]  They tried to put infertility chemicals in the food.
[03:28:02.031 --> 03:28:03.852]  You know, Atrazine is a chemical castrator.
[03:28:03.852 --> 03:28:06.114]  This is what's feminizing many people today.
[03:28:06.114 --> 03:28:07.735]  Atrazine, it's an herbicide.
[03:28:07.735 --> 03:28:12.237]  They tried to put soft-kill chemicals into the vaccines, into the water supply.
[03:28:12.237 --> 03:28:18.061]  They tried soft-kill techniques through multiple methods, psychiatric drugs, cancer drugs, everything.
[03:28:18.061 --> 03:28:22.604]  Now, they're running out of patients, and they've moved to a hard-kill vector.
[03:28:22.604 --> 03:28:26.106]  The hard-kill vector is Pollute the Skies.
[03:28:26.106 --> 03:28:27.607]  In the name of environmentalism,
[03:28:28.646 --> 03:28:29.787]  It's going to cause acid rain.
[03:28:29.787 --> 03:28:35.111]  It's going to cause lead to fall out of the skies and contaminate the entire food supply with lead.
[03:28:35.111 --> 03:28:38.734]  It's going to contaminate the rivers and streams and oceans.
[03:28:38.734 --> 03:28:40.976]  It's going to cause solar panels to be impaired.
[03:28:40.976 --> 03:28:47.200]  It's going to cause a global economic collapse, famine, disease, infestation, basically your zombie apocalypse.
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:48.902]  They're bringing it to you.
[03:28:48.902 --> 03:28:50.343]  We'll be back with more details.
[03:28:52.150 --> 03:29:03.196]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:53.007 --> 03:29:58.750]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[03:29:58.750 --> 03:30:03.472]  that has their products in hospitals and it's sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[03:30:03.472 --> 03:30:06.153]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[03:30:06.153 --> 03:30:08.314]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[03:30:08.314 --> 03:30:19.879]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[03:30:20.319 --> 03:30:29.987]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[03:30:29.987 --> 03:30:35.232]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[03:30:35.492 --> 03:30:39.676]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[03:30:39.676 --> 03:30:43.419]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:43.419 --> 03:30:46.422]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[03:30:46.422 --> 03:30:52.688]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[03:30:52.688 --> 03:30:55.551]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:31:02.264]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are.
[03:31:02.264 --> 03:31:06.707]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the Globalist battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[03:31:06.707 --> 03:31:08.748]  That's why they're so upset.
[03:31:08.748 --> 03:31:10.729]  Think how far we've come together.
[03:31:10.729 --> 03:31:20.216]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[03:31:21.156 --> 03:31:23.118]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[03:31:23.118 --> 03:31:28.582]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption, and to stand with God, and to stand with the unborn.
[03:31:28.582 --> 03:31:34.446]  So I just wanted to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[03:31:34.446 --> 03:31:41.992]  And without you, and your prayers, and your word of mouth, and your financial support, this operation that you built, that's your operation, would not be here.
[03:31:41.992 --> 03:31:45.375]  We've got some giant specials running right now at MFullworkstore.com.

[03:32:03.610 --> 03:32:07.993]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[03:32:07.993 --> 03:32:13.097]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[03:32:13.097 --> 03:32:14.918]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[03:32:14.918 --> 03:32:16.219]  Helps make DNA.
[03:32:16.219 --> 03:32:17.540]  Helps the body produce energy.
[03:32:17.540 --> 03:32:19.041]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[03:32:19.041 --> 03:32:21.043]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[03:32:21.043 --> 03:32:21.863]  It goes on and on.
[03:32:21.863 --> 03:32:29.789]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[03:32:30.109 --> 03:32:32.670]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[03:32:32.670 --> 03:32:39.492]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:32:55.516 --> 03:32:58.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:06.011]  Big Brother.
[03:33:06.011 --> 03:33:07.911]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:07.911 --> 03:33:09.532]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:09.532 --> 03:33:11.072]  You want answers?
[03:33:11.072 --> 03:33:12.793]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:12.793 --> 03:33:17.195]  It's Mike Adams!
[03:33:17.195 --> 03:33:20.676]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.676 --> 03:33:25.778]  Thank you for continuing with us here as we explore the science agenda to annihilate
[03:33:26.278 --> 03:33:27.059]  Humankind.
[03:33:27.059 --> 03:33:28.880]  It's the mad science agenda.
[03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:31.522]  By the way, you know, I'm not an opponent of real science.
[03:33:31.522 --> 03:33:32.683]  I am a scientist.
[03:33:32.683 --> 03:33:34.585]  You know, I do science every day.
[03:33:34.585 --> 03:33:41.010]  Real science, though, needs to be married with humility and what's called a precautionary principle.
[03:33:41.010 --> 03:33:47.275]  Such as, hey, don't release your weaponized mosquitoes, your genetically modified insects, into the wild.
[03:33:47.916 --> 03:33:49.817]  And then, oh, see what happens.
[03:33:49.817 --> 03:34:03.005]  You know, don't pollute the skies globally, block the sun, shut down photosynthesis, collapse all the food crops, just to see what might happen, to see if you might stop your, you know, global warming hoax, which is all fabricated anyway, it's all fiction.
[03:34:03.005 --> 03:34:10.070]  See, I understand the role of science, but these people, these globalists and lunatics, they think science replaces God.
[03:34:11.215 --> 03:34:12.736]  They hate the idea of God.
[03:34:12.736 --> 03:34:14.958]  They hate the idea of spirituality.
[03:34:14.958 --> 03:34:16.779]  And they think that science is their savior.
[03:34:16.779 --> 03:34:18.820]  That's why they're all into transhumanism.
[03:34:18.820 --> 03:34:23.103]  They want to merge with the machines, and they want to use science to dominate society.
[03:34:23.103 --> 03:34:27.386]  And when their mad science experiments go wrong, well, what do they do?
[03:34:27.386 --> 03:34:29.547]  They blame their political opponents.
[03:34:29.547 --> 03:34:39.894]  So, trust me, mark my words on this, when the geoengineering chemtrails experiment goes horrifically wrong, and the food crops are collapsing all over the world, and people are starving to death, you know what they're going to say?
[03:34:40.623 --> 03:34:42.745]  They're going to say, oh, it's because of climate change.
[03:34:42.745 --> 03:34:47.009]  They need to double down the pollution in the skies to block even more sun.
[03:34:47.009 --> 03:34:48.910]  And then it's going to get even worse.
[03:34:48.910 --> 03:34:52.133]  More starvation, more disease, more economic collapse.
[03:34:52.133 --> 03:34:53.634]  And they're going to say the same thing.
[03:34:53.634 --> 03:34:59.099]  It's going to be like AOC is going to come out and say, oh, we've got to put more pollution in the skies again and again and again.
[03:34:59.099 --> 03:35:01.601]  These are lunatics.
[03:35:01.601 --> 03:35:03.483]  These are science lunatics.
[03:35:03.483 --> 03:35:07.807]  They're almost going to win their own Darwin Award.
[03:35:08.621 --> 03:35:11.063]  For stupidity and self-extermination.
[03:35:11.063 --> 03:35:13.986]  The problem is they're going to take you and me with them.
[03:35:13.986 --> 03:35:18.370]  They're going to kill us all if we don't stop them with these mad science experiments.
[03:35:18.370 --> 03:35:25.017]  You don't pollute your planet and call it saving your planet, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[03:35:25.017 --> 03:35:30.642]  Now, oh, and by the way, you see they roll out these children as puppets all the time, like this Greta girl?
[03:35:31.708 --> 03:35:36.430]  They have Greta now lecturing America about fake climate change.
[03:35:36.430 --> 03:35:39.612]  This little girl who has no idea what she's talking about.
[03:35:39.612 --> 03:35:40.652]  She's been handed lines.
[03:35:40.652 --> 03:35:43.434]  She's a puppet of the globalists.
[03:35:43.434 --> 03:35:47.075]  They're lecturing us and lecturing Congress about global warming.
[03:35:47.075 --> 03:35:48.316]  Really?
[03:35:48.316 --> 03:35:48.596]  Really?
[03:35:48.596 --> 03:35:49.776]  What is she in?
[03:35:49.776 --> 03:35:51.217]  The seventh grade or something?
[03:35:51.217 --> 03:35:53.738]  I mean, this is what the globalists are doing now.
[03:35:53.738 --> 03:35:54.979]  They find children.
[03:35:55.723 --> 03:36:03.166]  Like Hogg and Greta and they just feed them lines and then they roll out these children as your saviors.
[03:36:03.166 --> 03:36:08.409]  Sarah Silverman, the comedian, didn't she say that this Greta girl is like the second coming of Christ or something?
[03:36:08.409 --> 03:36:09.429]  You see my point?
[03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:19.434]  They hate God but they say that their fake science is your God and you're supposed to bow down and worship and praise Greta as the second coming of Christ.
[03:36:19.434 --> 03:36:22.195]  This creepy, just creepy girl.
[03:36:23.012 --> 03:36:35.979]  Like, she should be, well, I'm gonna hold back my comments, but she's creepy, and her ideas are creepy, and they're dangerous for our world, and she has zero qualifications to even talk to us about any of this stuff.
[03:36:35.979 --> 03:36:39.361]  But isn't that classic leftism, liberalism?
[03:36:39.361 --> 03:36:41.302]  They talk about things that they don't know about.
[03:36:42.105 --> 03:36:49.868]  Like, they want to lecture you on your AR-15 and how your AR-15 works, and the first thing they say is, like, ban the clips, you know?
[03:36:49.868 --> 03:36:51.629]  Because they're morons!
[03:36:51.629 --> 03:36:55.270]  They don't know anything about what they're even talking about.
[03:36:55.270 --> 03:37:01.012]  They don't know the difference between a semi-automatic and a full-auto or bolt-action or anything.
[03:37:01.012 --> 03:37:07.014]  They have no clue what they're talking about, whether it's science or climate or guns or liberties or even history.
[03:37:07.014 --> 03:37:09.155]  They just fabricate their own history.
[03:37:09.155 --> 03:37:11.436]  They make up anything they want, and then they just pass it off.
[03:37:12.102 --> 03:37:13.363]  That's liberalism.
[03:37:13.363 --> 03:37:15.504]  They have no connection with reality.
[03:37:15.504 --> 03:37:17.645]  But they want to control everything.
[03:37:17.645 --> 03:37:18.746]  They want to dominate your world.
[03:37:18.746 --> 03:37:23.309]  They want to dominate you.
[03:37:23.309 --> 03:37:23.869]  Yeah, who was it?
[03:37:23.869 --> 03:37:27.751]  Which candidate was it that said, you can't have magazines that hold more than one round?
[03:37:27.751 --> 03:37:28.112]  Was that?
[03:37:28.112 --> 03:37:29.593]  That was Biden, I think.
[03:37:29.593 --> 03:37:31.554]  Yes.
[03:37:31.554 --> 03:37:33.535]  Brain scrambled Biden for you there.
[03:37:33.535 --> 03:37:36.077]  Famous AR-15 quotes.
[03:37:36.077 --> 03:37:36.877]  Fascinating stuff.
[03:37:36.877 --> 03:37:38.398]  But getting to the blood harvesting of people.
[03:37:39.153 --> 03:37:46.438]  I did cover this briefly on a previous show here on InfoWars, but there's something new that you need to understand about this.
[03:37:46.438 --> 03:37:55.643]  The Theranos company that was founded by Elizabeth Holmes, which was a massive financial and investment fraud, and she is facing criminal charges now.
[03:37:55.643 --> 03:37:57.244]  The company has been disbanded.
[03:37:57.244 --> 03:37:58.245]  It's all shut down.
[03:37:58.245 --> 03:38:01.347]  I think she burned through $900 million in other people's money.
[03:38:02.128 --> 03:38:08.871]  She, at one point, was celebrated as the most amazing woman, female entrepreneur, worth billions of dollars, going to change the world.
[03:38:08.871 --> 03:38:13.193]  Her entire business model was taking your blood in your own home.
[03:38:13.193 --> 03:38:24.198]  The goal was for her to install these so-called Edison machines in your home, and you were supposed to get up every day and stick your finger in this machine, and it was going to suck your blood.
[03:38:24.198 --> 03:38:29.140]  And from this blood, it was going to supposedly run all these medical tests.
[03:38:29.833 --> 03:38:33.455]  And then it was going to upload results to the Theranos company.
[03:38:33.455 --> 03:38:34.655]  You know what I think that really was?
[03:38:34.655 --> 03:38:51.543]  I think they were going to take DNA profiles and blood marker profiles of all people, tie it to your Google profile, tie it to your social security number, tie it to your bank account, tie it to your social credit score, and covertly test you for drugs.
[03:38:52.561 --> 03:39:10.036]  See, you know, if you're using an illicit drug or see if you're pregnant and then they can market, you know, pregnancy products to you even before you know you're pregnant or to genetically profile you and build a massive DNA database that would be used against you by the police state system.
[03:39:10.036 --> 03:39:11.857]  This was celebrated.
[03:39:11.857 --> 03:39:14.920]  This woman, Elizabeth Holmes, was on the cover of Fortune magazine.
[03:39:16.247 --> 03:39:25.089]  She was, again, it was kind of like the second coming of Christ is what we were told about, you know, in a way, about Elizabeth Holmes and she was this amazing person.
[03:39:25.089 --> 03:39:29.710]  I don't know about you, but have you ever seen this woman talk?
[03:39:29.710 --> 03:39:32.991]  Have you ever seen, have you ever heard her voice?
[03:39:32.991 --> 03:39:35.591]  She sounds creepier than Greta!
[03:39:35.591 --> 03:39:36.951]  She doesn't blink.
[03:39:36.951 --> 03:39:39.172]  She always wore the same black turtlenecks.
[03:39:39.172 --> 03:39:40.432]  It showed a view of her closet.
[03:39:40.432 --> 03:39:43.613]  She had like 32 copies of the same clothes.
[03:39:43.613 --> 03:39:44.513]  And she talked like
[03:39:46.067 --> 03:39:46.628]  Like a man!
[03:39:46.628 --> 03:39:47.188]  I don't know.
[03:39:47.188 --> 03:39:50.571]  And she's just full-on creepy.
[03:39:50.571 --> 03:39:52.753]  These people are way creepy.
[03:39:52.753 --> 03:39:53.733]  They're all into your blood.
[03:39:53.733 --> 03:39:56.376]  They're all into... Well, I gotta be careful.
[03:39:56.376 --> 03:40:05.743]  They're all into controlling you by profiling everything about you and stealing your information or harvesting your information, often without your consent.
[03:40:05.743 --> 03:40:08.586]  So think about just the three stories I've covered here so far today.
[03:40:09.505 --> 03:40:12.507]  We're talking about the GMO mosquito experiment gone wrong.
[03:40:12.507 --> 03:40:13.768]  Was that deliberate?
[03:40:13.768 --> 03:40:19.411]  Did they intentionally create super mutant killer mosquitoes now to wipe out people in third world countries?
[03:40:19.411 --> 03:40:20.872]  I believe there's a chance that that's true.
[03:40:22.168 --> 03:40:29.890]  What about the geoengineering, the Chemtrails experiment, Project Scopex, funded by Bill Gates, run by Harvard scientists, and also funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation?
[03:40:29.890 --> 03:40:40.352]  Global pollution to block the sun, shut down the global food supply, including, by the way, phytoplankton, which are the basis of the food webs of aquatic ecosystems, you know, ocean life.
[03:40:40.352 --> 03:40:41.392]  They're going to kill that, too.
[03:40:41.392 --> 03:40:42.472]  They're going to kill the oceans.
[03:40:42.472 --> 03:40:44.013]  They're going to kill the land.
[03:40:44.013 --> 03:40:45.453]  They're going to kill humans.
[03:40:45.453 --> 03:40:46.613]  And you can't do anything about it.
[03:40:46.613 --> 03:40:49.234]  You can't opt out, because if they block the sun,
[03:40:50.103 --> 03:40:53.429]  There's really nothing you can do except wait for all that stuff to fall out of the sky.
[03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:55.093]  And by the way, it contains lead too.
[03:40:55.819 --> 03:41:02.043]  So you're going to have lead poisoning of the entire planet, and lead right now kills 412,000 Americans a year, according to the Lancet.
[03:41:02.043 --> 03:41:10.569]  So they're going to up that number to maybe millions of Americans a year being killed by lead while they're poisoning the food supply and collapsing the food ecosystem at the same time.
[03:41:10.569 --> 03:41:21.235]  And then, the story I just covered, the blood harvesting of every person in America with the Theranos company, which thankfully is now defunct, but they're not going to give up on this attempt.
[03:41:21.235 --> 03:41:21.916]  They're going to do it again.
[03:41:22.921 --> 03:41:46.616]  The point is, they want to profile you, they want to control you, they want to surveil you, and then, ultimately, after they're done just wringing every last dollar out of your pocket, shaking all the coins, just holding you upside down, shaking you until all your wallet falls out, and they take all your money from Big Pharma and the cancer industry, and they kidnap your children, and hit them with chemotherapy, you know, medical kidnapping, because you wanted a second opinion as a parent.
[03:41:46.616 --> 03:41:49.098]  After they're done with all that, they're just going to kill you.
[03:41:49.972 --> 03:41:52.093]  Because they don't want you around.
[03:41:52.093 --> 03:41:52.553]  Don't you know?
[03:41:52.553 --> 03:41:54.834]  They've got the robots coming.
[03:41:54.834 --> 03:41:59.115]  They've got the robots, the automation, ready to take over the world, and they don't want you around.
[03:41:59.115 --> 03:42:07.938]  Why do you think they're pushing abortion, and infanticide, and infertility chemicals, and transgenderism, and super mutant mosquitoes that are going to kill and infect more people?
[03:42:07.938 --> 03:42:17.241]  Why do you think they're investigating and researching weaponized, biological, you know, deployment systems that can kill millions of people?
[03:42:18.308 --> 03:42:19.649]  Because they don't want you around.
[03:42:19.649 --> 03:42:24.111]  The globalists have already decided that it's the end of the line for the masses.
[03:42:24.111 --> 03:42:30.155]  And this is what, you know, Alex gets this, I get this, and this is what we're trying to warn you about.
[03:42:30.155 --> 03:42:35.998]  And I think the independent media is the only media in the world that is telling the truth about any of this.
[03:42:35.998 --> 03:42:36.359]  We are.
[03:42:36.359 --> 03:42:36.879]  We're it.
[03:42:37.586 --> 03:42:42.812]  We are humanity's last chance to stop this before they annihilate us all.
[03:42:42.812 --> 03:42:43.813]  That's what we're doing.
[03:42:43.813 --> 03:42:45.435]  That's why it's crucial that we survive.
[03:42:45.435 --> 03:42:46.616]  Thank you for your support.
[03:42:46.616 --> 03:42:48.458]  We'll be back after this break with more.
[03:42:51.604 --> 03:42:54.606]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[03:42:54.606 --> 03:42:56.567]  We've been selling it for over a year.

[03:43:13.958 --> 03:43:15.119]  Life is stressful.

[03:43:51.798 --> 03:43:57.560]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[03:43:57.560 --> 03:44:02.281]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[03:44:02.281 --> 03:44:04.961]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[03:44:04.961 --> 03:44:07.122]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[03:44:07.122 --> 03:44:18.685]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[03:44:19.145 --> 03:44:28.791]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[03:44:28.791 --> 03:44:34.055]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[03:44:34.315 --> 03:44:38.496]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[03:44:38.496 --> 03:44:42.237]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:42.237 --> 03:44:45.238]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[03:44:45.238 --> 03:44:53.440]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[03:44:53.440 --> 03:44:55.140]  We have entered a great time of change.
[03:44:56.428 --> 03:45:17.535]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government, known as a technocracy in their own words, that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[03:45:17.535 --> 03:45:17.875]  At first,
[03:45:18.922 --> 03:45:21.084]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[03:45:21.084 --> 03:45:22.306]  Don't support Trump.
[03:45:22.306 --> 03:45:23.827]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[03:45:23.827 --> 03:45:27.131]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father.
[03:45:27.131 --> 03:45:28.652]  Well, let us sterilize your children.
[03:45:28.652 --> 03:45:31.055]  Take these forced inoculations.
[03:45:31.055 --> 03:45:32.877]  Here, take this Prozac pill.
[03:45:32.877 --> 03:45:35.300]  Here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[03:45:35.300 --> 03:45:36.381]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[03:45:37.662 --> 03:45:41.464]  This is truly the Mark of the Beast system, and we're on air right now covering it.
[03:45:41.464 --> 03:45:43.725]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged.
[03:45:43.725 --> 03:45:51.290]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you, for yourself, and myself, and my family, and your family, spread the word about InfoWars.com and the live shows right now.
[03:45:52.873 --> 03:46:01.439]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[03:46:01.439 --> 03:46:06.081]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[03:46:06.081 --> 03:46:12.986]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[03:46:13.446 --> 03:46:23.176]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[03:46:23.176 --> 03:46:37.569]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues and many others.
[03:46:38.370 --> 03:46:42.033]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[03:46:42.033 --> 03:46:44.595]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[03:46:44.595 --> 03:46:48.639]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[03:46:48.639 --> 03:46:55.504]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[03:46:55.504 --> 03:46:58.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:06.056 --> 03:47:08.478]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:08.478 --> 03:47:12.361]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:16.863 --> 03:47:22.528]  The upshot of all of this that we're talking about today here on the Alex Jones Show, thanks for continuing with us.
[03:47:22.528 --> 03:47:24.449]  This is Mike Adams from Natural News.
[03:47:24.449 --> 03:47:34.197]  The upshot is that there is a global effort, you know, to devastate human life and to devastate the ecosystem that supports us.
[03:47:34.197 --> 03:47:40.522]  There's a collapse of the biosphere that's being engineered and if you oppose it, you are called anti-human.
[03:47:41.175 --> 03:47:45.717]  Environmentalists, you know, the environmentalists themselves are calling for this collapse.
[03:47:45.717 --> 03:47:47.858]  And they will be the ones who are most impacted.
[03:47:47.858 --> 03:47:56.461]  But in terms of practical things that you can do, it's become obvious to me that you're going to have to be able to live a year without food.
[03:47:56.461 --> 03:47:59.002]  I mean, without, you know, grocery store food.
[03:47:59.002 --> 03:48:01.483]  Yeah, you're going to need to stockpile some food.
[03:48:01.483 --> 03:48:03.604]  You're going to need to stockpile supplies like never before.
[03:48:03.604 --> 03:48:07.225]  And I want to bring your attention to the fact that the government itself
[03:48:07.958 --> 03:48:15.165]  Has entire underground cities and caves, networks, massive amounts of supplies.
[03:48:15.165 --> 03:48:20.871]  Remember a couple years ago when they purchased, I think DHS bought like 2 billion rounds of ammunition?
[03:48:20.871 --> 03:48:21.831]  Where do you think all that went?
[03:48:21.831 --> 03:48:24.174]  It went into the storage caves.
[03:48:24.174 --> 03:48:29.499]  They've got caves in different locations all around the country built into the limestone in Kansas City, for example.
[03:48:30.687 --> 03:48:32.668]  I've driven by some of those caves before.
[03:48:32.668 --> 03:48:39.314]  They've got underground cities, they've got underground bunkers, I mean, huge places, and they're prepared for years underground.
[03:48:39.314 --> 03:48:46.720]  Meanwhile, the government recommendation to you is to have enough supplies for three days.
[03:48:46.720 --> 03:48:52.965]  So, you're supposed to have three days of food, and they've got, like, ten years ready to go.
[03:48:52.965 --> 03:48:53.705]  You know?
[03:48:53.705 --> 03:48:57.909]  Because, of course, the globalists believe that they need to survive, but you don't.
[03:48:58.832 --> 03:49:03.895]  And they are now, what's obvious to me, they are planning to decimate the surface of the Earth.
[03:49:03.895 --> 03:49:09.978]  They're trying to turn the surface of the Earth, all the plants, all the food crops, you know, all the seeds, everything.
[03:49:09.978 --> 03:49:12.360]  The pollinators are in collapse right now.
[03:49:12.360 --> 03:49:14.000]  Ocean life is in collapse.
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:18.683]  You know, even the human cities are collapsing in many cases when they're run by liberals.
[03:49:18.683 --> 03:49:27.528]  As they collapse the surface of the Earth, the globalists will tend to move into their bunkers and their caves for long-term survival as the whole system collapses around them.
[03:49:28.109 --> 03:49:35.091]  We're talking about the collapse of nations, the collapse of governments, collapse of economies, banking, currency systems.
[03:49:35.091 --> 03:49:36.932]  Yeah, this is their plan.
[03:49:36.932 --> 03:49:37.952]  It's kind of a reboot.
[03:49:37.952 --> 03:49:43.974]  It's a planetary-scale reboot because they don't want what they call useless eaters to be around.
[03:49:43.974 --> 03:49:45.894]  That's how they consider you and me.
[03:49:45.894 --> 03:49:47.955]  They call us useless eaters.
[03:49:47.955 --> 03:49:54.237]  In their minds, the globalist minds, we have nothing to offer the world and we're just consuming, you know, their resources.
[03:49:54.237 --> 03:49:56.298]  So this is how they plan to do it.
[03:49:56.298 --> 03:49:57.718]  It's now incredibly obvious.
[03:49:59.119 --> 03:50:03.520]  So, the thing is, some humans will survive this.
[03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:07.902]  Some people will make it through, even living, you know, on the surface of the earth.
[03:50:07.902 --> 03:50:13.844]  Even if you don't have a 10-year bunker cave funded by the federal government, you can still make it through.
[03:50:13.844 --> 03:50:18.565]  And it all comes down to your preparedness level and also your location.
[03:50:18.565 --> 03:50:21.066]  So let's talk about location here for a second.
[03:50:21.952 --> 03:50:25.155]  I recently returned from a conference in Branson, Missouri.
[03:50:25.155 --> 03:50:32.021]  And by the way, thank you many of you who came up to say hello and to say that you're fans of InfoWars and so on.
[03:50:32.021 --> 03:50:39.068]  I think I shook the hands of at least 250, maybe 300 people during just the breaks at that conference.
[03:50:39.068 --> 03:50:47.815]  One of the things I got to do was talk behind the scenes with high-level government people who are patriots inside the government.
[03:50:47.815 --> 03:50:48.336]  We're talking like
[03:50:49.093 --> 03:50:55.698]  Alex Jones fans working inside high levels of different federal agencies, including DHS and others.
[03:50:55.698 --> 03:51:00.042]  And these people, what they told me was really interesting.
[03:51:00.042 --> 03:51:13.072]  They told me that number one, they're all convinced that Trump is going to win re-election in 2020, but they're also convinced that it's over for America by the end of Trump's second term.
[03:51:13.072 --> 03:51:13.913]  So really what they're saying is 2025,
[03:51:15.783 --> 03:51:18.304]  America is over as we know it.
[03:51:18.304 --> 03:51:20.684]  And I've had the same analysis and prediction.
[03:51:20.684 --> 03:51:21.844]  Same conclusion.
[03:51:21.844 --> 03:51:30.767]  Because what these people told me is that they were deployed in California, Oregon, Washington against Antifa and left-wing lunatics.
[03:51:30.767 --> 03:51:34.047]  They've been deployed at the border to try to protect ICE facilities and so on.
[03:51:34.047 --> 03:51:39.909]  And they see that the radical left is so far gone that there is no coming together again as a nation.
[03:51:39.909 --> 03:51:40.649]  If Trump wins,
[03:51:41.508 --> 03:51:51.274]  In 2020, the left is going to break away in certain ways or try to cause so much chaos that they destroy the whole country, they bring everything down with them.
[03:51:51.274 --> 03:51:55.657]  America as we know it will not exist past 2025.
[03:51:55.657 --> 03:51:57.138]  That's what I'm being told.
[03:51:57.138 --> 03:51:58.919]  And I think that's accurate.
[03:51:58.919 --> 03:52:10.227]  And I think that in this time of turmoil, when you have political turmoil combined with this geoengineering and chemtrails and mass poisoning of the food supply and the cultural pushing of transgenderism and all these poisons in the food,
[03:52:11.044 --> 03:52:13.085]  And vaccines.
[03:52:13.085 --> 03:52:13.245]  5G.
[03:52:13.245 --> 03:52:14.926]  You know, the list goes on.
[03:52:14.926 --> 03:52:18.288]  This is going to be a time of incredible collapse.
[03:52:18.288 --> 03:52:20.669]  A very risky time for America.
[03:52:20.669 --> 03:52:22.430]  A very risky time to be alive.
[03:52:22.430 --> 03:52:27.473]  But the second biggest factor that I was told really matters is where you are.
[03:52:27.473 --> 03:52:32.015]  Because the hot spots of all of this are going to be very localized.
[03:52:32.015 --> 03:52:38.759]  If you are anywhere near Sacramento, California, or Los Angeles, or Portland, you're in trouble because of what's coming.
[03:52:39.378 --> 03:52:48.005]  But if you're out in the middle of Utah, let's say, or Tennessee, or Montana, it's not such a big deal.
[03:52:48.005 --> 03:52:49.827]  This point was really driven home to me.
[03:52:49.827 --> 03:53:02.818]  Based on the analysis of these federal agents and some special ops people, and just real high-level people, but very dedicated patriots, they said they know, this is what all the models that they've been taught, this is what it tells them, that
[03:53:03.946 --> 03:53:10.211]  America's, the quote, civil war is only going to be very, very localized.
[03:53:10.211 --> 03:53:12.193]  Not even regional, but local.
[03:53:12.193 --> 03:53:13.273]  That's what they said.
[03:53:13.273 --> 03:53:18.297]  Certain cities, just certain areas around those cities, certain counties, that's it.
[03:53:18.297 --> 03:53:23.041]  Most of America is not going to be in a kinetic engagement.
[03:53:23.041 --> 03:53:25.403]  But what will affect all of America will
[03:53:26.311 --> 03:53:28.112]  Six problems.
[03:53:28.112 --> 03:53:29.553]  How do you get your food?
[03:53:29.553 --> 03:53:35.095]  Getting trucks to the grocery stores, getting fuel supplies, refineries functioning.
[03:53:35.095 --> 03:53:38.077]  You know, we saw an attack on the refineries in Saudi Arabia recently.
[03:53:38.077 --> 03:53:47.902]  That could easily happen in America if some radical leftists want to shut down fossil fuels and they start flying, you know, explosive laden drones into refineries in Texas or something.
[03:53:47.902 --> 03:53:49.823]  The fuel supplies could be cut off.
[03:53:49.823 --> 03:53:52.504]  Power grid could be shut down in certain scenarios.
[03:53:52.504 --> 03:53:54.205]  Food supplies could be cut off.
[03:53:54.205 --> 03:53:54.325]  So,
[03:53:55.501 --> 03:54:17.077]  Those of us who live in middle America, even if you're not in one of these lunatic left-wing cities, yeah, you're probably not going to have to kinetically engage a zombie apocalypse, but you are going to have to survive a year or more without potentially food, fuel, medicine, electricity, all the supplies that you depend on every day.
[03:54:17.077 --> 03:54:21.681]  So I want you to really think carefully about where you are.
[03:54:21.681 --> 03:54:23.142]  Do you need to relocate?
[03:54:23.775 --> 03:54:31.778]  Before 2025, or even it could be sooner depending on what happens in the 2020 election, how insane the left becomes.
[03:54:31.778 --> 03:54:36.259]  What supplies do you really need and do you know how to use those supplies?
[03:54:36.259 --> 03:54:39.140]  Have you tried cooking your stored food?
[03:54:39.140 --> 03:54:41.901]  You know, have you boiled water on a camp stove?
[03:54:41.901 --> 03:54:43.742]  Have you even tasted your stored food?
[03:54:44.383 --> 03:54:47.045]  Because a lot of it doesn't taste that great, depending on where you got it.
[03:54:47.045 --> 03:54:48.627]  So check it all out.
[03:54:48.627 --> 03:54:50.068]  Use what you have.
[03:54:50.068 --> 03:54:51.209]  Learn the skills.
[03:54:51.209 --> 03:54:55.333]  Because this right here, your brain, is what's going to save your life during all of this.
[03:54:55.333 --> 03:54:58.075]  And by the way, again, I was told it's over for America.
[03:54:58.075 --> 03:55:00.858]  I wish that wasn't the case.
[03:55:00.858 --> 03:55:01.858]  I'm not hoping for that.
[03:55:01.858 --> 03:55:03.640]  I love America.
[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:05.902]  I want to see America great again.
[03:55:05.902 --> 03:55:08.184]  I want to see Trump succeed.
[03:55:08.184 --> 03:55:11.487]  As long as he's pro-America and pro-Constitution, pro-Republic.
[03:55:12.096 --> 03:55:13.557]  A pro-First Amendment, a second amendment.
[03:55:13.557 --> 03:55:15.259]  I want to see America come back strong.
[03:55:15.259 --> 03:55:19.663]  But what I'm being told is that it's over for America as we know it.
[03:55:19.663 --> 03:55:23.967]  There's no coming back from the lawlessness of the left.
[03:55:23.967 --> 03:55:27.630]  The lunacy, the mass mental illness that they have thrust upon this world.
[03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:33.055]  I mean, look, the New York Times is just basically a fiction rag at this point with their attacks on Kavanaugh.
[03:55:33.055 --> 03:55:34.576]  CNN is a total joke.
[03:55:34.576 --> 03:55:38.019]  You have to have a lobotomy just to be able to watch CNN these days.
[03:55:38.019 --> 03:55:38.640]  It's so bad.
[03:55:39.372 --> 03:55:44.276]  You know, this is crucial for you to understand, for all of us to understand.
[03:55:44.276 --> 03:55:48.320]  America as we know it may be over in the next few years.
[03:55:48.320 --> 03:55:50.742]  So what comes out of that?
[03:55:50.742 --> 03:55:55.747]  I say that we, the people, you and me, and those of us who believe in
[03:55:56.565 --> 03:56:02.129]  Liberty and we believe in divinity and we believe in human rights and civil liberties.
[03:56:02.129 --> 03:56:12.457]  The right to speak, the right to practice religion, the right to worship, the right to carry and keep and bear arms, the right to own any firearm you want.
[03:56:12.457 --> 03:56:21.544]  These rights must be enshrined in the next society that we rebuild after the planned engineered collapse of this society.
[03:56:21.544 --> 03:56:23.486]  And by the way, let me remind you
[03:56:24.139 --> 03:56:40.712]  We must enshrine health freedom, medical freedom in the next society's documents because we cannot tolerate government medical kidnapping children, imprisoning parents because they won't poison their children with chemotherapy or vaccines.
[03:56:40.712 --> 03:56:41.473]  That has got to stop.
[03:56:42.051 --> 03:56:46.534]  We've got to have, you know, maybe a third amendment that's health freedom.
[03:56:46.534 --> 03:56:50.396]  Like, move the current third amendment about quartering soldiers in your house.
[03:56:50.396 --> 03:56:52.097]  Like, kick that on down the line.
[03:56:52.097 --> 03:56:53.878]  Keep it, but make it a later amendment.
[03:56:53.878 --> 03:56:57.721]  Insert a new third amendment that no one shall be forced
[03:56:58.487 --> 03:57:03.571]  To engage in medicine against their beliefs or wishes for themselves or their children.
[03:57:03.571 --> 03:57:05.232]  That's what we need, in my opinion.
[03:57:05.232 --> 03:57:06.873]  That's something we have to keep in mind.
[03:57:06.873 --> 03:57:09.795]  It was kind of missing from the original Bill of Rights.
[03:57:09.795 --> 03:57:21.384]  Interestingly, Benjamin Rush tried to put it in there, but I guess not enough people thought that was important at the time, because no one could imagine medical kidnapping of children by government, which is what's happening today.
[03:57:21.384 --> 03:57:22.585]  So these are some things to keep in mind.
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:25.163]  Of course, keep watching InfoWars.com.
[03:57:25.163 --> 03:57:27.286]  I'll keep covering this as best I can as well.
[03:57:27.286 --> 03:57:29.670]  I'll keep contributing to InfoWars.
[03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:30.892]  Get prepared.
[03:57:30.892 --> 03:57:32.755]  Stay informed.
[03:57:32.755 --> 03:57:35.259]  And relocate if you have to, because it's coming.
[03:57:35.259 --> 03:57:37.242]  And there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[03:57:37.242 --> 03:57:37.903]  Thank you for watching.
