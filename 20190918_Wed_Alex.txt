[00:00.000 --> 00:09.120]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report.
[00:09.120 --> 00:13.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:13.840 --> 00:33.120]  Now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33.120 --> 00:39.840]  I talk about this all the time, but the quick thing is here and humanity is at a crossroads
[00:39.840 --> 00:42.600]  deciding which way is going to go.
[00:42.600 --> 00:48.280]  There are so many amazing developments taking place that it makes my head spin, but as I
[00:48.280 --> 00:56.040]  sit here in California before the suns even come up, it's a metaphor for a new day.
[00:56.040 --> 01:03.200]  I talk so much yesterday that my tongue is literally raw on one side and sore.
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.600]  I did a five hour podcast with a gentleman who right now is the number one podcaster
[01:09.600 --> 01:10.600]  in the world.
[01:10.600 --> 01:15.120]  Joe wrote his number one overall, the body was great work, but this fellow right now
[01:15.120 --> 01:16.120]  is the number one podcast.
[01:16.120 --> 01:20.240]  So I've been doing it about two weeks and I'm going to even say who we did the podcast
[01:20.240 --> 01:27.320]  with until right before it airs, but it's very explosive, very positive, very negative,
[01:27.320 --> 01:28.320]  very argumentative.
[01:28.320 --> 01:35.000]  The fellow is very, very smart, but he was trying to get me to turn against Trump.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.560]  I've been persecuted so much for Trump, and for telling the truth, that's why it's hard
[01:40.560 --> 01:44.640]  to even be critical of Trump when he deserves it, because when you've been pig, had it defended
[01:44.640 --> 01:54.000]  somebody for so long and been persecuted, it's hard to turn on him, but I'm not close
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.120]  to turning on Trump.
[01:56.120 --> 02:01.000]  Trump has done a great job on so many fronts, but what happens is when you get around people
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.360]  in Hollywood or in business or anywhere, they get on your ass and they say, listen, I really
[02:06.360 --> 02:12.160]  like you, but you need to turn against Trump right now, or I'm not going to be your friend.
[02:12.160 --> 02:18.800]  Well, don't be my friend then, because the BS to Trump is a white supremacist, no matter
[02:18.800 --> 02:20.760]  how many times you say it is true.
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.560]  The BS to Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist, no matter how many times you say it's not true.
[02:25.560 --> 02:31.480]  The BS that I'm making stuff up to hurt people isn't true no matter how many times you say
[02:31.480 --> 02:38.240]  it, and all this bullying and intimidation isn't working anymore, but I see why some
[02:38.240 --> 02:44.160]  people succumb to it, but then after you start talking to them behind the scenes, they go,
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.960]  yeah, I know you're right, and that's happening all over LA.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.160]  We're super popular here.
[02:51.160 --> 02:56.480]  Even though you're in the midst of all the brainwashing and inside this big ass bubble
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.480]  of disinformation.
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.280]  So we got Tom Papert, host of the show today, he does a great job, yesterday's broadcast
[03:03.280 --> 03:09.920]  with Alan Schreuer, and the reports we had, I ended up watching about an hour of it last
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.760]  night, I watched about an hour of it this morning, just top flight radio TV, there's
[03:15.760 --> 03:17.960]  nothing more informative.
[03:17.960 --> 03:28.120]  Today's Tuesday show is the benchmark of quality information that's pro-human for a pro-human
[03:28.120 --> 03:29.620]  future.
[03:29.620 --> 03:32.920]  The globalists have decided that they're going to replace humans.
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.280]  It's the final revolution, nobody can ever resist you, used in the entire paradigm as
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.280]  it's known.
[03:38.280 --> 03:42.840]  We are standing against that saying we're not just getting scept, your destiny you laid
[03:42.840 --> 03:50.400]  out for us, and that's what in FullWars.com and NewsWars.com and band.video are all about.
[03:50.400 --> 03:54.120]  And that's why the power again that you have to take action and override their censorship
[03:54.120 --> 03:59.200]  is beyond paramount, it's total, it's complete, it is victory.
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.200]  Resistance and action is victory when you have the right motivation and the right ideology.
[04:04.200 --> 04:08.480]  And this is a pro-human ideology in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[04:08.480 --> 04:13.320]  Now we've got a bunch of special reports today, Tom Papert, and so much more, I'll be back
[04:13.320 --> 04:19.160]  in the office about one o'clock so I can pop it on air unless my tongue over here on the
[04:19.160 --> 04:23.120]  side of me, I just was yelling and ranting for almost five hours and at most of the
[04:23.120 --> 04:29.360]  show here today, so I've never had this where I've got a raw sound of my tongue, but my
[04:29.360 --> 04:32.880]  tongue doesn't swell up too much more, I'll be on air as well at the end, into the fourth
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.880]  hour.
[04:33.880 --> 04:38.880]  And regardless, thanks for all your support, Wild Horse couldn't drag us away, we love
[04:38.880 --> 04:42.640]  you, I know you love me, we're all in this together, you can feel victory, it's gonna
[04:42.640 --> 04:48.600]  be a rough future coming up, but we are on a trajectory, on a trajectory to win, so I'll
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.560]  see you in the future.
[04:51.560 --> 04:57.000]  That was Alex Jones, I'm Tom Papert filling in for Alex today, we'll be back right after
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  this break.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.400]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third bestseller, we had to just
[05:03.400 --> 05:08.440]  continue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it, that new formula
[05:08.440 --> 05:14.440]  is Ultra 12, it's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there, it's
[05:14.440 --> 05:19.800]  got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things, supports
[05:19.800 --> 05:24.040]  healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[05:24.040 --> 05:27.800]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[05:27.800 --> 05:28.800]  and on.
[05:28.800 --> 05:32.800]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.520]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count,
[05:36.520 --> 05:41.760]  bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12, it helps something in full war, so it's a 360 win and
[05:41.760 --> 05:48.240]  it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com, again we can only run the special for the
[05:48.240 --> 05:54.200]  next two weeks or so while supplies last, Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price,
[05:54.200 --> 06:07.880]  50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[06:07.880 --> 06:17.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:17.560 --> 06:23.000]  Welcome everyone to the Alex Jones show, I am Tom Papert filling in for Alex as he gets
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.600]  back from this very important trip to California, he'll be back in studio hopefully later this
[06:28.600 --> 06:31.760]  afternoon around 1pm.
[06:31.760 --> 06:40.120]  Today is an absolutely insane news day as Democratic mega donor Ed Buck has been arrested,
[06:40.120 --> 06:47.000]  a third man died at his home, police say that he is directly responsible, Ed Buck, what
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.480]  he reportedly allegedly likes to do is shove crystal meth into his victims and feed off
[06:54.480 --> 06:59.120]  their energy, one of the alleged victims actually went public in the media saying that, it's
[06:59.120 --> 07:04.680]  another episode of Alex Jones was right again, there's big things happening in the Middle
[07:04.680 --> 07:08.840]  East today as well, we're gonna have a guest on in the second hour, Patrick Howley of National
[07:08.840 --> 07:16.520]  File in the Epic Times, Israel is not a good place to be right now, everybody knows there
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.600]  are issues with Benjamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister, everybody knows there are
[07:20.600 --> 07:25.360]  certain issues with Israel, nobody understands the foreign aid this country gives to any
[07:25.360 --> 07:30.000]  of these Middle Eastern countries, any country in the world, I'm personally an isolationist,
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.960]  I'll come out and say it, America first, but what's happening in Israel right now could
[07:34.960 --> 07:40.640]  very well launch the United States into yet another geopolitical conflict in the Middle
[07:40.640 --> 07:42.640]  East, nobody is looking forward to that.
[07:42.640 --> 07:47.520]  The fake news is talking about Elizabeth Warren saying she's the new front runner, they're
[07:47.520 --> 07:52.640]  saying 20,000 people go to her rallies now, for some reason I just don't believe it, there's
[07:52.640 --> 07:58.560]  a new pandemic threat that could devastate the world population, there's abortion news,
[07:58.560 --> 08:03.640]  we're actually at the lowest number of abortions in this country in many, many years, and as
[08:03.640 --> 08:09.640]  Info Wars has reported for decades now, your TV is listening to you, your Alexa is listening
[08:09.640 --> 08:14.400]  to you, and now your smart faucet is listening to you.
[08:14.400 --> 08:22.200]  Let's start by talking about Ed Buck, again he was just arrested, police say that he has
[08:22.200 --> 08:32.340]  killed now three people, let's go ahead and air this video from LA.
[08:32.340 --> 08:36.040]  Lou and Cher, good evening to you, this is still a very active investigation, the crime
[08:36.040 --> 08:40.520]  scene tape is up, the street is blocked off and detectives are currently inside the home
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.440]  of prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck, who has been at the center of controversy following
[08:45.440 --> 08:52.120]  the suspicious deaths of two gay men inside his apartment in the span of just 18 months.
[08:52.120 --> 08:55.800]  Let's get you right to some of this video of the arrest just a short time ago, here
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.960]  you can see Buck taken away in handcuffs, charged with operating a drug den out of his
[09:00.960 --> 09:07.000]  West Hollywood home and providing methamphetamine, the latest victim, a 37-year-old man who
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.360]  overdosed inside Buck's apartment last week but survived.
[09:11.360 --> 09:15.600]  In court filings, the district attorney says Buck injected his victim with methamphetamine
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.760]  on September 11th, neighbors say they've been suspicious for years.
[09:20.760 --> 09:25.920]  Other men were not so lucky, last January 55-year-old Timothy Dean was found dead inside
[09:25.920 --> 09:30.320]  Buck's apartment located here on the 1200 block of North Laurel Avenue, the coroner
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.040]  saying he died of a methamphetamine in alcohol toxicity.
[09:34.040 --> 09:38.040]  He was the second man to die inside the home in less than two years.
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.400]  In July 2017, 26-year-old Jamel Moore was found dead.
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.320]  Officials say he died of a methamphetamine overdose, his death was ruled an accident
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.600]  and no charges were filed.
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.920]  Those close to Moore say he was working as a sex worker at the time he visited Buck's
[09:52.920 --> 09:54.240]  apartment.
[09:54.240 --> 09:59.040]  Another man who asked to remain anonymous previously told KTLA that Buck would instruct
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.000]  his male escorts to use high levels of drugs so he could watch their reactions.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.880]  Buck, who was openly gay, was home at the time both men died.
[10:08.880 --> 10:14.840]  Advocates for the victims as well as neighbors say his arrest is a long time coming.
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.160]  This is one of those instances, and I think we can go ahead and end that video now.
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.840]  This is one of those instances where you just sit there and wonder how many people have
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.080]  to wind up dead before police get involved.
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.800]  I guess the number is two, almost three that we know of.
[10:30.800 --> 10:39.000]  So according to prosecutors, Ed Buck, a prominent Democrat donor, big Hillary guy, is a violent,
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.880]  dangerous sexual predator.
[10:41.880 --> 10:43.240]  He prays on his victims.
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.760]  This is allegedly what he likes to do.
[10:44.760 --> 10:47.320]  Some of the victims have come forward to say this.
[10:47.320 --> 10:49.680]  He gets a young black man.
[10:49.680 --> 10:50.680]  He prefers them young.
[10:50.680 --> 10:55.480]  In fact, the one of the men who died reportedly was a former victim who showed up at his
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.240]  house, and Ed Buck reportedly killed.
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.520]  But what he likes to do is he gets these young black men.
[11:01.520 --> 11:06.440]  He brings them to his apartment to what the police are now calling a drug den.
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.320]  He allegedly shoots them up with drugs, methamphetamine, and he watches their reaction.
[11:11.320 --> 11:18.480]  He feeds off their energy according to one of the alleged victim.
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.080]  The man's name who says this, and this is what Infowars has been telling you for years.
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.240]  According to the Daily Mail, Jemaine Gagnon claims Buck paid to fly him from Minnesota
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.360]  to his apartment in Los Angeles drugged him by dissolving a substance into his Gatorade
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.640]  and then injected him with drugs.
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.680]  A 28-year-old provided pictures which show Buck crouching over him in a mattress pullout
[11:41.680 --> 11:44.120]  bed during one of their nights together.
[11:44.120 --> 11:49.360]  And a toolbox of sex toys which he pulled out during their encounter.
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.120]  This man donates to Hillary Clinton, this man donates to top Democrats.
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.640]  Now we, of course, have seen his arrest, but what I really want to get to is the quote
[11:59.640 --> 12:03.160]  by this poor individual who says that he is one of the victims, and the photos would seem
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.520]  to suggest there might be some truth to it.
[12:05.520 --> 12:11.080]  Gagnon says he was homeless and couch-surfing in April of 2018 when he met Buck on a gay
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.440]  dating site, Adam for Adam, and was offered $200 to spend the evening with him at his
[12:16.440 --> 12:18.200]  West Hollywood apartment.
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.360]  He said, I'd done sex for money many other times, but I don't make it a habit.
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.560]  The first day we met, I met him at his house, there's a gate at the main entrance, and he
[12:27.560 --> 12:28.560]  buzzed me up.
[12:28.560 --> 12:29.560]  He's on the second floor.
[12:29.560 --> 12:33.360]  When I walked in, it was dim lights, a mattress in the middle of the floor, three mirrors
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.760]  surrounding the mattress, and a flat-screen TV mounted on a wall.
[12:37.760 --> 12:39.640]  It was just kind of weird.
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.960]  He admitted, explaining to the 63-year-old, enjoy dressing him up and treating him like
[12:44.960 --> 12:47.680]  a sex slave.
[12:47.680 --> 12:55.800]  He said that Buck was open about enjoying men who are young, black, handsome, and well-endowed.
[12:55.800 --> 13:00.480]  He was quite open about being very generous to the black community.
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.080]  He went on, I'm his type, and pretty much half the black community is his type, vulnerable,
[13:05.080 --> 13:06.080]  depressed.
[13:06.080 --> 13:12.480]  If you're in a depressive state, that's the energy that feeds him.
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.200]  I first came across this article when it was fresh, and now that the man's been arrested,
[13:17.200 --> 13:20.320]  it just really makes you wonder what is going on in this country at the high levels, the
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.600]  stuff that we will likely never know, because all of these headlines are ripped from the
[13:25.600 --> 13:26.960]  Alex Jones show.
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.320]  Alex has been saying this for years, that these Democrat elites, these globalist elites,
[13:31.320 --> 13:33.960]  they feed off the energy of people.
[13:33.960 --> 13:39.920]  They will kill you for sport, and watch your soul leave your body for fun.
[13:39.920 --> 13:45.600]  Now we have a victim, a alleged victim, who says that Ed Buck literally feeds off of his
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.560]  energy while he drugs people to death, and this latest man, it sounds like it was a brush
[13:50.560 --> 13:56.320]  with death as he fled the apartment fearing he was having a methamphetamine overdose.
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.400]  So we're going to have Patrick Halley on in the next hour to talk about how this plays
[14:01.400 --> 14:07.640]  into what goes on with the nexium sex cult, to what happened with Jeffrey Epstein, all
[14:07.640 --> 14:13.760]  of these interrelated circles that all work together to create the globalist paradigm.
[14:13.760 --> 14:19.640]  It's going to be a fascinating interview, but we're going to follow this story closely
[14:19.640 --> 14:22.920]  as well, because this is a long time coming.
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.760]  Black activists are rightfully celebrating this.
[14:25.760 --> 14:33.080]  There was a massive rally protest outside of Buck's apartment late last night, as again
[14:33.080 --> 14:38.520]  the third man has been found to have had an overdose at Ed Buck's home.
[14:38.520 --> 14:42.000]  So in the next segment, we're going to get into exactly what's happening in the Middle
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.320]  East right now, because it is an absolutely shocking thing to see.
[14:46.320 --> 14:52.000]  And I don't like these foreign entanglements that the United States has found itself in.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.800]  But for better or worse, the last, oh, I don't know, 20 presidents have got us into this
[14:57.800 --> 14:59.120]  mess.
[14:59.120 --> 15:06.120]  And now we could easily see these foreign entanglements get us into a new world war.
[15:06.120 --> 15:10.640]  Netanyahu's opponent, who it seems like he may have lost.
[15:10.640 --> 15:13.160]  This guy could be the next Prime Minister.
[15:13.160 --> 15:20.440]  National File, my website, can report that he is potentially vulnerable to blackmail
[15:20.440 --> 15:21.440]  by Iran.
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.280]  And they say that the Israeli deep state wanted him in this position.
[15:26.280 --> 15:31.160]  He doesn't bode well or in peace in the Middle East.
[15:31.160 --> 15:34.240]  We'll talk more about that in the next segment.
[15:34.240 --> 15:36.040]  You're watching the Alex Jones show.
[15:36.040 --> 15:38.800]  I'm Tom Pappert, filling in for Alex.
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.240]  Keep an eye out for that very important podcast.
[15:41.240 --> 15:45.360]  It's going to drop in the next couple of weeks, it sounds like, and I am extremely excited
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.360]  to watch it.
[15:46.360 --> 15:47.880]  You're watching the Alex Jones show.
[15:47.880 --> 15:49.240]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[15:49.240 --> 15:51.880]  Patrick Howley coming up in the next hour.
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.680]  Make sure to stay tuned for that here on Infowars.
[15:55.680 --> 15:59.160]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.080]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.080 --> 16:04.640]  I sued the IRS and won.
[16:04.640 --> 16:07.600]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.600 --> 16:10.880]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.120]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.120 --> 16:14.440]  I can help you, too.
[16:14.440 --> 16:17.480]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[16:37.120 --> 16:38.880]  important message you'll ever hear.

[16:42.800 --> 16:47.400]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:47.400 --> 16:48.400]  off the grid.
[16:48.400 --> 16:52.280]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[16:52.280 --> 16:53.800]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:53.800 --> 16:57.760]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[16:57.760 --> 17:01.400]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.720]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:05.720 --> 17:11.400]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[17:36.720 --> 17:38.440]  slingbow.com.
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.200]  Sling bow products are compact and models start from just 1798.

[17:59.200 --> 18:02.880]  There are a few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.520]  you the products that in FullWarsLife.com are.
[18:06.520 --> 18:14.120]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[18:14.120 --> 18:19.080]  that God gave us to Mother Nature and then we make it even stronger, even better and
[18:19.080 --> 18:20.080]  lower the price.
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.680]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.960]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[18:26.960 --> 18:28.880]  It sells itself.
[18:28.880 --> 18:29.880]  Back.
[18:29.880 --> 18:36.320]  Normal turmeric only has three to five percent curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in
[18:36.320 --> 18:37.320]  the plant.
[18:37.320 --> 18:39.280]  Originally, obviously from India.
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.880]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other
[18:45.880 --> 18:50.520]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it and that's why people absolutely
[18:50.520 --> 18:51.520]  love it.
[18:51.520 --> 18:59.400]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at FullWarsLife.com.
[18:59.400 --> 19:02.320]  We have entered a great time of change.
[19:02.320 --> 19:07.920]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that
[19:07.920 --> 19:13.960]  if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.600]  accepting a tyrannical corporate world government known as a technocracy in their own words
[19:18.600 --> 19:23.400]  that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[19:23.400 --> 19:27.120]  At first, they can do just a few basic things to do.
[19:27.120 --> 19:28.120]  Don't support Trump.
[19:28.120 --> 19:29.760]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.400]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father and, well, let
[19:33.400 --> 19:35.200]  us sterilize your children.
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.840]  Take these forced inoculations and here, take this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized
[19:39.840 --> 19:40.840]  marijuana.
[19:40.840 --> 19:43.720]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[19:43.720 --> 19:47.440]  This is truly the market of the beast system and we're on air right now covering it and
[19:47.440 --> 19:48.440]  you're awake.
[19:48.440 --> 19:49.440]  You're involved.
[19:49.440 --> 19:50.440]  You're engaged.
[19:50.440 --> 19:51.440]  You're an ambassador of truth.
[19:51.440 --> 19:55.040]  So I'm begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family spread the word
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.040]  about it.
[19:56.040 --> 19:57.040]  FullWars.com.
[19:57.040 --> 20:01.960]  The live shows right now.
[20:01.960 --> 20:23.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war.
[20:23.840 --> 20:33.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.280 --> 20:35.840]  I'm Tom Pampered filling in for Alex's again.
[20:35.840 --> 20:37.920]  He's on a very important podcast.
[20:37.920 --> 20:41.800]  I'm very much looking forward to seeing that before we get into what's happening in the
[20:41.800 --> 20:42.800]  Middle East.
[20:42.800 --> 20:46.960]  I just want to take a second and stress how important it is to support this broadcast
[20:46.960 --> 20:49.200]  and all of info wars.
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.120]  Think about everything this network has done.
[20:51.120 --> 20:54.720]  It's such an honor to be sitting in this chair in this studio.
[20:54.720 --> 21:00.240]  This is the network that largely secured President Trump's presidency.
[21:00.240 --> 21:05.680]  This is the network that has kept this country out of more foreign military conflicts over
[21:05.680 --> 21:06.960]  the last few years.
[21:06.960 --> 21:12.520]  This is, I would say, the number one conservative libertarian network that is in existence and
[21:12.520 --> 21:15.920]  they're expanding every single day with your support.
[21:15.920 --> 21:18.920]  So right now, these are some of the best deals I've ever seen.
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.360]  I'd have no idea how Alex makes the profit doing this, I'll be completely honest, because
[21:22.360 --> 21:31.000]  right now you can get up to 75% off dozens of products at infowarstore.com, 75% off total
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.040]  gut health combo pack with seven powerful formulas, 50% off super male vitality and
[21:37.040 --> 21:44.560]  it comes with a free bottle of ultimate female force, 63% off the best-selling Myco ZX plus
[21:44.560 --> 21:50.640]  fungus and yeast support, 50% off ultra 12 vitamin B12, I'm a big fan of ultra 12 vitamin
[21:50.640 --> 21:51.640]  B12.
[21:51.640 --> 21:55.520]  The hardest part about traveling is doing without the majority of these and then 60%
[21:55.520 --> 22:00.360]  off super blue silver immune gargle and I've actually got mine with me here.
[22:00.360 --> 22:03.640]  I refuse to travel without this stuff.
[22:03.640 --> 22:05.080]  It's an absolute lifesaver.
[22:05.080 --> 22:08.720]  I don't know about the folks at home, but whenever I travel, whenever I'm in an airplane
[22:08.720 --> 22:12.200]  for four or six hours, you always get something in your throat.
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.760]  You always get an upper respiratory something and this seems to do the trick at finding
[22:16.760 --> 22:17.760]  that.
[22:17.760 --> 22:22.900]  You can also get 50% off bodies, many, many other fantastic deals.
[22:22.900 --> 22:27.560]  Now is the time to take advantage of these great prices.
[22:27.560 --> 22:30.120]  Many products are already beginning to sell out.
[22:30.120 --> 22:37.720]  This is your opportunity to support the infowar, infowarstore.com.
[22:37.720 --> 22:41.520]  So let's talk about the globalist big dream.
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.640]  We got rid of John Bolton.
[22:43.640 --> 22:44.640]  Everybody celebrated.
[22:44.640 --> 22:45.800]  It seemed like it was going to be great.
[22:45.800 --> 22:49.440]  I always wonder, is this the revenge of Bolton?
[22:49.440 --> 22:56.520]  Because now Israel, which America financially supports and gives weapons to, they're going
[22:56.520 --> 23:03.720]  to have a man who is essentially far left wing on everything but military where he is
[23:03.720 --> 23:05.000]  a warhawk.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.440]  He could be the next prime minister and if he is not the next prime minister, then there
[23:09.440 --> 23:17.120]  will be a king maker who will force Netanyahu back into attacking Hamas.
[23:17.120 --> 23:23.920]  And this all comes up after National File broke an exclusive story, nationalfile.com.
[23:23.920 --> 23:29.960]  Netanyahu opponent could be blackmailed by Iran and the Iranian deep state is covering
[23:29.960 --> 23:31.160]  it up.
[23:31.160 --> 23:33.520]  They have their candidates.
[23:33.520 --> 23:36.960]  Two sources told the National File, the parts of the Israeli government, what some would
[23:36.960 --> 23:42.640]  consider the Israeli deep state are hiding compromising material that could allow Prime
[23:42.640 --> 23:48.840]  Minister Bebe Netanyahu's political opponent, Lieutenant General Benny Gantz, to be blackmailed
[23:48.840 --> 23:49.840]  by Iran.
[23:49.840 --> 23:52.960]  You see, Gantz has too many powerful people.
[23:52.960 --> 23:58.960]  He has a vice and that vice is apparently, allegedly, according to two sources who came
[23:58.960 --> 24:03.720]  to National File independently, that vice is women.
[24:03.720 --> 24:05.840]  He has a mistress.
[24:05.840 --> 24:11.880]  You've certainly heard of this before, Bill Clinton, President Trump, but generally not
[24:11.880 --> 24:14.320]  a good idea to do that when you're running for political office.
[24:14.320 --> 24:20.320]  So earlier this year, it was widely reported that Iran had hacked Gantz's email.
[24:20.320 --> 24:28.440]  What was not widely reported is that they gained compromising intel about his mistress.
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.720]  And what definitely has not been widely reported is that the Israeli deep state, the Israeli
[24:32.720 --> 24:39.680]  army, the IDF, well, it has a division called the Censorship Division.
[24:39.680 --> 24:45.760]  And they decide what flies, what goes out in the public forum within Israel.
[24:45.760 --> 24:50.360]  And so while this story is out there, multiple Israeli media outlets wanted to report this
[24:50.360 --> 24:56.920]  prior to yesterday's election, none were allowed to do so.
[24:56.920 --> 25:02.440]  And so now we have this deadlocked election where Netanyahu is not going to be able to
[25:02.440 --> 25:04.680]  secure a majority.
[25:04.680 --> 25:07.800]  Gantz won't be able to either, but there's going to be a kingmaker who wants nothing
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.400]  more than endless war.
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.560]  And as we all know, when there's war in the Middle East, somehow the United States always
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.040]  has to get involved.
[25:20.040 --> 25:25.760]  The Censorship Division decided that this would pose a national security risk to Israel
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.680]  if it were public that the next prime minister might be blackmailed by Iran.
[25:30.680 --> 25:33.960]  Because they're not some sort of comedic value to that.
[25:33.960 --> 25:37.440]  And now we have Iran.
[25:37.440 --> 25:43.600]  There's a kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman, who wants to make sure that Israel goes back to
[25:43.600 --> 25:45.100]  war.
[25:45.100 --> 25:47.080]  Isn't that phenomenal?
[25:47.080 --> 25:52.120]  And again, I bring this up not to defend Israel, not to say that I think we need to
[25:52.120 --> 25:55.400]  send more money and weapons and everything else to the Middle East for any reason.
[25:55.400 --> 25:57.280]  I don't want us to give foreign aid to anybody.
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.680]  Everybody should get foreign aid from the United States, America first, but I predict
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.040]  this is going to lead to further conflict in the Middle East.
[26:06.040 --> 26:09.720]  This is from End of the American Dream, also infowars.com.
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.720]  Last November, this Lieberman character resigned as Israel's defense minister when Israeli
[26:14.720 --> 26:19.560]  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to reject Lieberman's plan for a military
[26:19.560 --> 26:26.240]  operation in Gaza and instead agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas instead.
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.520]  This man quit his job because there wasn't enough war.
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.840]  My goodness, if only we could have got rid of John Bolton the same way, who did took
[26:34.840 --> 26:37.280]  him being fired.
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.120]  And now, this man is the leader of a party that will serve as the kingmaker.
[26:42.120 --> 26:45.520]  You see, neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority.
[26:45.520 --> 26:47.360]  They're both stuck in limbo.
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.680]  And this man is going to get to say, whoever will go to war, you're going to be the next
[26:51.680 --> 26:54.160]  Prime Minister.
[26:54.160 --> 26:56.540]  It's a terrible place to be.
[26:56.540 --> 27:00.760]  This is really a result of what happens when the United States allies with these powers.
[27:00.760 --> 27:04.480]  But say what you will, there are two countries in the Middle East that are really decent
[27:04.480 --> 27:09.840]  places to live, one of them the United States under Hillary and Obama, desperately trying
[27:09.840 --> 27:13.200]  to destroy, and that's of course Syria, where they're protecting Christians.
[27:13.200 --> 27:18.360]  The other is Israel, where they're at least trying to live in peace.
[27:18.360 --> 27:22.200]  Now, that may be no longer.
[27:22.200 --> 27:26.480]  This could easily erupt into a larger military conflict.
[27:26.480 --> 27:31.280]  If Iran is compromising material on Gantz, Gantz decides to attack Hamas.
[27:31.280 --> 27:33.520]  What does that say with Iran?
[27:33.520 --> 27:35.720]  What does that mean for the United States?
[27:35.720 --> 27:44.520]  And of course, the United States is already posturing itself for more war in the Middle
[27:44.520 --> 27:45.520]  East.
[27:45.520 --> 27:53.040]  Saudi Arabia says it has material evidence tying Iran to the Aramco attack.
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.360]  Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that contrary to initial estimates, Ramco should be able
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.680]  to get back up and going, but the Kingdom's Defense Ministry said it was planning a press
[28:01.680 --> 28:08.520]  conference to present material evidence, purportedly linking Tehran to the unprecedented attack
[28:08.520 --> 28:12.880]  on the Kingdom's oil infrastructure.
[28:12.880 --> 28:13.880]  This is another thing.
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.920]  And Tulsi Gabbard, not that I would ever vote Democrat in my life, but she's been pointing
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.440]  out that the United States does not exist to be Saudi Arabia's protector.
[28:22.440 --> 28:25.600]  She's a slightly more colorful language than that.
[28:25.600 --> 28:30.640]  But this is what happens when we depend on a Middle Eastern theocracy for oil.
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.280]  I think what needs to happen in this country is we need to continue pursuing energy independence
[28:35.280 --> 28:42.000]  so we can stop bowing to Saudi Arabian kings and getting involved in their conflicts.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.400]  I think that would be the best course for President Trump to continue to take.
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.120]  You're watching the Alex Jones show.
[28:47.120 --> 28:48.840]  I'm Tom Pappard filling in for Alex.
[28:48.840 --> 28:50.080]  He's on his way back.
[28:50.080 --> 28:52.080]  You might be popping in this afternoon.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.080]  Stay tuned.
[28:53.080 --> 28:58.320]  We'll be back after this break.
[28:58.320 --> 29:00.160]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.720]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[29:04.720 --> 29:05.720]  by you.
[29:05.720 --> 29:07.120]  But the symptoms are there.

[29:20.040 --> 29:21.040]  across America.

[29:23.040 --> 29:25.040]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.040 --> 29:28.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:28.600 --> 29:29.600]  healthier I feel.
[29:29.600 --> 29:32.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.240 --> 29:37.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:37.440 --> 29:39.880]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[29:59.520 --> 30:05.200]  Super silver wound gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.760]  their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[30:09.760 --> 30:12.840]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[30:12.840 --> 30:14.640]  years as been a best seller.
[30:14.640 --> 30:20.280]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[30:20.280 --> 30:25.200]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.640]  technology in it.
[30:26.640 --> 30:32.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.280]  oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[30:36.280 --> 30:41.840]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one you're
[30:41.840 --> 30:44.960]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it
[30:44.960 --> 30:49.920]  at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslife.com.
[30:49.920 --> 30:54.680]  Get your super silver skin cream today, we can only run this special for another week
[30:54.680 --> 30:58.800]  or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[30:58.800 --> 31:03.320]  I know most of you realize this but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[31:03.320 --> 31:09.040]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at infowars and we are the individuals
[31:09.040 --> 31:12.320]  that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan and we know how to
[31:12.320 --> 31:15.080]  take them down, that's why they're so upset.
[31:15.080 --> 31:19.320]  Think how far we've come together, you know even if we were losing we'd all still keep
[31:19.320 --> 31:23.880]  fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the
[31:23.880 --> 31:29.240]  New World Order who've really taken the mask off, the lines in the sand for everybody now
[31:29.240 --> 31:33.640]  but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the
[31:33.640 --> 31:34.640]  unborn.
[31:34.640 --> 31:39.000]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.760]  in the arena and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,

[31:59.080 --> 32:03.040]  Disease is a tincture that you take under the tongue, you've been selling it for over
[32:03.040 --> 32:04.040]  a year.
[32:04.040 --> 32:09.000]  It's a private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.640]  body but not be an oppressant.

[33:01.400 --> 33:15.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.280 --> 33:20.720]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[33:20.720 --> 33:25.720]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:25.720 --> 33:28.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.600 --> 33:32.000]  I am Tom Pappert filling in for Alex.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.280]  The last segment we were talking about was really going on in the Middle East.
[33:36.280 --> 33:39.880]  What's really going on with this Israeli election that you're undoubtedly hearing about from
[33:39.880 --> 33:42.160]  every major media source this morning.
[33:42.160 --> 33:47.920]  But so you know what's really happening as it was reported on nationalfile.com and infowars.com.
[33:47.920 --> 33:53.440]  Let's see what the globalist propaganda engine at AP News.
[33:53.440 --> 33:54.440]  See what they have to say.
[33:54.440 --> 33:59.920]  So we just heard, just to recap, that there is now a kingmaker party in Israel that is
[33:59.920 --> 34:03.640]  going to demand war with Hamas.
[34:03.640 --> 34:09.920]  They're going to demand essentially genocide of Palestine in all likelihood.
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.680]  But this is the absolute insanity that's being put out by AP.
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.240]  Israel's Arabs poised to gain a new voice after a tight election.
[34:20.240 --> 34:21.240]  Isn't that great?
[34:21.240 --> 34:25.280]  You've got to remember here in the United States they're saying no walls from Mexico
[34:25.280 --> 34:27.720]  to Palestine.
[34:27.720 --> 34:31.200]  No border, no walls, no USA at all.
[34:31.200 --> 34:33.920]  This is insanity what we're seeing right here.
[34:33.920 --> 34:38.480]  But this is what they want the world to believe.
[34:38.480 --> 34:47.280]  In this Tuesday photo, Israeli Arab politician Aiman Odeh cast his vote.
[34:47.280 --> 34:48.280]  Isn't that lovely?
[34:48.280 --> 34:53.440]  Israel's Arab coalition appears to be poised to emerge as the main opposition bloc following
[34:53.440 --> 35:00.640]  Tuesday's election, a historic first that would grant a new platform to a long marginalized
[35:00.640 --> 35:01.640]  minority.
[35:01.640 --> 35:04.160]  Doesn't that just sound so lovely?
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.240]  It's almost like it's not true.
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.680]  Another complete results Wednesday indicated the joint list won about a dozen seats in
[35:12.680 --> 35:16.640]  the 120 member assembly, coming third after the blue and white party of former military
[35:16.640 --> 35:21.360]  chief Benny Gantz and the right wing Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.640]  In absolute terms, the Arab bloc appears to have met or fallen short of its performance
[35:25.640 --> 35:26.880]  in 2015.
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.800]  But this time around, due to shifting constellation of Israeli politics, it would be well placed
[35:31.800 --> 35:36.800]  to lead the opposition if a national unity government of the two largest parties is formed
[35:36.800 --> 35:40.560]  as seems likely.
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.120]  This is insanity that they're reporting this as if it's some wonder.
[35:44.120 --> 35:46.560]  This could mean the death of these people.
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.360]  That is what this election actually means.
[35:48.360 --> 35:51.440]  But they report it as though it's a wonderful thing.
[35:51.440 --> 35:52.760]  It's multiculturalism.
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.800]  It's everybody's getting together in a circle and singing kumbaya.
[35:56.800 --> 36:02.900]  Meanwhile, we could have a world war erupt in the Middle East any day now.
[36:02.900 --> 36:09.040]  These guns are pointed toward Iran, we're pointing it back towards Saudi Arabia.
[36:09.040 --> 36:14.480]  And by the way, on Big Tech, this just shows the allegiance of these people.
[36:14.480 --> 36:20.800]  Facebook is still auto-generating results for the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in terms
[36:20.800 --> 36:22.240]  of pages.
[36:22.240 --> 36:24.120]  You can see they're on screen for the document cam.
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.760]  I love Islamic State.
[36:27.760 --> 36:29.400]  Isn't that insane?
[36:29.400 --> 36:34.480]  These are Big Tech overlords for you, right there.
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.280]  But this does, I mean, this again, who on earth does this?
[36:38.280 --> 36:41.920]  Pages from a confidential whistleblowers report obtained by the Associated Press.
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.040]  Who goes to the AP with your whistleblowers report along with two printed Facebook pages
[36:47.040 --> 36:52.040]  that were active on Tuesday, September 17th are photographed in Washington.
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.960]  Facebook likes to say that it's automated systems remove the vast majority of prohibited
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.400]  content glorifying the Islamic State's group and al-Qaeda before it's reported.
[37:00.400 --> 37:03.840]  But a whistleblower's complaint shows that Facebook itself has inadvertently produced
[37:03.840 --> 37:07.600]  dozens of pages in their names.
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.720]  These are the algorithms that are meant to rule our lives and make everything work.
[37:12.720 --> 37:13.720]  Isn't that lovely?
[37:13.720 --> 37:18.240]  The algorithms that were attempted to be gained for Hillary Clinton, the algorithms that are
[37:18.240 --> 37:24.680]  now being gained for the new crop of Democrats, as insane as they all might be.
[37:24.680 --> 37:28.360]  But speaking of Hillary Clinton, you know, largely what's happening in the Middle East
[37:28.360 --> 37:29.860]  is due to her policies.
[37:29.860 --> 37:33.240]  I mean, it was her and Obama who created ISIS.
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.760]  It was, of course, Hillary who destabilized much of North Africa.
[37:36.760 --> 37:42.400]  She's the reason why you, if you had the money and the inclination and the lack of morality,
[37:42.400 --> 37:46.880]  you could go to Libya today and buy a black slave.
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.400]  Eradicated slavery in the West, and Hillary Clinton brought it back in Libya.
[37:50.400 --> 37:51.400]  Isn't that nice?
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.480]  Hillary Clinton, this is an article up at infowars.com, Steve Watson.
[37:56.480 --> 38:02.960]  She is still complaining that she lost to Trump.
[38:02.960 --> 38:05.040]  When is this lady going to get over it?
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.000]  It's honestly pathetic at this point, but this article is absolutely insane.
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.320]  She has apparently been mentoring some of the Democrat candidates to run against Trump
[38:15.320 --> 38:16.520]  in 2020.
[38:16.520 --> 38:19.640]  That's sure to please all Trump supporters everywhere.
[38:19.640 --> 38:22.240]  Let's, can we roll this video?
[38:22.240 --> 38:24.160]  I'm fascinated by this lady.
[38:24.160 --> 38:25.640]  I don't know why she's still out there.
[38:25.640 --> 38:28.560]  She should be hiding under a rock by now.
[38:28.560 --> 38:36.040]  So, I've talked with many of the Democratic candidates for president, as you might guess.
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.720]  I've answered their questions about everything from digital outreach.
[38:40.720 --> 38:42.000]  She's talking to these people.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.280]  She's answering their questions.
[38:43.280 --> 38:49.960]  Who better to consult with for your campaign than the losing candidate who lost a rigged
[38:49.960 --> 38:53.120]  election?
[38:53.120 --> 38:58.720]  Obstacle might very well turn out to be.
[38:58.720 --> 39:01.320]  I'm mesmerized by this.
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.200]  The fact that she is still going, still running her mouth.
[39:05.200 --> 39:09.240]  She warned the Russians are coming to meddle in the election yet again.
[39:09.240 --> 39:14.240]  We have a fundamental set of threats at the bedrock of our democracy and anyone who stands
[39:14.240 --> 39:19.080]  in the way of confronting those threats is abdicating their responsibility to protect
[39:19.080 --> 39:20.480]  and defend the Constitution.
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.240]  I was the first person you ran for president more than 50 years without the protection
[39:24.240 --> 39:25.240]  of the Voting Rights Act.
[39:25.240 --> 39:31.560]  She also complained, what a complete and utter lunatic.
[39:31.560 --> 39:34.680]  And the fact that she's consulting with the new crop of Democrats doesn't surprise me.
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.560]  I mean, look, we all know that social media, everything was tilted in her favor in 2016
[39:39.560 --> 39:42.960]  and just think about what's happened over the last few years.
[39:42.960 --> 39:48.280]  Let's go ahead and start to get into this because it's absolutely horrifying.
[39:48.280 --> 39:52.440]  A couple weeks ago, I was here in studio with Alex and you may remember, we were reporting
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.920]  on the potential new gun control push that will weaponize your Alexa, your Fitbit, your
[39:57.920 --> 40:03.120]  everything to spy on you, give that information to the government and then allow the government
[40:03.120 --> 40:09.520]  to do one of two things, either come and take your guns or put you on prescription SSRIs
[40:09.520 --> 40:10.520]  or both.
[40:10.520 --> 40:15.920]  Well, now, new article up at zero heads, it's up at infowords.com as well.
[40:15.920 --> 40:23.040]  Smart TVs have been caught sending sensitive user data to Facebook and Netflix.
[40:23.040 --> 40:25.480]  Every single day, Alex Jones is completely vindicated.
[40:25.480 --> 40:30.440]  I remember when I was a kid, I was a child and Alex was saying, look, these devices
[40:30.440 --> 40:31.640]  are listening to you.
[40:31.640 --> 40:32.640]  It's already in the patents.
[40:32.640 --> 40:34.640]  Go look it up for yourself.
[40:34.640 --> 40:37.920]  And now here it is, mainstream news.
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.320]  Just when social media companies were starting to modify their data collection practices
[40:42.320 --> 40:47.880]  to better respect user privacy, the next threat is coming from the Internet of Things.
[40:47.880 --> 40:49.680]  Smart TVs are becoming increasingly popular.
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.760]  In some cases, users data are being sent to Netflix even though they didn't have an account.
[40:53.760 --> 40:55.840]  This is kind of like with Facebook.
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.600]  Facebook can mine your user data even if you've never had a Facebook account in your life.
[41:01.600 --> 41:02.880]  It's not just smart TVs.
[41:02.880 --> 41:06.720]  Other smart devices from speakers to cameras have also been caught sending user data to
[41:06.720 --> 41:09.360]  third parties like Spotify.
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.120]  Nearly 70% of Americans have a smart TV or a Roku or Apple TV.
[41:14.120 --> 41:18.200]  Nearly all these devices have recognition technology that tracks what you watch and sells
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.800]  that data, approximating your interest to advertisers.
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.120]  Viewers who watch Firepower, which is on every night from 7 until 9 p.m. with myself and
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.080]  Will Johnson know that I've been building a new studio there.
[41:31.080 --> 41:36.720]  And when you're shopping for TVs, this is how it works now I learned, you can choose
[41:36.720 --> 41:45.600]  to get a dumb TV and you can pay $1,200 or you can get a smart TV and pay $600.
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.200]  And it doesn't take a genius to sit there and think, what on earth is the difference
[41:50.200 --> 41:51.200]  between these two TVs?
[41:51.200 --> 41:53.840]  It's the same exact size, the same exact technology.
[41:53.840 --> 41:59.600]  One's a smart TV and it's cheaper and one is a dumb TV and it costs twice the amount
[41:59.600 --> 42:00.600]  of money.
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.480]  The other thing would be that they're stealing my data to spy on me and sell it to whoever
[42:05.480 --> 42:10.600]  is paying the most and that subsidizes the cost.
[42:10.600 --> 42:16.120]  This isn't exactly hard stuff to understand, but apparently most Americans don't care.
[42:16.120 --> 42:17.120]  I think that's the real problem.
[42:17.120 --> 42:18.320]  We're all numb to this.
[42:18.320 --> 42:21.320]  Everybody just knows that your smartphone is spying on you.
[42:21.320 --> 42:24.080]  You mention a word and two days later it's in a Facebook ad.
[42:24.080 --> 42:26.080]  You never even type it, you never do a Google search.
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.360]  We all just kind of accept this as the price that we pay to live in this wonderful advanced
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.360]  society.
[42:32.360 --> 42:35.160]  We're going to talk more about this when we come back after the break.
[42:35.160 --> 42:42.080]  Big Tech is one of the major destructive forces of our time and nobody.
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.040]  It seems like nobody is trying to rein it in whatsoever.
[42:45.040 --> 42:47.120]  You're watching the Alex Jones show.
[42:47.120 --> 42:50.760]  I'm Tom Pappard filling in for Alex as he returns from California.
[42:50.760 --> 42:52.680]  He's on a very big podcast.
[42:52.680 --> 42:54.360]  Keep an eye out for that.
[42:54.360 --> 42:56.360]  We'll be right back after this break.
[42:56.360 --> 43:01.880]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[43:01.880 --> 43:06.360]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[43:06.360 --> 43:07.360]  it.
[43:07.360 --> 43:08.360]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[43:08.360 --> 43:13.320]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.640]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[43:18.640 --> 43:22.920]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy,
[43:22.920 --> 43:26.480]  helps produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system functioning goes
[43:26.480 --> 43:27.480]  on and on.
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.600]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.560]  weight loss, depression, or memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[43:35.560 --> 43:37.960]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[43:37.960 --> 43:42.800]  It helps some of the info war, so it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at
[43:42.800 --> 43:43.800]  infowarstore.com.
[43:43.800 --> 43:50.320]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[43:50.320 --> 43:52.360]  Ultra 12 twice as powerful.
[43:52.360 --> 43:58.520]  At the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[43:58.520 --> 44:04.200]  Super silver wound gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has
[44:04.200 --> 44:08.760]  their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[44:08.760 --> 44:11.840]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[44:11.840 --> 44:12.840]  years.
[44:12.840 --> 44:13.840]  It's been a best seller.
[44:13.840 --> 44:19.280]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[44:19.280 --> 44:24.160]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[44:24.160 --> 44:25.640]  technology in it.
[44:25.640 --> 44:27.600]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[44:27.600 --> 44:29.120]  It's got the steric acid.
[44:29.120 --> 44:31.640]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[44:31.640 --> 44:35.280]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[44:35.280 --> 44:36.720]  It's in two sizes.
[44:36.720 --> 44:41.360]  Super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're not going to find
[44:41.360 --> 44:43.000]  a product that's good anywhere.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.880]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslive.com.
[44:48.880 --> 44:53.760]  Your super silver skin cream today, we can only run this special for another week or
[44:53.760 --> 45:00.080]  so as of taping this September 10th.
[45:00.080 --> 45:03.040]  We have entered a great time of change.
[45:03.040 --> 45:08.640]  The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that
[45:08.640 --> 45:14.680]  if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.320]  accepting a tyrannical corporate world government known as a technocracy in their own words
[45:19.320 --> 45:24.120]  that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[45:24.120 --> 45:27.840]  At first, they give you just a few basic things to do.
[45:27.840 --> 45:28.840]  Don't support Trump.
[45:28.840 --> 45:30.440]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[45:30.440 --> 45:34.600]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father and, well, let us sterilize
[45:34.600 --> 45:35.600]  your children.
[45:35.600 --> 45:40.520]  Take these four synoculations and here, take this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized
[45:40.520 --> 45:41.520]  marijuana.
[45:41.520 --> 45:44.400]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.120]  This is truly the market of the beast system and we're on air right now covering it.
[45:48.120 --> 45:49.120]  And you're awake.
[45:49.120 --> 45:50.120]  You're involved.
[45:50.120 --> 45:51.120]  You're engaged.
[45:51.120 --> 45:52.120]  You're an ambassador of truth.
[45:52.120 --> 45:55.480]  So I'm begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family.
[45:55.480 --> 45:58.960]  Spread the word about infowars.com, the live shows right now.
[45:58.960 --> 46:05.480]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[46:05.480 --> 46:15.000]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity, whoever's behind it.
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.120]  Know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration and now is the
[46:20.120 --> 46:25.440]  time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is
[46:25.440 --> 46:31.840]  here on this planet and that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek God's
[46:31.840 --> 46:38.080]  countenance, God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency and
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.160]  to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war
[46:43.160 --> 46:48.280]  will be exposed to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.320]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully, but it's already tilting towards
[46:53.320 --> 46:55.920]  a global depression because of energy crises.
[46:55.920 --> 47:02.480]  We're covering it all live on the radio at infowars.com.
[47:02.480 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:26.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show again, I am Tom Pappard filling in for Alex as he
[47:26.280 --> 47:27.560]  gets his way back here.
[47:27.560 --> 47:32.160]  He may be back in studio at one o'clock so stay tuned.
[47:32.160 --> 47:37.320]  We've been talking about big tech and I really want to go big picture here because big tech
[47:37.320 --> 47:43.920]  is working hand in hand with our globalist overlords to create this new perfect paradigm
[47:43.920 --> 47:50.160]  that they want to usher in that is not a human paradigm, but this is just an important article
[47:50.160 --> 47:56.640]  because Facebook, this is really them flaunting their power over the legal system, over Congress,
[47:56.640 --> 47:57.840]  over everybody.
[47:57.840 --> 48:00.600]  Everybody knows Laura Loomer is suing Facebook.
[48:00.600 --> 48:04.560]  You may remember her appearance on the Alex Jones show from a few months back.
[48:04.560 --> 48:10.240]  She's suing Facebook because Facebook has considered Laura Loomer a hate figure.
[48:10.240 --> 48:15.600]  She's a five foot, seven Jewish girl, but she's a hate figure according to Facebook
[48:15.600 --> 48:17.640]  and she must be banned.
[48:17.640 --> 48:23.520]  She's every bit as bad as Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson or that dangerous white supremacist
[48:23.520 --> 48:30.280]  Milo Yiannopoulos who coincidentally is married to a black guy, but so in that lawsuit Facebook
[48:30.280 --> 48:38.400]  has now filed a motion to dismiss and it is perhaps the most confusing motion to dismiss
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.600]  I have ever read in my entire adult life, which in Middle East is not that long.
[48:42.600 --> 48:44.080]  Maybe there's something crazier.
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.360]  Somebody can show it to me, but this was this was something else.
[48:47.360 --> 48:51.240]  So in its response to independent journalist Laura Loomer's lawsuit against the platform,
[48:51.240 --> 48:57.160]  Facebook refers to itself as a publisher, which means it could potentially forego protections
[48:57.160 --> 49:02.720]  afforded to all big tech, all social media networks by Section 230 of the Communications
[49:02.720 --> 49:03.720]  Decency Act.
[49:03.720 --> 49:08.520]  So for people who don't know how this works, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, they're
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.120]  all in this bizarre world, middle line area where they're not a publisher, they're not
[49:14.120 --> 49:20.160]  a newspaper because a newspaper, if a newspaper publishes libel, you can sue the pants off
[49:20.160 --> 49:21.160]  that newspaper.
[49:21.160 --> 49:22.160]  You can make it fold.
[49:22.160 --> 49:27.240]  So they're not a newspaper, they're not a publisher, but at the same time, it's not
[49:27.240 --> 49:28.960]  a public forum.
[49:28.960 --> 49:33.200]  They can ban anyone they want without it being a violation of the First Amendment.
[49:33.200 --> 49:41.240]  So in this bizarre world, clown world legal document, they somehow managed to make the
[49:41.240 --> 49:45.640]  case that they are indeed a publisher, but they're not a publisher.
[49:45.640 --> 49:49.960]  Motion to dismiss Loomer's lawsuit against the big tech company, Facebook's legal counsel
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.200]  appears to specifically refer to the company as a publisher.
[49:53.200 --> 49:57.960]  It says this, third, to the extent Ms. Loomer's claim targets Facebook's decision to deactivate
[49:57.960 --> 50:00.280]  her accounts, it is also deficient.
[50:00.280 --> 50:06.680]  Under well-established laws, neither Facebook nor any other publisher can be libel for failing
[50:06.680 --> 50:08.920]  to publish someone else's message.
[50:08.920 --> 50:15.320]  So here, Facebook is saying, we're a newspaper, it's just like at infowars.com.
[50:15.320 --> 50:23.120]  Everybody has the right to just send an article to infowars or newswars.com and have it published.
[50:23.120 --> 50:24.520]  That's true.
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.440]  But Facebook says it's not a publisher.
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.920]  Anybody can go to Facebook, but they can ban people, but anybody can go to Facebook.
[50:30.920 --> 50:35.760]  Strangely, later in the motion, Facebook then invokes Section 230 and what reclaimed the
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.840]  net, which I'm a big fan of that website, it seems to be a great civil liberty on the
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.160]  Internet website, describes as a mind-boggling stance.
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.320]  It's mind-boggling claim that it's first-member rights allow it to ban users for exercising
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.960]  their own first-member rights, and that's not even the only puzzling and contradictory
[50:51.960 --> 50:53.320]  point from the filing.
[50:53.320 --> 50:57.160]  Another is the way Facebook refers to itself as a publisher at one point, only two later
[50:57.160 --> 51:00.320]  in the same document invokes Section 230.
[51:00.320 --> 51:06.040]  The extent Ms. Loomer's claim targets Facebook nor any other publisher can be liable.
[51:06.040 --> 51:13.960]  And then it goes on to describe itself on page 18 as a company that is protected by
[51:13.960 --> 51:19.640]  Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act.
[51:19.640 --> 51:24.440]  It's totally insane, and I love that we got this on the document cam because this is where
[51:24.440 --> 51:25.640]  Facebook is leading us.
[51:25.640 --> 51:28.160]  This is where all these insane people are leading us.
[51:28.160 --> 51:32.520]  This is another article from by Paul and Joseph Watson up at infowars.com.
[51:32.520 --> 51:39.880]  These are not prepared for a pandemic that could kill 80 million people, warned the Global
[51:39.880 --> 51:47.000]  Preparedness Monitoring Board, a joint entity formed by the World Bank and the WHO.
[51:47.000 --> 51:55.720]  This is the die-off, the great murder of humanity that Alex Jones has always been talking about.
[51:55.720 --> 51:57.480]  And they want it to happen.
[51:57.480 --> 52:03.560]  There's a very real threat of a rapidly moving, highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen
[52:03.560 --> 52:08.320]  killing 50 to 80 million people and wiping out nearly 5% of the world's economy, warns
[52:08.320 --> 52:12.160]  the paper adding that the world is not prepared for this.
[52:12.160 --> 52:17.600]  A global pandemic on that scale would be catastrophic, creating widespread havoc, instability and
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.320]  insecurity.
[52:19.320 --> 52:25.120]  The GPMB says governments need to invest more in emergency preparedness and that misinformation
[52:25.120 --> 52:30.120]  on social media is also exacerbating the spread of diseases.
[52:30.120 --> 52:37.280]  But don't worry, Trump is being pressured to ban vaping and that will solve everything.
[52:37.280 --> 52:44.200]  So a mosquito-borne virus could be a form, not this, but a form of what kills people.
[52:44.200 --> 52:49.560]  A man went from healthy to brain dead in nine days from a mosquito-borne virus.
[52:49.560 --> 52:55.240]  A 64-year-old man was a perfectly healthy, happy human being less than two weeks before
[52:55.240 --> 53:00.400]  his August 19 death from a rare mosquito-borne virus.
[53:00.400 --> 53:03.280]  Here's a comforting headline.
[53:03.280 --> 53:04.760]  Are you guys ready for this?
[53:04.760 --> 53:08.520]  This year's flu season may be a bad one.
[53:08.520 --> 53:10.720]  Here's why you need a flu shot.
[53:10.720 --> 53:13.360]  Are you ready for your flu shots, ladies and gentlemen?
[53:13.360 --> 53:16.760]  Flu seasons are notoriously unpredictable, but there are already clues that the upcoming
[53:16.760 --> 53:20.040]  season may be especially difficult.
[53:20.040 --> 53:22.760]  Flu season in the southern hemisphere can be an indication of what's to come in the northern
[53:22.760 --> 53:23.760]  hemisphere.
[53:23.760 --> 53:26.840]  The recent flu season in Australia, where winter just ended, arrived early and with
[53:26.840 --> 53:27.840]  a vengeance.
[53:27.840 --> 53:33.080]  A particularly virulent flu strain, H3N2, dominated.
[53:33.080 --> 53:35.800]  What's more, pediatric flu deaths have already been reported in the U.S.
[53:35.800 --> 53:39.320]  A four-year-old in California had underlying health problems.
[53:39.320 --> 53:42.520]  That's the part that they never put in the headline, is it?
[53:42.520 --> 53:43.520]  Underlying health problems.
[53:43.520 --> 53:47.800]  Very young who are already sick, the very old who are already sick, but you better get
[53:47.800 --> 53:48.800]  your flu shot.
[53:48.800 --> 53:54.680]  We should never forget that the flu kills, said Dr. Cameron Keiser, a public health
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.360]  officer for Riverside County, California.
[53:57.360 --> 54:01.720]  A death so early in the flu season suggests this year may be worse than usual.
[54:01.720 --> 54:10.240]  The CDC estimates that last year there were 37 million to 43 million flu illnesses, 36,000
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.120]  to 61,000 related deaths.
[54:14.120 --> 54:16.880]  So you better get your flu shot, here we go.
[54:16.880 --> 54:20.480]  The concern with delaying it is that some people might have the opportunity to get vaccinated
[54:20.480 --> 54:23.280]  now, may not have that opportunity later.
[54:23.280 --> 54:28.200]  That's Dr. Robert Atmar, professor of medicine and infectious disease expert at Baylor College.
[54:28.200 --> 54:31.240]  The most important thing is for people to get their flu vaccine and get it before the
[54:31.240 --> 54:33.360]  epidemic starts.
[54:33.360 --> 54:36.720]  Most healthy people get the shot in September, can expect some protection through the spring,
[54:36.720 --> 54:43.080]  but older adults may want to schedule their vaccination for some time in October.
[54:43.080 --> 54:45.280]  There's no mention of what the flu shot actually does.
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.320]  It protects against one very specific strain of the flu, and who even knows what the strain
[54:50.320 --> 54:51.680]  that you could get sick with will be.
[54:51.680 --> 54:55.560]  It's all total insanity, but this is then the globalist agenda.
[54:55.560 --> 54:58.640]  We're all going to get sick and die of the flu, mosquitoes are biting us, we're going
[54:58.640 --> 55:01.640]  to die, there's a respiratory illness that's going to take out 80 million people.
[55:01.640 --> 55:10.040]  But the elites want us to live in 100-square-foot parasite pods, and it's the housing of the
[55:10.040 --> 55:11.040]  future.
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.080]  Of course, Paul Joseph Watson had a similar article and a video that went along with it
[55:15.080 --> 55:21.080]  last week, but this is up at nationalfile.com, and this is the future.
[55:21.080 --> 55:22.080]  This is what they want.
[55:22.080 --> 55:28.720]  Maybe we can put some of the images on screen from an article that's embedded in this one.
[55:28.720 --> 55:29.720]  This is what they want for us.
[55:29.720 --> 55:36.440]  We're going to live in these 100- to 180-square-foot pods, these tiny little homes, and if you
[55:36.440 --> 55:44.600]  look at these things, it looks like a wasp nest on the side of somebody else's building.
[55:44.600 --> 55:48.680]  Parasite pods are part of a broader design subclass called parasitic architecture, divine
[55:48.680 --> 55:53.240]  as temporary structures that feed off energy from a host building to provide power, utility,
[55:53.240 --> 55:55.120]  structural support.
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.280]  Some aesthetically disturbing examples can be seen online, and this is being put forward
[56:01.280 --> 56:12.040]  in China, in Spain, in Malaysia, all across the world as the next step in human evolution.
[56:12.040 --> 56:16.640]  So I know we don't have much time here, but let's see exactly what this type of living
[56:16.640 --> 56:20.840]  conditions brings with clip number five.
[56:20.840 --> 56:25.840]  This is what happens when people are destitutes and living in close quarters.
[56:25.840 --> 56:26.840]  We can bring that up.
[56:26.840 --> 56:27.840]  There we go.
[56:27.840 --> 56:41.800]  Polarist people fighting over who knows what, I believe, has happened right here in Austin,
[56:41.800 --> 56:43.800]  I understand correctly.
[56:43.800 --> 56:47.640]  Texas Street Bites TV, my goodness.
[56:47.640 --> 56:49.240]  These are some of the lovely campers.
[56:49.240 --> 56:57.160]  They just need a nice parasitic home and maybe a flu vaccine, and all will go well.
[56:57.160 --> 57:00.240]  It's disgusting footage.
[57:00.240 --> 57:07.640]  This is what humanity is being degraded to, thanks to our globalist overlords here.
[57:07.640 --> 57:10.080]  All right, I think we've seen enough.
[57:10.080 --> 57:15.160]  We better stop it before it gets unfriendly for a family audience, but this is what the
[57:15.160 --> 57:21.800]  globalist one, IQ has plummeted over the past few decades, or I'd had a lot to do with that.
[57:21.800 --> 57:22.800]  This is the type of behavior.
[57:22.800 --> 57:24.160]  This is the type of living conditions.
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.640]  This is the type of illnesses that they're going to continue to force upon us if we don't
[57:29.640 --> 57:31.160]  fight back.
[57:31.160 --> 57:37.200]  Infowars.com, Infowarsstore.com, NewsWars.com, I'm Tom Papperts.
[57:37.200 --> 57:38.680]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[57:38.680 --> 57:41.960]  Alex should be back in studio later today.
[57:41.960 --> 57:42.960]  Stay tuned.
[57:42.960 --> 57:48.160]  This is Patrick Halley on the other side of this break.
[57:48.160 --> 57:53.920]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[57:53.920 --> 57:56.720]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[57:56.720 --> 58:01.400]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[58:01.400 --> 58:06.160]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[58:06.160 --> 58:08.760]  for their organs to be harvested.
[58:08.760 --> 58:14.520]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at Infowars.com 15 years ago that Google
[58:14.520 --> 58:19.280]  was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[58:19.280 --> 58:25.680]  hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying
[58:25.680 --> 58:29.560]  to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist
[58:29.560 --> 58:33.600]  Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[58:33.600 --> 58:37.560]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale.
[58:37.560 --> 58:42.280]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical
[58:42.280 --> 58:44.320]  than ever to support the Info War.
[58:44.320 --> 58:49.080]  Please support the Info War however you can.
[58:49.080 --> 58:51.480]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.

[58:59.000 --> 59:00.680]  body but not be an oppressant.
[59:00.680 --> 59:04.440]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our

[59:51.920 --> 1:00:09.880]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:15.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:19.880]  I am Tom Papert your host in the beginning of the last hour we were talking about Ed
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:26.120]  Buck who has now been arrested after three men that we know of have reportedly overdosed
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:31.560]  after he allegedly injected crystal meth into their body.
[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:36.440]  One victim says he does it so he can feed off the energy of young black men who are in
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:37.440]  distress.
[1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:42.280]  For this segment, maybe the next few, we're going to have Patrick Halley with us.
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:46.200]  Patrick Halley is a reporter for Epic Times as well as my website, National File.
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:50.240]  Patrick has previously been at Breitbart, Big League Politics, Daily Caller.
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:54.360]  He is a heavy hitter when it comes to these topics.
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:57.460]  One of my favorite people at Halley reporter on Twitter.
[1:00:57.460 --> 1:00:59.160]  Make sure you follow him.
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:04.600]  Patrick was instrumental in breaking down everything that happened with Nexium, the
[1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:08.520]  famous sex cult that was really a human trafficking cult.
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:12.560]  Patrick also was instrumental in helping the world understand what was going on with Jeffrey
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:13.560]  Epstein.
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:16.360]  But who better to bring into this conversation?
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:19.680]  Patrick, I know you're familiar with what happened with Ed Buck.
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:23.560]  What do you consider his arrest?
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:24.560]  What do you view this as?
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.040]  Is this a step in the right direction?
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:28.160]  Well, you would think so.
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:31.280]  I mean, you would think he would have been arrested after the first black man died at
[1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:36.520]  his home after being overdosed, after being injected with crystal meth.
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:39.120]  You would have thought he would have been arrested after the second black man died at
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:40.120]  his home.
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:41.600]  Now, this third man did not die.
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:42.600]  He survived.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:49.200]  However, this is enough to get Ed Buck charged with battery causing serious injury, administering
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:51.600]  meth and maintaining a drug house.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.680]  So he is finally being brought to justice.
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:54.680]  These are felony counts.
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:59.320]  He is, of course, a Hillary Clinton donor and a very close friend of the Clintons.
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:03.080]  And so this is yet another person who's in the Clinton nexus, who has been accused in
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:10.560]  a civil suit of human trafficking, who is obviously preying on black men and taking pleasure
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:13.240]  in delight in their suffering and their misery.
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:16.960]  This is something we often see from elitists who are involved in human trafficking who
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.160]  are connected to the Clintons.
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:22.200]  They thrive on the suffering of their victims.
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:25.680]  Now you brought up a really important connection there because it does seem as if they are
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:28.320]  all connected to the Clintons in some way, shape, or form.
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:32.000]  We of course had Jeffrey Epstein intimately acquainted with the Clintons.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.760]  We had the nexium human trafficking sex cults where they were giving illegal donations to
[1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:39.360]  Clinton in 2008.
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:41.560]  And now we have Ed Bunk who is their super donor.
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:47.240]  So is this, in your view, is this just a commonality between elites?
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:53.440]  Well, it's a network, and it's a network of people who are all connected with one another.
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:57.200]  And so the Trump administration and also me as an investigative reporter have been going
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:02:59.720]  after these so-called placeholder cases.
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:02.160]  Jeffrey Epstein was one of those placeholder cases.
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:05.520]  However, they killed Jeffrey Epstein where he committed suicide.
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:11.120]  And so he's not going to then turn on the people like Jolaine Maxwell, who he was involved
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.320]  with.
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:18.080]  It's interesting to note that Keith Reneire of nexium, his sentencing is now delayed until
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:19.080]  2020.
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:21.120]  That gives him a lot more time to talk.
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:26.360]  And so my appeal to the prison guards who are guarding Keith Reneire right now is, please,
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:27.560]  don't pull an Epstein.
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:33.040]  Keep this man safe, not for his sake, but for our sake, because this guy was being funded
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:37.760]  by the Bronfman's, the cult was illegally bundling money for Hillary Clinton.
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:41.240]  Hurston Gillibrand's family was in the child trafficking cult.
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:47.920]  They were running human experiment daycares in Guatemala and Mexico, grooming little kids,
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:51.000]  giving them fake visas to get them up over the border.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.560]  And Claire Bronfman's brother even owned the land where the child sex bunker was found
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:57.560]  in New Mexico.
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:03:58.560]  Wow.
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:03.000]  So you can see the whole map of human trafficking as it comes up from Central America.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  All over the border.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.600]  And then these kids get pumped into situations where they are the victims of satanic pedophile
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:11.120]  human traffickers.
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:12.840]  That is the issue of our times.
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:15.280]  That's the power structure of our world right now.
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:19.520]  And they can't kill every Jeffrey Epstein because all this truth is cascading out into
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:20.520]  the open.
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:21.720]  I think you're exactly right.
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:23.760]  We are winning this thing, whether they like it or not.
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:26.920]  Patrick, we've got to take a short commercial break here at about 30 seconds.
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:31.760]  When we get back, I want to pick your brain about why is it that they're always going
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:32.760]  after?
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:35.320]  Next to him going after almost exclusively Hispanic children.
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:37.560]  We had Epstein who went after a certain subset.
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:40.280]  We have Ed Buck who goes after young black men.
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:43.280]  It almost, it's very bizarre and very interrelated.
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:45.240]  As you said, it is absolutely a network.
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:47.640]  I'm Tom Pappard filling in for Alex Jones today.
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:50.800]  He will be back in studio hopefully later this afternoon.
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:52.640]  But you are watching the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:57.480]  We'll be back with Patrick Halley after this short break.
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:03.160]  Silver Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has
[1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:07.720]  their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:10.800]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:11.800]  years.
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:12.800]  It's been a best seller.
[1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:18.200]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:23.120]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented SilverSol
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:24.600]  technology in it.
[1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.960]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:34.240]  oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:39.800]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're
[1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:41.960]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:47.840]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:50.680]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:06:19.440]  We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:21.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:23.920]  I am Tom Pappard filling in for Alex today.
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:28.880]  It's an honor to be here with my very, very important guest, Patrick Alley.
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:35.200]  He's at Howley Reporter on Twitter and he is by and large the most devastatingly effective
[1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:41.240]  journalist when it comes to breaking apart these sex rings, sex cults, alleged drug dens.
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:44.800]  So Patrick, we were talking a little bit in the last few seconds of the last segment.
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:49.680]  They always seem to go after very specific subsets of the population.
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:55.840]  This is from one of the alleged victims of Ed Buck who mated out, who fled the apartment
[1:06:55.840 --> 1:06:57.340]  and never returned.
[1:06:57.340 --> 1:07:00.800]  This was a homeless young black man who had been on the street.
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:06.680]  He was allegedly paid $200 by Buck to spend the night with him.
[1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:10.140]  And this is one of the quotes that he gave the media.
[1:07:10.140 --> 1:07:14.560]  He said, I'm his type and pretty much half the black community is his type.
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:16.520]  Vulnerable, depressed.
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:21.720]  If you're in a depressive state, that's the energy that feeds him.
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:23.320]  That's the energy that feeds him.
[1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:30.640]  I think that is the most startling and shocking line I've read this year.
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:35.200]  Talk a little bit, if you could, about how these people, do you agree they feed off energy?
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:36.800]  That's what we had with Epstein.
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:40.440]  That's what we had with Nexium and now that's what we allegedly have with Ed Buck.
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:41.680]  Do you agree with that?
[1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:47.440]  Yes, they feed off of misery, they feed off of adrenaline, but they feed off of negative
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:48.440]  energy.
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:53.080]  And if you are somebody who is a marginalized person, then you are at risk.
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:54.640]  Look at Child Protective Services.
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:58.800]  It was Hillary Clinton, through her husband, signing the Adoption and Safe Families Act
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:03.840]  in 1997, that created financial incentives to take kids out of their homes, put them
[1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:08.880]  in foster care, and now the State Department confirms that they're being child sex traffic.
[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:10.600]  And so that happened because of the Clintons.
[1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:15.280]  There is now an entire industry, all over the country, of kids who are being sex trafficked
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:16.960]  through Child Protective Services.
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:18.520]  The Clintons put that in place.
[1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:23.640]  The Clintons have been at the center of human trafficking for the last 20 or 30 years.
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:28.000]  And we are seeing everybody who's connected with them now, during the Trump years, being
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  a target.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.680]  Church of Scientology is being sued for human trafficking.
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:35.840]  Church of Scientology has a very powerful lobbying shop in D.C. They're lobbyist Greg
[1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:36.840]  Mitchell.
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:38.800]  You can find photos of him with Hillary Clinton.
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:41.600]  You can go to the L. Ron Hubbard House in Dupont Circle.
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:45.080]  As I've been, I took a VIP tour during the election.
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:50.880]  And you can see very clearly that this occult, elitist network is operating all over the
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.880]  country and all over the world.
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:54.280]  And they're not messing around.
[1:08:54.280 --> 1:08:56.720]  And so this really is a war for humanity.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:02.640]  Patrick, you've been covering something, and this is very related, that I honestly do
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:04.680]  not know if this has been important.
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:08.920]  This very important information, the CPS scandals that you have been single-handedly breaking
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:12.840]  at Epic Times and National File, very, very important stuff.
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:14.840]  Can you tell us a little bit about this?
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:20.200]  Because some people don't understand that CPS, these are not necessarily great families
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:24.280]  that the government is ripping children out of their birth parents and giving them to.
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:28.400]  So explain to us the work you've been doing here lately.
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:33.360]  I broke the story of massive child prostitution that's going on in the California CPS.
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:36.640]  It's not exclusive to California, it's happening all over the country.
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.080]  The state of California doesn't even put out an Amber Alert if kids go missing from foster
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:42.080]  care.
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:45.800]  All of the kids are officially labeled as runaways, so that no Amber Alert has to go
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:46.800]  out.
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:51.720]  And the reason is that they leave for a short period of time, and they engage in prostitution,
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:55.600]  and they get 20 Johns at a time, and they get paid, and their pimps get paid, and then
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:57.080]  they get returned to foster care.
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:09:58.800]  And this is what they do on the weekends.
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:00.640]  This is what they do for days at a time.
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:02.000]  This is happening all over the country.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.800]  The Clinton's created this system in 1997 by signing an act that pays foster parents
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.680]  that allows everybody in the CPS system to get paid, that they take the kids out of the
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:14.680]  parents' houses.
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:19.880]  And I'm coming out with an article today that's a real bombshell showing how in Oregon, parents
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:24.840]  who are conservatives, Christians, and Trump supporters are being targeted with fake CPS
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:25.840]  reports.
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:26.840]  Antifa is doing this.
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:31.600]  Antifa is making fake CPS reports against Trump supporting parents and weaponizing this
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:37.720]  agency, knowing that every single time CPS goes into a parent's house, they have a financial
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.400]  incentive to take the kids away, and they're going to look for any excuse to do it.
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:45.280]  That is horrifying information, but it doesn't really surprise us.
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:46.640]  So let's just recap here.
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:53.320]  We have people like Ed Buck, who are giving money to Hillary Clinton, allegedly drugging
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.800]  and allegedly killing young black men.
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:11:00.960]  We have people like Jeffrey Epstein, close personal friend of Hillary Clinton and Bill
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:01.960]  Clinton.
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:04.120]  I mean, we know how many times he flew on the Lulita Express.
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:07.880]  We think that he's been to the infamous pedophile island.
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:12.680]  We have Nexium, which gave money to the Clintons, and now we have the Clintons essentially building
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:16.840]  a system that allows children to be prostituted.
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.600]  Patrick, what can be done to right this ship with CPS?
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:23.000]  What can be done here?
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:29.480]  Well, look, the Clintons are the mafia bosses, however, they're not the top bosses.
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:33.760]  I mean, if you look at the networks here and you realize that Jelaine Maxwell, who is Jeffrey
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:38.840]  Epstein's handler, her father was business partners with Charles Bronfman of the Bronfman
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:40.480]  family of Nexium fame.
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:45.360]  Jeffrey Epstein himself was the tax mitigation advisor to Edgar Bronfman, Clair Bronfman's
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:47.280]  father when he was at Bear Stearns.
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:49.400]  Their relationship goes back to the 70s.
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:50.720]  These people all know each other.
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:53.100]  They hang out on Richard Branson's island.
[1:11:53.100 --> 1:11:56.080]  They hang out on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile island.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:59.840]  They have networks and they thought they were untouchable for a long time.
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:04.000]  That's why Nexium was hiding in plain sight until a whistleblower named Frank Perlato
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.480]  came to me and we started busting this thing up and exposing the connections.
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:11.720]  What they're doing very clearly is they're doing satanic rituals.
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:16.520]  They're bringing kids in as sex slaves and they're performing satanic rituals and they're
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:19.680]  using them for horrible, horrible things, but it's not just sex.
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:22.040]  It's not just for their own sexual gratification.
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.280]  It's also for occult rituals that they're performing and it's also for blackmail.
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:30.480]  As we know from the Jeffrey Epstein case, world leaders were being blackmailed for the things
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:34.840]  that they were engaging in that were all on videotape being surveilled.
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:39.100]  Once these people do horrible things and they're politicians and they're connected to so many
[1:12:39.100 --> 1:12:42.960]  other people in politics, then they're owned and they're 100% owned.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:47.800]  That photo you just showed was Jolene Maxwell at an In-N-Out burger in Los Angeles taunting
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:52.960]  the press by reading a book about the life and death of CIA agents right after Jeffrey
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:54.160]  Epstein's death.
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:55.400]  These people are clowns.
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:13:00.680]  They're all connected to intelligence and so it becomes harder to go after them, but
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:03.120]  we have to keep going after these placeholder cases.
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:10.600]  Yet again, my appeal to Keith Reneire as prison guards is keep that guy safe, do your job,
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:16.400]  don't take a bribe, don't leave the gate open and look the other way because this guy very
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.160]  well could flip and make a deal and that would change human history.
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.960]  I think you're absolutely right about that and a lot of us were hoping that that would
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:23.960]  happen with Epstein.
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:25.280]  Of course, it didn't happen now.
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:28.600]  In the next segment, I want to get into what is being done by the Trump administration,
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:31.840]  which there are some faults with the Trump administration, but going after child sex
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:33.600]  trafficking is not one of them.
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:38.520]  But for the couple minutes we have left, I want to just get your thoughts on how high
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:44.800]  up Ed Buck is and is there a potential for an Epstein Reneire type of situation with
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:46.560]  Ed Buck?
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:47.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:52.200]  Ed Buck has been one of the biggest institutional Democrat donors for a long time.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:57.200]  He's at a Tom Steyer level and it's interesting to look into Tom Steyer.
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:59.920]  What was he talking about in some of those Podesta emails?
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:02.000]  He showed up in Podesta emails.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.240]  These people are all linked to one another and so the thing is, if any one of them goes
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:12.240]  down or becomes compromised or decides to flip, then the whole thing comes down and that's
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:16.800]  why you see so many of these people dying like Jeffrey Epstein because there is a system
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:21.720]  of accountability where if they think someone's going to flip, then that person ends up dead.
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:24.200]  And this often happens in Clinton world.
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:25.880]  And there are stories you never even hear about.
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:31.480]  There's Harold H. L. Moody, who is a program coordinator at Pulaski County Youth Services
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.200]  in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:37.440]  He was also the communications director for the Arkansas Democrat Party during the 2016
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:40.400]  election, a close friend of Hillary Clinton.
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:41.400]  And he was arrested.
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:46.120]  He was in a child porn chat room and he was showing baby rape videos.
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:50.240]  And he even said to his fellow people in this chat room, I've heard of white privilege,
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:51.680]  but not perv privilege.
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:53.720]  I'm not the jukebox at Waffle House.
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:55.480]  I don't play on demand.
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:56.480]  This guy was arrested.
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:58.240]  It was completely blacked out in the press.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:14:59.240]  Nobody's heard about this.
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:01.560]  Harold H. L. Moody.
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:07.400]  The Clintons even put their health initiative through the Clinton Foundation in Pulaski County.
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.920]  They gave an award to the head of Pulaski County Youth Services where this man was employed,
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:14.040]  where he was smoking meth at his desk.
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:17.800]  And there was another case where a guy who worked there was arrested for raping a 14-year-old
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:18.800]  boy.
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:20.840]  This is a human trafficking operation.
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:22.600]  I'm not scared about getting killed.
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:24.720]  If they kill me, I'll go meet my maker.
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:28.160]  I'm going to use every moment that I have in order to get as much information about this
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:29.160]  out there to people.
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:30.240]  Well, and Patrick, we're friends.
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:32.680]  I know for a fact that you are in a good state of mind.
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:34.200]  You're a happy, healthy individual.
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:36.080]  And if anything were to happen, it would be suspicious.
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:40.720]  When we come back, we're going to talk about exactly what the Trump administration is doing
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:45.400]  because by and large, they're going after these people more than we've seen ever before.
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:48.600]  That's one of the many great things about the Trump administration.
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:50.080]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:51.080]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:56.160]  We'll be back after this break.
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:57.960]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:02.560]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:03.560]  by you.
[1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:08.400]  The symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:13.360]  and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:17.880]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:18.880]  across America.
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:20.880]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:23.400]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:26.440]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:27.440]  healthier I feel.
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.080]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:34.400]  Heart and body over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:37.720]  a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:59.120]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:00.840]  without all the speculation.
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:06.160]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:10.480]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:13.800]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:17.680]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:21.840]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:26.320]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:32.360]  lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:33.360]  each month.

[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:48.680]  Call now 800-600-3388 800-600-3388.
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:51.320]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:56.720]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:03.280]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:10.800]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity.
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:17.320]  Whoever's behind it know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:22.000]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  position is here on this planet and that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:35.720]  to seek God's countenance, God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency
[1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:40.920]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:45.400]  will be exposed to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:51.080]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully but it's already tilting towards
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:53.560]  a global depression because of energy crisis.
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:56.760]  We're covering it all live on the radio at m4s.com.
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:01.000]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.880]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula you are supposed to rename it.
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.040]  That new formula is ultra 12.
[1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:12.440]  It's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:17.760]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:22.040]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:26.360]  produce healthy blood cells essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on.
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:30.680]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:34.680]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:37.040]  Bottom line folks you need ultra 12.
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:44.120]  It helps sun the m4 war towards a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at m4store.com.
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:49.400]  Again we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:20:07.560]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at m4slive.com.
[1:03:32.340 --> 1:20:23.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:28.160]  I'm filling in for Alex today, he just did a very important podcast with a very high
[1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:29.160]  profile person.
[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:31.320]  I'm looking forward to seeing that drop.
[1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:33.680]  We have Patrick Halley with us via Skype.
[1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:38.360]  He's going to tell us what the Trump administration is doing to fight back against these child
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:40.120]  trafficking cults.
[1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.400]  But first we do have to take a moment here.
[1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:44.520]  I'm just being completely honest folks.
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:51.960]  I am a big supporter of infowarstore.com and it is very rare that you can get up to 75%
[1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:58.240]  off on dozens of products at infowarstore.com and this deal, again I have no idea how Alex
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:03.320]  makes these things happen but I'm guessing this is going to end very soon.
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:05.720]  Alex and I have had these conversations.
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:13.240]  He is trying to expand as rapidly as humanly possible and this is in the face of such insane
[1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:17.440]  censorship that it has nothing like this has ever been seen before.
[1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:21.480]  There has never been censorship like what has happened to Alex Jones.
[1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:23.440]  On Facebook you're not allowed to say the man's name.
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:28.760]  In fact for a couple hours, about a month ago, Facebook would actually let you plot
[1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:30.840]  Alex Jones' death.
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:32.640]  You could assassinate Alex Jones on Facebook.
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:35.000]  Facebook was saying you could break the law essentially.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  They changed it back though.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  It's okay.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:43.760]  75% off the new total gut health combo pack with 7 powerful formulas, 75% off.
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:48.440]  There's 50% off super male vitality and you get a free bottle of ultimate female force,
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:55.680]  63% off the best selling Myco ZX plus fungus and yeast support, 50% off Ultra 12, Vitamin
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:22:00.480]  B12, 60% off the super blue immune gargle.
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:03.600]  If you travel, I cannot stress this stuff enough.
[1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:04.600]  Silver works.
[1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:07.360]  Silver is one of the best things you can do for immune support.
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:10.560]  50% off bodies, many, many other.
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:17.160]  This is your opportunity to stock up while the deals are this deep at infoworsstore.com.
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:21.320]  I cannot suggest it enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:22.320]  Okay.
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:25.800]  So we have Patrick Halley here with us via Skype.
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:30.360]  Patrick is a reporter for NationalFile.com as well as TheEpicTimes and again, congratulations
[1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:31.360]  Patrick.
[1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:34.800]  It's a fantastic place for these stories to be disseminated.
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:39.840]  Patrick, you are a big proponent of President Trump because by and large, he is one of the
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:47.280]  few people who is fighting back against this Clinton aligned mess of cults and everything
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:48.280]  else.
[1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:50.400]  So Patrick, tell us what is the Trump administration doing?
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:54.080]  Are they doing enough and what are they doing to fight back against this?
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:59.480]  Trump's been fighting this for years and it remains to be seen whether they're doing enough
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:01.320]  because we're going to have to see the results.
[1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:03.360]  That's all that really matters in human history.
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.640]  I will tell you that on October 1st, the Family First Act goes into effect.
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:13.280]  President Donald Trump last year quietly slipped this in as an addition on the bottom
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:15.560]  of a short-term spending bill.
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:20.000]  Knowing that Congress had to pass a short-term spending bill, Trump secretly put something
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  into that bill called the Family First Act, which passed into law without anyone knowing.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.680]  And what it does is it de-incentivizes the taking kids out of their houses and putting
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:34.000]  them into foster care and then adopting them.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:39.040]  I heard from a man yesterday in Oklahoma who said that he had just lost his kids.
[1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:40.120]  He was a cook at Chili's.
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:41.880]  He had a hard episode at work.
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:45.840]  They didn't file an official report to say what happened that he had a hard episode because
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:49.520]  the manager was an illegal alien and didn't want an official report.
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.840]  That put him into the CPS system.
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:56.280]  And after 15 months, there was no choice, the kids get adopted out, so his family is
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:57.280]  gone.
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:58.560]  He said, why am I even an American at this point?
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:23:59.560]  I don't have a family.
[1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:00.560]  I don't have a job.
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:02.640]  I don't have any constitutional rights.
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:07.240]  That's what's happened ever since these financial incentives were put in place in 1997 for child
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:10.000]  protective services to human traffic kids.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.840]  So on October 1st, Trump on a state-by-state level is going to start taking some of those
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:15.680]  financial incentives away.
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:20.360]  On October 4th, the Trump administration is holding an emergency meeting on the same day
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:25.720]  that parents are rallying at the state capitol in Sacramento, and the Trump administration
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:30.640]  is going to discuss an emergency response to the child sex trafficking epidemic.
[1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:34.640]  The State Department under Mike Pompeo has already confirmed that the foster care system
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:36.840]  is the breeding ground of human trafficking.
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.720]  80% of kids in this country who are child sex trafficked came through the foster care
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:43.720]  system, or their migrants who are coming up over the border.
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:49.000]  So the Trump administration is being forced, and Trump has been doing this for years, but
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.360]  his administration now is being forced to actually do something about it because of
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.600]  the constant public outcry and the reporting of all the facts that are coming out about
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:58.960]  what's really going on.
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:03.400]  This is human slavery, and there's no freedom in this country as long as this is going on.
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:10.000]  So let's not pretend like we still live in the country of freedom and liberty, and the
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.680]  Constitution still means anything if the government is coming by and taking kids out of your house
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:16.280]  and sex trafficking them.
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:17.880]  That's the worst thing that can happen.
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:22.400]  Pat Dirk, we've got a few minutes left here, and I kind of want to thread some of this
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:27.880]  together because we know that the girls, the women, it's mostly children who come in from
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:29.040]  Central America.
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:35.440]  Something like 86% of them are raped as they come into the United States illegally.
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:40.520]  We also know, thanks in no small part to your reporting, I cannot suggest high enough that
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:45.520]  people go follow at Halley Reporter on Twitter where he puts out his information first.
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:52.000]  But we now know, again, thanks to you, that Nexium was bringing in illegal immigrant teenage
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.600]  girls and telling them that they are essential slaves.
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.280]  They have no freedom.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:03.640]  So how does stopping illegal immigration, and President Trump is building the wall with
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:09.400]  all of the roadblocks that he's encountered, it is still going up, he is forced Mexico
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:13.880]  to stop some of these crossings, how does this tie together illegal immigration and
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:16.240]  human trafficking?
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:22.000]  The media's outcry over separating children from their parents at the border is all predicated
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.720]  on a diversion.
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.960]  Everything they tried to do, they hide it in plain sight.
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:30.520]  Now they were, the Democrats were colluding with Russia on Uranium One, and so they created
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:33.440]  a public spectacle about Trump being allied with Russia.
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:37.200]  What's going on is that they're trafficking these kids up using human traffickers and
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:40.360]  most of the parents are not actually related to the kids.
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:44.880]  So if they create as much of a spectacle in the media and as much outrage about supposedly
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:48.280]  separating these kids from their parents, they can conceal the fact that they're not
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:49.840]  actually the parents.
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:55.080]  When Trump put in this DNA testing at the border to give the people a cheek swab and
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:27:01.680]  do rapid DNA testing at the border, they found immediately 30% of the parents who were taking
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:04.800]  the kids over the border were not actually the parents, they were frauds.
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:08.160]  Some of them even turned around before the DNA test and admitted to this and went back
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:09.480]  to Guatemala.
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:14.000]  So the ACLU and CNN are now fighting the DNA testing.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Well, why?
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:21.200]  I mean, wouldn't you want to know if these are real parents who are related to the kids?
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:22.200]  It's all a joke.
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:24.360]  They're on the side of human trafficking.
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:27.160]  They don't want it to be exposed that these are human traffickers.
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:32.600]  And so they're trying to hide this barbaric practice in plain sight by diverting and making
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:37.040]  people think that the Trump administration has some kind of fascist policy at the border.
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:40.120]  Patrick, you are absolutely on fire, my friend.
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:41.320]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:42.840]  We've got about a minute left here.
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:46.880]  Would you please tell us, again, I know it's at Howley Reporter, maybe tell us how to spell
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:49.800]  your name, tell us where people can watch you, where people can find you, where people
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:51.560]  can find your work.
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:58.120]  At Howley Reporter, H-O-W-L-E-Y, Howley Reporter, and please go there.
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:03.320]  And I'm going to have another big article for The Epic Times later today about the political
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:08.120]  targeting, about how there are fake CPS reports being filed because the left wing knows that
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:14.320]  they can use this fraudulent agency, CPS, to weaponize against Trump supporters.
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:15.960]  And so that's what we're dealing with.
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:17.880]  Every Trump supporter is on the front lines.
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:22.120]  We've got to stick together and we've got to stay vigilant going into this election.
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:27.040]  And I think that President Donald Trump probably will win so long as we don't have some kind
[1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:32.040]  of big event put forth by the globalists before election day.
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.640]  God bless you, my friend.
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:36.240]  Thank you so much for coming on The Alex Jones Show.
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:38.880]  That was, again, Patrick Howley at Howley Reporter.
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:40.760]  I hope he comes back real soon.
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:41.920]  I'm Tom Papert.
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:43.320]  This is The Alex Jones Show.
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:44.840]  Alex should be back.
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:48.560]  We'll find out if he's up to coming in studio in the next half hour.
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:51.160]  Thank you all so much for watching this very important broadcast.
[1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:54.760]  We will be back after this break.
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:57.080]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.560]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:05.520]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:08.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:11.040]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:12.360]  I can help you, too.
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:15.360]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:17.560]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:25.800]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:29.560]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:34.320]  But if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:36.240]  at heart and body extract.
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:39.400]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:44.320]  Don't just take my word for it, check out all of the success stories at hbxtrack.com
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:53.200]  or to order call 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305, hbxtrack.com.
[1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:57.160]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:02.920]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[1:30:02.920 --> 1:30:05.720]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:10.400]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:15.160]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:17.760]  for their organs to be harvested.
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:22.880]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com, 15 years ago that
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:28.160]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:34.520]  and hundreds of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit,
[1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:38.560]  trying to control our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:44.440]  Chinese on every one of these issues and many others, we've been dead on and we've raised
[1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:46.560]  the alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:51.280]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical
[1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:57.360]  than ever to support the infowar, please support the infowar however you can.
[1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:03.160]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:07.600]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:10.680]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:12.440]  years as a bus seller.
[1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:18.120]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:23.000]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:24.480]  technology in it.
[1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:29.820]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[1:31:29.820 --> 1:31:35.560]  oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more, it's in two sizes, super
[1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:40.640]  silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're not going to find a product
[1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:44.160]  that's good anywhere, you're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds
[1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:50.920]  the infowar at InfowarsLife.com, get your super silver skin cream today, we can only
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:56.640]  run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:31:56.640 --> 1:32:01.520]  I know most of you realize this but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly, you are
[1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:06.880]  just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Infowars and we are the individuals
[1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:10.160]  that have done the research to understand the global battle plan and we know how to
[1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:12.920]  take them down, that's why they're so upset.
[1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:17.200]  Think how far we've come together, you know even if we were losing, we'd all still keep
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:21.720]  fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:27.120]  New World Order who've really taken the mask off, the lines in the sand for everybody now
[1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:31.400]  but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the
[1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:32.400]  unborn.
[1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:36.840]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist
[1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:42.640]  in the arena and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:45.640]  for this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[1:32:45.640 --> 1:32:50.080]  We've got some giant specials running right now at infowarsstore.com, a lot of items pretty
[1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:51.080]  percent off.
[1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:59.920]  Please take advantage of it at infowarsstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:17.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:17.560 --> 1:33:22.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:30.640]  You are listening to Alex Jones for my whole life.
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:41.840]  I didn't know if I even really existed, but I do, and people are starting to notice.
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:46.840]  You think this is funny?
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:53.840]  Is this a joke to you?
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:34:07.800]  Every one small thing, yeah, bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker and the criminals
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:12.240]  are running the asylum that they want to have a blood feast on us like they had in communist
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:18.680]  China 60 plus million and Soviet Russia 50 plus million and Hitler 40 plus million total
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:21.320]  dead including 20 million Germans.
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:25.960]  If you want to be part of this blood feast, you're invited to dinner, but on the table
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:38.640]  like a suckling hog.
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:41.960]  October 4th, mark your calendars.
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:48.040]  That's the date we're all told by Hollywood and the corporate media breathlessly that
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:58.480]  Joaquin Phoenix's greatest role in Venice and France, the Joker, it's coming out and
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:04.840]  the critics that have seen it in the screenings, they say that the mere mortals can't even
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:09.640]  understand the plot because it's so sophisticated, it's so incredible.
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:13.480]  Well, let me give you a spoiler alert.
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:18.960]  There's nothing sophisticated about the film, I've been given a full synopsis by contacts
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:24.680]  I have inside that vampire kingdom known as LA and it matches with the leaks and reviews
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:25.680]  I've seen.
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:31.400]  I'm about to tell you exactly what happens in the movie and why it's being put out now
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:53.920]  and what its real message is to the public.
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:58.920]  Modern psychology and psychiatry is a new priesthood, it's only been around 200 years
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:00.080]  or so.
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:06.140]  But from my research, Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell and others have the best take on
[1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:12.160]  psychology as a lens, a thought system to see the world through, but it doesn't mean
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.840]  it's God, it doesn't mean it has all the answers and Hollywood and the entire psychological
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:24.840]  system has admittedly been used for more than 70 years to shape the minds and attitudes
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:29.040]  of not just the people in America, but the people of the world.
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:34.520]  Carl Jung talked about archetypes and the Joker is in the tarot deck, it's also in a
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:36.440]  deck of bicycle playing cards.
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:39.360]  Well, who is the Joker in archetype?
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:45.200]  He's a clown, he's a servant of the king, but he's allowed to speak his mind and entertain
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:47.000]  but also play tricks.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:54.400]  The exaggerated red lips and smiling teeth are not the smile of a friend, no it's the
[1:36:54.400 --> 1:37:00.560]  smile of a great white shark coming out of the water and attacking its prey, it's the
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:06.760]  smile of a lion or a tiger when it pulls back its lips to bite into you or your wife or
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:09.000]  your child.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.720]  It's the leering face of a pack of wild wolves chasing you through the woods.
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:23.160]  So at a primitive level, the Joker is a man beast, he is possessed, he is filled with
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:30.440]  a demonic intelligence that only the wild can give him because he's let himself go of
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:33.200]  any inhibition.
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:40.680]  The Joker is a human that has given himself over to the knowledge of evil that has empowered
[1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:44.960]  himself to do things others will not do.
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:50.440]  At least that's what your run-of-the-mill devil worshiper or Luciferian or Alistair
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:52.480]  Crowleyite will tell you.
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:55.200]  The truth is the Joker is a loser.
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:58.400]  People that bind to the archetype end up destroying themselves and a bunch of other
[1:37:58.400 --> 1:38:01.560]  people usually along the way with them.
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.440]  But in the DC universe, the last 70 years, he's Arthur Fleck.
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:11.800]  Now the filmmakers tell you over and over again, this is not the Joker of comic books.
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:16.360]  Oh no, this is entirely new and something really deep and special.
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:21.680]  Well the truth is the original Joker is an archetype of a very evil wicked person who
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:26.680]  only cares about themselves and wants to overthrow God's existing order and create a hell on
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:29.200]  earth that he controls.
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:34.440]  We saw that during the French Revolution which was admittedly carried out by Luciferians
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:40.800]  who wanted to overthrow civilization and even the family and set up hell on earth with themselves
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:41.800]  in charge.
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:47.160]  Oh and many of those pushing the French Revolution and other similar communist revolutions that
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:51.720]  came out of it in many cases would dress up when they went out to commit murders like
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:57.400]  clowns and that's really the true genius of the original comic book creators and people
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:38:59.280]  that made them popular like Stan Lee.
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:03.280]  They understood that they could take already existing characters that were real in the
[1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:08.960]  world and then take them and exaggerate them, put them on paper and on the big screen.
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:14.400]  Just as Greek gods were simply a hyped up version of traits that the Greeks saw in people,
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:17.200]  Hollywood has done the same thing today.
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:20.400]  Now let's get into the new Joker film itself.
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:23.680]  This individual lives with his mommy in her basement.
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:29.560]  He has Tourette's syndrome and laughs, it makes weird noises at inopportune times and
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:30.960]  gets beat up.
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.260]  He's disempowered.
[1:39:32.260 --> 1:39:33.920]  His life is hellish.
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:36.640]  The critics tell him that he sucks.
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:41.320]  Well isn't this Hollywood itself down 40% of the box office collapsing?
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:43.080]  Every other person's a comic.
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:45.700]  No one actually wants to work or raise a family.
[1:39:45.700 --> 1:39:51.320]  So this is that, again, archetype of the communist or of the Jacobin of the French Revolution
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:54.960]  that none of us are going to work, none of us are going to get jobs and the only way
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:02.240]  we're going to ever be successful is if we overthrow the big corrupt system that is Gotham
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:06.800]  and we go out and show them that we can be more evil than the system itself that we can
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:13.920]  mastermind and engineer and organize all these other people to carry out crimes.
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:21.600]  But like a sick twisted robin of loxley or robinhood, they do it to people in many cases
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:27.280]  that actually deserve it because the stagnant system needs to be burned down and rebuilt.
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:30.600]  And who better to do it than the Joker?
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:35.360]  If you go back to the original days of the DC universe with the Joker in the 50s and
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:43.600]  60s, we see someone who really enjoys poisoning the population, putting things into the water,
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:50.160]  the food or cosmetics or air that only when you come into contact with both of them does
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:52.400]  it actually hurt or kill you.
[1:40:52.400 --> 1:41:18.440]  Now I wonder where all those famous writers in the comic books got an idea like that because
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:22.640]  back at the time in the 40s and 50s it was a big debate about how the Soviets and the
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:28.280]  Nazis put fluoride in the water to dumb people down, lower their fertility and make them
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:58.240]  more easily manageable.
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:08.640]  And
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.720]  government policy book, how they're poisoning your water supply, how they'll take all children
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:19.320]  at birth and raise them in government dormitories and do medical experiments on them, and how
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:24.520]  they'll bring in total charity and put implants in your body to control every facet. You know
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:30.160]  what's funny? Even though this book's free online at major university websites, you little
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:35.000]  bastards out there are gonna go watch your TV and your movies, and you're gonna sit there
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:39.840]  and laugh at me right now and not check any of it out. Hollywood would love for you to
[1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:44.880]  believe that this is some new angle they come up with, but no, it's not. It's the angle they're
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:49.200]  obsessed with. It's why they can't come up with new ideas because they don't want to.
[1:42:55.200 --> 1:43:01.440]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:10.600]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity. Whoever's behind it
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:17.440]  know this, there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration, and now is the time to be
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:22.960]  more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet,
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:29.120]  and that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance,
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:35.360]  God's discernment, and to pray for peace, and to pray for transparency, and to pray that the
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:40.920]  very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war will be exposed to their
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:46.200]  attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped. Now we'll probably avert a new
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:52.080]  world war hopefully, but it's already tilting towards a global depression because of energy
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:55.160]  crises. We're covering it all live on the radio at info wars.com.

[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:11.960]  with their listeners and let us private label it. In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:18.920]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:24.440]  that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.

[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:38.200]  Now we come here about as conquerors but as liberators to return control of this city to the
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:44.040]  people. I'll get more into Joker in a moment but first let's go back to Dark Knight Risers with
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:50.760]  Ban and his whole French Revolution outfit and Fire Risers and we're bringing down society and oh
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:56.280]  it's so edgy. I went and saw the movie and said it's a communist Jacobin French Revolution push.
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:00.840]  What the left wants and then later I read a review where the director after it had been
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:07.800]  out a few months said that was the whole point. This is incredibly transparent. The French Revolution
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:14.040]  in mainline history books was carried out by the Illuminati set up by Adam Weissab in Germany.
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:19.640]  That was their model. They tried to hijack our revolution. George Washington wrote a bunch of
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:24.200]  letters that are in the National Archives. Here's one on screen talking about how this
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:30.280]  Luciferian cult of devil worshipers was trying to hijack our revolution. At first Thomas Jefferson
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:35.160]  thought they were good went over there and they almost killed him. If you want to understand the
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:43.080]  new Joker film understand Charlie Manson in the late 1960s going and killing Sharon Tate and cutting
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:49.800]  a baby out of her womb and then trying to blame it on black people to trigger a race war and he
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:55.560]  said he wanted a race war and that he had worked with the CIA and it turned out he had worked with
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:02.680]  them in MKUltra. Showhead Theodore Kaczynski the Yuna bomber that's LA Times Associated Press
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:07.400]  Washington Post. We're supposed to forget all of this and now Hollywood admits they're trying to
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:14.280]  cause a civil war by confiscating firearms by creating racial tension by staging events like
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:19.240]  Jesse Smollett got caught doing and hundreds of others where they've been caught and still hundreds
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:25.000]  of others where they have still gotten away with it. The system wants you to be a victim.
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:30.520]  They want to glorify people that are seen as victims. They want to glorify mental illness and
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:35.720]  are creating new ones all the time. You see the Joker he has Tourette syndrome. He's a loser. He
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:40.360]  lives in his mommy's basement and when you read the WikiLeaks from Hillary Clinton she's talking
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:45.480]  trash about how her supporters live in their mother's basements or all baristas and want more
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:51.640]  money from her but she can't deliver it to him but she's got to lie to them and that's what this
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:57.560]  film is all about. 90% of the college educations are worthless. They're designed to be worthless.
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:01.560]  You're going and paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for something where the job and the
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:08.200]  industry doesn't exist but then they tell you oh the conservatives have stopped us the nationalists
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:14.120]  the capitalists from bringing in this utopia where you're going to have jobs managing everything
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:20.520]  but because they haven't gone along with this the managed economy the carbon taxes the social
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:26.360]  workers running everybody's families we're going to have to have a violent overthrow and a tearing
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:33.400]  down of civilization to be able to carry this out and then then we'll have the utopia same thing
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:40.120]  we heard from Lenin Stalin Hitler Mao but all it created was a nightmare for the general public
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  that killed hundreds of millions of people and started giant wars but you see that's the whole
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:52.760]  point of this priesthood the priest of power George Arwell Eric Blair who actually worked
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:51:01.160]  for MI6 before that OSS worked in the Ministry of Truth for real at BBC wrote 1984 about the real
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:07.560]  world they were going to build he is O'Brien and Winston in the book he wrote essays admitting it
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:12.440]  and O'Brien tells him Winston we're here to trample people and be trampled we're here to
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:17.720]  make society ugly we're here to end the family and tear down everything and finally just kill all
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:24.680]  humans on earth we are the post-human movement we are Satan we kill still destroy and now you turn
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:30.440]  on NBC look at the London Guardian it's everywhere the post-human world how ugly humans are how bad
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:38.120]  we are so the very people telling the dumbed-down poisoned brainwash masses who went into debt
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:43.320]  for worthless educations that it's all the fault of Christians and nationalistic conservatives
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:48.840]  and that they've got to overthrow things to have a future that is the very Hollywood megabank
[1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:55.880]  chai combat and owned system pumping cultural poison into this nation to cause a massive
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:52:02.120]  collapse of civilization like they call for in clard and pivot strategies to then usher in
[1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:07.800]  their system of total control and authoritarianism and that's the model and that's why you see all
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:12.840]  the films about race war and death and destruction and the downtrodden going on and conducting
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:18.680]  mass shootings and mass killings and all the studies show that mass shootings are literally
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:24.680]  triggered when the media hikes them up and mentally ill people on medications that on the inserts
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:30.680]  admit they cause people to commit suicide or murder others but oh they've all been given
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:37.640]  liability protection this is an admitted plan by ultra rich running multinational corporations
[1:52:37.640 --> 1:52:43.080]  allied with the eu the chai comms and radical islam and others on record to destabilize the western
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:49.000]  world in the renaissance and overthrow it and bring in this tyranny all in the name of human
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:57.240]  empowerment they are the bullies the joker is the bully the power structure and the system
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:03.240]  is laughing at everyone and dangling in front of them the promise of something great and free
[1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:09.000]  health care and free school and free money and free jobs and free housing and free everything
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:13.880]  if you'll just sign on to their revolution but in the end all you get is death and destruction
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:19.320]  here's the good news these jokers would have you believe they're the most powerful card in the deck
[1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:24.200]  but when you know they're the joker when you know they're scammers when you know that they're
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:29.240]  trying to enslave you by creating a crisis they control and then a solution that they offer with
[1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:35.160]  a galleon dialectic they have no more power because the truth is ladies and gentlemen the ace
[1:53:35.160 --> 1:53:41.720]  of spades is knowledge and historical understanding and a good loving heart towards others but also
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:45.880]  the will to stand against these bullies these jokers and let them know you're not going to submit
[1:53:45.880 --> 1:53:51.400]  to them all they are is a scarecrow ladies and gentlemen trying to keep you from taking your
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:56.360]  destiny of being a free human being and they put all these sad pathetic people into these systems
[1:53:56.360 --> 1:54:02.440]  and suck their future and suck their dreams away and then offer them fiery communist revolution
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:08.840]  as a way to be empowered and every time the fools that do this end up being the first
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:17.640]  who are killed by their masters the joker wants to destroy gotham bring it down teach him a lesson
[1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:22.920]  well bill mars up there saying crash the economy to teach america's not to support trump the private
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:27.240]  fellow reserve is trying to crash the economy to teach us americans that populism and love in
[1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:33.800]  our country is not good it's incredible what real world terrorist real world jokers and
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:39.480]  veins these individuals are and hollywood thinks you're so stupid they're throwing it on your face
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:44.920]  and saying oh it's so complex you can't understand it i was watching bird box for 10 minutes it could
[1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:49.800]  see it was some signal over the cell phones making people kill themselves just like the kingsman
[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:54.440]  they're telling you what they're doing to you they're telling you how they're poisoning the water
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:58.600]  they're telling you how they're dumbing you down i want to be clear walkie and phoenix is a great
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:04.120]  actor i wish him the director is no harm but they're just carrying out an agenda a replay of the
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:08.760]  same thing that was shown over and over and over again the truth is it's not cool to be a violent
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:14.120]  revolutionary trying to overthrow families and overthrow culture and overthrow society so you
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:18.840]  can build something ugly on top of it and then act like you're actually a rebel you don't have to
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:24.600]  kill you don't have to become satanic to have power you don't have to go out and and do horrible
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:29.880]  things to to be somebody and show the world show the bullies that you're not going to put up with it
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:34.680]  but that's the left does they teach their minions in the colleges while they're giving them worthless
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:38.840]  degrees that you're all victims and then when there's nobody really victimizing them they go oh well
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:43.800]  there's microaggressions so you've got to go out and take over society you've got to brainwash people's
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:48.920]  children you've got to get control of education so that these evils don't happen to you anymore and
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:56.280]  really you're just a bunch of idiots following the joker and his operation well the age of the
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:02.520]  jokers come into an end but hollywood sees the joker as their identity and that's why they put him
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:08.440]  up there and celebrate him because that's their archetype the con man the scam artist the pedophile
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:14.680]  the serial killer the hitler the Stalin the mal you can take the ace of spades in your hand
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:19.880]  anytime you want and start being a straight and strong and truthful person and standing up to
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:25.800]  build a better safer good community and rediscovering the values that made america the greatest nation
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:39.240]  in the history of the world we are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:55.160]  you the people americanism not globalism will be our credo yes i have thought an awful lot
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:57:01.720]  about blowing up the white house huge nationwide protests erupted once again on president donald
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:14.520]  trump's second weekend in office when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:27.320]  prejudice when america is united america is totally unstoppable and most importantly

[1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:57.480]  the surf satan who are in control of this planet believe that if they can organize enough crises
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:04.360]  that they control they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:09.400]  known as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control and manipulate every
[1:58:09.400 --> 1:58:15.640]  facet of our lives at first they give you just a few basic things to do don't support trump

[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:21.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show tom pampered still sitting in for alex that was another fantastic
[2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:32.120]  report by mr jones himself so it's almost time for that bizarre facebook event storm area 51 they
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:37.320]  can't stop us all well i i think they probably can i would never recommend such a thing i mean
[2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:42.200]  you're essentially talking about an insurrection against the us government but it's very i mean
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:47.640]  i think it's just a facebook meme i don't think anybody really has an intention to storm area 51
[2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:52.440]  and it kind of seems like a distraction but what's been fascinating is all of the responses
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:59.720]  from the united states government we now have another from the daily star area 51 has secrets
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:09.960]  that deserve to be protected warns us air force general what i i think they're taking the meme
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:15.000]  a bit too seriously us air force officials have already warned they stood ready to defend the
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:22.680]  military base now we have general dave gold fine he's issued a strong warning against anyone planning
[2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:30.040]  to tour storm area 51 to see them aliens area 51 has secrets that deserve to be protected
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:37.800]  it's a very strange situation especially when you consider that the us navy has now essentially
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:44.120]  admitted that yes you're tracking ufo's you're tracking it's it's a strange time to be alive
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:48.840]  is it not ladies and gentlemen strange flying objects captured on video by a navy
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:54.360]  finder pilots off the coast of san diego in 2004 and atlantic waters in 2015 were acknowledged by
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:02:00.440]  the navy as unidentified aerial phenomena last week we've got a clip on that let's go ahead and
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:08.520]  air some of this clip here if we can clip 10 to the control room official usg footage brought
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:16.280]  to you exclusively by the navy second of three us military videos of unidentified aerial phenomena
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:21.960]  been declassified this is the only official footage that has been released that was taken
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:31.640]  during the 2004 nemes incident they can aboard us navy f a 18 super hornet footage was captured
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:40.200]  by tracking systems most advanced on the market here you can see their display information
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:43.560]  giving some background information about what we're going to see here
[2:02:44.840 --> 2:02:48.520]  sensors in the tv visual mode sourcing is a camera
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:03:01.320]  sensor zoom is only 1.0 sensor aimed six degree above the aircraft axis
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:09.720]  breaking down exactly what we're going to see showing the speed radio viewers radio listeners
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:18.040]  explaining the hot and cold white is hot black is cold
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:32.920]  here is our unidentified phenomena in the air and this comes by the way as bernie sanders has
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:44.280]  made part of his campaign a promise to declassify the ufo's now i am by no means a ufo truther
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:54.120]  but it is just fascinating to see the military confronting an internet meme as this type of
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:04:03.160]  information becomes public for the first time many will remember in wiki leaks former astronauts
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:14.840]  begging a potential quintan administration to declassify ufo's it's really bizarre it's a
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:21.400]  bizarre time to be alive when we come back we're going to talk about reality tv or as i like to
[2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:27.160]  call it the presidential election in 2020 because there's a new headline out reality tv story

[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:56.120]  past decade or so i come from the broadcast industry originally and there is nothing innovative
[2:06:56.120 --> 2:07:01.720]  about it so this is a it's a very peculiar article but i think it says something about where our
[2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:07.640]  society is going as declining ratings crunch budgets unscripted writing talents continue
[2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:11.480]  to put in some of the small screen's most punishing hours quote there's not enough
[2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:17.800]  adderall to stay awake oh i'm sure there's enough adderall for you natalie is a pseudonym
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:22.360]  used in this article was scrambling for a job last spring when she received an offer to work
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:27.720]  in the latest season of ease keeping up with the kardashians a story producer with 13 years of
[2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:32.360]  experience natalie had been hired for another show that fell apart so she was grateful to receive
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:40.440]  the offer until production company buna murray called her with the rate $1,100 a week i don't
[2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:45.720]  know who can't live off $1,100 a week is that how inflated these people's ego and lifestyle is
[2:07:45.720 --> 2:07:50.120]  what do they do where are they living and the ritziest new york neighbor it's it's bizarre
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:56.440]  she says i audibly gasped she depended on her usual rate of $2,500 a week to support her family
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:02.200]  with an average of 1.9 million total viewers in its 16 season kardashians remains an influential
[2:08:02.200 --> 2:08:07.000]  show and natalie was being offered little more than what a production assistant makes in a week
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:13.720]  she said it made me angry because i knew that someone's going to take that job people really
[2:08:13.720 --> 2:08:21.560]  don't like the free market do they but since 2016 reality tv has been on its way out something
[2:08:21.560 --> 2:08:25.400]  that people predicted would happen much earlier they thought it would be a flash in the pan
[2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:31.880]  in the mid 2000s and it would be over but i think i know the reason and that's reality is just
[2:08:31.880 --> 2:08:37.160]  getting interesting thanks to president trump i would say and the bikes of alex jones so they're
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:42.360]  puffing up elizabeth warren pocahontas for those who haven't noticed this this is the left's attempt
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:48.840]  to recreate the magic 2016 and 15 with president trump this is an article up at heavy.com and
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:54.760]  maybe we can show some of these photos on screen thousands hack elizabeth warren's new york rally
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:09:00.760]  look at these crowd-sized photos there's a couple things right off the top one this is outside and
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:05.480]  so it makes it kind of difficult to tell exactly how many people are there too wouldn't it be nice
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:09.480]  if president trump could do a rally outside i would i don't think that would end well for the
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:15.880]  president i there's too many security risks but warren because she is a puppet because she is
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:21.080]  what the globalist wants she can do a rally outside but you notice these are supposed to be
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:26.440]  crowd-sized photos they're tight shots are they doing to her what they do to president trump and
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:33.320]  they don't show the crowds it does make you wonder but she says her campaign says i should say 20,000
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:41.480]  people in attendance there's another article nbc wall street journal poll biden leads democrat
[2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:49.080]  2020 field but warren's support is growing it's very interesting i mean i think alex predicted
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:54.120]  years ago and i think i did too that warren would be the globalist pick to run against
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:00.440]  president trump in 2020 so it's very it's fascinating the way this is going but
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:09.320]  but here's another one from ct post new focus on crowd size as warren vint rivals trump you see
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:14.520]  the democrats have been kind of in panic mode these last several years as their crown sizes
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:21.240]  have been non-existent we all remember jeb bush he was lucky to get 15 people in a room the democrats
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:27.080]  have been largely the same veto a roark who wants to take your guns recently god i think what
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:35.320]  15 people in a room he met in a in a kindergarten school classroom here recently so president trump
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:42.280]  is rightly mocking Elizabeth warren's crowd by the way this was in new york city the epicenter
[2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:47.960]  of all liberal debauchery right up there with los angeles said anybody could do that
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:54.520]  mocking her openly and i think that's a good point because here is a story or here's a tweet i
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:59.960]  should say from brad parscale president trump's campaign manager going into 2020 it's also he's
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:06.120]  also the digital strategist from 2016 at real donald trump rally in new mexico was a data goldmine
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:13.880]  45 000 people registered for tickets 94 percent were from within new mexico 78 percent of registrants
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:21.960]  matched to voter file over 20 percent voted in one or zero of the last four elections meaning
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:28.360]  they might have voted in 2016 or they might not have voted in a decade or more 52 percent were male
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:33.320]  48 percent female great numbers for president trump i thought women hate the guy 40 percent were
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:42.440]  latino and 31 percent were democrat but that's the big thing right there 45 000 people 45 000
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  people registered for this rally but elizabeth warren's allegedly getting 20 000 even though it
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:51.480]  couldn't be confirmed and this is not something new by the way anybody who has been following
[2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:55.160]  president trump anybody who is watching this broadcast frankly will remember this little
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:12:03.320]  blast from the past august 21st 2015 it's a cnn article 30 000 turnout for trump's alabama pep
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:10.920]  rally this has been happening since 2015 and that's why the democrats are trying to puff up
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:17.080]  elizabeth warren she is their answer she's their answer that's how pathetic things have really gotten
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:24.520]  because of course warren has simply adopted the majority of bernie sanders platform and she's
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:31.320]  going to be the globalist pawn the sheepdog who will lead them all back to globalism the fascinating
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:37.960]  thing to see but speaking of the reality tv type situation we're in have you noticed they're using
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:42.600]  children so we had sof she was on info wars a couple months ago y'all remember the 14-year-old
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:48.040]  wonderkin who is devastating the internet with her commentary well she's been banned she's gone now
[2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:53.400]  not really because you can ban people and they still exist but the left is trying to puff up this
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:13:01.480]  european climate change activist who is a young child and let's let's just roll this bizarre clip
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:07.240]  if we can back in the control room who ends climate change representative gretta thunberg has been
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:12.840]  hailed by comedian sarah silverman as the second coming thunberg has made rounds on the left's
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:20.840]  propaganda circuit everyone always asks me about donald trump uh but i mean my message for him is
[2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:27.800]  just listen to the science and he obviously doesn't do that is it that climate change strikes you as
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:36.680]  so big that you feel you felt moved by that yes i mean the climate crisis is the biggest crisis
[2:13:36.680 --> 2:13:43.960]  humanity has ever faced and if we don't do anything right now we we're screwed sweden in germany people
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:48.040]  are starting to call it the gretta effect where people are taking more trains since you started
[2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:52.520]  this movement they've said they feel ashamed to fly unnecessarily in europe all of this after
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:57.880]  thunberg sailed from england and new york representing the un's tyrannical sustainability
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:04.520]  goals on her so-called zero emissions voyage but the zero emissions trip was a scam as four
[2:14:04.520 --> 2:14:10.360]  sailors had to fly to new york and relieve the crew to take the ship back regardless the arrogance
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:16.440]  of the un and the media supporting thunberg hailed her as victorious she wants governments to act
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:22.280]  to save kids like her from climate devastation as the governments can regulate it and if you dare
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:28.760]  criticize her not only are you a child bully but you are someone who's mean to people with
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:34.120]  disabilities and this is how they have it set up she's the perfect from beginning to end uh
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:38.920]  you know puppet slash spokesman for this movement because she embodies everything that they want to
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:45.400]  do doctorate kids intimidate their opponents uh and come up with with platitudes of utter nonsense
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:50.440]  on a minute by minute basis if you follow her on twitter you can find the same arrogance like the
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:56.440]  kind found at the recent gastro summit talk given by the behavioral scientist and marketing strategist
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:02.120]  magna sotaland from the stockholm school of economics which he titled can you imagine eating
[2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:07.480]  human flesh sotaland claims that since food sources will be scarce in the future people
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:12.680]  must be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting among them human
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:19.160]  flesh as the epoch times wrote what sotaland doesn't mention curiously is the long documented
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:24.920]  science on the biological effects of cannibalism a tribe called the four lived in isolation so
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:30.600]  there you have it the new globalist actor they're desperately trying to salvage the narrative

[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:13.080]  essentially bent them over a barrel and they're now preventing some of this cartel violence some
[2:23:13.080 --> 2:23:18.440]  of the human trafficking from getting into the united states but there's a special report that i'd
[2:23:18.440 --> 2:23:23.560]  like to air on this very subject if the control room can go ahead and bring that up whenever you're
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:30.920]  able to it is the first ever global agreement on migration and even if the document is purely
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:37.720]  symbolic for the united nations its adoption is historic we are on the eve of a truly remarkable
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:44.760]  moment in the pursuit of the better management of international migration a singular issue of our
[2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:49.400]  time there are communities fighting back against becoming dumping grounds for the cloward and
[2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:55.400]  piven style united nations engineered replacement migration of sovereign nations however finding
[2:23:55.400 --> 2:24:01.000]  their message on mainstream media is a fleeting reality in fact a quick search of protests against
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:07.080]  immigration leads you to pro immigration protesters against the agencies keeping our borders safe
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:13.400]  you're looking at a protest on fifth avenue in new york organized by the closed the camps nyc
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:20.520]  coalition the message for microsoft stop using your technology to facilitate the us immigration
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:26.600]  policy immigrations and customs enforcement opened up classrooms the dining hall where families get
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:32.840]  three meals a day a library with internet and legal resources and a barbershop commissary in
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:38.920]  courtroom sharing what the office says happens inside the center where women girls and boys 15
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:44.200]  and under wait for the results of credible threat hearings so they could see exactly the care
[2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:48.200]  in the conditions under which these individuals are being kept there's a lot of
[2:24:48.200 --> 2:24:58.760]  um ugly rhetoric that is out there with regard to my agency um and dhs as a whole to include cpp
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:04.680]  and with regard to the people that are enforcing the laws that congress has passed
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:14.120]  and calling us names and vilifying us for doing the jobs that we are sworn to do that congress
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:23.400]  appropriates seven billion dollars a year to this agency to effectuate um it's not right
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:30.440]  it's not fair and frankly it's not helpful what if we truly aren't safe in our communities due
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:35.640]  to the policies of the left as they kowtow for the united nations wouldn't these protesters
[2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:41.400]  simply be supporting unchecked violence against legal residents are they not aiding and abetting
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:47.320]  the thousands of quietly reported cases and unreported cases of rape and murder waged against
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:52.600]  innocent and unsuspecting people by illegal aliens instead the left would have our second
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:57.800]  amendment destroyed and the borders flung wide open hell yes we're going to take your ar-15 your
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:04.200]  ak-47 we're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow americans anymore for example
[2:26:04.200 --> 2:26:12.680]  from 2011 until 2017 there were 367 killed by mass shootings in the united states while a 2017
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:19.080]  report by the texas department of public safety reveals that from june 1st 2011 to february 28th
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:27.320]  2017 the 215 000 criminal aliens who were booked into texas jails were collectively charged with
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:39.400]  566 000 offenses including 1167 homicides and 6098 sexual assaults with a total of 257 000 convictions
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:45.800]  and that was just texas the numbers don't lie your chances as a us citizen of being killed by an
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:51.000]  illegal immigrant are far higher than a citizen being killed in a mass shooting recently in
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:57.320]  rockville maryland protesters gathered to support taking their community back i live out here in
[2:26:57.320 --> 2:27:05.560]  maghreb county all my life and now as you can see maghreb county has become a sanctuary for rapists
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:13.720]  child rapists these children come here to escape that type of terror and it's happening right here
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:19.720]  and we are enabling it what is montgomery county and the county executive with this executive order
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:24.360]  what do you believe they're doing wrong i believe that they're endangering every single citizen
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:32.040]  in this county because they are actively obstructing local state and federal cooperation on
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:37.640]  fundamental matters of public safety and national security we should have learned after 9 11 that it
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:43.640]  is key that we have walls that come down on communicating the immigrant status of criminal
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:50.600]  suspects in custody and this order is the most radical sanctuary order in america and this county
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:55.400]  is ground zero for that let's get some facts on the table you mentioned that i'm from german town
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:28:02.120]  two of the victims of illegal alien criminal rape suspects were from german town one was a 16-year-old
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:07.480]  girl who was taking a nap in her own home when a home invader who had been previously deported
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:15.240]  living this an alleged interview and across the pond now there is completely no exaggeration
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:21.880]  but pretty much a vietnam level of death that happens every single year in mexico
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:30.840]  30 000 people die that could come to the united states and by the way it's a little bit more dead
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:40.440]  than from assaults right that terrible ar-15 the ak-47 so scary looking those guys now what's
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:46.520]  scary is illegal immigrants coming here to sell drugs rape us kill us torture us mutilate us
[2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:51.480]  and everything that comes with it you're watching the alex jones show we'll be right back after

[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:25.800]  of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:30.280]  thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the

[2:31:59.160 --> 2:32:06.680]  giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia i was the first to warn of human animal hybrids
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:12.120]  and organ harvesting i was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:17.880]  they were born for their organs to be harvested i was the first to warn you along with paul watson
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:23.960]  and info wars dot com 15 years ago that google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record

[2:32:30.760 --> 2:32:35.400]  private run for profit trying to control our economy that our government hollywood have been
[2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:41.560]  taken over by the communist chinese on every one of these issues and many others we've been dead on
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:46.120]  and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale that's why the globalists are trying to shut us
[2:32:46.120 --> 2:32:52.040]  down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war please support the info
[2:32:52.040 --> 2:33:04.280]  war however you can you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:11.080 --> 2:33:16.280]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:33:16.280 --> 2:33:25.400]  welcome back to this third hour of the alex jones show i'm tom papper sitting in for alex
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:32.680]  today he will be back tomorrow and we will have mike adams of natural news posting the fourth hour
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:39.320]  the broadcast but let's turn our attention to really just as big of an enemy of the american
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:45.960]  people as the mainstream media and that would of course be big tech anybody who watches alex
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:51.800]  jones frequently or at all knows that most of these companies are hedging their bets not just
[2:33:51.800 --> 2:33:59.800]  hedging their bets they're putting all the chips on china china is the new power according to facebook
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:07.800]  google twitter all of them and now we finally have a few allies in the united states senate
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:17.880]  to understand this senator josh holly is rather upset that google uber the big tech giants are
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:26.200]  dropping all of their money in communist china we've got a clip of senator holly let's go ahead
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:32.360]  and air that clip 13 i believe yeah my concern is that what we're seeing with silica valley is
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:36.600]  they're creating jobs if they're creating jobs in china i mean where they're prioritizing their
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:41.400]  investment overseas you know i mean look look at google google has worked overtime to try and
[2:34:41.400 --> 2:34:46.840]  open business ventures in china including being willing to launch a platform search engines
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:51.640]  that censor according to chinese communist government standards just so that they can rake in the
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:56.680]  box where's everything produced that apple for instance makes china so i'm concerned that we're
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:01.400]  they're building an economy in which american workers don't have anything to do american
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:06.840]  workers don't benefit uber i mentioned the uber economy because uber drivers get paid cents on
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:12.680]  the dollar in order to drive so who benefits from that uber executives they get rich just like google
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:18.760]  executives are rich and amazon executives are rich facebook but what about everyday american workers
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:24.200]  what's their place in this economy it's a problem do you think gig economy jobs make america better
[2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:29.000]  or worse place i mean it just depends they should be making america better and this is my challenge
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:33.480]  to these companies my challenge is if they want to be leaders you know they say they represent the
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:39.000]  best of america well that's true create jobs in this country if that's true invest in the middle
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:43.880]  of our society in the middle of the country but in the american middle of the middle class invest
[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:49.080]  here produce things here create jobs and opportunities for our families increased productivity
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:54.440]  they haven't been doing any of that senator ollie is really on to something there i mean these
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:36:01.080]  companies and look if you want to be a a sadist or a sociopath you can make the same calculation
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:07.480]  you can look at 350 million people in america plus you know 30 40 50 million illegal immigrants i'm
[2:36:07.480 --> 2:36:12.600]  sure you can look at that compared to billions and billions of chinese you can look at the fact
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:18.520]  that they have no labor laws you chain your child up like we would chain up a bike you chain your
[2:36:18.520 --> 2:36:22.440]  child up downstairs if somebody tries to commit suicide because of the work in the conditions
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:29.720]  the suicide net will catch them there is no escaping the orwellian chinese social credit system so you
[2:36:29.720 --> 2:36:34.920]  know your workers are going to be high quality meanwhile you look over here in america where
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:41.640]  we have unions we have rights we have freedoms we have the ability to actually uh demand something
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:48.200]  from our employers so what's the solution to this well as bush clinton obama all of the previous
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:54.440]  presidents more or less for the past half century if not longer have realized well just outsource all
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:37:02.040]  the jobs to china and will buy their stuff and we will become enslaved to the chinese communist
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:12.280]  infrastructure that's the future and you know i take a lot of ubers when i come here to austin to
[2:37:12.280 --> 2:37:17.480]  visit the infowars studios and it never fails these are people who are telling me yeah you
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:22.200]  know i wanted i used to have a factory job and well now i'm trying to get my real estate license
[2:37:22.200 --> 2:37:26.040]  and i'm just driving uber to put food on the table until i can get that done and then hopefully
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:32.520]  i can have a real job again because until trump came about there were no jobs in this country for
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:38.360]  normal human beings you know the whole learn to code movement which you can now get banned for on
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:44.680]  twitter that whole movement came about because when coal miners when factory workers when
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:51.400]  the people who represent the majority of middle class america when their jobs were exported to china
[2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:58.360]  what were they told by the liberal media just learn to code learn a new skill it's a changing
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:03.960]  economy and you got to find a place so i'm glad that we finally have josh holly in congress
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:10.680]  pushing back against this but i really want to stress that this is you might as well have
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:16.120]  elected alex jones to congress and i say that in a very very positive way because alex was
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:21.320]  in the halls of congress just over a year ago shouting at sundar p chi shouting at these big
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:28.200]  tech overlords saying exactly almost verbatim what senator holly was saying right there so
[2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:34.440]  seeing things like this make me optimistic for the future and optimistic that through congress
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:40.920]  through the trump administration through the fcc the f tc we might start to get some movement
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:48.040]  against big tech because as we said earlier we it's very clear what side these people are on
[2:38:48.040 --> 2:38:55.400]  facebook has pages for the islamic state and al qaeda twitter won't allow laura lumar on there
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:01.480]  won't allow alex jones on there won't allow hardly any info wars programming you have to be very
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:06.680]  subversive about it oh and shroyer is constantly banned and shadow banned and they end his videos
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:11.640]  earlier they run them without audio they're doing anything they can to game the system against
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:18.920]  patriots but oh well they let uh well they let himas have a twitter mas definitely gets a twitter
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:24.120]  so it's very clear what side these people are on they're on the side of anti america you know i
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:28.920]  used to joke that we used to watch certain broadcast outlets allege is ira russia today and
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:33.320]  they're fairly honest because you just know that they're being anti american and so that's their
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:38.040]  perspective but now we're to the point where facebook twitter youtube all of them have the
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:44.200]  same exact bias they want to see america fail they want to have our nice houses they want to have
[2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:50.920]  the freedoms that the rest of us do not get but they want america to fail i think that's
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:59.160]  completely obvious at this point so i want to change gears here many will remember last week news
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:07.560]  broke about a horrific discovery in south bend indiana say that's that's where pete boot edge edge
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:13.480]  lives i believe where's the butt guy i always get confused that's where pete lives may repeat
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:20.360]  pete everyone will remember that a stash of over two thousand aborted babies was discovered in a
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:28.920]  deceased former abortionist home and now a new report up on my site national file dot com
[2:40:30.280 --> 2:40:36.840]  according to the whole women's health alliance they say that these type of stashes exist nationwide
[2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:43.240]  they said what happens in south bend is a microcosm for what's happening statewide and
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:50.200]  what's happening nationally so if i guess if they can't sell the body parts they just hold
[2:40:50.200 --> 2:40:58.600]  on to them for keepsakes what type of sadistic fallen human being
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:05.320]  would do such a thing it really does make you wonder but in the article that was just on screen
[2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:12.840]  i mean mayor pete has said nothing about this two thousand dead babies discovered
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:19.240]  in his hometown where by the way they hate him now black lives matter protests against him the man
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:26.120]  has lost all popularity in his hometown mayor pete pete has said nothing after the discovery
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:31.800]  of over 2,200 preserved babies were found in the residence of the deceased doctor urick cluffer in
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:36.360]  south bend indiana all eyes turned to their mayor south bend indiana mayor and democrat

[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:38.520]  funny if this was some type of parody but it's real life cheerleaders punish for displaying

[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:10.520]  posed with the trump 2020 banner before a home football game this august in a statement to nbc
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:15.720]  charlotte the stanley county board of education said because the cheerleaders were in uniform
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:20.680]  and were acting as representatives of the school the display of the sign could be perceived as the
[2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:26.920]  school or school system endorsing a political campaign which they say is prohibited the school
[2:48:26.920 --> 2:48:32.360]  district says the goals were not disciplined simply ask not to do it again but days later the
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:37.800]  north carolina high school athletic association placed the cheerleading spot on probation telling
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:43.720]  the local newspaper that every contest should be conducted in a wholesome athletic environment
[2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:49.320]  an environment where good sportsmanship is shown where people feel safe that respect for all people
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:55.080]  participating is being shown and while some are cheering on that decision others cheering on the

[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:21.080]  so that everybody going into the game uh goes through the biggest trump rally they've ever
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:27.960]  been to that would be phenomenal so supporting president trump it might make people feel unsafe
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:35.240]  they could feel unsafe president trump orange man bad orange man scary these poor teenagers
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:38.360]  you know i have a feeling that if it were any other candidate you would not be having this
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:43.960]  especially if it was for president obama during the obama years but you know who exactly are these
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:50.120]  girls you know isn't joe biden should they be supporting creepy sleepy uncle joe we've got a

[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:22.600]  costs it would put it would put 720 million back million women back in the workforce it would
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:28.120]  increase the gdp to sound like a wonk here by about eight tenths of one percent it would grow the
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:36.440]  economy to sound like a wonky so sorry joe you don't sound like a policy wonk to me he's very
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:41.240]  sad honestly it's very sad i don't like joe biden i would never vote for the man in a million years
[2:50:41.240 --> 2:50:45.880]  but he used to be savvy you all know that he used to want to ban raves and he used to kind of have
[2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:51.800]  a cadence to the way he talked and he was very on the ball no longer no longer that's such a strange
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:58.120]  strange situation we're in with this creepy sleepy old guy 720 million women in the united
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:03.800]  states of america for those playing at home yes america's population of like 325 million people

[2:51:10.600 --> 2:51:15.880]  where we're going to get 300 million women i i'm not asking questions anymore it's the clown show
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:20.120]  so this is a story that's been out for a couple days but it bears repeating because we need to
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:28.440]  hold these people accountable ilian omar the democrat representative for minnesota she tweeted
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:36.920]  out in 2013 a father's day tweet that allegedly reportedly proves she married her brothers of
[2:51:36.920 --> 2:51:42.520]  course the biggest scandal that she has she allegedly married her own flesh and blood for
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:49.560]  the purpose of skirting united states immigration laws meaning it was a sham marriage i hope it
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:55.480]  was just a sham marriage so and now to lead a 2013 tweet representative ilan omar wished a happy
[2:51:55.480 --> 2:52:01.720]  father's day to her abo nurse iid which would mean her true name is ilan nurse iid the same surname
[2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:09.000]  yes her ex-husband who allegedly is her brother she's faced increasing scrutiny over what some say
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:13.480]  was allegedly a sham marriage to skirt united states immigration policy to help her brother
[2:52:13.480 --> 2:52:20.120]  Ahmed nurse iid gain a us citizenship many consider the father's day tweet to be proof
[2:52:20.120 --> 2:52:25.240]  that she lied about her identity here's what it said we can put it on screen perhaps with
[2:52:25.240 --> 2:52:31.320]  the document cam happy father's day to my abo nurse iid i am forever grateful to a law for
[2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:37.320]  giving me the best father and actually links to a deleted instagram post is of course she scrubbed
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:42.840]  her instagram apparently she didn't quite catch that they were up on twitter so according to
[2:52:42.840 --> 2:52:48.280]  immigration customs enforcement if anyone enter into a sham marriage for the purpose of evading
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:53.720]  us immigration law it is a felony offense carrying a prison sentence of up to four years
[2:52:53.720 --> 2:53:00.440]  and a fine of up to 250 000 dollars it applies to both foreign nationals and us citizens who
[2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:06.280]  perpetrate the crime you know it does make you wonder is anybody investigating this or is it
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:11.880]  ever going to be taken seriously or are we going the way of the uk which is an absolute mess when
[2:53:11.880 --> 2:53:17.320]  it comes to this type of thing this is another article up in national file dot com uk rejects ban
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:27.800]  on eating dogs to avoid offending foreign culture so if you don't eat toto from kansas what can i
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:34.680]  say then you are offending foreign cultures uk justice ministry has blocked a ban on eating
[2:53:34.680 --> 2:53:41.000]  cats and dogs over fear it may offend far east asians this is by the way the time of year that
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:45.160]  horrifying things happen in china i mean i'm sorry i don't i guess maybe i think my culture is the
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:49.480]  best i think that i should we should put america first but uh in china they're currently blow
[2:53:49.480 --> 2:53:54.360]  torching dogs to eat them that's uh this is just the time of year just the time of year the uk's
[2:53:54.360 --> 2:53:59.320]  politically correct authorities come under fire on a regular basis for their devotion to progressive
[2:53:59.320 --> 2:54:03.880]  ideals of inclusivity even if there are significant negative consequences and now environmental
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:10.440]  ministers have drafted a proposal that will prohibit the practice but it's been stopped
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:19.320]  oh my dogs are our companion animals we do not eat them but then they say just officials also
[2:54:19.320 --> 2:54:22.840]  argued that it would be difficult to enforce the law in the current ban on transporting
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:29.240]  or exporting dog and cat meat suffices so i guess you can pick up a dog at the pound and just eat it
[2:54:30.440 --> 2:54:35.640]  now we think things are bad here in the us where we have antifa saying that we need to
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:40.760]  put trump supporters in death camps that came out a couple weeks ago and it's still i don't
[2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:45.400]  know why i was surprised of course that's what they think but it still bothers me we have uh

[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:54.920]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:58:58.680]  we have been blessed at their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years it's been
[2:58:58.680 --> 2:59:05.640]  a best seller we convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:11.240]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology
[2:59:11.240 --> 2:59:17.800]  in it it's got the hyaluronic acid it's got the steric acid it's got the grapefruit essential oil
[2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:24.440]  it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more it's in two sizes super silver skin cream
[2:59:24.440 --> 2:59:29.160]  in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere
[2:59:29.160 --> 2:59:33.960]  you're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the info war at info wars life
[2:59:33.960 --> 2:59:40.680]  dot com get your super silver skin cream today we can only run this special for another week or so
[2:59:40.680 --> 2:59:49.720]  as I'm taping this september 10th you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:49.720 --> 3:00:03.160]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:00:10.760 --> 3:00:15.080]  hello and welcome to the fourth hour of the alex jones show this is mike adams from natural news
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:20.280]  step it in for this whole hour today we've got a lot coming up for you here covering some science
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:27.880]  bombshells that are the biggest you could say science red flags that they are trying to destroy
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:34.040]  our biosphere and annihilate humanity we've got new breaking news on that number one the gmo mosquito
[3:00:34.040 --> 3:00:42.200]  experiment in brazil has failed catastrophically and it has now unleashed super mutant gmo mosquitoes
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:46.600]  that could kill millions of people throughout south america central america and even in the
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:51.800]  united states eventually and this has caused genetic pollution of the mosquito population
[3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:57.320]  combining the genes from three different countries into one mosquito population it is an absolute
[3:00:57.320 --> 3:01:01.480]  catastrophe it's exactly the type of genetic pollution that we have been warning about
[3:01:01.480 --> 3:01:09.960]  for many years in fact i remember on info wars in 2012 seven years ago i was talking about this
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:16.760]  very issue with a save our science type of uh warning at that time that was in 2012 and here
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:21.400]  it is happening today but that's just one story of three big bombshell stories i have for you
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:27.400]  today the other one is about the global geo engineering slash chem trails program that's
[3:01:27.400 --> 3:01:33.480]  being funded in part by bill gates and being run by a harvard scientist to pollute the entire planet's
[3:01:33.480 --> 3:01:40.200]  atmosphere this is a stratospheric aerosol injection or as the bill gates funding is is
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:45.640]  promoting another program called scope x which stands for stratospheric controlled perturbation
[3:01:45.640 --> 3:01:50.760]  experiment this is designed to pollute the entire planet shut down photosynthesis
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:56.040]  collapse the food supplies globally and in today's broadcast here on info wars i'm going to
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:02.920]  go over the ramifications of that and why just honestly truthfully if you don't have a one year
[3:02:03.480 --> 3:02:09.960]  plan to survive without groceries you're going to you're going to be killed by this because
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:14.520]  the global food supply will collapse that's what this program is trying to achieve and it's now
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:19.960]  out in the open cnbc just released a big video on this a couple of days ago and they're touting
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:24.680]  the benefits of it basically chem trails are now being supported by the mainstream media the same
[3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:30.840]  media that three years ago said it was a conspiracy theory now it's mainstream you know cnbc
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:36.920]  saying it's awesome it's it's incredible all right and that's just the second story the third story
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:42.120]  i have for you today is about the evil tech giants and how they're trying to literally suck your
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:48.360]  blood now they're doing this through medical testing innovation i'm going to talk about the
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:56.040]  now defunct company theranos and elizabeth holmes and how it was actually a plot to harvest the blood
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:03:01.960]  and the dna of every american in your own home and then to upload the dna scans to a central
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:08.680]  database that would be used of course by the deep state the swamp the federal government the nsa to
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:13.960]  profile you genetically and to tie you to crimes that you didn't commit because you might share
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:19.320]  genes with some hair follicle that was left behind or a piece of skin left behind by some other criminal
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:25.000]  it's insane but they want your blood they're out for your blood it's not just the blood of children
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:29.720]  as you well know not just infanticide and abortions and all that insanity and how they're
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:34.920]  they're just mass killing children in the name of women's health they want your blood so they can
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:41.000]  track you and they can enslave you so we've got those three stories coming up here in this hour
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:47.240]  here on the alex jones show now alex is traveling of course right now i was told that he he's arriving
[3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:51.800]  soon in austin i think he'll be on the air tomorrow maybe tonight maybe he'll pop in
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:57.320]  during the last part of this hour we'll see but alex of course he released this information in
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:01.880]  the podcast yesterday he was on with jill rogan i think a five hour interview that'll probably be
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:08.200]  edited to a shorter version but alex sees the same thing that i see about what's happening this is
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:15.640]  the the an escalation of global events to try to destroy humanity this is the annihilation
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:19.720]  of the human race that we are witnessing and i hope you talked about that with joe rogan because
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:27.080]  joe needs to get the full picture of what's going on i'm talking about the i call it geogeneside
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:32.680]  this is the planned planet-scale genocide of the human race through multiple vectors
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:36.680]  not just the fluoride in the water supply not just the heavy metals and lead in the water
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:41.800]  not just radiation fukushima and all that not just the vaccines and 5g but much more so we'll
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:46.120]  get into that here on the alex jones show as we continue with the fourth hour stay with us
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:48.600]  we'll be right back in one minute for all those details
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:04:57.480]  hapies is a tincture that you take under the tongue you've been selling it for over a year

[3:06:06.360 --> 3:06:16.040]  joneshow with mike adams welcome back to the fourth hour this is mike adams here filling in for
[3:06:16.040 --> 3:06:21.000]  alex jones who is traveling today but we've got big bombshell news for you here let's start right
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:28.200]  into it number one the gmo mosquito experiment that was unleashed in brazil over the last two years
[3:06:28.200 --> 3:06:35.960]  has gone horribly wrong it has resulted in the breeding of super mutant mosquitoes that now combine
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:40.280]  some of the genes of mosquitoes from three different countries mexico cuba and brazil
[3:06:41.160 --> 3:06:45.880]  and these new super mosquitoes are now coming back with a vengeance because they've been genetically
[3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:50.920]  modified they've been turned into like mutant i don't know maybe you could call them super hero
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:56.360]  mutant mosquitoes or something and they are now stronger than ever and they're surging back in
[3:06:56.360 --> 3:07:02.040]  population and they now threaten the lives of millions of people in ways that they've never
[3:07:02.040 --> 3:07:05.960]  been threatened before this was all part of an experiment i mean let's back up on this we were
[3:07:05.960 --> 3:07:11.400]  told the science was that they were going to release all these males that were genetically
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:16.360]  modified and the males were going to be weakened with a dominant infertility gene and then they
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:21.320]  would mate with the females and then the females would have offspring that were sterile and through
[3:07:21.320 --> 3:07:26.200]  this mechanism we were told the whole system would collapse the mosquitoes would die off we
[3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:31.720]  wouldn't have these mosquito populations this is what we were told well uh guess what happened
[3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:37.480]  as in many of these experiments things that in the wild things happened that they did not
[3:07:37.480 --> 3:07:43.400]  anticipate in the laboratory so what really happened is at first yes the mosquitoes began
[3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:48.440]  to die off for about the first 12 to 18 months and this is reported by Yale and this has been
[3:07:48.440 --> 3:07:53.960]  reported in the science journal nature by the way so the first 18 months they started to die off
[3:07:53.960 --> 3:08:01.800]  but then something changed the females began to stop mating with the weakened males you hear
[3:08:01.800 --> 3:08:06.040]  me on this the females said no they don't want to reproduce with the weakened males and they
[3:08:06.040 --> 3:08:11.800]  started selecting males that had you know virility males that could have children males that could
[3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:16.360]  have offspring gosh if only liberals in california could be as smart as these mosquitoes that would
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:21.800]  be amazing but these female mosquitoes then started selecting males that could reproduce
[3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:27.480]  and then the population surged back but during this time some of the modified genes got transferred
[3:08:27.480 --> 3:08:32.760]  over to the population that's in the wild and this wasn't supposed to happen and in fact this
[3:08:32.760 --> 3:08:38.120]  was what these scientists at Yale are very concerned about we had a transfer of genes
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:43.640]  that was we were told that was impossible so now we have genetically modified super mosquitoes
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:51.000]  that are in the wild and they can't take it back they can't pull it back you can't put that back
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:57.720]  in the box it's it's it's in the wild now and so how many people I say how many people are going to
[3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:04.760]  die in brazil from dengue fever or you know all these mosquito-borne diseases you name it so many of
[3:09:04.760 --> 3:09:10.760]  them how many are going to die because of this science experiment gone wrong the number could
[3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:15.240]  be huge over the next decade it could kill a million or more people because of this experiment
[3:09:15.240 --> 3:09:21.880]  you know theoretically and they can't pull it back so we warned about this in 2012 we warned
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:26.920]  about the different levels of dangerous science and things that can be unleashed in the wild we
[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:32.360]  warned about you know chemicals being unleashed like fluoride and so on and that's one level of
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:38.360]  danger glyphosate pesticides all these things but a higher level of danger is what we call
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:45.000]  self-replicating pollution genetic pollution that continues to replicate and that's what these
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:49.800]  scientists have done and they forced it on us and they said their science was perfect it's going
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:54.120]  to work great they're going to save lives they said they're going to save lives with their twisted
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:10:00.680]  science and they banned us for daring to raise the alarm on this seven years ago people we raised
[3:10:00.680 --> 3:10:06.200]  the alarm seven years ago and what happened we get banned we get deplatformed but we were right the
[3:10:06.200 --> 3:10:11.000]  whole time we were the ones warning humanity about this and now it's happened and by the way
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:16.040]  the experiment hasn't been stopped and this is continuing I just got a text before the show
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:20.920]  from a couple that lives out in california they might be watching this right now they told me that
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:24.840]  based on their information other strains of genetically modified mosquitoes are being
[3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:28.920]  released in california I haven't confirmed that yet but that's what they're telling me
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:34.840]  they're already seeing very aggressive mosquito behavior that they didn't notice before so
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:40.920]  something is being unleashed on purpose as part of a massive depopulation scheme because the end
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:46.600]  result of this really is to kill more humans that's what's going on they're killing more humans
[3:10:46.600 --> 3:10:54.360]  and also just a quick note here about sexual reproduction in nature isn't it interesting
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:11:00.600]  that species adapt and overcome and they engage in sexual reproduction to achieve continuation
[3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:07.560]  of the species and even in mosquitoes they do not the females do not want to reproduce with
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:15.640]  the weakened feminized pathetic males and yet in our pop culture today especially on the west coast
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:21.880]  in you know liberal california you see feminization of the males you see the push for transgenderism
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:29.000]  you see the push for the mutilation of the genitalia of children you see this push for extinction
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:36.280]  and in the wild you see survival adaptation the animals are smarter than the progressives in
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:42.200]  california the insects are smarter than the progressives in california the insects choose
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:47.880]  life the progressives in california choose suicide and death and infanticide and abortion
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:57.400]  and just self-destruction i find that interesting at many levels all right next story but you know
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:01.480]  it'll be interesting to see if these gmo mosquitoes continue to be released all around the world and
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:06.840]  if they are you know it's a depopulation program because the science is already out that it doesn't
[3:12:06.840 --> 3:12:11.960]  work to reduce mosquitoes so that can't be the plan anymore the Yale scientists have already
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:17.160]  proven it they did the dna analysis so it's all about depopulation of humans it's all about
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:23.480]  breeding a weaponized strain of mosquitoes in order to kill human beings and that's consistent
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:28.600]  with everything else that we've been seeing about killing human beings and with that note
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:34.920]  let's go to geoengineering now i did a story yesterday this was interesting now you're probably
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:39.720]  already aware because you're a super informed audience you know more than anybody that watches
[3:12:39.720 --> 3:12:45.480]  the mainstream media you know that bill gates has been funding this global pollution scheme called
[3:12:45.480 --> 3:12:51.080]  scopex it's the scopex project stratospheric controlled perturbation experiment and this is
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:56.760]  with harvard scientists by the way and their plan is to pollute the skies they want to block the sun
[3:12:56.760 --> 3:13:03.560]  this is their plan to reflect sunlight back into space so to deprive plants on earth the sunlight
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:08.200]  that they need in order to function as plants this is about shutting down photosynthesis
[3:13:08.200 --> 3:13:13.160]  which is the basis of all sustainable life on our planet and there you go if you're watching it shows
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:18.200]  the airplanes releasing pollution into the stratosphere and this pollution will consist of
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:23.320]  sulfur dioxide and calcium carbonate which is contaminated with lead what it means is that they're
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:30.440]  going to drop lead and pollution all across the entire planet in the stratosphere they're going
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:35.960]  to let poison the entire planet now lead according to a study in the land set that we covered last
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:44.680]  week kills in america 412 000 americans every year lead we're talking low level lead contamination
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:49.240]  and by the way the mechanism of that death is through heart disease and ischemic heart disease
[3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:55.160]  so lead causes heart failure and low level lead contamination causes that that's why it's important
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:13:59.720]  to get you know clean supplements that's why i know infowars tests are supplements and you know
[3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:03.720]  i do testing for lots of companies including i've tested a lot of infowars supplements you
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:07.160]  got to get rid of the lead you got to have clean stuff because if you're exposed to lead you're
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:13.480]  going to die of heart disease 412 000 americans do every year it's incredible now bill gates wants to
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:18.520]  put lead into the skies all around the planet calcium carbonate is always contaminated with
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:24.680]  lead we've done the testing we know how much lead is in calcium carbonate now the media will lie to
[3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:29.400]  you and say no it's just chalk well all chalk is contaminated with lead so that's a fact that you
[3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:35.720]  can count on we've done the test ic pms mass spectrometry we know this information now this
[3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:42.680]  is about shutting down shutting down the biosphere so it's not just about releasing gmo mosquitoes
[3:14:43.400 --> 3:14:47.480]  that are going to be super mutant mosquitoes that kill millions of people especially in third
[3:14:47.480 --> 3:14:52.600]  world countries which is where uh bernie sanders sort of hinted that he might support enhanced
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:58.200]  abortion right for impoverished nations filled with black and brown people that's where they're

[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:15.240]  corporate world government known as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control

[3:20:21.080 --> 3:20:28.440]  we're back with the alex jones show thanks for continuing with us the fourth hour here on this
[3:20:28.440 --> 3:20:35.160]  bombshell day so much news today alex is coming back to to austin after traveling and he may be
[3:20:35.160 --> 3:20:41.160]  popping in this hour or certainly later with with a special report so we'll see if he pops in i know
[3:20:41.160 --> 3:20:47.480]  he's aware alex is fully aware of the annihilation of humanity that is taking place it's not you
[3:20:47.480 --> 3:20:51.880]  know we've covered all these things over the years the fluoride the 5g assaults the psychiatric
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:57.800]  drugging of children the abortion and the infanticide the murder everything now it just gets bigger and
[3:20:57.800 --> 3:21:02.440]  bigger on a more global scale and there are more vectors trying to depopulate humanity just kill
[3:21:02.440 --> 3:21:07.640]  off all humans this is what the globalists are trying to do so as i sort of got into in the last
[3:21:07.640 --> 3:21:12.360]  segment but i'll go into more detail here the geoengineering experiments are now openly admitted
[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:16.440]  by the mainstream media the same media that attacked us years ago said we were conspiracy
[3:21:16.440 --> 3:21:20.600]  theorists for talking about chemtrails and geoengineering and weather control you know once
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:25.320]  again like alex jones was 10 years ahead of the media on this and i warned about this stuff seven
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:30.840]  years ago in 2012 you know but again we were censored so that you couldn't know the truth but now
[3:21:30.840 --> 3:21:38.120]  it's all out there so understand that this this chemtrails program project scopex is funded by
[3:21:38.120 --> 3:21:43.880]  the biggest globalist organizations that are also involved in censorship in particular when i was
[3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:49.960]  watching the cnbc video yesterday that was touting the benefits of chemtrails and geoengineering
[3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:55.400]  they showed the list of donors who are supporting this program and the donors it was 14 non-profits
[3:21:55.400 --> 3:22:01.960]  and it includes just a long list of them but one of them is the alfred p slone foundation and that
[3:22:01.960 --> 3:22:07.800]  rang a bell because i remember the alfred p slone foundation was instrumental in getting the
[3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:15.240]  waxed documentary that told the truth about vaccines getting it banned from the trabeca film
[3:22:15.240 --> 3:22:22.280]  festival that was it was a couple years ago but alfred p slone foundation has always been about
[3:22:22.920 --> 3:22:28.760]  covering up the truth about the science schemes that are trying to kill people and brain damage
[3:22:28.760 --> 3:22:34.680]  people and maim people and depending on you know what information sources you go to you can find
[3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:40.200]  some very interesting history about alfred p slone and a lot of these globalists who really
[3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:45.640]  have decided to try to eliminate the human population so what i want to explain here
[3:22:45.640 --> 3:22:51.000]  you know as a scientist myself as a published scientist and a lab scientist i need you to
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:57.560]  understand what will happen when they dim the sun they're trying to block the sun by mimicking
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:04.520]  a natural disaster volcano there was a volcano that erupted in the year 1815 i forgot the
[3:23:04.520 --> 3:23:10.920]  name of it it was like mount tambora or something similar to that and this volcano caused what was
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:18.360]  called a year without a summer it caused food crops to fail around the world food crops failed on at
[3:23:18.360 --> 3:23:23.960]  least five continents people starve to death all over the world because of one volcano why because
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:30.360]  that volcano ejected a massive amount of particulate matter into the stratosphere and then of course
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:35.000]  the stratosphere it it you know it circulates it moves around and so then that spread across the
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:40.600]  whole planet and it blocked the sun food crops failed people died businesses went bankrupt
[3:23:40.600 --> 3:23:46.280]  all over the world and that was 1815 now the scopex project funded by bill gates and the
[3:23:46.280 --> 3:23:51.560]  alfred p slone foundation and others they're trying to mimic this natural disaster of a
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:23:56.040]  volcano through artificial means by flying planes at high altitude and releasing pollution
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:03.720]  into the atmosphere understand the environmentalists are now demanding global pollution the environmentalists
[3:24:04.360 --> 3:24:11.160]  want to pollute the planet this is their demand now and if they succeed they're going to cause
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:19.000]  listen carefully a global collapse of food production we are talking about a food collapse
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:25.240]  that spans all the major continents you know at least five continents a food collapse that will
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:30.280]  collapse populations especially in third world countries where they're on marginal food supplies
[3:24:30.280 --> 3:24:36.920]  already and even by blocking as little as one or two percent of the sunlight they will crush food
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:42.520]  production in those marginalized areas where plants are just barely surviving as it is you don't have
[3:24:42.520 --> 3:24:46.680]  to block 50 percent of the sunlight to collapse world population you only have to block a tiny
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:51.800]  portion of the sunlight and this is what they're trying to do this is and and they claim it's very
[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:56.440]  affordable to do they say they're only going to have to spend 2.5 billion dollars a year
[3:24:56.440 --> 3:25:01.800]  for the next 10 or 15 years to achieve this and that's nothing people like bill gates can write
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:08.600]  a check for 2.5 billion dollars i mean he probably carries that in his pocket who knows but these
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:14.040]  people to them this is cheap they want to destroy the human population the cheapest way for them
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:20.600]  to accomplish that is to pollute the skies the implications of this are enormous way beyond
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:25.560]  anything that i think they have even imagined the collapse of the global food supply means that
[3:25:26.440 --> 3:25:32.280]  you're gonna have social unrest you're gonna have starvation famine disease basically you're
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:37.240]  gonna have the four horsemen of the apocalypse unleashed upon our world this was like end times
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:43.240]  mad science that is gonna happen and there's no one stopping them and and the other side of this
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:49.160]  is that they don't even need a vote they don't even need permission from the president or the senate
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:53.720]  you know why because they can launch these planes from any country in the world they don't have to
[3:25:53.720 --> 3:25:58.440]  launch them from the united states even if trump were completely opposed to this and he may not
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:04.760]  even be aware of of any of this yet he couldn't stop it because the president has no power outside
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:10.440]  the united states these globalists can get together and they can pay some you know third world
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:15.160]  dictator nation somewhere that has a runway they can just launch all these planes from there
[3:26:15.160 --> 3:26:21.080]  and because it's polluting the entire planet the entire stratosphere you can't escape it
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:27.880]  the globalists have figured this out you can say no to vaccines and there's a growing vaccine
[3:26:27.880 --> 3:26:33.000]  resistance because of the dangers of vaccines and the toxic ingredients they put in them like mercury
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:38.200]  and aluminum and squalene and so on and aborted human fetal tissue by the way you can escape
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:42.200]  vaccines and they're trying to push the mandates but the mandates are meeting resistance even in
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:50.040]  california but you can't escape global pollution of the skies there's nothing you can do if the
[3:26:50.040 --> 3:26:56.040]  sunlight is blocked sunlight's blocked you can't grow your crops like you used to and also by the
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:27:00.680]  way your solar panels don't work like they used to so all these globalists that are saying ah we
[3:27:00.680 --> 3:27:05.320]  have to give up combustion engines you got to buy solar panels you have to install solar everything's
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:10.520]  got to be solar these are the same lunatics that are that are going to block the sun think about
[3:27:10.520 --> 3:27:15.480]  this these are the same people like yeah invest all your money in solar panels and then uh we're
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:19.640]  going to make sure they don't really work very well as if they i mean they don't even work very
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:25.640]  well right now in many cases so these people are going to bankrupt you know the the counties and
[3:27:25.640 --> 3:27:31.080]  the cities that have invested all this solar panel expecting a payoff in 15 years or whatever
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:35.160]  that's going to be delayed because the sun's going to be blocked and then they're going to have a
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:40.200]  global food collapse mimicking the natural disaster of this 1815 volcano and you're going to have
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:46.680]  famine you're going to have a geopolitical collapse you know economic collapse social unrest basically
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:53.400]  you're looking at a global coordinated collapse of human society as we know it today and this
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:59.320]  is their deliberate plan and i call this their hard kill vector they tried soft kill they tried to
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:04.200]  put infertility chemicals in the food you know atrazine is a chemical castrator this is what's
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:09.240]  feminizing many people today atrazine it's an herbicide they tried to put soft kill chemicals
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:14.360]  into the vaccines into the water supply they tried soft kill techniques through multiple
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:20.120]  methods uh psychiatric drugs cancer drugs everything now they're running out of patience
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:26.680]  and they've moved to a hard kill vector the hard kill vector is pollute the skies in the name of
[3:28:26.680 --> 3:28:32.040]  environmentalism it's going to cause acid rain it's going to cause lead to fall out of the skies
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:37.160]  and contaminate the entire food supply with lead it's going to contaminate the rivers and streams
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:42.520]  and oceans it's going to cause solar panels to be impaired it's going to cause a global economic
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:47.960]  collapse famine disease infestation basically your zombie apocalypse they're bringing it to you

[3:33:27.080 --> 3:33:32.520]  the mad science agenda by the way you know i'm not an opponent of real science i am a scientist
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:38.520]  you know i do science every day real science though it needs to be married with humility and
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:44.760]  what's called a precautionary principle such as hey don't release your weaponized mosquitoes
[3:33:44.760 --> 3:33:50.680]  your genetically modified insects into the wild and then oh see what happens you know don't pollute
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:55.880]  the skies globally block the sun shut down photosynthesis collapse all the food crops
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:00.600]  just to see what might happen to see if you might stop your you know global warming hoax
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:05.880]  which is all fabricated anyway it's all fiction see i i understand the role of science but these
[3:34:05.880 --> 3:34:12.600]  people these globalists and lunatics they think science replaces god they hate the idea of god
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:16.920]  they hate the idea of spirituality and they think that science is their savior that's why
[3:34:16.920 --> 3:34:21.640]  they're all into transhumanism they want to merge with the machines and they want to use science
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:26.520]  to dominate society and they're when they're mad science experiments go wrong well what do they do
[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:32.680]  do they blame their political opponents so trust me mark my words on this when the geo engineering
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:37.720]  chemtrails experiment goes horrifically wrong and the food crops are collapsing all over the
[3:34:37.720 --> 3:34:41.320]  world and people are starving to death you know what they're gonna say they're gonna say oh it's
[3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:46.840]  because of climate change they need to double down the pollution in the skies to block even more sun
[3:34:46.840 --> 3:34:52.200]  and then it's gonna get even worse more starvation more disease more economic collapse and they're
[3:34:52.200 --> 3:34:56.360]  gonna say the same thing you're gonna it's gonna be like aoc is gonna come out and say ah we gotta
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:35:01.800]  we gotta put more pollution in the skies again and again and again these are lunatics these are
[3:35:01.800 --> 3:35:09.400]  science lunatics they are they're they're almost going to win their own darwin award for stupidity
[3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:14.200]  and self extermination the problem is they're gonna take you and me with them they're gonna
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:20.040]  kill us all if we don't stop them with these mad science experiments you don't pollute your planet
[3:35:20.040 --> 3:35:26.280]  and call it saving your planet but that's exactly what they're trying to do now oh and by the way
[3:35:26.280 --> 3:35:31.880]  you see they roll out these children as puppets all the time like this gretta girl who they have
[3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:38.840]  gretta now lecturing america about fake climate change this little girl who has no idea what she's
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:44.280]  talking about she's been handed lines she's a puppet of the globalists it's the lecturing us
[3:35:44.280 --> 3:35:50.440]  and lecturing congress about global warming really really what what is she in the seventh grade
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:56.920]  or something i mean this is what the globalists are doing now they find children like hog and
[3:35:56.920 --> 3:36:02.360]  gretta and they just feed them lines and then they roll out these children as your saviors
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:07.400]  sarah silverman the comedian didn't she say that this gretta girl is like the second coming of
[3:36:07.400 --> 3:36:13.640]  christ or something you see my point they hate god but they say that their fake science is your god
[3:36:13.640 --> 3:36:19.320]  and you're supposed to bow down and worship and praise gretta as the second coming of christ
[3:36:19.320 --> 3:36:27.640]  this creepy just creepy girl like she she should be well i'm i'm gonna hold back my comments but
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:33.160]  she's creepy and her ideas are creepy and they're dangerous for our world and she has zero qualifications
[3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:39.720]  to even talk to us about any of this stuff but isn't that classic leftism liberalism they talk
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:44.680]  about things that they don't know about like they want to lecture you on your ar-15 and how
[3:36:44.680 --> 3:36:51.000]  your ar-15 works and the first thing they say is like ban the clips you know because they're
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:55.880]  morons they don't know anything about what they're even talking about they don't know the difference
[3:36:55.880 --> 3:37:01.640]  between a semi-automatic either full full auto or bolt action or anything they have they have no
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:06.520]  clue what they're talking about whether it's science or climate or guns or liberties or even
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:11.000]  history they just fabricate their own history they make up anything they want and then they just pass
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:17.400]  it off that's liberalism they have no connection with reality but they want to control everything
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:24.200]  they want to dominate your world they want to dominate you yeah who was it which candidate
[3:37:24.200 --> 3:37:29.400]  was it that said you can't have magazines that hold more than one round was that that was biden i think
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:37.320]  yes uh brain scrambled biden for you there famous ar-15 quotes fascinating stuff but getting to the
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:42.360]  blood harvesting of people i did cover this briefly on a previous show here on info wars
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:48.040]  but there's something new that you need to understand about this the theranos company
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:53.160]  that was founded by elizabeth holmes which was a massive financial and investment fraud
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:58.040]  and she is facing criminal charges now the company has been disbanded it's all shut down
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:03.080]  i think she burned through 900 million dollars in other people's money she at one point was
[3:38:03.080 --> 3:38:07.480]  celebrated as the most amazing woman female entrepreneur worth billions of dollars going
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:13.560]  to change the world her entire business model was taking your blood in your own home the goal
[3:38:13.560 --> 3:38:19.000]  was for her to install these so-called edison machines in your home and you were supposed to
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:23.240]  get up every day and stick your finger in this machine and it was going to suck your blood
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:30.040]  and from this blood it was going to supposedly run all these medical tests and then it was
[3:38:30.040 --> 3:38:35.560]  going to upload results to the theranos company you know what i think that really was i think
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:42.360]  they were going to take dna profiles and blood marker profiles of all people tie it to your
[3:38:42.360 --> 3:38:47.000]  google profile tie it to your social security number tie it to your bank account tie it to
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:54.520]  your social credit score and covertly test you for drugs see you know if you're using an illicit
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:39:00.520]  drug or see if you're pregnant and then they can market you know pregnancy products to you
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:04.840]  even before you know you're pregnant or to genetically profile you and build a massive
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:11.720]  dna database that would be used against you by the police state system this was celebrated
[3:39:11.720 --> 3:39:18.120]  this woman elizabeth holmes was on the cover of fortune magazine she she was again it was kind
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:22.680]  of like the second coming of christ is what we were told about you know in a way about elizabeth
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:28.680]  holmes that she was this amazing person i don't know about you but have you ever seen this woman
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:36.040]  talk have you ever seen have you ever heard her voice she sounds creepier than greta she doesn't
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:40.760]  blink she always wore the same black turtlenecks they showed a view of her closet she had like
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:48.680]  32 copies of the same clothes and she talked like like a man i don't know and she's just
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:55.480]  full-on creepy these people are way creepy they're all into your blood they're all in a well i gotta
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:40:00.680]  be careful they're all into controlling you by profiling everything about you and and stealing
[3:40:00.680 --> 3:40:06.600]  your information or harvesting your information often without your consent so think about just
[3:40:06.600 --> 3:40:10.840]  the three stories i've covered here so far today we're talking about the gmo mosquito
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:16.360]  experiment gone wrong was that deliberate did they intentionally create super mutant killer
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:20.600]  mosquitoes now to wipe out people in third world countries i believe there's a chance that that's
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:25.720]  true what about the geoengineering the chemtrails experiment project scopex funded by bill gates
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:30.840]  run by harvard scientists and also funded by the alfred peace loan foundation global pollution
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:35.160]  to block the sun shut down the global food supply including by the way phytoplankton
[3:40:35.160 --> 3:40:40.760]  which are the basis of the food webs of aquatic ecosystems you know ocean life they're gonna kill
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:45.240]  that too they're gonna kill the oceans they're gonna kill the land they're gonna kill humans
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:49.240]  and you can't do anything about it you can't opt out because if they block the sun
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:53.640]  there's really nothing you can do except wait for all that stuff to fall out of the sky and by the
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:58.280]  way it contains lead too so you can have lead poisoning of the entire planet and lead right
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:03.240]  now kills 412 000 americans a year according to the land set so they're gonna up that number
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:07.640]  to maybe millions of americans a year being killed by lead while they're poisoning the food supply
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:12.760]  and collapsing the food ecosystem at the same time and then the story i just covered the blood
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:19.320]  harvesting of every person in america with the theranos company which thankfully is now defunct
[3:41:19.320 --> 3:41:23.880]  but they're not going to give up on this attempt they're going to do it again the point is they
[3:41:23.880 --> 3:41:28.520]  want to profile you they want to control you they want to surveil you and then ultimately
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:33.960]  after they're done just ringing every last dollar out of your pocket shaking all the coins just hold
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:37.800]  you upside down shaking it until all your wallet falls out and they take all your money from big
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:42.840]  pharma and the cancer industry and they kidnap your children and hit them with chemotherapy
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:47.000]  you know medical kidnapping because you wanted a second opinion as a parent after they're done
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:52.680]  with all that they're just going to kill you because they don't want you around don't you know
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:57.480]  they've got the robots coming they've got the robots the automation ready to take over the world
[3:41:57.480 --> 3:42:01.960]  and they don't want you around why do you think they're pushing abortion and infanticide and
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:06.200]  infertility chemicals and transgenderism and super mutant mosquitoes that are going to kill
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:13.080]  and infect more people why do you think they're investigating and researching weaponized biological
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:18.760]  you know deployment systems that can kill millions of people because they don't want
[3:42:18.760 --> 3:42:24.920]  you around the globalists have already decided it's the end of the line for the masses and this
[3:42:24.920 --> 3:42:30.280]  is what you know alex gets this i get this and this is what we're trying to warn you about
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:35.080]  and i think the independent media is the only media in the world that is telling the truth

[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:45.320]  before they annihilate us all that's what we're doing that's why it's crucial that we survive

[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:27.480]  for continuing with us this is mike adams from natural news the upshot is that there is a global
[3:47:27.480 --> 3:47:34.280]  effort you know to devastate human life and to devastate the ecosystem that supports us there's
[3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:40.200]  a collapse of the biosphere that's being engineered and if you oppose it you are called anti
[3:47:41.080 --> 3:47:45.560]  environmentalists you know the environmentalists themselves are calling for this collapse
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:50.360]  and they will be the ones who are most impacted but in terms of practical things that you can do
[3:47:50.360 --> 3:47:55.320]  it's become obvious to me that you're going to have to be able to live a year without food
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:48:01.480]  i mean without you know grocery store food yeah you're gonna need to stockpile some food you're
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:05.800]  gonna need to stockpile supplies like never before and i want to bring your attention to the fact that
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:14.600]  the government itself has entire underground cities and caves networks massive amounts of
[3:48:14.600 --> 3:48:19.080]  supplies remember a couple years ago when they purchased i think dhs bought like two billion
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:24.360]  rounds of ammunition where do you think all that went it went into the storage caves they've got
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:29.080]  caves in different locations all around the country built in limestone in you know kansas city for
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:34.760]  example i've driven by some of those caves before they've got underground cities they've got underground
[3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:41.160]  bunkers i mean huge places and they're prepared for years underground meanwhile the government
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:48.360]  recommendation to you is to have enough supplies for three days so you're supposed to have three
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:55.160]  days of food and they've got like 10 years ready to go you know because of course the globalists
[3:48:55.160 --> 3:49:00.680]  believe that they need to survive but you don't and they are now what's obvious to me they're
[3:49:00.680 --> 3:49:05.480]  planning to decimate the surface of the earth they're trying to turn the surface of the earth all
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:11.400]  the plants all the food crops you know all the seeds everything the pollinators are in collapse
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:16.440]  right now ocean life is in collapse you know that even the human cities are collapsing in many cases
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:21.560]  when they're run by liberals as they collapse the surface of the earth the globalists will tend to
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:27.320]  move into their bunkers and their caves for long-term survival as the whole system collapses around
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:32.520]  them we're talking about the collapse of nations the collapse of governments collapse of economies
[3:49:32.520 --> 3:49:38.920]  banking currency systems yeah it's it this is their plan it's kind of a reboot it's a planetary
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:44.760]  scale reboot because they don't want what they call useless eaters to be around that's how they
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:50.120]  consider you and me they call us useless eaters in their minds the globalist minds we have nothing
[3:49:50.120 --> 3:49:55.720]  to offer the world and we're just consuming you know their resources so they this is how they
[3:49:55.720 --> 3:50:04.040]  plan to do it it's now incredibly obvious so the thing is some humans will survive this some people
[3:50:04.040 --> 3:50:08.760]  will make it through even living you know on the surface of the earth even if you don't have a 10
[3:50:08.760 --> 3:50:14.520]  year bunker cave funded by the federal government you can still make it through and it all comes
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:20.600]  down to your preparedness level and also your location so let's talk about location here for
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:26.680]  a second I recently returned from a conference in Branson Missouri and by the way thank you many
[3:50:26.680 --> 3:50:32.440]  of you who came up to say hello and to say that your fans of info wars and so on I think I shook
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:39.160]  the hands of at least 250 maybe 300 people during just the breaks at that conference one of the
[3:50:39.160 --> 3:50:45.720]  things I got to do was talk behind the scenes with high-level government people who are patriots
[3:50:45.720 --> 3:50:51.960]  inside the government and we're talking like Alex Jones fans working inside high levels of
[3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:58.520]  different federal agencies including DHS and others and these people what they told me was
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:04.120]  really interesting they told me that number one they're all convinced that trump is going to win
[3:51:04.120 --> 3:51:11.480]  re-election in 2020 but they're also convinced that it's over for America by the end of trump's
[3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:18.760]  second term so really what they're saying is 2025 America is over as we know it and I've had the
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:25.160]  same analysis and prediction same conclusion because what these people told me is that they
[3:51:25.160 --> 3:51:30.520]  they were deployed in California, Oregon, Washington against antifa and left wing lunatics
[3:51:30.520 --> 3:51:34.360]  and they've been deployed at the border to try to protect ICE facilities and so on and they see
[3:51:34.360 --> 3:51:40.200]  that the radical left is so far gone that there is no coming together again as a nation if trump
[3:51:40.200 --> 3:51:47.960]  wins in 2020 the left is going to break away in certain ways or try to cause so much chaos
[3:51:47.960 --> 3:51:52.200]  that they destroy the whole country that bring everything down with them America as we know
[3:51:52.200 --> 3:51:59.160]  it will not exist past 2025 that's what I'm being told and I think that's that's accurate and I think
[3:51:59.160 --> 3:52:04.760]  that in this time of turmoil when you have political turmoil combined with this geoengineering and
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:09.240]  chemtrails and mass poisoning of the food supply and the cultural pushing of transgenderism all
[3:52:09.240 --> 3:52:16.040]  these poisons in the food and vaccines 5g you know the list goes on this is going to be a time of
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:23.640]  incredible collapse a very risky time for America very risky time to be alive but the second biggest
[3:52:23.640 --> 3:52:29.480]  factor that I was told really matters is where you are because the hot spots of all of this are
[3:52:29.480 --> 3:52:35.880]  going to be very localized if you are anywhere near Sacramento California or Los Angeles or
[3:52:35.880 --> 3:52:41.640]  Portland you're in trouble because of what's coming but if you're out in the middle of Utah
[3:52:42.200 --> 3:52:49.640]  let's say or Tennessee or Montana it's not such a big deal this point was really driven home to me
[3:52:49.640 --> 3:52:55.160]  based on the analysis of these federal agents and some special ops people and just real high
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:53:00.520]  level people but very dedicated patriots they said they know this is what the all the models
[3:53:00.520 --> 3:53:07.480]  that they've been taught this is what it tells them that America's the quote civil war is only
[3:53:07.480 --> 3:53:14.200]  going to be very very localized not even regional but local that's what they said certain cities
[3:53:14.200 --> 3:53:20.120]  just certain areas around those cities certain counties that's it most of America is not going
[3:53:20.120 --> 3:53:28.280]  to be in a kinetic engagement but what will affect all of America will fix problems how do
[3:53:28.280 --> 3:53:34.280]  you get your food getting trucks to the grocery stores getting fuel supplies refineries functioning
[3:53:34.920 --> 3:53:38.600]  you know we saw an attack on the refineries in Saudi Arabia recently that could easily
[3:53:38.600 --> 3:53:43.720]  happen in America if some radical leftists want to shut down fossil fuels and they start flying
[3:53:43.720 --> 3:53:48.760]  you know explosive laden drones into refineries in Texas or something the fuel supplies could be
[3:53:48.760 --> 3:53:54.280]  cut off power grid could be shut down in certain scenarios food supplies could be cut off so
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:53:59.560]  those of us who live in middle America even if you're not in one of these lunatic left-wing
[3:53:59.560 --> 3:54:06.680]  cities yeah you're probably not going to have to kinetically engage a zombie apocalypse but you
[3:54:06.680 --> 3:54:14.600]  are going to have to survive a year or more without potentially food fuel medicine electricity
[3:54:14.600 --> 3:54:20.040]  all the supplies that you depend on every day so I want you to really think carefully about where
[3:54:20.040 --> 3:54:27.800]  you are do you need to relocate before 2025 or even it could be sooner depending on what happens
[3:54:27.800 --> 3:54:34.440]  in the 2020 election how insane the left becomes what supplies do you really need and do you know
[3:54:34.440 --> 3:54:40.200]  how to use those supplies have you tried cooking your stored food you know have you boiled water on
[3:54:40.200 --> 3:54:45.560]  a camp stove have you even tasted your stored food because a lot of it doesn't taste that great
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:51.080]  depending on where you got it so check it all out you know use what you have learn the skills
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:55.160]  because this right here your brain is what's going to save your life during all of this
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:55:01.000]  and by the way again I was told it's over for America I wish that that wasn't the case I'm not
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:06.760]  hoping for that I love America I want to see America you know great again I want to see Trump
[3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:12.440]  succeed as long as he's pro-america and you know pro-constitution pro-republic pro-first
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:16.440]  amendment a second amendment I want to see America come back strong but what I'm being told
[3:55:16.440 --> 3:55:22.920]  is that it's over for America as we know it there's no coming back from the the lawlessness
[3:55:22.920 --> 3:55:27.880]  of the left the lunacy the mass mental illness that they have thrust upon this world I mean look
[3:55:27.880 --> 3:55:32.920]  the New York Times is just basically a fiction rag at this point with their attacks on Kavanaugh
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:38.360]  CNN is a total joke you have to have a lobotomy just to be able to watch CNN these days it's so
[3:55:38.360 --> 3:55:44.600]  bad you know these this is crucial for you to understand for all of us to understand America
[3:55:44.600 --> 3:55:53.640]  as we know it may be over in the next few years so what comes out of that I say that we the people
[3:55:53.640 --> 3:55:59.800]  you and me and those of us who believe in liberty and and we believe in divinity and we believe in
[3:55:59.800 --> 3:56:04.920]  human rights and civil liberties the right to speak the right to practice religion the right
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:11.480]  to worship the right to carry and to keep and bear arms the right to own any firearm you want
[3:56:12.280 --> 3:56:19.400]  these rights must be enshrined in the next society that we rebuild after the planned
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:25.800]  engineered collapse of this society and by the way let me remind you we must enshrine health
[3:56:25.800 --> 3:56:33.000]  freedom medical freedom in the next society's documents because we cannot tolerate government
[3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:38.680]  medical kidnapping children imprisoning parents because they won't poison their children with
[3:56:38.680 --> 3:56:45.160]  chemotherapy or vaccines that has got to stop we've got to have you know maybe a third amendment
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:50.280]  that's health freedom like move the current third amendment about quartering soldiers in your house
[3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:55.240]  like kick that on down the line keep it but make it a later amendment insert a new third amendment
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:57:01.880]  that no one shall be forced to engage in medicine against their beliefs or wishes
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:06.200]  for themselves or their children that's what we need in my opinion that's something we have to
[3:57:06.200 --> 3:57:10.600]  keep in mind it was kind of missing from the original Bill of Rights interestingly Benjamin
[3:57:10.600 --> 3:57:15.400]  Rush tried to put it in there but uh i guess not enough people thought that was important at the
[3:57:15.400 --> 3:57:20.040]  time because no one could imagine medical kidnapping of children by government which is what's happening
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:25.400]  today so these are some things to keep in mind of course keep watching infowars.com i'll keep
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:31.480]  covering this as best i can as well i'll keep contributing to infowars get prepared stay informed
[3:57:32.520 --> 3:57:37.320]  and relocate if you have to because it's coming and there's nothing we can do to stop it thank you
[3:57:37.320 --> 3:57:43.880]  for watching
