[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:52.560]  okay my friends we're live we're here it is Thursday the 28th of June 2012 a day
[00:52.560 --> 00:59.200]  that will live in infamy I said six months ago that I thought the Supreme
[00:59.200 --> 01:05.720]  Court would rule in favor of government-run nightmare forced health
[01:05.720 --> 01:12.200]  care and all that comes with it and then in the last few months I came on air
[01:12.200 --> 01:16.800]  and said well looks like I'm wrong I I hope this isn't some type of you know
[01:16.800 --> 01:23.680]  big manipulation but they are implying and in the arguments a few months ago
[01:23.680 --> 01:30.200]  before the court the court who allowed media in at the time so they could follow
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.680]  it behaved as if they were going to overturn it or most of it well they
[01:35.680 --> 01:40.600]  didn't do that and they said the power to tax is the power to do whatever they
[01:40.600 --> 01:43.880]  want well George Washington said the power to tax is the power to destroy
[01:43.880 --> 01:48.640]  they're claiming that they have the power to tax the federal government does
[01:48.640 --> 01:55.720]  and that's unlimited basically and it's actually true that's what this is is a
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.000]  tax and it's to the insurance companies it was in the back of the Wall Street
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.200]  Journal it was in the Financial Times of London oh yeah they followed it because
[02:04.200 --> 02:07.560]  they own this country through fraud those big banks do not the poor Brits that
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.840]  funded it all that
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.840]  they had openly written the health care law I mean to call it communist or
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.360]  socialist is not accurate it's big insurance companies owned by the big
[02:25.360 --> 02:32.160]  mega banks the people that openly say they rule the world and I have the
[02:32.160 --> 02:35.480]  media go from oh there is a world government and it's run by private
[02:35.480 --> 02:39.680]  bankers and they know best and they're going to control your life and they're
[02:39.680 --> 02:43.600]  going to bankrupt your city by design of putting their people in to sign on to
[02:43.600 --> 02:46.480]  their debt they're going to steal your pension funds and then they're going to
[02:46.480 --> 02:50.680]  ratchet up the taxes and take people's private property to fund the bureaucracy
[02:50.680 --> 02:56.560]  and that's just the way it is so when we come back from break I've got a big
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.360]  list of things this health care law does I'm gonna rattle them off one after the
[03:01.360 --> 03:12.640]  other this is going to be an absolutely key worldwide transmission so we're
[03:12.640 --> 03:21.360]  going to be covering all of this today but I was driving into work this morning
[03:21.360 --> 03:28.720]  listening to a 1960s oldie station on XM because so much is going on now you
[03:28.720 --> 03:31.280]  know sometimes it's tuned into music I can't even handle listening to talk
[03:31.280 --> 03:36.680]  radio and what they think is conservative or libertarian the the thin
[03:36.680 --> 03:48.040]  facsimile the work of fiction and when I heard the oldie station break in to
[03:48.040 --> 03:52.880]  announce never do that before that it had been upheld it was like a punch in
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.720]  the stomach but it was a punch in the stomach I knew was coming my instincts
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.480]  are always right always right and I never listen to them I came on here the
[04:02.480 --> 04:05.440]  last six months and I said they're gonna uphold it I said it years ago they'd
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.160]  uphold it when I got the Supreme Court and I said you watch everybody's like
[04:09.160 --> 04:12.480]  no they say they're gonna return it and I said okay if that happens I have some
[04:12.480 --> 04:24.320]  hope and of course they upheld it they did not overturn it of course and you've
[04:24.320 --> 04:32.240]  got the Janet Reno slash big sis clone will so to mayor and Kagan
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.880]  Kagan's a dead ranger for the other clones other goblin creatures what

[04:43.760 --> 04:49.720]  just criminals total criminals and I I knew it was coming everybody's like no
[04:49.720 --> 04:52.720]  you're wrongs I said okay we'll see they say they're gonna overturn it I'll have

[08:34.360 --> 08:39.200]  control freaks in your life even more running every facet of it you got it
[08:39.200 --> 08:45.040]  I've told you since they passed health care for the last two years that you were
[08:45.040 --> 08:51.800]  going to see the Supreme Court of the United States uphold it and the entire
[08:51.800 --> 08:55.120]  conventional wisdom since they first started having hearings a few months
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.960]  ago was oh no you should have heard the questions they asked hey you know the
[08:59.960 --> 09:04.560]  government can make you buy a car from somebody if they wanted to or the
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.320]  government you know can make you do this or that this is very dangerous special
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.280]  interest can just come and now lobby government to make you buy their product
[09:13.280 --> 09:21.760]  this is totally un-American it's totally unconstitutional it's why for 235
[09:21.760 --> 09:26.960]  years we've never had anything like this because it's diametrically opposed to
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.120]  our system it is the nightmare control freak eugenics based nanny state on
[09:33.120 --> 09:38.720]  steroids and I'm going to go through a list this morning of research we did in
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.280]  some articles and it's only part of the nightmare the nightmare is so huge so
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.640]  deep I don't know how to describe it this morning I got the news driving to
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.560]  work that the Supreme Court who was going to announce last week but suddenly
[09:53.560 --> 09:57.720]  backed off and didn't announce and I've made the point I thought that was a very
[09:57.720 --> 10:02.760]  foreboding came out and basically upheld the entire government run
[10:02.760 --> 10:07.440]  health care system that was written by insurance companies so let's get one
[10:07.440 --> 10:13.200]  thing straight here out of the gates okay this is not debatable NPR this
[10:13.200 --> 10:19.680]  morning had Gibbs and all the globalist minions and press secretaries of old on
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.480]  celebrating the people get their free health care isn't this great let's get
[10:24.480 --> 10:29.040]  one thing straight the big insurance companies on record go read the wall
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.680]  Street Journal go read New York Times they sold it like well it's a good idea
[10:34.680 --> 10:39.640]  the insurance companies are even for it a consortium of them wrote it yes that's
[10:39.640 --> 10:43.960]  why Obama's plan is Mitt Romney's plan because Mitt Romney's plan was not his
[10:43.960 --> 10:50.760]  plan it was the big banks plan as a direct tax to them as we've said hundreds
[10:50.760 --> 10:55.520]  of times hundreds of times we've written articles I can't believe how dead on
[10:55.520 --> 10:59.800]  this transmission is it's unbelievable you've ignored at your peril and you
[10:59.800 --> 11:05.280]  know why cuz we do the research no one else has been saying this that it's a
[11:05.280 --> 11:10.840]  direct tax to the insurance companies to make 33 to 35 depending on how you
[11:10.840 --> 11:19.320]  interpret it million people buy MD mainline foundation created controlled
[11:19.320 --> 11:25.600]  Rockefeller style medicine that we've had the last 90 years okay and it allows
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.040]  the insurance companies and HMOs owned by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and those
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.960]  other big mega six banks that are writing up their living will about to go
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.200]  belly up like in Ron they're really just shell corporations the money's already
[11:37.200 --> 11:41.840]  been stolen it's a designed implosion they own the big insurance companies on
[11:41.840 --> 11:47.040]  record and this is a tax as the Supreme Court has said and they claim that's
[11:47.040 --> 11:53.480]  their power a tax directly to special interest your money doesn't go to uncle
[11:53.480 --> 11:59.440]  Sam they're saying this is a tax directly to in fact guys will you cue up
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.400]  the CNBC piece where they say we're all slaves to the world government please
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.880]  cue that up for me because it's in your face okay this listen it'd be bad
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.360]  enough to have socialist health care even run by good people because it would
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.200]  turn into eugenics based once you communalize everybody folks are gonna
[12:16.200 --> 12:19.800]  say well we got to control what you eat and do because everybody else is paying
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.280]  for it and there goes free will there goes individualism here comes the nanny
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.760]  stayed into your life in your bathroom in your bedroom in your medicine cabinet
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.720]  in your refrigerator and you notice all that's being rolled out right now so I'm
[12:33.720 --> 12:40.120]  gonna go through all of this but it makes my head spin and nothing has made me
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.600]  want to leave this country more than when I got the news this morning that they
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.840]  had just put the whole thing through as my gut told me they would because look
[12:49.840 --> 12:53.240]  the elites that have taken over this country the banksters that the Bernie
[12:53.240 --> 12:56.800]  made off Ken lay types that are creating the carbon taxes and that just got
[12:56.800 --> 13:02.320]  upheld by federal appellate court this is the agenda they want that's why the
[13:02.320 --> 13:07.080]  exact same thing comes out of Mitt Romney in his actions not as rhetoric that
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.520]  comes out of Obama because this is what they want this is globally going in
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.760]  everywhere you can watch on C-span the House of Commons every time I watch it
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.080]  they have members of parliament get up to the Prime Minister didn't matter who's
[13:20.080 --> 13:27.920]  in office Tony Blair or Cameron or in between those two the last guy and they
[13:27.920 --> 13:32.440]  say well my constituent died of brain tumor she waited two years to get it it
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.840]  was almost a hundred percent operable if she got surgery within six months but
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.880]  they made her wait and then Tony Blair gets up and says well I admit that's
[13:40.880 --> 13:46.360]  going on we need to change that we need more funds Paul Watson for a month had
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.240]  a chest cold and was going to the National Health Service because you're
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.360]  not allowed to go to a private doctor that the elites go to unless you they
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.480]  give you permission and they gave him a little pack with some bandages some
[13:57.480 --> 14:02.480]  Tylenol some aspirin and some things and he went back and said this I can get
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.840]  this at the store and he finally with some herbs and things was able to cure
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.240]  himself could not go see a private doctor even though he had the money to go
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.280]  do it that's what the government wants that's the control they want this
[14:18.280 --> 14:24.560]  government all over the country runs lies every year when school starts saying
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.040]  it's the law you've got to take 40-something vaccines when there is no
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.600]  law even if you support vaccines what does that tell you it is a unified
[14:32.600 --> 14:38.840]  group of abject scumbag criminals and it's we the people that have to start
[14:38.840 --> 14:42.320]  saying no to this we've got to resist this now let me give you another little
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.320]  nugget here the IRS is going to get your medical records and is going to
[14:47.320 --> 14:51.520]  enforce this and you've got to file with them and they've got other
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.240]  legislation introduced where they can share your medical records and IRS
[14:55.240 --> 14:59.200]  records with any agency they want folks Nixon got in trouble for just having
[14:59.200 --> 15:06.820]  IRS files this is all total in-your-face evil and why not they've worked to get
[15:06.820 --> 15:10.280]  their people in all the regulatory positions in the major court positions
[15:10.280 --> 15:16.240]  and they're moving against us yeah Obama is getting ready to speak about his
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.360]  big victory here in just a moment and I'm not even gonna go to that idiot he's
[15:21.360 --> 15:25.000]  not even the president he's a joke he's a fraud he's a teleprompter reading
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.500]  scammer but we'll read some of the scumbag transcript later and it's time
[15:29.500 --> 15:33.400]  to pull them down it's time to stop putting them on a pedestal it's time to
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.760]  it really that's not an exaggeration that we have a criminal government I
[15:36.760 --> 15:42.560]  have the Washington Post foreign policy journal foreign policy.com one of
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.120]  their elite publications saying fast and furious fast and the ridiculous in
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.400]  Mexico it's taken as fact that the United States is backing the drug cartels
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.960]  you mean criminal elements and they go on to say they had lunch with Wayne
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.000]  LaPierre of the NRA and he says that it goes a lot deeper in his government
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.120]  drug dealing and backing cartels and he they say they met with a top libertarian
[16:06.120 --> 16:13.200]  banker as well and they say they don't say it it's in the Chicago Tribune it's
[16:13.200 --> 16:18.800]  in the El Paso times a year and a half ago we broke it it's in federal filings
[16:18.800 --> 16:23.280]  the tons of cocaine per little cartel they've got the guns they shipped the
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.600]  guns they shipped to drug cartels in the U.S. in Chicago in Indianapolis
[16:28.600 --> 16:36.480]  Indiana in Dallas Texas in Tampa Florida I mean go look it up go look
[16:36.480 --> 16:43.400]  they're drug dealers they carried out Oklahoma City this isn't the government
[16:43.400 --> 16:48.240]  okay I said I'd give you the skinny on the health care law here it is here it
[16:48.240 --> 16:55.480]  is the trap number one is this the trap once they've got government control of
[16:55.480 --> 17:00.200]  mandated health care they openly are saying through the death panels and they
[17:00.200 --> 17:03.720]  shut them up they don't call them that but it's these federal boards that are
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.480]  staffed by insurance company execs bioethicist who decide you don't get eye
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.760]  surgery after 65 you don't get any surgery after 60 oh you were overweight
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.200]  so you don't get that knee surgery or you don't get that I mean literally they
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.240]  admit in Time Magazine Newsweek they're rolling it out now going well you're
[17:21.240 --> 17:24.760]  paying for it those of you that are healthy you shouldn't have to pay for
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.040]  well see we don't need to pay for people that have made bad choices that's why
[17:28.040 --> 17:33.680]  it's a free market system but once you have that trap now we've got to have
[17:33.680 --> 17:39.520]  social control and so that's the big plan and and they admit the plan is to
[17:39.520 --> 17:45.360]  control everything and have the big insurance companies make you buy health
[17:45.360 --> 17:48.720]  care it's already increased the price in the last two years just the just the
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.080]  fact that was in place and being phased in a 25% plus increase in cost most
[17:54.080 --> 18:00.840]  analysts and go 50% the next two years it makes more people dependent on the
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.360]  system there was already charity care but they got rid of the Hippocratic oath
[18:06.360 --> 18:10.840]  15 years ago in medical school they had for thousands of years Hippocrates
[18:10.840 --> 18:14.680]  going back to that that my dad was taught in dental school you do a 30 year
[18:14.680 --> 18:17.920]  care for free or you get local charities to pay for the lab work and
[18:17.920 --> 18:21.720]  thanks all these so-called charity hospitals that are really for profit
[18:21.720 --> 18:24.720]  they're supposed to people don't even know I think the illegal aliens get to
[18:24.720 --> 18:29.080]  care they go in and say charity care boom by law they're giving it one of my
[18:29.080 --> 18:32.280]  crew members had Crohn's disease his insurance had dumped him a long time ago
[18:32.280 --> 18:36.960]  it's for even work for me full-time and I said no there is charity care he didn't
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.480]  his doctors lied and said it didn't exist he found out about it and had like a
[18:40.480 --> 18:46.520]  $40,000 surgery for free for free because he couldn't afford the insurance
[18:46.520 --> 18:50.440]  and he was somebody making you know lower-middle-class wages at that time
[18:50.440 --> 18:54.720]  they wouldn't insuring and he couldn't pay for it and if you pay the top dollar
[18:54.720 --> 18:58.480]  been 200,000 but the charity care calculation for everything put together
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.680]  in two weeks in the hospital and a bunch of his intestines removed was 40
[19:04.680 --> 19:08.760]  something thousand dollars so they're getting rid of that there's no
[19:08.760 --> 19:11.760]  hypocritical there's no you're supposed to do the health care part of it for
[19:11.760 --> 19:14.680]  free it's not just about playing golf on the golf course by the way it's
[19:14.680 --> 19:17.600]  bankrupting doctors they don't make the money they used to when we come back I'm
[19:17.600 --> 19:22.440]  going to break down the rest of it the trap letting control freaks and social
[19:22.440 --> 19:26.760]  engineers and government who say there's too many of us run everything the
[19:26.760 --> 19:33.280]  insurance lobby wrote the entire thing and it dovetails with the aisle rest is
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.560]  to be the enforcer now the collection agency for the private fellow reserve
[19:37.560 --> 19:43.320]  who this tax pays to will now be in your health care and the Supreme Court said
[19:43.320 --> 19:48.200]  this is a tax what an incredible admission it's actually true they go we
[19:48.200 --> 19:52.280]  have the power to tax you have the power to destroy but it's illegitimate
[19:52.280 --> 19:57.160]  because it's out of your purview your jurisdiction and it goes to private
[19:57.160 --> 20:02.680]  banks that own the insurance companies a little over a year ago I began to do a
[20:02.680 --> 20:06.800]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[20:06.800 --> 20:11.280]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[20:11.280 --> 20:14.160]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.440]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[23:07.920 --> 23:11.760]  president Ronald Reagan requested that carnivore be sent directly to the
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.240]  White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class
[23:15.240 --> 23:20.280]  healer now 27 years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to

[24:13.200 --> 24:18.520]  around us and squeezing us during the short break I was watching part of
[24:18.520 --> 24:26.120]  Obama's live speech from the criminal house the White House there that being
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.320]  disgraced by all the rats and criminals that are inside of it publicly and all
[24:30.320 --> 24:33.880]  the different crimes they're committing from putting our military under NATO and
[24:33.880 --> 24:37.680]  UN command and telling Congress they have no authority to giving al-Qaeda
[24:37.680 --> 24:44.920]  control of Libya and areas of Syria as we reported four days ago back on Sunday
[24:44.920 --> 24:50.640]  there are special forces from the West backing al-Qaeda getting near and
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.800]  surrounding the president's compound there in Damascus I mean there's just no
[24:54.800 --> 25:00.200]  end of the unbelievable wholesale evil that the globalists are funding in front
[25:00.200 --> 25:04.360]  of everyone because the general public is in a trance and it's too lazy to get
[25:04.360 --> 25:08.360]  into the complexities of what's happening but it's not even complex
[25:08.360 --> 25:13.480]  anymore in fact I had the guys during the break I said type in Obamacare does
[25:13.480 --> 25:18.080]  not cover pre-existing conditions and the law comes up the Associated Press comes
[25:18.080 --> 25:24.320]  up and we can put that on screen for folks if you're watching on prison
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.760]  planet.tv if you're a radio listener just type in Obamacare does not cover
[25:28.760 --> 25:36.560]  pre-existing conditions for kids and the reason I raised this is I was watching
[25:37.320 --> 25:44.760]  during the break Obama speak and he was saying well we need this for families we
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.480]  need this for children you know we don't need this to bankrupt someone we need to
[25:48.480 --> 25:54.160]  cover people's conditions it doesn't it makes you buy insurance lets the insurance
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.000]  companies control the type of care you get the code word for that is well
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.800]  there's too many unneeded tests the doctors are just trying to make money
[26:01.800 --> 26:09.160]  no no dashel in the book he wrote on it and that's in the health law said oh
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.320]  well if you're over 65 you don't need that eye surgery you need to go on and
[26:12.320 --> 26:18.760]  die this is how they run socialism but it's socialism on the bottom pure
[26:18.760 --> 26:22.800]  profit to the big banks on top and we have it on screen if you scroll down
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.960]  Obamacare does not cover pre-existing conditions for children and that was
[26:27.960 --> 26:33.840]  from almost two years ago right before Congress passed the law hours after
[26:33.840 --> 26:38.000]  President Obama signed a historic health care legislation a potential problem
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.520]  emerged administration officials are now scrambling to fix a gap oh it was a
[26:41.520 --> 26:46.600]  mistake and the highly touted benefits for children and it still doesn't
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.320]  guarantee it I mean it is just such a scam ladies and gentlemen such a fraud
[26:51.320 --> 26:57.280]  and written by the insurance companies show the doctors and nurses are no
[26:57.280 --> 27:01.280]  longer in control of the care and now governments involved and they could say
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.280]  oh yeah we've got a band soda we got a band milk we got a band popcorn
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.880]  spreading all over the US or put big taxes on it because it goes into the
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.680]  health care fund that's then paid to these stinking insurance companies and
[27:13.680 --> 27:17.320]  you've got to go buy it from them and that's why now that there's no market
[27:17.320 --> 27:21.720]  and they can force you to buy it it's gone up 25% that was about six or seven
[27:21.720 --> 27:25.360]  months ago I saw that number they were projecting 50% in the next few years but
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.160]  but health care has already gone up a bunch yeah because they're making you
[27:29.160 --> 27:38.480]  buy it now there is no into this and in Canada in England in Germany I talked
[27:38.480 --> 27:45.200]  to the people over there it is selective if they don't like you they put you to
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.440]  the end of the line in some areas of England you can wait over two years for
[27:50.440 --> 27:54.280]  surgeries that are totally operable but if you don't get them you're dead oh you
[27:54.280 --> 27:58.160]  got a tumor in your liver yeah if we got that out in a few months you'd be fine
[27:58.160 --> 28:01.800]  but you know what you're gonna wait a year and a half you're dead you're dead
[28:01.800 --> 28:07.960]  you're dead this is the scum government the people that crave control in our
[28:07.960 --> 28:11.920]  lives even more and it's all over the world they're putting this in is the
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.800]  same big criminal banks who have control the issuance of currency and credit as
[28:15.800 --> 28:21.360]  Ponzi scheme operators they're in control of the whole planet I had Rosa
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.200]  Corey author of behind the green mask on today we have moved her we're gonna
[28:25.200 --> 28:28.360]  apologize for this obviously breaking news we're gonna move her to sometime
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.960]  next week to expose the UN takeover of our society at the local level but via
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.600]  UN UNESCO that sets the standards the first director general of it was Julian
[28:38.600 --> 28:41.880]  Huxley all this Huxley's brother who was a top eugenicist and the founder of
[28:41.880 --> 28:47.720]  transhumanism they said and and George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell I'll
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.760]  go read these Nobel Prize winners people like Bernard Shaw or excuse me
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.000]  Bertrand Russell saying we're gonna take over with government healthcare we're
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.040]  gonna kill you that are the hammer because you're a useless feeder and who
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.240]  are the useless feeders the truth is they create the useless feeders with a
[29:03.240 --> 29:07.640]  welfare and then use them as an army to take us out then they kill them next
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.320]  week just like they fund Al Qaeda to attack everybody I'm so sick of it
[29:11.320 --> 29:16.160]  people better understand the bankers learned 500 plus years ago in the black
[29:16.160 --> 29:21.960]  nobility wars in what is Italy today was city states how to finance all sides
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.000]  and they've done it ever since the Rothschilds all of it this is how they

[33:46.160 --> 33:50.520]  in elite financial publications like trilateral Commission minutes that they
[33:50.520 --> 33:57.040]  themselves released in the late 1970s that's how I knew three global regions
[33:57.040 --> 34:02.240]  shell derivatives to countries hold the world hostage to the debt bubble that is
[34:02.240 --> 34:08.240]  the banks by increment get direct taxes in the name of bailouts transferred to
[34:08.240 --> 34:13.320]  the banks it's impossible to ever pay it off but they hold you hostage for the
[34:13.320 --> 34:18.320]  total transfer they raise taxes and regulations to shut down all competition
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.680]  stall economies bring in carbon taxes and create a post-industrial world and
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.480]  then they can control everybody they want you so poor that you've got to get
[34:29.480 --> 34:33.040]  your health care your food everything from them and what are they saying in
[34:33.040 --> 34:38.120]  Europe and now the United States if you want your food stamps you're gonna have
[34:38.120 --> 34:44.760]  to be up on your vaccines so now people are calling their bluff that it's not the
[34:44.760 --> 34:48.280]  law to take the vaccines that are full of cancer viruses you name it I we have
[34:48.280 --> 34:51.280]  the Rockefeller Foundation documents at info wars.com
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.080]  Sterilence cancer viruses you're a new listener and they're saying what just
[34:55.080 --> 34:59.240]  type in Rockefeller Foundation documents Sterilence and vaccines
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.280]  Carnegie Rockefeller Foundation documents cancer viruses and vaccines go
[35:04.280 --> 35:10.640]  read it they're killers they're killing us they're murderers it's in the game
[35:10.640 --> 35:14.200]  they're training the military incrementally to have war with us they're
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.200]  buying now we've learned thousands it was hundreds of armored mobile pill boxes
[35:18.200 --> 35:24.480]  that's little machine gun nests for those that don't know shot guns machine guns
[35:24.480 --> 35:31.240]  armed robot cars with huge 50 cows armed drones in the skies 450 million
[35:31.240 --> 35:38.680]  rounds of 40 cal 250 million rounds of 9 millimeter a hundred million rounds of
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.640]  50 cal for domestic operations I mean they're just arming stockpiling weapons
[35:43.640 --> 35:49.800]  firing troops coming in FEMA putting out press releases in LE09 just type it
[35:49.800 --> 35:56.040]  in 14 15 countries training to kill us training for war training for hell and
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.480]  they're gonna implement this massive reeducation takeover that'll make
[36:00.480 --> 36:04.960]  Stalin's reeducation and Lenin's reeducation look like a cakewalk look
[36:04.960 --> 36:11.320]  like Sunday school this isn't a game PayPal they mean business and that whole
[36:11.320 --> 36:16.800]  act my instinct was this is all an act Alito all then they don't want anger to
[36:16.800 --> 36:20.680]  build over this they want to just drop it on us because they're scared of things
[36:20.680 --> 36:25.160]  and their Google metrics studying mass movements which they admit can literally
[36:25.160 --> 36:29.080]  predict the future they know that it would have built the last you know six
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.680]  eight months while the Supreme Court was hearing the arguments and things so
[36:32.680 --> 36:34.840]  the Supreme Court would say oh this doesn't sound constitutional the
[36:34.840 --> 36:37.960]  arguments and and all the Supreme Court's gonna rule against it and I said
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.040]  no they're not people are like well you're wrong and I said okay well I hope
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.840]  and then they just drop the hammer and I want to have hope but you're not gonna
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.280]  get hope from organized criminals you're only gonna get hope becoming wise to
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.640]  them I knew in my gut and here at the office I said you watch they're gonna
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.120]  uphold that everybody's like but but they say it's gonna get overturned and
[37:01.120 --> 37:04.560]  Obama came out and said I don't listen to the court and I said I think I've
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.200]  even said this on air I said I think that's all a shill to make us think that
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.040]  when the clock I said this on air I did that that that that when the court does
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.560]  this well it's like well Obama said he might ignore him but now I guess we got
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.800]  to listen so it's just all the elaborate shill just like when we were going to
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.720]  protest the no fly garbage and the and the body scanners and the groping we
[37:27.720 --> 37:31.120]  didn't opt out for Thanksgiving for upwards of a week and a half two weeks
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.760]  they just shut it down nationwide that was confirmed because there wasn't a
[37:34.760 --> 37:39.480]  real terror threat they're staging all that it was oh my gosh they're gonna say
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.280]  no it's gonna totally shut things down we can't let them have a victory it's
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.520]  that simple this is all psychology and the minute you realize that they're the
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.360]  enemy they're criminals and they want to implode things no amount of tickets no
[37:53.360 --> 37:56.880]  amount of taxes no amount of regulations you know I know what they do I
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.600]  remember when they jacked up prices to go to national parks and tried to kick
[38:00.600 --> 38:03.680]  out a lot of the old folks that were there 15 years ago or so you know the
[38:03.680 --> 38:06.880]  old timers that weren't tyrants and put in the environmental control freaks who
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.440]  would then take over the surrounding areas in the UN buffer zones under Bill
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.680]  Clinton's executive order they told him we may have to shut national parks and
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.200]  lay half of you off and everybody got real scared for a year and the
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.080]  Department of the Interior hang out and said oh it's all right it's all right
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.840]  we'll just start writing a bunch of tickets and change the way we do things
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.520]  and and and and you've got a revenue generate and we're gonna stay open and
[38:29.520 --> 38:33.120]  we're gonna hire a bunch more people and we're gonna take property nearby we're
[38:33.120 --> 38:36.640]  gonna sell part of our property how's that sound it's the same thing they call
[38:36.640 --> 38:39.400]  the cops in well there's a shortfall you better get out there and write some
[38:39.400 --> 38:43.600]  tickets here's your quota all of it goes into the Comprehensive annual financial
[38:43.600 --> 38:48.120]  report 76% on average water district city districts that we had a big report on
[38:48.120 --> 38:52.040]  this California is totally flushed with money but it's all been invested not in
[38:52.040 --> 38:57.600]  pensions but in globalist Ponzi schemes it's all there the numbers I was seeing
[38:57.600 --> 39:00.760]  last night Aaron Dykes had an expert on going over the public it's public
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.600]  numbers but it's just not discussed by the California CAFER Comprehensive
[39:04.600 --> 39:09.080]  annual financial report and it was more than 10 times their supposed debts and
[39:09.080 --> 39:12.320]  what they're in the hole is just shitting there but see they only talk
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.320]  about the budget the budget when we first discovered this and covered it with
[39:16.320 --> 39:24.560]  Walter Burian back in the mid 90s 1996 or so it was only in the 60s 60 plus
[39:24.560 --> 39:29.160]  percent depending on the state all and all of its agencies the counties its
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.080]  agencies the cities ladies and gentlemen this is the permanent political ruling
[39:33.080 --> 39:40.080]  class coupled with the six megabanks and they take back then 60 plus percent now
[39:40.080 --> 39:47.440]  it's over 76% last time we checked 76% of all the tax money goes directly into
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.240]  private accounts and you know who started this the dailies and the mafia
[39:52.240 --> 39:58.000]  before them in Chicago in the 30s and 40s it's called the Chicago 1313 and the
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.880]  banks and the Chicago Business School that's all the Rockefellers were they
[40:01.880 --> 40:08.560]  were mafia to they ran most the liquor go look at the history up in up in hot
[40:08.560 --> 40:11.960]  springs Arkansas where they stayed and did things it's on record there it's not
[40:11.960 --> 40:16.960]  debatable they use US government train cars to ship the liquor everywhere
[40:16.960 --> 40:24.120]  producing it right there in I tell you it's unbelievable the US government is
[40:24.120 --> 40:30.240]  nothing but an organized crime shell for these interests that's why La Piedre
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.720]  Wayne La Piedre has come out this is in the Washington Post publication
[40:34.720 --> 40:38.360]  foreign policy.com and said yeah no we think fasciferious goes deeper in the
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.320]  government drug dealing and stuff of course it does of course it does that's
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.880]  in the federal courts it came out and see this corruption so out in the open
[40:45.880 --> 40:49.080]  now they've got to shut everything down they've got to start shutting freedom of
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.320]  the press down they've got to start going after everything because they've
[40:52.320 --> 40:58.400]  gone so far that's the thing about tyranny the floor drops out at a certain
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.360]  point so many corrupt people are in nobody in the system can say no to the
[41:02.360 --> 41:06.760]  other corrupt people and so it's a free-for-all and it's just they rob
[41:06.760 --> 41:09.880]  everything till it collapses and the big banks have even created a
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.360]  stratagem off of old tyrannical systems that weren't controlled to control the
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.880]  black hole effect that this tyranny is going to create and listen you've got
[41:19.880 --> 41:24.360]  hope with Romney okay go in a room without oxygen and just hold your
[41:24.360 --> 41:28.920]  breath and hope you know that a keyboard elf's gonna appear and give you some
[41:28.920 --> 41:34.240]  air again Romney didn't write Obamacare the people that controlled him the big
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.480]  banks did Obama didn't write right it they were given it the different
[41:39.480 --> 41:42.320]  special interests got together in hundreds of meetings after that and
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.280]  haggled it out and it's admitted hey what about this Elena Kagan the must come
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.520]  out of the same cloning tank that all these other weird creatures that engage
[41:52.520 --> 41:58.960]  in evil Janet Reno a big sis Napolitano Sotomayor I mean who are these
[41:58.960 --> 42:04.000]  people it's the joke dirtbag criminals that they put in there who will rule
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.680]  anything Supreme Court rule black people aren't humans they wanted to build the
[42:09.680 --> 42:12.880]  court up in this little game where Obama says the court doesn't matter oh
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.320]  well dare you Obama we hate you better do what the court says also when it did
[42:17.320 --> 42:23.760]  this he'd say she was all a setup it's all coordinated at that level it's
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.560]  totally coordinated and now one seventh of what was left of the economy half the
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.160]  economy one where the others have been on government half now you give it one
[42:33.160 --> 42:40.040]  seventh more that's well do the math do the math I mean I've already three and

[43:26.040 --> 43:29.400]  is going to enforce it and is the enforcement mechanism and that's what
[43:29.400 --> 43:34.080]  they say they say it's a tax administered by the IRS you show the proof of
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.720]  where you bought it and that it's authorized by them the IRS is now in
[43:38.720 --> 43:41.960]  charge of your health care the collection agency for the private bankers

[43:46.520 --> 43:50.600]  charge you penalties and interest oh that's going to help the dump truck
[43:50.600 --> 43:56.040]  driver where I drive to work every day and watch three to seven city of Austin
[43:56.040 --> 44:01.560]  truck police pulling over even brand new trucks and harassing them and opening

[44:21.240 --> 44:24.000]  lose their job and then when they lose their job and can't get health care they
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.440]  go on welfare oh and now you got to take shots though since you're on the
[44:28.440 --> 44:33.320]  welfare I mean it is such they want to bankrupt us so there's nothing we can do

[48:54.000 --> 48:58.240]  control that's the whole gentleman act that you people don't seem to get is to
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.760]  act weak and pathetic when you're a big sick predator now let's go ahead watch
[49:03.760 --> 49:09.760]  this right now go ahead and watch this this is what they think of you and they
[49:09.760 --> 49:12.960]  want you to know now and this is who runs your health care and this is who the
[49:12.960 --> 49:16.920]  Supreme Court says you pay your taxes to and they now run your health care you
[49:16.920 --> 49:20.520]  don't just pay them they decide what goes in your body because they want you
[49:20.520 --> 49:26.000]  dead or to hammer but slowly slowly slowly birth defects neurological
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.400]  disorders here it is here it is mostly what they do is hold summits I think
[49:31.400 --> 49:35.960]  that right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.680]  want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it
[49:40.680 --> 49:45.600]  one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.160]  downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.240]  and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.400]  that there's a Bernanke pot put and that we won't go any lower than say five
[49:59.400 --> 50:03.080]  percent down from here of course we are because if we look at the economic data
[50:03.080 --> 50:07.200]  there's nothing to get excited about in that so we you know yesterday we saw some
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.880]  reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance sheets and pump more
[50:10.880 --> 50:15.000]  money in but the stock market knows that reluctance is totally different than
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.800]  not willing to do it at all and that's why we saw oil and oil implode and gold
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.240]  trade off heavily because they're not a protected class if the stock market
[50:23.240 --> 50:27.160]  starts trading off in the 10 to 15 to 20 percent area the chairman's gonna come
[50:27.160 --> 50:30.560]  in and throw some stimulus at it so to answer your question we are absolutely
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.120]  slaves to central banks because we'd love to be slaves of the economy but the
[50:34.120 --> 50:37.960]  economic numbers continue to do nothing but trend lower mr. LeCamp do we work
[50:37.960 --> 50:42.580]  for the central bank we know that mr. LeCamp we do this is that let's stop
[50:42.580 --> 50:45.680]  right there and they all agree we work for the foreign bankers and we had a

[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:46.200]  all right I have just had an hour of torture just focusing on how evil
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:51.040]  government run banker run health care as the Supreme Court says it's a tax and
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:55.320]  it's a criminal tax directly to foreign banks but that's not even the bad boy
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:00.080]  they're gonna run health care and control even if you have the money for the
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:04.480]  procedures that after it's phased in what health care you can get they're
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:10.760]  moving to restrict vitamins and minerals and everything else I just I can't
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:14.960]  stand the control freak class and all the different scum and criminals that
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:19.000]  work for it now they get up there and say this is so children get health care
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  when they don't cover pre-existing conditions for children or anybody else
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:28.720]  for that matter and it's just further meant to totally bankrupt us meanwhile
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:32.560]  they take 76% of the money on average and put it into secret shell accounts they
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:36.840]  don't even really secret it's secret as the public's ignorant and I guess it's
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:39.760]  not a secret that a whale shark swimming around in the Gulf of Mexico but if you
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:45.600]  don't go and look at it identified it is a secret and it's just the people
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:50.040]  perish for lack of knowledge and it's all right there it's all just right there
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:55.680]  all how the criminal network works what they're doing how they're operating and
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:58.560]  once they get this plan really in place they're gonna just be killing this left
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:01.240]  and right all the stuff they put out in the environment and then they'll run the
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:05.960]  cure or the treatment and they'll run they'll have the the different charity
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.040]  events for it sit there and watch the killers running charity events for what
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:13.480]  they've done I mean it's just there's never an end to it there's net is it
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:18.280]  ever in does it ever stop because it is just evil's victory after victory after
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:24.600]  victory and all the stupid well-meaning people that conned by it like children
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:30.480]  have had their brains microwaved I mean I Eric in Colorado you've heard my rant
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:34.560]  about this the IRS now to enforce health care and penalties and interest if
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:37.320]  you don't and then they'll have your medical records I mean is there no end
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:45.200]  to this you know Alex I I think a lot of people had a similar reaction when a
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:50.600]  social security got passed so many decades ago I think you're being a
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:56.080]  little alarmist oh that is an actual talking point yeah and it bankrupted us
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:00.000]  to the foreign banks and we've lost so many of our freedoms and that's how they
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.560]  argue that the government there's no there's no social security there if
[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:06.720]  people took their social security money and put it in guaranteed investments of
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:10.320]  three and a half percent a year you'd get double the money most of the metric
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:14.880]  show go ahead so you support this you show so you like what the insurance
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:19.760]  companies wrote I do I do I I'm not gonna say that the insurance companies
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:24.120]  wrote it yes they they're gonna make more money off of it but the thing about
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  listen punk listen punk put him on hold put him on hold it is a fact that the
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:34.520]  insurance companies wrote this they had the head of the insurance company
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:38.640]  consortium their head lobbyists in the Wall Street Journal admitting that they
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:46.520]  wrote it and you just say I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say that that they
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.640]  wrote it the insurance companies wrote it people like Elena okay was Elena
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.480]  Kagan involved in the writing and putting it all together with the insurance
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:58.440]  companies and is that a conflict of interest to then be appointed to the

[1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:09.920]  deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:18.600]  GCN radio network. Okay I'm gonna go to your phone calls here in the horrible
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:25.240]  aftermath of banker care insurance company care known as Obamacare going in
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:30.400]  written by the insurance companies doesn't cover pre-existing conditions has
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.120]  the IRS make you give your medical records and that you have insurance to
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:40.200]  them and then they take money out of your bank account no judge no jury with
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:43.480]  penalties and interest and let me tell you whether penalties and interest work
[1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:46.560]  if you didn't buy five thousand dollars worth of health care by the way the price
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:51.120]  is going up now because of this it turns into fifteen thousand dollars in a year
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:55.080]  and they'll come take your house because they care about your children because
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:57.720]  the government wants you to have health care because they care about the
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:01.800]  children that's why the Associated Press admits it doesn't cover pre-existing
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:07.120]  conditions it's written by insurance companies to scam you period that
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:13.560]  criminal Elena Kagan that that came out of the same cloning tank as Janet
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:21.680]  Reno and big sis and the rest of them whatever her name is Mr. Mrs. MSNBC
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:31.080]  host Rachel Maddow you've got the same cloning tank you've got Sotomayor all
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:40.080]  these people Janet Napolitano I mean what a joke what a sickening joke and
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:44.560]  again some of these people appointed by Republicans Alito what do you expect the
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:47.680]  government has the power to tax you really any tax they want power to tax
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:51.960]  power to destroy and it doesn't just let the IRS control your health care and
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:56.800]  take your bank account as they jack up the prices and again it's up 25 plus
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  percent just just because of the law passing just getting ready for they
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:05.480]  they're about 50% in the next few years oh that's really good because it's
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:11.800]  written by insurance companies 30 plus million people they make by it now chief
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:16.320]  justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion he was joined by justice
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:29.560]  Sotomayor Ryder Anthony Kennedy Samuel Alito Scalia
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:35.080]  I'm reading it wrong from the top to the bottom I'm so angry I can hardly think
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:39.600]  right now chief justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion he was joined
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:47.080]  by justice this Sotomayor Ryder Ginsburg Kagan those in the dissent included
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:54.160]  justice's Anthony Kennedy Samuel Alito Scalia and Clarence Thomas and that's
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:58.160]  an argument right there vote Republican as bad as they are they didn't go with
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:07.040]  that and I mistakenly said Alito voted for earlier I was so angry I was
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:11.160]  reading this wrong so chief justice is John Roberts wrote the majority opinion
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:16.240]  he was joined by Sotomayor Ryder first Peter Ginsburg and Kagan that's
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:27.240]  graces so Scalia Alito Kennedy and Thomas voted against it the problem is if
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:33.440]  you had a mainline Republican in there who was just not as bad as Obama Obama
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:37.240]  is so bad I would probably be because these are such revolutionary criminals
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:39.840]  working with the bankers that I'd probably vote for him but I mean Mitt
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:45.000]  Romney supports abortion leased it in the past and he helped write what became
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.520]  the law and Elena Kagan helped write it
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:58.520]  I thought that was crazy when I was reading that Alito part but they haven't
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:01.600]  written out in two lines that look like it was stacked underneath each one I was
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:05.840]  like wow he voted for that and again I'm just in an absolute rage right now I'm
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:11.920]  totally disgusted by this here's Associated Press Obamacare does not
[1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:15.960]  cover pre-existing condition in kids but he's up there talking about how it's
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:19.080]  for the kids and how it's sweet and how it's compassionate and I saw a
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.520]  headline earlier in the week that 17 trillion has been spent on the poor in
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:27.760]  the last 50 years and that things haven't gotten better that's with cook
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:32.160]  numbers it's gotten worse things are worse out there look at it the people
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:36.320]  been turned into animals in fact guys I remember it was 15 or 17 trillion I'm so
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:41.840]  angry I can't think straight will you will you type in 17 trillion spent on
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:46.960]  the poor with no effect with no change I want to get get the actual headline I'm
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:52.120]  gonna go to your calls try to settle down now this is just absolutely
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:56.960]  disgusting to have the control freaks now in control of this and they admit
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:01.280]  it's a tax to the foreign banks they admit it's a tax but not a tax to
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:04.680]  criminal government to the insurance companies owned by the banks who see
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:09.080]  NBC says we're slaves to that rule us and the guests are like of course we're
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:13.360]  slaves of course we are that's just the way it is now and I'm not supposed to
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:19.520]  get angry by that and then I had a P-brain calling earlier I could tell
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:23.200]  that same slithering voice about there's not no problem with troops on the
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:27.120]  streets what's the big deal and he calls back in even though he didn't go by his
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:32.080]  real name P-brain and he says oh I'm not gonna agree with you the insurance
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:35.280]  companies wrote this really it's just admit it I'm not even gonna argue with
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:41.600]  you P-brain and I'm like let me guess you like abortion oh yes I do okay fine
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:46.360]  then okay it's one thing if you call a disagreeing when you call in with that
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:51.560]  self-affected self-important NPR voice because you feel powerful because you're
[1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:57.880]  part of the system because you've cozied up to Satan okay we got Dr. Vishnu
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:02.360]  Lars Sean Jackie Tim I'm gonna try to shut up now and go to your calls and try to
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:07.600]  just get myself under control right now Sean in Arizona you're on the air
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:13.240]  worldwide welcome welcome Alex don't feel too badly I kind of let the talking
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.560]  heads the cloud my vision a little bit when in my heart I always knew that the
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:24.080]  corporate fascist state would absolutely not allow this this legislation to be
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:29.040]  overturned we have to remember on a sad day for freedom and liberty such as
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:38.720]  today that our forefathers actually rested with the people met the people to
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:43.520]  be the the last arbitrators of what was constitutional and and not
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.640]  constitutional that's right juries grand juries and the people but now they put
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:51.880]  in electronic voting machines there's not elections in most areas we've got to
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:56.080]  admit we have a criminal government arming to the teeth against us that
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:59.800]  works for foreign banks it is illegitimate those aren't just words it
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:05.920]  is it is it's criminal and evil absolutely Lincoln Lincoln said it best
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:11.520]  he said the people are both masters of the courts and Congress's not to
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:16.440]  overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who perverted for two
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:21.480]  weeks I wanted to get one quote on that would just shake us to the bone and
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:26.680]  today is as great a time as ever and I'll end this with this quote if you
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:31.800]  will allow me because it is absolutely apropos to where we're at and what
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:36.840]  you're trying to wake up our fellow citizens that the quote starts as
[1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:42.160]  follows if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:47.280]  bloodshed if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not so
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:52.880]  costly you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:59.040]  against you and only a precarious chance for survival there may be yet a worse
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:06.080]  case you may have to fight when there is no chance of victory because it has
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:13.960]  better to perish than to live as slaves Winston Churchill yeah that's a good
[1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:17.680]  quote and he said that on the radio and and no that's it that that's what I've
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:21.560]  explained to people this isn't a game folks they really do put cancer viruses
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:25.920]  in the vaccines they're killing us look at the numbers I mean this is real this
[1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:31.000]  isn't a game and we have a childlike public who has no idea amazing call
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  amazing points that you just made that's why I get so enraged when people
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:40.640]  like P-brain call in and just sit there and go oh yeah I like it oh it's loving
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:46.240]  itself no it's not no it's not they said there wasn't death panels in there
[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:53.040]  when they're in there these these boards that decide the healthcare you get they
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:57.560]  killing all these babies to them they think it's funny you're gonna get
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:01.120]  destroyed we tell you all you cockroaches that love this system and all
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:05.120]  you swabs and all you control freaks this thing's gonna collapse you
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:08.680]  understand that it's designed to kill you that's the sick part about it the
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:11.760]  new allures a bunch of trash those you that go along with this you deserve what
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:16.320]  you get so I hope you enjoy it let's go ahead and talk to Jackie in Montana
[1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:25.760]  you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I've got a couple of points here one well
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:30.120]  maybe three first I thought we were supposed to be represented before
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:34.760]  taxed I don't feel represented that's right no taxation without representation
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:39.920]  that's one of the things that started 1776 exactly we don't have representation
[1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:45.480]  look that's that we pay the money directly to the bankers that own the
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:49.040]  insurance companies and their enforcer the Federal Reserve they set up the same
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:55.640]  year they got the IRS we pay it to them if we pay it they tell us we're slaves
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:18:08.720]  they tell us to our face I tell you what I'm feeling like one but the tax the
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:14.680]  supposed tax from what I'm understanding it wasn't sent to the proper place to
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:19.960]  even be they had that witch in there Kagan at the White House before he made
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:24.240]  her Supreme Court justice she was at the corporate meetings running it with the
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:28.280]  bankers in the insurance companies to write the screw job that's illegal too
[1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:33.640]  it's illegal to ship guns into Mexico to drug cartels and ship cocaine in it's
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:37.160]  illegal for the UN to kidnap little kids all over the world and fly them into
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:41.760]  Saudi Arabia to blow their heads off on videotape but they sure do it just
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:47.720]  we're a bunch of naive idiots I'm sorry go ahead I got two other things real
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:53.400]  quick I brought this up on Twitter before and that's the fact that Spain's
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:57.680]  going to be counting our votes how are we going to be able to verify or know
[1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:06.440]  that they're being counted properly it's all fraud they look it's illegal in all
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:10.320]  the statutes to have Congress or anybody else inside our trading and then
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:15.040]  they had the media come out right before healthcare to blackmail them and and
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.920]  oh look they're all inside our trading and then they and then they let them
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.400]  and then they let them come out and say oh it's legal when we do it because we
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:25.280]  said in the media went along with that they're just criminals they're dirt
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:30.320]  they're scum they're trash they're evil they're gonna eat us out of house and
[1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:34.320]  home they've sent forth scores of bureaucrats eat out our substance dr.

[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:50.800]  getting out of here at least if I moved out of the United States though I
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:53.680]  wouldn't have to look at all the bureaucrats and even in a third-world
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:57.560]  country the bankers have already blown everything out so bad there's not cops
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:01.640]  every five feet and bureaucrats everywhere I can go hide in the jungle or
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:05.960]  something I'm just so sick of being around all this scum and knowing their
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:09.640]  murderers and killers and drug dealers and having to watch these whores in the
[1:25:09.640 --> 1:25:16.280]  media push him as God's gift to the earth I'm beside myself with anger I I
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.960]  don't keep saying that I'm blowing up during the breaks here I just I just am
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:26.040]  so angry dr. Vishnu in Florida what's your take on our new doctor the IRS and
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:29.840]  the Federal Reserve that controls our bank accounts and everything else very
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:33.400]  nice people I'm sure they'll be nicer once the casual societies in though
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:38.560]  what's your take on our new government-run health care well to be honest
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:43.960]  Alex I'm absolutely beside myself I just I don't get this this is absolute and
[1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:48.600]  total tyranny when you have no control of your body anymore and the government
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.160]  has to tell you what to do and how to live how to be born and how to die it's
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:58.760]  it's a problem it's a big problem and I'm 98% of my patients here in central
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:03.440]  Florida are geriatric patients and I and I deal with them holistically and I'm
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:09.400]  constantly constantly having to get rid of the problems that they have due to
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:15.760]  the vaccines the yearly flu shots they take in and and they have no clue and on
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.200]  top of the fact that I have four children who have never been vaccinated
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:25.000]  who were born at home and I see the it my heart just falls every day to see
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:31.200]  their friends dealing with ADD dealing with multiple immune system breakdowns
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.520]  due to the multiple numbers cancer off the charts neurological ever they're
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:40.960]  killing us and we know they are it's not like it's our opinion we have all the
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:45.880]  documents I mean they're killing off the old people they say it in Time Magazine
[1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:50.880]  and Newsweek how they're scum and need to be gotten rid of I mean it's so sick
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:55.320]  and then you get some control freak calling up going Kevin it wants to
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:27:01.280]  help us I think it's good it's liberal no it's not
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:06.440]  especially I believe when you see what's going on during flu season when you
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:10.240]  know they're they're putting the ads out they're having the placards out in
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:14.080]  front of Walmart and CVS and Walgreens come in get your flu shot got to have
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:18.080]  your flu shot it and now everywhere I go I walk down the street it's like every
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:21.880]  fifth child or whatever looks like it just blasted with autism just you can
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:25.800]  you know doing all the autistic ticks and things you just feel sorry for them
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:30.560]  it'll be a good-looking kid to nice parents you just realize oh enemy attack
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:33.680]  them and then some cop drives by looking at you like like you've done
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:36.560]  something wrong and I know that I'm not saying the cop himself is bad but I'm
[1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:40.160]  like hey they just brain damaged this kid I'm sick of it I mean that's why I get
[1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:44.640]  so angry I get so angry at the system and some moron TSA person asking me
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:48.160]  where I'm going and stuff you know to like get me used to being talked to
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:53.520]  acclimating me and I'm just like shut up shut up idiot your boss has carried out
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:58.760]  the attacks you scumbag pedophile I'm sorry doc anything else no problem
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:02.240]  well there are two things I just want to mention I think your work with Dr. Wallach
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:06.920]  is profound it's great stuff his stuff is great I know him has worked for a long
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:13.360]  time and secondly it I believe that if the public at large just look at what's
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:16.800]  already out there there's some an organization it's not a prophet it's
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:20.400]  called the National Center for Homeopathy there in every county in the
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:25.160]  United States you can learn how to take care of your family using simple non-toxic
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:28.920]  homeopathic remedies exactly that's what this is all about you don't into that
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:32.880]  stuff there's the herbalist there's all of it and it's all under attack by this
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:37.520]  medical tyranny run by the banks who created and financed this model of
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:41.240]  medical tyranny they wrote the whole deal they did the whole deal let me talk
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:43.880]  about that by the way in the next hour I didn't have it planned that way for the
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:47.840]  ruling to come down today but they sure dropped this on us like a ton of bricks
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:52.720]  I physically feel assaulted I don't think anything has upset me this much
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:56.520]  except for 9-11 that day I knew it was coming and I saw him do it and I knew
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:00.640]  everything was gonna come after it and it's just it's just total confirmation
[1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:04.640]  and I knew that they were gonna rule this way and they sucker punched everybody
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:08.200]  so that there wouldn't be opposition built to it so everybody would just kind
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:12.240]  of shut up and go along with it it's all psych war chiefs it's all coordinated
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:16.720]  at the top the Republicans and Democrats they might give us a sacrificial lamb
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:19.720]  politically of Eric Holder but I doubt that because he knows where all the

[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:27.640]  article is media whitewash is Olympic security scandal revelations about
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.680]  casket liners plan for evacuation of London blacklisted we'll just call him
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:38.280]  Lee but he's an investigative journalist he first brought this story to the
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:42.560]  national media they didn't want to cover it and said that there's a blackout
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:49.680]  they've since he came out and did get on news radio in England with Tony Gosling
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:54.040]  who has his own show of Bilderberg org is a great journalist once he was able
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:58.040]  to go on that show there's now been some whitewashing about oh there are some
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:02.520]  stuff happening but basically it's designed to fail and just like we broke
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:07.040]  the plan for martial law in Chicago and evacuation if there was an attack later
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:11.480]  it was confirmed in the Chicago Tribune Washington Post for NATO that's basically
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:17.400]  what's happening here it's a standard program and he'll just go by Lee the
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:22.920]  article again is media whitewash is Olympic security scandal the original
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:28.520]  article was whistleblower bills plan to evacuate London during Olympics and Lee
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:34.240]  joins us now I really appreciate you coming on today Lee you've got the floor
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:42.000]  tell us here today well it's absolutely my pleasure being here I first went
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.840]  into G4S because I was concerned about how the training people I heard some
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:51.040]  stories and of course you can't just listen to what people say you have to
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:55.240]  get in there and find out for yourself so I did so I went to a training center I
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:36:00.160]  signed myself up to be an Olympic security officer I already had a security
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:05.240]  into authority license from a previous investigation I'd already done and by the
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:08.920]  end of the day after a brief interview and when I say brief interview they
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:13.640]  basically said what's your name I told them they said take your three cups can
[1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:16.920]  you tell the difference between orange juice water and
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:21.080]  there was nothing in the third cup I said absolutely that's orange juice that's
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:26.200]  water and they went right you're in and a few weeks later I was given the my
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:31.640]  first training assignment where I had to turn back up at the school again and
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:35.640]  basically they started showing me a PowerPoint presentation of what a
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:40.760]  security guard does for the Olympics and that I was assigned to work
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:43.720]  in a pedestrian screening area well I am assigned to work in a pedestrian
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:47.640]  screening area which is why I'm going by another name obviously to hide my
[1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:53.840]  identity so I don't get kicked out and so the security training is so inadequate
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.080]  for these people that they're dragging the job centers for everybody so if you're
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:02.400]  a long term unemployed in London and you live in an Olympic borough you have no
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:05.640]  choice but to go down to the Olympics so most of these people don't even want to
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:10.240]  be there I've been tried well they tried to build drugs to me while I was in my
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:14.480]  classroom someone came up to me and actually said do you want to buy some
[1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:19.600]  marijuana it was I he opened the package up and there it was and it had that
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  let me let me just stop you for a minute here Lee your your phone's a little
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:27.280]  overdriven a little muffled can you back off of it a little bit
[1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:31.600]  oh sure yeah absolutely how's that yeah back off a little more go ahead and
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:34.240]  then start back over with the marijuana what was happening there
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:41.120]  well I was approached in one of my classes and by a student and he offered to
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:46.800]  tell me marijuana in the classroom this is a student training to be an Olympic
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:52.200]  security officer but later on one of the training officers training us
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:57.760]  saw him do it to someone else and he turned him and said hey mate can you do
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:02.240]  that outside wait for a break he actually said that he didn't kick him out
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:06.440]  he didn't throw the police he didn't do anything he's gonna wait for a bit later
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:12.000]  so you can do that in a break I think it's absolutely ridiculous and it goes
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.640]  on from there really tell us about yourself as an investigative journalist
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:23.720]  why you got this idea you know basically how you signed up and why you're
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:27.320]  going public with this information because obviously it's all a bunch of
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:32.720]  security theater as we've learned with the TSA where they wantonly are hiring
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:37.640]  criminals yeah yeah I mean you know as an investigative journalist I'm a
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:41.880]  filmmaker and an investigative journalist I used to work on a program here in the
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:48.320]  UK called Cook Report which was I suppose you know the last great independent
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:52.480]  investigative journalist program that there was in this country until we did a
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:56.680]  story called Castro Questions which was about 30 politicians taking bribes and
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:39:02.200]  the company was bought out by a big American corporation, Cartman Communications, they
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:05.360]  came in they swooped down they shut us down and that was the end of that so
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:08.480]  you're on freelance and ever since then I don't want to be too specific in what I've
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:11.920]  worked on because obviously that will give me a way as well I've been a
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:15.640]  freelance investigative journalist and I also I make documentary films and what
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:19.160]  have you and I've worked for all the major broadcasters as well as doing
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:23.160]  independent stuff myself so you know the reason that really that I wanted to do
[1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:28.520]  G4S because I care about the Olympics this is the biggest event this country's
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:35.960]  ever going to see and I don't want it basically ruined by an organization that
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:41.320]  when they got the job to do the security they received 86 million pound
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:46.040]  contract and within a couple of years they've buttoned up to 284 million
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:50.160]  pounds I don't understand where the money is going so I went okay I don't get this
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:54.960]  I want to go and join the security team and and we'll find out exactly what
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:01.720]  they're like. Why do you think they're doing this I mean they claim they're such
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:06.800]  a big terror threat why do they want the most flimsy security possible tell us
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:10.920]  about who's involved I know Watson's article was reporting that it's mainly
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:16.600]  foreigners who were to be the security people. Yeah yeah that's you know
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:23.720]  predominantly true they are there's a lot of Nigerians and a lot of Asians who
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:30.720]  are basically the local populace of the areas of the Olympic boroughs they're
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:35.280]  very black heavily in Asian areas of London and they're getting them to
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:38.800]  basically work it they haven't done a day's worth of security in their life
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:42.920]  they're having to put them through their security industry authority license they
[1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:47.600]  have to be licensed before you do any kind of security work in the UK and so the
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:52.240]  Olympic authority are paying for everybody to have the FIA licenses and
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:56.480]  these people are being rushed through this program it's not a hard program but
[1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:00.520]  it's a proper test I did it I actually found it you know you had to revise for
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:03.840]  it there's no that going on they sit there for a couple days and they get
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:09.400]  the license which is a joke in itself really and then they're on to doing
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:13.000]  security training and the reason that this is happening is that they want the
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:18.480]  worst security there because obviously as far as I can see if something happens
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:23.120]  a terrorist gets in they can blame it on the security and G4S being the biggest
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:28.160]  security company in the world so they claim will basically blame this
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:32.280]  local indigenous population who they couldn't train work or untrainable or
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:35.960]  whatever excuse they'll come up with at the time you know I'm used to doing
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:41.720]  false flag operations as part of investigative journalism that I've
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:46.440]  done previously and I proved over the shadow of the doubt I talked to British
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:51.720]  agents and their handlers to inclusion between the IRA and the British
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:55.480]  government and in fact one of the British agents said to me there are more British
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:00.240]  soldiers in the IRA than there are Irish people in the IRA I've had members
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:04.880]  British commandos on who were killed after they were on the show I've had
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:10.120]  people like steak knife on that got forced out by alternative journalists
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:14.480]  but was later for those that don't know in the London Guardian and the other big
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:20.720]  papers that the entire leadership cell was not infiltrated but was run by
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:26.240]  British intelligence and they would do violent things if they couldn't get IRA
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:31.960]  members to carry out attacks that's right yeah yeah and you know from Jerry
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:39.240]  Adams my McGinnis steak knife there's another guy Kevin Fulton these people
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:44.360]  are all British agents you know and and so I've done this kind of work before
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:51.640]  and this agent Kevin Fulton had trained with the FBI had come back over
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:56.680]  with Ireland and was teaching other IRA members how to make bombs that go off
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:00.680]  with the camera flashing infrared flash so I know all about forced flag
[1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:07.480]  operations and this to me feels like the same thing that putting in a level of
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:11.840]  security that isn't inadequate I'm telling you that now I was at the training
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:17.720]  facility a couple of weeks ago and people didn't know how to search a bag you
[1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:20.520]  know they were standing there and it was like a little test I was telling
[1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:24.160]  next one of the trainers and the guy was going through trying to search a bag and
[1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:27.600]  just basically staring at it you know touching it with his hands and the
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:31.600]  trainer said it's alright mate I know what you mean and I laughed and I looked
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:37.000]  at him and said I'm glad you took you explained to me what was he doing and the
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:42.760]  trainer just said to me move on don't ask all right right when I've asked
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:47.960]  questions about how the training's going you know what sort of things we'll be
[1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.360]  doing all I've been told is be the robot exactly those words I'm quoting a
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:57.120]  trainer said to me be the robot because it was always worried because we were
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:02.360]  having to wear a uniform that's accused uniform from the Olympic venue back to
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:06.120]  our homes and then back to office people at the next day and I said well hold on
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:10.320]  a minute this is a security risk policemen don't do that soldiers don't do
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:14.200]  that why are we expecting to do that I care about my family I don't want them
[1:44:14.200 --> 1:44:18.560]  held hostage while I have to let someone through a gate or not search them
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:21.800]  properly you know to get them into the stadium you know that in itself is a
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:25.960]  security risk and the guys that says to me don't worry about it mate just be the
[1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:29.560]  robot you know this is crazy stuff that's going on down here at the moment
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:34.680]  we've also got these troops that are coming into London in actual fact they're
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:39.880]  helicoptering them in under the cover of night time if you live in Greenwich or
[1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:44.400]  in southeast London near Woolwich barracks you will hear Chinook helicopters
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.240]  going backwards and forwards all night long and that's them busing in these
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:53.560]  troops and an army a British army major who's a doctor there told me that he's
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:57.560]  got to look after a hundred thousand troops as they come through Woolwich
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:01.640]  barracks and then they moved on to other barracks in and around London and he
[1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:05.080]  said he's being a lot of Americans and he's being a lot of Germans and a lot of
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:09.280]  other nationalities and I said well these UN troops then he said yeah I think so
[1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:13.120]  so let's be clear you're an investigative journalist and part of
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:17.840]  these TV shows all of this Tony yeah Gosling says you know he can vouch for
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:22.160]  you he's a great journalist as well and you've you've covered false flag that's
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:27.440]  on record these events have gone on and now you're saying you're seeing all the
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:32.480]  telltale signs of false flag being prepared and more they're bringing in
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:40.200]  to station all over London a hundred thousand troops I guess using this really
[1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:46.760]  is an I for NATO slash UN invasion cover because I've noticed they use these
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:51.960]  drills as pretext for another mission in the future so I'm not saying that the
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:57.400]  UN's invading now the point is this is just to acclimate everyone and get
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:03.560]  everybody prepared for it in the future one he told you one hundred thousand
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:09.560]  troops where are they stationing them where are they bivouacking them well
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:14.200]  they're coming into Chinook in the Woolwich barracks they're going through a
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:17.920]  medical procedure there and an orientation procedure and then they're
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:22.800]  getting moved out and I assume they're coming in in batches of a hundred or
[1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:27.640]  hundred and twenty hundred fifty these helicopter flights are going on all the
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:30.560]  time throughout the night I mean it's the fact that they're doing that at night
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:34.160]  but not in the daytime which is suspicious anyway I don't like things
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:37.480]  done under the cover of darkness you know especially when armies and governments
[1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:42.120]  involved and then they're putting them out to barracks all around London and
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:48.120]  they're just sticking there and they're just waiting there and basically as someone
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:51.520]  said to me today there's the world column in it one of these hundred thousand
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:58.440]  troops they're going to be for and I was told as training at G4S that we were
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:02.120]  going to be involved in a and I'm coasting now so I'm going to get it
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:06.880]  absolutely right at the final moment in the history of London this is not
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:10.640]  talking about the Olympics they were talking about an event after the
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:14.240]  Olympics and they said it would be a defining moment in the history of
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:20.400]  London now now give folks the date of the Olympics over there sorry what's the
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:29.000]  exact date again of the Olympics because I've talked to police and they've been
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  told be ready for martial law by September slash October I've talked to
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:45.160]  police in Austin Texas I've talked to police in Dallas Saint Louis Washington
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:50.040]  DC in San Francisco all saying the same thing that doesn't mean they'll pull the
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:54.280]  trigger but they're telling these guys high level this is going to happen
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:48:00.240]  they've already federalized in these rapid response teams local police key
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.440]  units and they're getting ready for a global meltdown and I think they could
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:09.400]  use the Olympics you know back at the Munich Olympics they have one day in
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:12.920]  September it's narrated by Michael Douglas and at the end of it they have
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:16.320]  the former head of German intelligence admit the whole thing had been staged
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:21.160]  and was fake that they'd staged a hijacking and I went to the thing won
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:26.040]  an Academy Award and as an afterthought they admit they staged that at the
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:30.280]  Olympics I forget what year was that at the German Olympics where that happened
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:41.440]  in Munich I'm gonna look at Munich terror attack Munich 1972 and again just at
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:45.480]  the end of the movie that the former head of German intelligence laughs and
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:48.880]  says but you know the whole thing was staged and we stage the hijacking and
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:53.040]  we ran the terrorist they ran the terrorist commanding the minions they
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:57.440]  sent who didn't even know can you believe the magnitude of that evil yeah
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:01.080]  and you know and I think that they're gearing up to do something like that
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:04.640]  again because you know as a G for a security officer I'm going to be
[1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:08.680]  involved in apparently the evacuation of London or a possible evacuation of
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:13.400]  London that's exactly what they've told us they actually spent quite a lot of
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:17.920]  time talking about the evacuation of London and this defining moment in the
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:21.920]  history of London more so really than they told us about how to search someone
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:27.480]  actually the mechanics of you know being the excuse officer this was they were very keen
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.880]  on getting this information into us that after the Olympics we would be involved
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:35.160]  in some things and they were gonna say what it was obviously you don't need to
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:39.840]  know but we were gonna be involved in this evacuation of London and a friend
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:43.600]  of mine said to me says well how would you evacuate London let me stop you
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  because again this is so bombshell it's not that they're just planning for the
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:52.280]  contingency they're saying this is going to happen they're saying that we as
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:56.480]  security officers are going to be involved in the evacuation of London
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:50:00.680]  that's what I've got that's my quote that's what's written down it's not a
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:03.520]  possible evacuation I've said that I said well maybe it's possible
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:07.280]  evacuation because this sounds crazy but actually they're talking about they
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:11.040]  said you're going to be involved in the evacuation of London and you will be
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:15.040]  dealing with members of the public okay I've talked to Gosling journalist there
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:19.080]  in England radio show they're in the country great scoops he gives us
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:21.800]  routinely he's one of the guys that really discover where Barbara would be
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:27.400]  first this year he can vouch for you you sound credible but if you are credible
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:31.240]  and this follows the paradigm we've got a lot of leaks that this is coming
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:35.800]  already if this is credible buddy you better come out quick with who you are
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:39.320]  I know you want to keep going in and getting intel but they're gonna discover
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:44.240]  who you are and you could end up I mean they've killed people involved in the
[1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:48.800]  Rupert Murdoch investigation for heaven's sakes I mean stay there I mean
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:51.600]  you know how people they killed who were in British intelligence who had a
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:56.000]  conscience and went public how they were really running the inoff the IRA this is
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:02.360]  hardcore stay there sir we'll be right back wow wow hi this is Alex Jones did

[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:10.360]  got
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:43.800]  You know, I wish that this story wasn't credible in my mind, but this investigative journalist
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:50.640]  who we'll just call Lee, but I've seen it over and over again.
[1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:52.840]  I mean, 7-7 was a government event.
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:56.360]  You can go look up the research on it, run by MI6.
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:55:02.520]  They had a former high-level FBI counter-terrorism guy, what John Loftus went on Fox News and
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:03.520]  exposed it.
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:08.120]  And it was in the British papers, but it's like, okay, the head of the bombings, MI6.
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:11.560]  They set up some guys in a drill.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:14.200]  Some of them figured it out and ran, got killed.
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:16.800]  This guy's got a lot of courage we're talking to.
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:23.040]  Lee, you've worked these IRA cases being staged by British intelligence with the FBI and others.
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:29.040]  You know a bunch of those guys got killed, including investigative journalist.
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:30.040]  You've got a lot of courage.
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:32.040]  Why are you doing this?
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:38.880]  Because, well, A, it's in the public interest to know these things, because if you don't
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:43.240]  know what's going on, then you can't defend against anything.
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:48.120]  If you know that the security is lax, but you know that they're actually going to turn
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:53.320]  off the walk-through metal detectors at peak times to get people into the stadium.
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:55:57.680]  They won't be any metal detectors on going into that stadium, and someone could basically
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:00.640]  walk through with a bomb, and you're not going to know because it's not going to ping
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:02.400]  because it's not going to be on.
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:03.400]  People need to know this.
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:07.080]  If you've got teeth and go to the Olympics, or if you're working at the Olympics, you
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:10.520]  need to know, and that's what whistleblowing is all about.
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:14.160]  You come out and you say, hey, look, this is in the public interest.
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:15.680]  I'm not doing this to be a hero.
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:19.920]  In fact, actually, I'm in danger in my life by telling you this, but it's in the public
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:25.680]  interest for people to know the fact, and that's why I do it, because I care about people.
[1:56:25.680 --> 1:56:30.520]  I care about people in my country and from around the world, and I don't want to see
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:36.040]  anything happen to them other than the Olympics, or for any other event, or on the tube or
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:37.040]  anything.
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:38.920]  What do you think the defining moment could be?
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:44.120]  A terror attack, a bio-weapon release, and then the troops appear from NATO and UN to
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:48.080]  save everyone, and, oh, we learned how great it is to be occupied, because I know they've
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:53.320]  done those drills here, NLE09, NLEO10, NLEO11.
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:54.320]  People can look those up.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:56.320]  I mean, what do you think's happening?
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:58.200]  What are they planning to do with 100,000 troops?
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:00.520]  You know, I really don't know.
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:04.600]  However, what I've sort of been speculating on is the fact that what would make people
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:08.800]  want to leave London, and basically, it's going to be a bio-weapon of some kind.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:15.640]  You know, if a bomb goes off at the stadium, yeah, it needs to be quite a large bomb or
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:17.800]  anything, but it won't give you to the bomb or anything like that.
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:21.640]  It'll be a bomb, and it will just go off, probably high-velocity air bombers that they've
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:25.600]  got now, and they'll say it's a biological weapon, and it won't be.
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:30.600]  They'll just say it, and then the troops will come in, and people will want to leave London.
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:32.880]  People will be trying to desperately get out.
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:36.680]  Well, number one, I mean, I don't get scared of big crowds, but I don't like it.
[1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:40.680]  I mean, I remember being a kid at a Dallas Cowboys game, I'm going, man, what happened
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:41.680]  to me?
[1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:44.520]  If something just instinctively, a child, I couldn't put my finger on it, but now I
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:50.000]  know, instinctively, if there's a stampede, a fire, whatever, it's a death trap, and this
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.440]  will have to be investigated obviously further.
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:58.880]  I hope your story is inaccurate, but from credible sources, they say you're credible,
[1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:00.840]  and this fits the MO.
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:02.480]  It's all theater to begin with.
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:06.880]  Now, could the supervisor have been mistaken about what he was told?
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:10.560]  How many people told you that there will be this big defining event?
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:14.720]  Well, two trainers were in the room at any one time.
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:18.360]  There's one trainer given a presentation, and another trainer basically sitting in
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:20.840]  the corner, and checking what they say and what they say.
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:24.840]  So this is standard training, is that a big defining moment's coming up?
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:25.840]  That's right.
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:31.520]  800 people a day have gone through that training center, and every 800 people that go through
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:32.520]  it have been told.
[1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:36.520]  And so the rest of the story is, the media needs to go vet your story, but they won't
[1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:41.320]  telling us it's probably true, we'll be right back.

[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:26.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.680 --> 2:00:35.920]  All right, I'm coming down off of the blood-pumping, headache-indistinguishing anger over the Global
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:41.440]  Crime Syndicate and its private collection agency, the private fellow reserve, the IRS,
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:47.360]  quasi-government, running my healthcare and grabbing money out of my bank account, being
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:51.040]  upheld by the Supreme Court after the sucker punch of saying it wouldn't be.
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:53.760]  We knew that was a fraud.
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:57.920]  Hospital stocks soar on Supreme Court's ruling to uphold Obama's signature healthcare
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:00:58.920]  law.
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:03.880]  And I had a moron call in earlier and say the insurance companies didn't write it when
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:07.360]  they're on record bragging the head of their lobby.
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:11.760]  People up in the news saying, I mean, these poor little mainline liberals are like little
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:13.280]  children.
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:17.320]  They just have no idea.
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:20.520]  And now the Supreme Court says it's a tax for the private insurance companies.
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:25.920]  I mean, you know, just, and they just can't understand that.
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:26.920]  They just can't get.
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:29.680]  It's a big scam, and they're a schmuck.
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:32.880]  Let's go to Lee, investigative journalist, I'll just leave it at that.
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:36.280]  The articles are up at infowars.com and prisonbunna.com.
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:39.480]  I obviously want to get you back up on the nightly news sometime next week as we get
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:42.400]  closer to all of this.
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:46.880]  The rest of the story is that you've tried to already get this to national media, haven't
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:47.880]  you?
[2:01:47.880 --> 2:01:48.880]  Yeah.
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:49.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:55.800]  I've got a contact at Channel 4 News, who I regularly work with.
[2:01:55.800 --> 2:02:00.760]  And this story was actually originally going to go out through him.
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:04.320]  And he basically told me he said there's a blackout on this story.
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:05.320]  We're not doing it.
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:09.640]  And I said, oh, so I tried by other contacts, other major media, and I said, we're not going
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:11.840]  to do anything that's going to go against the Olympics.
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:16.240]  And I was like, ah, well, how do I get this story out?
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:23.320]  And the fabulous Tony Gosling said, you know, he invited me onto his show so we could break
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:24.320]  the story that way.
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:29.040]  It needs to, it actually, I couldn't even get it into a paper, you know, or anything
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:30.040]  like that.
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:34.440]  So that's why I, you know, I turned to Tony Gosling, you know, and he's great.
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:41.840]  And he showed us amazing, we've had an amazing response for it.
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:48.520]  Well we need to get this out to people because I've never had so much chatter and sources
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:52.920]  that won't name themselves for a couple months saying, watch the Olympics, something's big
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:53.920]  is going to happen.
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:55.840]  And we know it.
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:03:01.440]  We know the Germans would stage the deal at the Olympics in 72.
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:06.560]  That's admitted in one day in September, Academy Award-winning documentary.
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:10.640]  And again, the whole movie is about Islamic terrorists and everything.
[2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:14.120]  And at the end, they admit, by the way, we staged it with them.
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:15.120]  Hello.
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:16.120]  Yes, are you there?
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  Yes, no, I'm here.
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:18.120]  Yeah, great.
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  But you're gone then.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:24.120]  No, no, no, I'm just marveling that they may go ahead with this even though you've
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  exposed it.
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:26.600]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:32.760]  Well, yeah, one of the reasons why I wanted to expose it was to hopefully say, hey look,
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:36.200]  we know something's wrong, we don't know exactly what you're going to do, but you're
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:41.320]  going to do something and hopefully expose this so that they change their plans and do
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:42.320]  nothing.
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:43.320]  That's my hope.
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:46.920]  I mean, there's four weeks to go and I'm trying to get this everywhere I possibly can.
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:52.600]  I mean, one example was that they were facing the bomb checks in the stadium for the past
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:53.600]  three years.
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:59.600]  They came out the other day in a newspaper here and a couple of guys from G4S got back.
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  But, you know, it hasn't gone any higher than that.
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:04.600]  They said, oh, well, you know, it's these guys' fault.
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  If you're facing the bomb checks in the stadium for the past three years, you put your name
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  to it, that is fraud and that needs to be a criminal investigation.
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:18.600]  But of course, no one investigates G4S, they're actually above the law and that's what worries
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:19.600]  me.
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:22.840]  I want to set you up for the nightly news with an in-depth commercial free interview.
[2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:23.840]  Hopefully.
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:24.840]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:28.400]  We'll be in contact today and thank you for all the work you're doing and I look forward
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:29.400]  down the road.
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:33.840]  Hopefully, at some time, you can reveal your identity after you've been employed there.
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:34.840]  Are you planning to do that?
[2:04:34.840 --> 2:04:35.840]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:36.840]  I will do that.
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:37.840]  That's not that.
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:38.840]  It's the big reveal.
[2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:43.560]  All right, well, we'll do that in the aftermath and hopefully we can't avert this false flag.
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:49.720]  We have a special guest coming up to give us his medical take on what's happening with
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:56.720]  government-run healthcare straight ahead and I've got CBS News is going to be here to
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:00.720]  interview me and not a good day to interview me probably.
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:02.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:06.160]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:07.800]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[2:05:07.800 --> 2:05:11.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:12.840]  or gold?
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:16.120]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:18.360]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:22.520]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:23.520]  seeds.
[2:05:23.520 --> 2:05:28.840]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:30.720]  food for you and your family.
[2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:31.840]  And here's the best part.
[2:05:31.840 --> 2:05:36.040]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[2:05:36.040 --> 2:05:38.520]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:41.760]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:48.560]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:52.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:57.560]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[2:05:57.560 --> 2:05:59.760]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:04.480]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods

[2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:21.240]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:29.640]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:34.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:39.480]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[2:07:39.480 --> 2:07:46.280]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[2:07:55.920 --> 2:08:01.320]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:19.360]  Please the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:26.840]  We are in to hour number three and for the next 30 minutes, I wanted to get Dr. Doug
[2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:32.760]  Joel Wallach on today and then we're going to get him back on the nightly news tonight
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:35.600]  for a more in-depth discussion.
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:40.600]  We also are going to get, speaking of that's why I said Doug, Dr. Doug Rocky back on to
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:46.720]  get his take on government-run mandated healthcare and we're also going to get Dr. Russell Blalock
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:52.760]  on MD, brain surgeon, who really breaks down the horrors of government-run healthcare.
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:56.640]  More news and your phone calls coming up at the bottom of the hour for folks that are
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:02.760]  holding, you can either hold or disconnect, but we will be taking calls as well as I did
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:05.800]  for much of the last hour.
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:11.920]  How they voted, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, he was joined
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:21.920]  by Sotomayor, Ryre, Ginsburg and Kagan, Kagan who helped codify the Romney healthcare plan
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:24.040]  with the insurance companies.
[2:09:24.040 --> 2:09:29.560]  So she was the one in the White House codifying it for the insurance companies who incidentally,
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:35.960]  Daily Mail and Associated Press report hospital stocks soar on Supreme Court's ruling to
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:40.040]  uphold Obama's signature healthcare law.
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:43.760]  Insurance companies wrote it, they bragged they did, it makes 35 million people buy the
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:52.920]  healthcare and allows them to control what procedures you can get from MD-directed medicine.
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:59.360]  So part of this tyranny is they're going after the herbalist, everybody else, it's on.
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:03.680]  They admit, by the way, the Supreme Court, I have the ruling right here, it's everywhere,
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:08.660]  you can't miss it, they're saying the government has the power to tax really without representation
[2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:13.360]  and so you now pay your taxes to the insurance companies owned by the big six mega banks.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:17.920]  That's what this is, your taxes directly to the banks, that's what needs to be pointed
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:18.920]  out here.
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:22.640]  I'm not seeing any articles, they're all saying it's a tax to the government.
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:29.040]  No it's not, it's a tax to the big mega banks who, if you go back to the 20s, had the reports
[2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:34.680]  put out through Congress to start trying to restrict all the other four branches of medicine
[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:39.680]  and to create this monolithic system and then they sold that plan to the Germans who accelerated
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:43.960]  it faster, you know, the first people Hitler killed was through the medical system, that's
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:45.800]  all on record.
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:52.200]  The Soviets use it as well as a tyranny and I wanted to get Dr. Joel Wallach and over
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:56.000]  the next few days and next week we're going to have, you know, Dr. Eisenstein on as a
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:59.600]  medical doctor and exposes the tyranny of the medical system, we're going to have other
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:05.120]  folks on, we're going to have, again, people that are experts in how corrupt the system
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:12.080]  is like Dr. Doug Rocky, we're going to be doing it all, but we're joined by Dr. Joel
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:18.080]  Wallach right now and boy does he have a long bio, I will not go over the entire thing,
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:24.320]  he ran a big federal program doing autopsies on zoological animals and he found most of
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:31.360]  the illnesses were deficiency related and he attended University of Missouri and received
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:35.800]  his bachelor's degree in science of agriculture, veterinary for 30 years, he worked as a research
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:41.000]  veterinary pathologist at several institutes and for humans they do animal testing, that's
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:46.680]  why his work is so important and universities including regional primate research center
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:50.720]  in Atlanta, that's the big famous one where he discovered and identified the first animal
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:56.440]  models for cystic fibrosis in monkeys, he found that he could reproduce their condition
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:12:01.560]  at will because it was a nutritional deficiency, Dr. Wallach then made the decision to go to
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:05.840]  medical school so he could treat children for cystic fibrosis himself, he taught nutrition
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:10.120]  at the National College of naturopathic medicine in Oregon, made a primary care physician at
[2:12:10.120 --> 2:12:14.920]  the naturopathic degree, he also established his own company, American longevity now young
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:20.120]  Jebedy InfoWarsTeam.com is where we have the great products discounted, let me tell
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:25.200]  you it's been a revolution for Erin Dyke's losing 92 pounds, I'm even trying, I mean
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:28.040]  the stuff doesn't even say it's for weight loss, she's just not as hungry when you use
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:32.440]  it, things like beyond tangy, tangerine, pollen burst and I'm not going to go into
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:35.900]  whole pitch about that, I'm going to have him on tonight to break down a whole hour
[2:12:35.900 --> 2:12:41.280]  long interview for the nightly news and we also have the maker of Obama's real father
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:44.280]  coming on with some new developments on the nightly news tonight but we've only got it
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:50.760]  for this segment the next, Dr. Wallach I wanted to get you on to give us your take on this
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:57.360]  monstrosity of the IRS having our medical records and we have to file with them every
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:00.960]  year and if we don't, penalties and interest they're going to take money out of our account
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:05.520]  now so now the IRS is our doctor if we don't pay the money to the private fellow reserve
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:11.120]  I mean this is an incredible tax directly to these criminals, I know you've talked about
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:16.160]  this forever, you've beaten the FDA in court over and over again, you helped get the ruling
[2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:21.320]  protecting vitamins and minerals decades ago, I mean you're an icon of an unsung hero fighting
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:25.280]  these people, I don't mean to toot your horn for you but I mean people need to understand
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.320]  you know what you're talking about, what do you make of all this, I mean it was like
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:34.360]  a ton of bricks falling on me today when they upheld this.
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:41.560]  Well, Alex, so thank you first of all for the kind words and you're exactly correct,
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:49.640]  this actually started in 1914, there was actually money that was put up by the Rockefellers
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:57.280]  and the Carnegie's and there was a professor who was a retired professor who they hired
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:03.840]  and he ran around and he looked at all the medical schools back in 1914 and what he did
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:09.520]  was look at the different kinds of medical schools and there was as you pointed out there
[2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:13.720]  are herbalist medical schools and homeopathic medical schools, what they called straights
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:22.880]  that people who actually used the pharmaceuticals were made from petroleum and so the Rockefellers
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:28.160]  and Carnegie's were extremely interested in that and he came back to them and said look
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:34.160]  you have two separate types of schools out there and they got legislation to support
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:39.440]  through government only that people who went through medical school and used pharmaceuticals
[2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:44.120]  could be licensed and recognized as quote the real doctors unquote and the ones who
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:50.560]  were herbalists and homeopaths could not be considered real doctors and they were called
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:53.040]  quacks back in 1914.
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:57.320]  Because they weren't able to patent all of that as easily, now they're trying to patent
[2:14:57.320 --> 2:15:00.920]  fish oil and stuff so now they say it's good for us.
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:06.160]  Exactly, you got it because foods as they are you can't patent for instance we've known
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:09.960]  for a long time that niacin, vitamin B3 could lower cholesterol.
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:14.560]  Well you know doctors poo poo that for a hundred years and then suddenly now when they figured
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:22.720]  out how to make a time release and they could actually patent a time release form of vitamin
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:30.080]  B3 niacin they patented it and now you can pay $150 for a prescription through your insurance
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:35.880]  of a time release niacin and you can get it from a health food store for three bucks.
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:41.600]  And so the whole thing is designed to turn the American people into an ATM machine and
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:46.680]  if you look at this Alex and you pointed this out quite correctly there's nothing that
[2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:50.280]  this health care law does in any way shape or form there's nothing that it does for
[2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:54.320]  the patient there's nothing that makes the patients care better there's nothing that
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:16:02.920]  makes the doctor use only procedures that work all it does is find ways to tax everybody
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:08.000]  to pay the doctor and it was the biggest sham ever because they said when they were talking
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:12.440]  about it initially that it was not a tax and they passed it through the supreme court by
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:14.880]  convincing the supreme court that it was a tax.
[2:16:14.880 --> 2:16:19.560]  And now they say exactly and of course the doctor is just one level of the insurance
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:26.360]  companies the big banks are the ones that wrote this and it's a tax directly to them.
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:30.800]  Exactly it goes right to them because and I wonder why in the beginning they were having
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:40.560]  IRS agents installed into this to monitor the health care act why were they putting
[2:16:40.560 --> 2:16:44.240]  IRS agents because they're going to start garnishing wages no no they admit it they
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:48.640]  say penalties and interest and then now they say they're going to raise already it's gone
[2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:52.160]  up 25% just since they passed the law now that it's going to be implemented it's being
[2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:56.920]  reported they predict within a year and a half to two years 50% increases and and you
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:59.840]  just heard me read the headline here daily mail it's all over the nose.
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:05.440]  In fact guys go to CNBC and show them hospital stocks are going straight up.
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:10.040]  Well here's the way to beat the system I've been working on this for a year Alex how
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:13.960]  to beat this system because I figured that in some form it was going to come about and
[2:17:13.960 --> 2:17:17.720]  what people have to do is do two things number one they have to care for themselves and stop
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:23.080]  using the system just don't use doctors that's it don't use doctors and so what do you do
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:28.640]  about the insurance piece well what you do is you get a $5,000 to $10,000 deductible
[2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:33.240]  and you you just start squirreling away 50 bucks a month 100 bucks a month and you get
[2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:39.400]  a $5,000 $10,000 deductible for a family of five and it'll be 100 bucks a month but you
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:43.440]  have some responsibility here because you don't want to get sick and so what you do
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:50.000]  want to do is use our 90 for life program which can and has been proven in the livestock
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:54.160]  pet animal and laboratory animal industries but all you have to do is take the 90 cents
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:58.600]  of nutrients and you will prevent as many as 900 different diseases including all birth
[2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:03.960]  effects including all birth effects I'm being all inclusive here and well maybe this evening
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:08.960]  we can talk about what all birth effects means it's going to break the world apart when they
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:13.360]  realize some of the things they think of are choices give you a little tidbit there some
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:16.960]  of the things that people think of as being choices are really birth effects that are
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:22.160]  totally preventable and so we're looking at preventing every birth defect you can name
[2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:28.480]  just like Sarah Palin's little boy trig was born with down syndrome it's totally preventable
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:33.760]  that OBG-1 should be put in jail for actually what is the mineral deficiency because they're
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:38.400]  telling us it's all genetic that we're falling apart but it wasn't happening like this at
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:42.960]  this rate I mean even China their government admits most of its mineral deficiencies I
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:47.680]  know the Amish have helped down in Central and South America get the kids on minerals
[2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:51.320]  and and they've stopped having as many birth defects I mean I mean this is something known
[2:18:51.320 --> 2:18:55.960]  all over the world now just not here yes you're exactly right and of course we've eliminated
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:19:00.640]  every birth defect you can name and ten times that many you can't name or don't know enough
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:06.640]  to name just simply by giving preconception nutrition to female animals the moment they're
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:10.360]  born better yet before they're conceived and all through the pregnancy they're developed
[2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:13.760]  and then throughout their life and then when they go through puberty and they're old enough
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:18.760]  to have their own babies every baby will be perfect we have the capacity to eliminate every
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:23.680]  birth defect we shouldn't have one baby out of 750 born with down syndrome we shouldn't
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:29.000]  have one kid out of a hundred now in the United States with autism but of course doc from
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:32.960]  the research I've seen you're talking about people that that had the defect because of
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:39.240]  a mineral deficiency and there's things like the eggs being old in the studies in the ovaries
[2:19:39.240 --> 2:19:45.600]  that's been linked to chromosomal malfunctions in the zygote formation but but I'm just amazing

[2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:37.920]  well dr. Wallace giving a big speech tonight against all over the world hundreds of years
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:41.120]  dedicated to the work he's doing I want to get him on the nightly news tonight to spend
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:47.360]  a whole hour with us and he's graciously said he'll do it very busy guy to go over this
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:54.160]  history to talk about it and then to discuss how they the system knows this and so yes
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:25:00.480]  they want you sick and the proof is in the disease numbers they try to keep them secret
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:04.520]  but you know look them up depending on which metric doctor what is it with autism to go
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:16.560]  from 1 in 25,300 in 1970 what was it 1976 to 1 in 58 that's this year's numbers the
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:22.160]  media is using old ones of 1 in 80 something how many thousand percentage increases that
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:30.720]  to have the number I saw back in the 1940s was maybe one child out of a couple hundred
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:35.440]  thousand would get a particular type of bone cancer you know now it's much higher I mean
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:41.640]  we're talking about huge increases in everything what is causing that you're saying from your
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:46.440]  zoological research and this is anything I saw vets talk about was minerals like oh
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:50.120]  that those cows are calving better given these minerals are they're going to be stillborn
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:54.920]  or they're going to be deformed I mean how do vets know this but medical science doesn't
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:26:02.720]  am I correct in saying they know what they're doing at the top or or are they ignorant and
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:08.120]  point of a nutritional deficiencies and here's why the difference between animal medicine
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:13.120]  and human medicine is simply insurance if there were no insurance the medical system
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:18.160]  in the government and all of the bureaucrats could not game the system it's not a free
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:21.320]  market system because everybody's trying to get into your insurance everybody tells
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.080]  us what getting in your pants they don't get in your pants they want to get in your insurance
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:29.400]  and so in the animal industry there is no health insurance and so a farmer doesn't have
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:35.040]  any way to pay for long-term health care of a pig that has bone to bone arthritis he just
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:38.880]  can be bacon tomorrow so if he's going to make money on that pig he's got to bring
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:43.520]  that pig to market weight in a very economic way and we've done that by eliminating 900
[2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:47.480]  different diseases with vitamin their own supplements and I've actually tracked the
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:53.000]  top 20 longevity cultures on earth took 10 years of research and basically the top 20
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.400]  longevity cultures on earth are all illiterate they're all third world cultures and a single
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:01.800]  one of them is an industrialized nation they have no private insurance they have no government
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:06.240]  insurance they have no hospitals clinics doctors and yet they have 40 times a hundred as we
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:10.840]  do and live 20 years longer than we do in a healthful way and you wrote a book on that
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:13.560]  we're going to talk about that tonight in fact I'm going to write a note on that because
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:17.640]  I always mean to really get into depth on those cultures because I've in separate research
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:22.200]  run into a few of those give us a couple of those cultures a couple of people might know
[2:27:22.200 --> 2:27:26.680]  about would be the okinawans and I'm not talking about the ones who live in okinawa
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:30.960]  city and eat McDonald's and and Kentucky fried chicken I'm talking about the ones who live
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:34.560]  on up in the mountains and still think the second world war is going on and they're
[2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:39.560]  putting their wood ashes into the gardens and the wood ashes are not really wood ashes
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:44.000]  either the minerals are left when you burn the wood for fuel and by dumb luck they live
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.440]  in a place that has the 60 essential minerals in it a second place would be the Nikoi and
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:52.920]  Peninsula on the Pacific coast which are the longest of people in Costa Rica and Central
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:28:01.000]  America and these people live to be an average of 92 it's just an amazing thing they have
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:06.040]  100 year old out of 250 their population no doctors they're totally primitive but again
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:12.200]  by dumb luck they have all 60 essential minerals in their land and when they burn wood for fuel
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:15.800]  they put the wood ashes which are really the plant minerals into the gardens they eat their
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.680]  tomatoes and corn and sweet potatoes which then have the minerals in them and they have
[2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:26.800]  all the nutrients they need by contrast we force growth things with NPK nitrogen phosphorus
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:31.720]  potassium which is all the plant needs to make the maximum yields for the farmers and
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:36.720]  doctors say oh don't supplement you're going to kill yourself take our drugs well you can't

[2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:23.440]  grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:32:23.440 --> 2:32:28.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:33.320]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands

[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:21.360]  to Georgia he was looking for a solar steel he was in a bag because he was way behind and
[2:33:21.360 --> 2:33:25.200]  he was willing to make a deal when he came across this young man selling on a fiddle
[2:33:25.200 --> 2:33:31.040]  and playing it all right I completely spun out of control today I guess you didn't know
[2:33:31.040 --> 2:33:36.440]  it but I am a fiddle player too dealing with the IRS now over my so-called health care
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:43.040]  now you play penalties in interest the insurance companies I'm gonna do a report on the news
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:47.760]  tonight about it and then that way tomorrow I'll have it all stacked up in here where
[2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:53.080]  it's all over the news from the insurance companies that they went in and wrote the
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:58.820]  health care plan and now their stocks are all exploding that's CNBC Associated Press
[2:33:58.820 --> 2:34:05.960]  Daily Mail and I had that call or call earlier it makes me so angry and with with satisfaction
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:16.200]  say I was wrong I'm so sick of it I'm tired of it now I know I've had Tim and the watcher
[2:34:16.200 --> 2:34:20.800]  and everybody holding patiently I'm gonna get to all of you a guy that had wallet schedule
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:24.520]  longer but I want to go to your calls so he'll be on the news tonight we appreciate him joining
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:30.360]  us but speaking of that since I already had this right here this is not product placement
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:35.720]  but it is I was about to make myself a beyond Tangier tangerine during the break and then
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:39.120]  ran out of time you can notice we're out of spoons to even had some metal ones around
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:44.760]  there's a little bisphenol a fork here link to brain damage a new study that's out oh
[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:52.600]  there it is this phenol a exposure link to brain tumor diagnosis and it's a bunch of
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:57.600]  big scientific studies and breaks all down where they're from you can just look that
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:04.480]  up and that you're much more likely to have brain tumors well really why do you think
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:11.960]  why do you think it's exploding destroys your fertility it's an endocrine disruptor side
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:20.640]  issue I doubt this is bisphenol though it's just certain types of plastics the point that
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:25.660]  I'm trying to get out here is that I wouldn't be promoting beyond Tangier tangerine and
[2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:31.520]  polymers if I didn't believe in it in fact I I turned down every week people that want
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:37.080]  me to endorse products I mean I turned out a lot of them and other radio hosts don't
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:42.920]  do that but I know of I mean I later hear them endorsing stuff that I refuse to endorse
[2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:46.680]  like sometimes I end up hearing the ads running on my show and I didn't endorse it but whatever
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:53.400]  it's not my voice endorsing it that's fine this stuff is powerful my mother is a triathlete
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:59.440]  and she has been able to reverse in fact she's willing to do a testimonial she believes
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:03.440]  in it so much and she is very private in fact I'm going to get around to doing that I've
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:07.920]  been so busy I haven't Aaron died she's seen what's happened with him beyond Tangier tangerine
[2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:13.400]  polymers is incredible in fact I like to mix the two that's what I'm going to go to your
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:18.800]  calls I like doing a half a half scoop or one scoop you're supposed to do two scoops
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:25.040]  of the beyond Tangier tangerine but I like it so much I just drink more of it but just
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:32.480]  take half dosages and then they've got polymers that comes in single packs I'm talking to
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:37.200]  the makers of it I like it so much about coming out with a can of it well I'm not talking
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:40.600]  about it we're already doing it with my face and name on it I like it so much and I want
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:45.120]  it in a can I want it in a container I don't these little packets are good on the road
[2:36:45.120 --> 2:36:50.880]  but I don't know anyways the point is these little babies with all the different B vitamins
[2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:56.960]  and all the minerals and all of the antioxidants and all the little goodies that are in it
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:01.520]  it's all available at info wars team dot com and you can shine up there and get free shipping

[2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:35.520]  bad I call that the double trouble right there tangy tangerine beyond tangy tangerine with
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:43.400]  polymers double trouble of course that's not available in stores but sorry hmm I've got
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:49.760]  so much more energy now instead of just drinking coffee taking those polymers so info wars team

[2:38:00.600 --> 2:38:08.800]  dot com okay enough of that I have decided that I'm gonna even go to the next level
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:15.320]  because I don't want to get into this healthcare system I have had a hernia for 13 years and
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:22.040]  will not go get it fixed because I hate the MD healthcare system so much yeah you break
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:28.280]  your leg they can do a great job but there's so many mistakes so many flesh eating bacteria
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:36.920]  one of my children's friends fathers 40 something years old went in to get surgery done on a
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:41.640]  pinched nerve in his back and an infection killed him a week later I can tell you how
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:47.520]  many family members how many friends I've had that were as strong as a horse and went
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:56.360]  in to have toe surgery or or old football injury worked on dead dead dead every week
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:01.640]  I hear about somebody dying from an infection in the hospital so you know what I got this
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:06.960]  hernia and let me tell you over the years it's gotten bigger and I went into the doctor
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.800]  about three years ago medical doctor and I went and checked with another doctor as well
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:16.040]  and they said no that's a peritoneum you know the one where it's the bag that holds in your
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:23.040]  heart and your lungs and all that at my belly button it's not a intestinal or or or hernia
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:30.240]  of the gut and they said you need to lose 70 pounds well I lost 40 something and I need
[2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:38.040]  to lose our 20 or 30 before it gets too big but side issue that's how much I don't like
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:44.440]  the system and and and I've got because I love food so much I've just got to continue
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:49.280]  exercising and I'm going to lose the rest of it I kind of hit that threshold point and
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:53.160]  I've just got to remember to take my my longevity products and I'm going to do it but this is
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:58.160]  what we face I mean I went in to have I had my leg broken and had to have surgery because
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:04.880]  the bone was cocked out on the side didn't come out of the skin it was it wasn't technically
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:12.400]  a compound fracture but it was about to be and they almost killed me nine times they
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:18.080]  tested my blood came in had the head of the hospital there brought in the family doctor
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:23.640]  and going yeah you don't have any heroin in your system and there's no alcohol or drugs
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:26.920]  and they looked at me and they said we've never seen anything like it nine times the
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:32.360]  amount to keep you wonder do you remember waking up and assaulting people and I vaguely
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:37.680]  do yes they had to change they had to tie me down on the bed so I'm not going under
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:43.120]  the knife I mean I'm going to have special testing done or something and then they had
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:48.160]  the IV in me that night it came out it was blood all over me and then I got an infection
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:57.600]  this was a nice hospital in Raleigh Texas by Dallas so I don't know why I'm going off
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:11.080]  to that story it's just the nightmare the nightmare the nightmare of having to go under
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:15.120]  IRS banker controlled health care because that's what this is what they do everywhere
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:19.320]  this is the globalist running your healthcare completely and in your bank account and in
[2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:25.760]  your medical records it is hellish and again if you're a new listener like what does heroin
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:28.800]  have to do with waking up on the operating table they because normally you have to be
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:35.040]  a total drug addict you know who's got the liver you know that's been trained to not
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:42.080]  have opiates not knock you out I'm the opposite a few times well they tried to give me pills
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:46.560]  when I left for for pain and I would throw up when I took him the point is opiates and
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:52.560]  Alex Jones do not mix never liked him I remember one time I had a shoulder dislocated and I
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:42:00.800]  tried a some kind of opiate pill oh my gosh talk about side issue I don't want anything
[2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:08.200]  to do with the mainline medical system nothing nothing nothing just last week one of the
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:12.720]  children that my daughter plays with and his friends with for several years who I'd met
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:20.200]  her dad out of sporting events and stuff he did went to the hospital my friend my childhood

[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:06.440]  overcome darkness that's something I believe all heartedly but the other thing is every
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:11.920]  state has a every citizen has the same arrest powers as every other police officer and if
[2:45:11.920 --> 2:45:16.240]  a police officer is acting unlawfully or a TSA agent is acting unlawfully you should
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:20.960]  arrest them you should that's how you have to do you cannot ask criminals for your rights
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:26.360]  you have to take them and exercise them the same as the pro gun carry law as a police
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:30.160]  officer if you're acting unlawfully and you're trampling the rights and violating your oath
[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:36.120]  to the Constitution and your state your citizens have a right to rebel against that lawfully
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:43.480]  and call a supervisor put it on 9 11 or the 9 1 1 recording and call for another jurisdictional
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:48.480]  agency like you if you have to go against the city police officer get a share the point
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:53.400]  is a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves and they're doing their best to put criminals
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:57.920]  in everywhere or people that think we have no rights and folks have you noticed since
[2:45:57.920 --> 2:46:05.640]  we got rid of the Bill of Rights the Constitution it's getting dark real fast what do you think
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:10.120]  of this whole health care thing well it's just you know you just your last caller just
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:15.880]  said he was not going to get his children vaccinated I mean to me it has sealed like
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:22.200]  John F Kennedy said those who make a peaceful revolution possible make a violent one inevitable
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:26.200]  I mean if people come to try to take my child I'm not going to allow that and I have plenty
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:30.440]  of there are a lot of great police officers and I know that they're talking in the wings
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:36.000]  a lot of them have a lot of talk they're not going to say it on the top of the way because
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:41.960]  they could lose their jobs would be looked at strangely but it's not if you're acting
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:46.040]  on lawfully you shouldn't have the uniform that's all here's the deal people better get
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.760]  looked at strange and better get in trouble they can't stop us all saying no I mean my
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:57.400]  gosh listen the ATF last year tried to ban 63% of shotguns manufactured in the last decade
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:02.520]  saying of their bottom loading they could be all altered so they're illegal and people
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:07.400]  said okay come try to get them you're right it's a certain point I'm not looking for trouble
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:12.240]  but nobody's touching my children nobody's putting anything in them nobody's doing you
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:17.840]  know it's over I mean I exactly I don't like talking about it but I'm done I'm done with
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:22.160]  these crooks and that's why they're massing all this force against us doesn't matter they
[2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:29.080]  don't have moral authority it's it's weak all of it is garbage anything else sir yes
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:34.920]  sir the good police officers and the good military guys like Stuart Rhodes and others
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:39.920]  who know their oath and understand it I believe that the time has come for them to be a lot
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:44.920]  more vocal the more dangerous it gets the louder we should scream we should never sit
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:50.760]  down and only with God's help and having right on our side can we keep on a comment
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:54.840]  I hear you I hear you that's the founder of the Texas Ranger said that folks I've read
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:48:00.000]  the health care act I know all about it I wish it wasn't bad this is not hyperbole
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:06.200]  it's horrible it's horrible horrible horrible horrible and it and it's designed to get worse
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:11.000]  over time they know how to kill us man slow it's not going to get phased in for another
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:22.240]  year and then it and then it metastasizes and it takes over and you pay it to foreign banks
[2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:29.440]  the watcher in mass thanks for holding her on the air watcher hey Alex hey buddy I don't
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:41.800]  express my opinion sir I can barely I can barely hear you speak up okay I need to talk right
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:47.880]  of your telephone brother I want to be able to go ahead how about now go better yes okay
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:55.560]  I normally don't express my opinions I watch and I wait till it's time to act time to act
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:49:01.800]  the Constitution has been slaughtered and the Rewrite reminds me a song by Green Day
[2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:06.280]  the American idiot I don't see that there's anything that's going to wake up the major
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:13.880]  population at this point and you know I don't want violence to be the action but unfortunately
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:21.680]  there I believe they're going to force that at this point when the the justices just cow
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:28.920]  down to the tyrant president and his administration what other choice do we have but to follow
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:34.520]  our founders and do what they would have done well what we do is we go out first all of
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:39.000]  the I understand the physical angle I bought people think of that but we should we should
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:44.280]  go to all the city halls all the meetings all the little public meet and greets with
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:49.440]  these congress people and say listen you little rat you repeal this tax to the private
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:54.120]  Federal Reserve listen the fact that this money is paid to the Federal Reserve we've
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:50:00.200]  got it the average person when they learn this isn't just a tax but it's a tax to insurance
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:06.600]  companies I mean listen listen it they're gearing up against this they're probably going to
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:12.880]  start a fight but I think whoever shoots first loses our forebears didn't shoot first when
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:16.800]  the government comes to take the guns things like that or individually you got to do what
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:22.320]  you got to do to protect yourself but I mean here's an example who do you go after physically
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:28.320]  them you go after physically yeah that is the big question since everybody we're supposed
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:34.080]  to go to for protection and to stand up for our rights and enforce the Constitution are
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:40.320]  violating it now beyond that I have one other question I need your sure throw it out throw
[2:50:40.320 --> 2:50:48.160]  it out throw it out do you think Syrian girl is legit well yeah I mean I mean she's just
[2:50:48.160 --> 2:50:53.200]  a guest lives in another country doesn't live in Syria now and she's criticizing how they're
[2:50:53.200 --> 2:50:58.800]  using al-Qaeda I mean yeah I mean she's legit giving her perspective on it the news she covers
[2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:06.360]  is right out of the news so yeah folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip

[3:00:32.640 --> 3:00:38.960]  was a punch in the stomach this is like a hundred punches in the stomach and the way
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:44.840]  the media played it like oh they weren't gonna rule for Obama health care the takeover of
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:50.240]  health care and then of course they did rule for it very very frightening to know that
[3:00:50.240 --> 3:01:00.280]  even if Mitt Romney gets in that he supports it like Obama saying he'll legalize the illegal
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:05.880]  aliens and Mitt Romney comes out and says yeah I'll do that too but then give speeches
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:10.200]  saying he won't to conservatives it's just amazing because they're bought and paid for

[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:00.720]  people they were gonna start forcing them to do it that they would take the money you're
[3:02:00.720 --> 3:02:05.840]  saying in Minnesota they take money out of your bank account for health care yeah and

[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:32.680]  the department it's I get pieces of mail from the Treasury Department I knew they were already
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:38.360]  phasing it in so even before the Supreme Court ruled on this they were already sucking money
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:50.920]  out of your bank account on a $1500 bill they put a levy on my home my god that is so incredibly
[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:56.480]  predatory we're gonna have to look into this I mean I knew as soon as you talked about

[3:03:01.840 --> 3:03:07.040]  account the IRS that the Treasury Department does claiming that that's for your health

[3:03:24.640 --> 3:03:28.120]  have I'll tell you what's amazing about this they're not supposed to be able to take people's
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:33.840]  bank accounts for medical bills you're not supposed to even be able to call them I said
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:38.480]  I try to stay out of hospitals but one time I did cut my finger really bad and they called
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:42.320]  an ambulance it happened on a lake and I said okay I'll run the ambulance and it drove
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  like 40 miles an hour and everything and got there and I paid everything I had insurance
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:53.000]  and I paid and I kept getting this $500 bill for the ambulance it went and looked we'd
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:58.560]  paid it and they just didn't stop calling my goodness show so this is already happening
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:04.280]  Treasury went to look into this the Treasury takes money out of your account to pay for
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:13.320]  medical bills yeah I just got a phone call notifying me that it was happening how long
