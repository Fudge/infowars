[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]  We're a real Christian organization and they're recruiting at Bohemian Grove and much more
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.760]  for the Harper's Magazine Reporter.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.880]  And at this hour I am really happy to announce that we've got
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.760]  Kim Bryant on, the mother
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.860]  of a valiant family that are trying to defend their children from the re-education
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.560]  dumbing down centers that are the public schools. It was first reported by the Metro West Daily News.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.840]  WorldNet Daily has written an article about this.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.160]  We have it on InfoWars.com.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.880]  Coming up in about five minutes we're going to have our guest on who I know is already online.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.440]  But I wanted to read some of this article.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.160]  Homeschooling standoff in Waltham.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.800]  A legal battle over two homeschooled children exploded into a seven hour standoff yesterday
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.480]  when they refused to take a standardized test ordered by the Department of Social Services.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.440]  George Nicholas Bryant, 15,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.880]  and the daughter, Nysa Bryant, 13, stood behind their parents,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.640]  Kim and George Bryant, as police and child kidnapping services workers,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.960]  attempted to collect the children at 7.45 a.m.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.040]  The DSS demanded the two complete a test to determine their educational level.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.520]  After a court order was issued by the
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.920]  Framingham Juvenile Court around 1 p.m.,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.880]  the children were driven by their parents to the Waltham Hotel.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.000]  Again, they refused to take the test.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460]  The court order
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.940]  said the children must be here.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.060]  It said nothing about taking the test, said George Bryant, the father.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.660]  The second refusal came after an emotional filled morning for the family
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.300]  when DSS workers sternly demanded the Bryants comply with their orders.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.740]  We have legal custody of the children and we will do with them as we see fit.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.460]  DSS worker, Susan Estakovich, told the Bryants in their Gale Street home,
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.780]  quote, they are minors and they will do what we tell them to do.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.020]  We have legal custody of the children and we will do with them as we see fit.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.660]  Four police officers were also at the scene and attempted to coach the Bryants
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.460]  to listen to the DSS worker.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.260]  Whatever happened to the Fifth Amendment, folks?
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.100]  We are simply here to prevent a breach of the peace. Oh yeah, you're the one causing the breach of the peace,
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.560]  said
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.500]  uh... Waltham Youth Officer Detective James Allude.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.800]  We will not
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.420]  physically remove the children.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.660]  And then it goes on to the CPS saying they may take the children for good
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.060]  because the children refused to take the test. Now,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.780]  the question here in the mid...
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.660]  the precedent we're looking at here
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.620]  is that if they can make you
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.340]  follow their curriculum and have CPS in your home and have them take their
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.260]  stupid
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.780]  test to see how they've dumbed your kids down,
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.580]  to make sure they've carried out the Defense Department directive
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.420]  that the former head of Policy Department of Education on,
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420]  Charlotte Iserby.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.980]  They want to make sure they've dumbed your kids down.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.000]  And they're trying to outlaw homeschooling, harassing parents
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.940]  nationwide as the borders are wide open
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.900]  and as their kids are learning how to use drugs and have sex and
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.720]  worship Nike tennis shoes
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.100]  in these public schools and eat irradiated food. They feed them
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.760]  now in these systems. The kids are thumb scanning to get school lunches,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.580]  training them for the biometric system.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.820]  It's horrible.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.660]  And it's your children, not the states. And this is not freedom.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.980]  We'll come back and uh... go to uh... the mother,
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.040]  Mrs. Bryant, who has incredible courage.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.840]  The father said that they can try to bully a lot of parents. He said there
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.600]  have been threats all along.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.520]  And he says most families fall
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.160]  to that bullying by the state legal system. We're not going to do it.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.800]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.920]  And we'll talk to Mrs. Bryant.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.720]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com. Stay with me.
[00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:45.143]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:47.143]  a war on for your mind.
[00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:55.243]  All right, we had some callers earlier in the last hour with our other guests wanting
[00:03:55.243 --> 00:04:00.863]  to bring up CPS and how the government's breaking up families. Some of those folks got disconnected
[00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:05.262]  on accident. If you want to call in on this issue, we'll take your calls later in this
[00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:13.863]  hour. The toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231. There is a hallmark of dictatorship
[00:04:13.863 --> 00:04:19.903]  and police state, whether it was under the Egyptians who wanted to kill the firstborn
[00:04:19.903 --> 00:04:27.423]  of the Jews or whether it was in Franco's Spain who took people's children for political
[00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:32.623]  reasons or in Hitler's Germany. The same eugenics process of dumbing our kids down
[00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:37.503]  is taking place here. We have the official Department of Education documents. They're
[00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:43.342]  in Charlotte Iserby's phonebook-sized book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America. He's
[00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:47.263]  of course the former head of policy, number two position, Department of Education in the
[00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:51.823]  first Reagan administration. So we know they want to hurt our children. The useful idiot
[00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:55.623]  teachers who aren't generally bad, but are just ignorant and follow orders, don't see
[00:04:55.623 --> 00:05:00.023]  the larger plan. The more education funding, the dumber our kids get. The bigger the drug
[00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:04.342]  war gets, the more drugs on the streets, more people in prison. The bigger the war on terror
[00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:09.623]  gets, the more terror. They are creating the crises to offer the solution. Now from California
[00:05:09.623 --> 00:05:13.342]  to Illinois to Texas, they're now announcing you can't home school. You've got to have
[00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:17.263]  a teaching certificate. You've got to have CPS in your house five times a year. You've
[00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:21.943]  got to take our tests. You've got to follow our curriculum. They're saying your kids don't
[00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:27.303]  belong to you. And with the Bryant family up in Massachusetts going back six years ago,
[00:05:27.303 --> 00:05:32.582]  George Bryant was arrested six years ago after not attending a meeting that the city contends
[00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.823]  was a summons. Now they don't even send you a summons. They just call and say you've got
[00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:40.903]  to show up. We'll arrest you if you don't. It's not a legal document. It's not constitutional.
[00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:44.263]  The meeting was called by the Waltham School District for his failure to send his children
[00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:49.903]  to school when they're home schooling. And they now have basically grabbed the kids and
[00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:53.423]  have taken custody. They've gotten the kids back. But they say they control them even
[00:05:53.423 --> 00:05:59.462]  in the house. If they don't take the test, they're going to be taken out of the home.
[00:05:59.462 --> 00:06:03.623]  Joining me is Kim Bryant. And Kim, I'm sorry you've gone through this. And I want to commend
[00:06:03.623 --> 00:06:09.423]  you and your husband's courage and honor trying to shield your children from the clutches
[00:06:09.423 --> 00:06:16.423]  of these evil creatures. Thank you. It's been a long six and a half years. Simply trying
[00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:21.462]  to raise your children in this so-called free country. Tell us about yourself, your husband,
[00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:26.943]  why you decided to homeschool, what it's been like with these vicious hyenas attacking you.
[00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:33.943]  Well, let's see. We decided to keep our kids out of school mostly because we felt that
[00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:40.383]  we could provide them with a better education. When I was looking at preschools for my son,
[00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:45.823]  I was looking for a place where he would be able to express himself. I was looking for
[00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:52.623]  a kind of school where no one would tell him to sit down and be quiet. And then a friend
[00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:56.783]  of mine said to me, well, I know the school you're looking for is called homeschool. And
[00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:02.783]  she handed me a bunch of literature on home education. And my kids never went to school.
[00:07:02.783 --> 00:07:09.263]  I don't usually say that I homeschool because I kind of think that the word homeschool is
[00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.823]  sort of an oxymoron. It's my home. It's not a school.
[00:07:13.623 --> 00:07:17.623]  Yeah, because if you use the word school, they can legally now try to take you under regulations.
[00:07:17.623 --> 00:07:23.063]  Now, something they're very angry about, the Chicago Tribune's done it. LA Times has done it.
[00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:28.102]  They're very upset the last five International Spelling Bee champions were homeschoolers.
[00:07:28.102 --> 00:07:32.823]  They're now taking first, second, and third place generally. They're also winning all the geography
[00:07:32.823 --> 00:07:40.102]  bees. I've had cousins that were homeschooled, got full scholarships. Fortune 500 begs for them.
[00:07:40.342 --> 00:07:44.183]  They start making 60, 70, 80 grand a year right out of college, 100 grand a year.
[00:07:45.222 --> 00:07:51.783]  They hate it that they can't ruin your brains. So I want to make that clear. It's your children,
[00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:56.183]  and of course you do a better job. Go ahead. Well, I was just going to say that both of my children
[00:07:56.823 --> 00:08:03.383]  competed in Destination Imagination, which is a problem-solving creativity challenge,
[00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:07.943]  and both teams were made up entirely of children who don't attend school.
[00:08:08.503 --> 00:08:13.703]  And my son's team is a state champion in his challenge, and my daughter's team came in second.
[00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:17.943]  Well, let's not even call it school. Your children do not attend re-education camps.
[00:08:17.943 --> 00:08:21.143]  They definitely don't. And that's what it is, by the way.
[00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:27.943]  Yeah. So going over this, this started six years ago. What happened? What developed?
[00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:36.663]  We got a letter from the truant officer. He sent us a letter and said, well, certainly you could
[00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:41.543]  homeschool, but you have to follow certain procedures. You have to send us an education plan.
[00:08:42.183 --> 00:08:46.903]  And we sent him a letter back saying, oh, we do? Could you please give us a copy of the law that
[00:08:46.903 --> 00:08:53.223]  requires us to do that? He didn't provide that law. Instead, he went and filed criminal charges
[00:08:53.223 --> 00:08:57.463]  for failure to send children to school. Now that's false arrest imprisonment right
[00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:05.623]  there. So we went to court. We told them that we wanted a jury trial. And the penalty, I might add,
[00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:13.463]  for this statute is $20 fine. They changed it from a criminal complaint to a civil complaint and
[00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:21.143]  tried to tell us that we couldn't have a jury. And we kept asking for the copies of the law.
[00:09:22.023 --> 00:09:27.303]  And so they decided that they weren't going to get anywhere. The day the trial was supposed to start,
[00:09:27.862 --> 00:09:36.983]  they filed a notice for dismissal. And we asked them if we had been prejudiced,
[00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:41.783]  and it was dismissed with prejudice, so they couldn't bring it back. And they went and filed
[00:09:41.783 --> 00:09:49.463]  with the Department of Social Services allegations of educational neglect. And DSS came to the house
[00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:56.663]  and decided that they did not want to pursue it. So the city attorney filed a care and protection
[00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:01.143]  against us, which is very unusual. It's not usually done by the truant officer. It's usually
[00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:04.423]  done by Child Protective Services. Well, now they're doing it across the board
[00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:09.223]  because they're desperate. The exodus has gone from 100,000 kids 10 years ago to a million,
[00:10:09.223 --> 00:10:12.583]  two million, three million. Some estimates are now at four million. A lot of folks are
[00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:18.023]  secretive about this. They're panicking because a brain trust is leaving them.
[00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:23.063]  That's great. The more the better. I hope it just collapses under its own weight.
[00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:29.783]  Absolutely. Oh, it's criminal. Now, when they arrested your husband, what was the terror like
[00:10:29.783 --> 00:10:33.783]  to have these people there grabbing your husband? And what was it like for the children? I mean,
[00:10:33.783 --> 00:10:39.063]  this is the purest form of terrorism. Well, I have to tell you, I wasn't home
[00:10:39.063 --> 00:10:46.023]  at the time that it happened. And my husband was in the middle of a Cub Scout meeting with my son
[00:10:46.023 --> 00:10:54.503]  at the time. And I got a call basically when he was in jail telling me to come and bail him out.
[00:10:54.503 --> 00:11:00.183]  And I was just petrified because I didn't know where the kids were. They were at a friend's
[00:11:00.183 --> 00:11:05.383]  neighbor's house. And then I was petrified that, gee, if he got arrested, then I'd get arrested,
[00:11:05.383 --> 00:11:14.263]  too, because I couldn't see that they would charge just him. But like I said, we went to court and
[00:11:14.263 --> 00:11:20.742]  got the whole thing taken care of. Ma'am, you should have sued them because that was false
[00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:24.823]  imprisonment. That was a terrorist attack. I mean, imagine if criminals come to your house
[00:11:24.823 --> 00:11:30.583]  and grab your husband and take him away for no reason with no law, then that would be kidnapping.
[00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:34.423]  But when the government does it, it's just, oh, well, they're the boss. Well, I totally agree
[00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:39.703]  with you because I checked the summons that summoned us to court. And that summons was never
[00:11:39.703 --> 00:11:44.583]  served. The court record shows it was never served, which means they falsely issued a default
[00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:48.903]  warrant on my husband and myself. All the time when they arrest patriots and Christians,
[00:11:48.903 --> 00:11:52.983]  there's not even paperwork. And then you go to them and go, I was in jail for a month. Where's
[00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:59.223]  the paperwork? Shut up or we'll arrest you again. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was amazing on Thursday
[00:11:59.223 --> 00:12:04.663]  when we were here because my husband and we had three members of our counsel here who are
[00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:09.543]  non-attorneys. We were standing at the door and my husband said to the police officers,
[00:12:09.543 --> 00:12:13.303]  you don't have a warrant and you don't have a precept to take those children,
[00:12:13.303 --> 00:12:21.143]  you better stay out. And the police didn't come in the premises at all.
[00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:25.943]  Now imagine if you'd have been a blue collar family, uneducated, ignorant on your rights,
[00:12:26.743 --> 00:12:32.343]  and imagine this is what they do. And now you put your toddler in Head Start. Oh,
[00:12:32.343 --> 00:12:36.823]  it's the good thing to do. You get three CPS visits a year. And on average,
[00:12:36.823 --> 00:12:41.783]  about 31% of children are being taken from families that are in Head Start. It is a
[00:12:41.783 --> 00:12:46.823]  way to get them into the home. The feds pay upwards of 10 billion a year to fund all this
[00:12:46.823 --> 00:12:54.903]  breakup of the family. But they are taking 100 kids a month in Austin, Texas. And now they fed on
[00:12:54.903 --> 00:13:00.983]  all the blue collar people. Now they're moving on to the middle class. Well, they get federal
[00:13:00.983 --> 00:13:06.583]  funds. The CPS gets federal funds for children who are on public assistance. So now they're
[00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:10.983]  ready to help you because it makes it real easy for them to take your kids and get lots of money
[00:13:10.983 --> 00:13:16.423]  for it. And they put them on Redline and Prozac and hurt them and give them psychological
[00:13:16.983 --> 00:13:24.103]  disorders on a list. In Florida, they have tens of thousands of toddlers. When they cry for mommy,
[00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:27.463]  that's called mental illness and they're putting them on antipsychotics. Do you believe that?
[00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:32.103]  Wow. Yeah, little babies beating on doors crying. And when they cry,
[00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:37.463]  that's mental illness and they drug them. This is the sickest evil we can imagine.
[00:13:39.943 --> 00:13:49.623]  I know a woman who was charged with educational neglect. She was trying to get special ed services
[00:13:49.623 --> 00:13:56.743]  for her child in school. And then they didn't want to pay for it. So she ended up taking her
[00:13:56.743 --> 00:14:02.183]  kid out of school and then they filed educational neglect charges on her. And they ended up taking
[00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:06.823]  her kids away from her. And then they turned around and said, well, you have Munchaisen
[00:14:06.823 --> 00:14:11.943]  because you're trying to test your kids too much. And she was using the test results to get special
[00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:17.223]  ed services. Yeah, see, you get their services, they do this to you. But notice now, we're all
[00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:22.263]  mentally ill now when we claim our rights or try to do something. See, it's a Soviet model.
[00:14:23.223 --> 00:14:29.303]  Well, as someone said to me once, the DSM-IV that educates that manual that has all the
[00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:35.063]  psychological problems doesn't have a code for normal. Everybody has to be sick.
[00:14:35.703 --> 00:14:40.823]  Well, we talked about in the first hour of the show, Dr. Charles T. Schell. Army doctor,
[00:14:40.823 --> 00:14:45.143]  dentist, had a private practice as well, went to Waco, said the government was involved.
[00:14:45.143 --> 00:14:49.303]  They grabbed him six years later, solitary confinement, forcibly drugging him. Now he's
[00:14:49.303 --> 00:14:54.423]  gone off the drugs, he's on appeal. The sentence for what they charged him with will be two years,
[00:14:54.423 --> 00:14:58.663]  but he's been in solitary for five and a half to six. And they say, even if the Supreme Court says
[00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:02.983]  we can't force him to be drugging, we may go ahead and hold him for the rest of his life.
[00:15:02.983 --> 00:15:11.063]  Yeah. Well, with my kids, I kind of wonder what kind of results do the kids have to have before
[00:15:11.063 --> 00:15:16.823]  you decide they're not educationally neglected. Even if my kids had agreed to take that standardized
[00:15:16.823 --> 00:15:20.423]  test, which they wouldn't agree to do, what are you going to do with the results?
[00:15:22.023 --> 00:15:28.023]  And again, it's, well, in Massachusetts, it's a violation of Article 12 of our Declaration of
[00:15:28.023 --> 00:15:33.783]  Rights. And, you know, they're not being compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against yourself.
[00:15:33.783 --> 00:15:38.023]  Yeah, it's all color of law. Stay right there. All color of law. We'll be right back with our guests.
[00:15:38.023 --> 00:15:41.383]  Thanks for listening to
[00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:50.263]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time. I do this show
[00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:54.983]  and back from nine to midnight Central Standard Time as well. We're talking to Kim Bryant.
[00:15:54.983 --> 00:16:00.183]  I'm ranting and raving on this subject because it's just such a key indicator of tyranny.
[00:16:01.223 --> 00:16:04.823]  Doesn't matter who's in office, George Bush, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry,
[00:16:04.823 --> 00:16:10.583]  it just gets bigger and worse. And they're panicking now because people are fleeing
[00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:16.103]  their brainwashing machine of MTV and the public school and the rest of it.
[00:16:16.103 --> 00:16:20.503]  I want to come back in the next segment and take calls for our guests for similar horror stories
[00:16:20.503 --> 00:16:24.743]  or how you successfully fought them off in your area, the child grabbing services.
[00:16:24.743 --> 00:16:32.183]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231. I appreciate Kim Bryant taking
[00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:36.343]  time out to join us. What was it like in this latest event where they show up with the police
[00:16:37.543 --> 00:16:41.863]  say you've got to go take this skills assessment test when your kids are winning, you know,
[00:16:41.863 --> 00:16:47.143]  on the big championship teams and stuff with all the other homeschoolers as the other public school
[00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:53.623]  kids drool in the corner saying I love the new world order. Describe what happened and now how
[00:16:53.623 --> 00:16:58.983]  the government's behaved since this has gotten so much attention. I haven't heard from the
[00:16:58.983 --> 00:17:03.543]  Department of Social Services since it got all this public attention, although I have seen
[00:17:03.543 --> 00:17:09.143]  news reports that spoke people for the governor or for the commissioner of Department of Social
[00:17:09.143 --> 00:17:17.143]  Services. I saw an interesting quote the other day that they support the Waltham Public Schools
[00:17:17.143 --> 00:17:21.863]  in ensuring that the children receive an education. And I said wait, wait, wait,
[00:17:21.863 --> 00:17:27.383]  I thought Child Protective Services was here to support the family and now the truth comes out.
[00:17:27.383 --> 00:17:32.503]  You guys are really here just to support states. Well, to make sure all the kids are in there
[00:17:32.503 --> 00:17:36.903]  getting their vaccinations and thumb scanning to get their food, training into the biometrics,
[00:17:36.903 --> 00:17:42.103]  and getting searched by the police. And making sure they know that they're watched every second
[00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:48.183]  of the day and that they obey arbitrary authority. Whatever we tell you to do, you do it, like that
[00:17:48.183 --> 00:17:53.463]  CPS worker said. Yeah, she said that in the article. She said tell us about that quote where
[00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:57.943]  we're in control, you're under us, she'll do what we say. She said it for real. I couldn't believe
[00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:04.743]  it. She just said these are minors, they will do what we tell them to do. Here's her quote.
[00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:10.023]  We have legal custody of the children and we will do with them as we see fit. They are minors and
[00:18:10.023 --> 00:18:16.663]  they do what we tell them to do. Yep. And I couldn't believe that she said it. Well, now
[00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:19.623]  they're threatening to take your children permanently if they don't take this test.
[00:18:20.423 --> 00:18:28.183]  They have made that threat. This is our second care and protection. My children have actually
[00:18:28.183 --> 00:18:36.103]  been in quote the legal custody since December of 2001 and they are still at home. So how did that
[00:18:36.103 --> 00:18:43.143]  happen? I hold up that constitution every chance I get. She said all this stuff about the children
[00:18:43.143 --> 00:18:49.062]  will do what we do and I said to her, excuse me, do children have rights? Do they have rights under
[00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:53.143]  this constitution? Well, number one, I mean, it's all a fraud. They're just claiming all
[00:18:53.143 --> 00:18:58.183]  these new powers. Oh yeah. What about a fifth amendment? I mean, can they make your children
[00:18:58.183 --> 00:19:04.103]  work as slave laborers? Can they make them take these tests? No. How do you verify if they took
[00:19:04.103 --> 00:19:12.263]  it or not? You know, if the children answered five questions, did they take the test? Do they
[00:19:12.263 --> 00:19:18.263]  have to answer 30 questions? There's no objective standard and there's no law. I don't see how it
[00:19:18.263 --> 00:19:22.343]  could be in accordance with the constitution to require someone to take a test. How did they
[00:19:22.343 --> 00:19:30.423]  get custody of your children in 2000? Well, I have to tell you, we have counsel. The Massachusetts
[00:19:30.423 --> 00:19:36.343]  constitution provides for C-O-U-N-C-I-L and we maintain that that does not require one to have
[00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:43.783]  a license by the bar of Massachusetts. The judge removed our counsel every court hearing and my
[00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:48.263]  husband and I left with them and we we've appealed that up to the appellate court saying,
[00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:51.543]  you know, we have a right to counsel. So they wouldn't allow you to have your own counsel and
[00:19:51.543 --> 00:19:57.302]  said that was an action that was bad and so they took custody. Yeah. Well, we weren't at the trial
[00:19:57.302 --> 00:20:03.062]  so and it's kind of hard to defend yourself when you're not there but these judges in Massachusetts
[00:20:03.062 --> 00:20:07.302]  have absolute judicial immunity. They can make up whatever they want on the bench and there isn't
[00:20:07.302 --> 00:20:16.423]  much you can do. Well, it's incredible. So now where does it stand? Well, now I think the ball
[00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:23.062]  is probably still in DSS's court. We'll see whether they go back to court and when we were in
[00:20:23.062 --> 00:20:28.423]  court on Thursday, the DSS attorney said, your honor, you have to issue this precept ordering
[00:20:28.423 --> 00:20:33.062]  the children, ordering the Bryant's to bring the children to the testing or else give them back
[00:20:33.062 --> 00:20:38.663]  custody because there's nothing we can do. So I hope she goes back into court and says that.
[00:20:38.663 --> 00:20:45.943]  The children won't take the test. Give them custody. Let us out. Well, I mean, they're your
[00:20:45.943 --> 00:20:50.903]  children. They're winning awards. You're educating them. You're intelligent people. I mean, the state
[00:20:50.903 --> 00:20:56.263]  is saying here, hey, it doesn't matter if you go to our public schools. We're still over you. We're
[00:20:56.263 --> 00:21:00.103]  going to send CPS to your house. Your kids are going to take tests. We're going to approve their
[00:21:00.103 --> 00:21:06.583]  curriculum. End of the story. This is a public school saying we own your kids. Now they're trying
[00:21:06.583 --> 00:21:10.503]  to take over the private schools. Yep. And I just stand there and say, where's the law?
[00:21:11.463 --> 00:21:14.743]  And what do they say to that? Well, we'll get your answer when we get back. The hundreds of
[00:21:14.743 --> 00:21:19.223]  times over six years as they've arrested your husband, taken custody of your children,
[00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:23.783]  come to your house, demanded they go to this hotel to take tests, the police trying to intimidate
[00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:27.863]  them, all of this, and that you just say, what's the law? What's the law? What's the law? What's
[00:21:27.863 --> 00:21:36.743]  the law? What do they say? We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[00:21:36.743 --> 00:21:41.063]  radio network.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:22:03.480]  All right, folks. We're back live. All the key indicators of a dictatorship of an ultra-police
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.160]  state being set up here in America, grabbing citizens that expose government corruption,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.040]  doctors in the community, forced drug use, saying they may stay in prison for life,
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.080]  never with a trial for anything, grabbing people's children, saying the state owns your children,
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.360]  saying they have custody of the children. All of this being set up here in America and John

[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.480]  our guest and get an answer from Kim Bryant about when she says show me the law, there is no law.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.320]  They don't care. Same thing in California. Same thing in Illinois. We've had the different
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.720]  homeschool legal defense associations on. They say there is no law. It's all color of law.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.640]  And they get people to waive their rights generally is how they do it.

[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.760]  Going back to our guest, and we really appreciate her joining us. After all they've been through,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:30.960]  this six plus year battle, Kim Bryant and her husband George Bryant. Now they're saying,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.720]  okay, you take the test. We're going to come take the kids. Let's see them try it with all
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.080]  this attention. This happens every day around the country. Even the middle class, educated,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.920]  intelligent people. Imagine what it's like with a working class of blue collar folks that weren't
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.360]  ever taught their rights and were in these public schools. When you ask them for the law,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.040]  showing that your kids have got to have their curriculum approved by the government,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.720]  that they've got to be tested by the government. When you ask for the law, what do they say?
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.920]  They won't show it to us. What do they say? They say, well, you know what it is.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:08.960]  We're not your attorney. You go look it up. So now they violate the fifth amendment
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.120]  and not telling you what you're charged of. Exactly. And they don't list on the sheets
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.800]  what the charges are. Well, the charge will say something. Well, if you're charged criminally,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.040]  it says failure to send. That's the entire thing. And then you go to court and say,
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.760]  what have I done? And they just sit there and look at you and go, we're taking your kids.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.840]  Sounds like a free country. They say, you have to do what we say. Give us an education plan.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.200]  And this will all go away. Of course, you know, it's not going to all go away.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.160]  People have said to me, well, why don't the kids just take the test and prove that they're fine?
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.400]  And I say, well, you know, my daughter's 13 and a half. She's got another two and a half years
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.680]  before she's 16. That's two and a half years of that social work coming to my house every month.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.600]  And how many years of testing? What incentive is there? You've committed no crime. Your kids
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.640]  are winning awards. And you've got people who have an agenda to take kids. They get
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.800]  massive federal funding to do it. It's in their own statements. You've got them showing up with
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.600]  an ax to grind, no warrant, no nothing, running your life. How would you like that, parents?
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:19.600]  It's absolutely amazing. Do you ever say to them, don't you have any humanity?
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.520]  Don't you know what the Bill of Rights says? Oh, well, I have a very strong member of council
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:33.840]  who says to them, God will judge. Your time will come. You will be held accountable,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:40.640]  perhaps not by me. There's a higher power than me. Well, you reap what you sow, and that's how it
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.000]  works. Yep. Well, let me just say this, too. When you put your kid in public school, we looked at a
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.680]  school that has 1,100 students, a middle school here in Austin, did an investigation. It's actually
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:27:01.440]  in the paper. And they found that over 500 of the children, almost half or tenths of the children
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:08.800]  of 1,100 to 500, had already had criminal charges filed against them. Now in Austin,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.160]  if you're late to class, three times late, that constitutes an unexcused absence
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.360]  that your parents can't excuse. You are criminally charged, and so are your parents.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.280]  And we found out that most of the parents paid the $500. It was a $500 fine,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.640]  $500 plus, plus court fees for like another $60, so $560. This happened to Mike Hanson,
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.760]  my cameraman's daughter. His grandmother, Mike's grandmother, died two years ago. They went to the
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.560]  funeral. She was out two days. Married their grandmother, who they all loved, very close
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:48.720]  family. Came back with a note, and they criminally charged Crystal, his daughter. It was a straight-A
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.880]  student, by the way, honor roll. Criminally charged Mike. He had a son in home schooling.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.880]  Criminally charged Mike Hanson. And Mike called the senator who wrote the law four years ago,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:06.080]  and he said, wait, your law says 14 unexcused absences in a semester is criminal truancy.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.160]  How can they do it for one or two or three absences? And he got the senator on the record
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.480]  saying, no. The senator wrote a letter, called the school district, said, you must stop it.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.960]  They dropped the charges on Mike, and then Mike investigated and found out that almost half the
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:25.520]  school, half the school was under criminal charges. Then they do a third unification.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.440]  Okay, if you don't get in trouble for the next semester, we're going to let you get off of this
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:35.360]  for just $100, not the $560. Then when your kid is late again or does anything wrong,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:42.640]  criminal charges a juvenile where 17-year-old gang members with beards, literal grown-up gang
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.120]  members, do horrible things to your children. So do you see how this is about getting everybody
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:54.880]  into the system? I can see it. And this is Austin, Texas. This is Dallas, Texas. The Houston
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.840]  Chronicle six months ago had a big series of articles. It said, headline, don't fill out your
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.480]  homework. Mommy gets arrested. And they are arresting parents if the kids don't fill out
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.640]  all their homework. First charge. Does that sound like a free society to you?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.480]  It sounds like a fascist society to me. And it's hidden in plain view?
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.720]  Sure is. Well, I'm ranting and raving here. A lot of times they scurry away when you get
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.520]  news attention. Did you get news attention six years ago when this started?
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:35.760]  We got some. I think we were found in 97. They were in court when they changed it from criminal
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.800]  to civil. But what happens is they put you here in Massachusetts. The juvenile court proceedings
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.840]  are all closed, allegedly for the privacy of the children. But I tell you, it's so that those
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.360]  government people can do whatever they want to you. So you go to a court hearing and nobody knows
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.520]  what happens. And it's hard for the press to stay interested when they can't go to any of the
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:02.240]  hearings. And nobody will talk to them. Yeah, secret government. All right. Well,
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.840]  the government says they can't tell us what antipsychotics they want to give Dr. Sell,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.040]  who's exposing government corruption so he's in solitary confinement. They say for his,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.800]  they can't tell him or anybody for his privacy. Yeah. Well, at one point they told us that they
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:23.680]  couldn't. We were taping. Anytime the social worker came, we were taping her visit. And they
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.680]  would say, well, we can't allow her to be taped. We'd say, what law allows you to do this in secret?
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.840]  What says you can't be taped? And they would say, oh, well, we have to do this for the children's
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.040]  privacy. Yeah, they're in a hearing with the parents, at the house, no warrant, can't have
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.360]  a record. That's so they can do whatever they want and falsify. Did you say no to that?
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.560]  Exactly. We said, no. You know, give us, give us a copy of the law. They said, well, show us,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.640]  we have to do this to protect the children's rights because they're in our custody. We said,
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.520]  show us the law relative to children's rights. And we called the embossment's office. We called
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.480]  the commissioner's office. You know, we talked to the press and they backed down. So, you know.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.080]  Yeah. Police are now fighting to make it illegal to videotape any type of government building or
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.240]  proceeding. But then every time they get caught doing something wrong, the videotape gets edited.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.160]  Uh-huh. All right, let's take a call. John in Michigan,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.640]  you're on the air with Mrs. Bryant. Go ahead, John.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.360]  Hello, and God bless you. I homeschool my children here in Michigan. Michigan is one
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.320]  of the best states for homeschooling. If you're having trouble there, might want to move here.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.800]  Yeah, that's a question. Hold on, John. What about moving to another state?
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.640]  Well, I've looked into it and it isn't much better out there. Actually, I have seen Michigan stuff
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.400]  and I think that's because Kwanlora has fought the court stuff in Michigan. And I think they've
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.640]  done a pretty good job because you haven't had HSLDA out there, the homeschool legal defense.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.960]  And so I think Michigan's doing pretty well. We moved to Connecticut for a while to try and
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.520]  protect our kids. They have a good law, too. But we have family in Massachusetts.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.640]  I understand it's roots. One more thing, please.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:08.160]  Yes. Where I think they get their power is in the marriage license. When you put your name down on
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.840]  that marriage license, you put your maiden name down and that makes your child a bastard.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:18.480]  It does. But see, that's illegitimate. That's contract by fraud and the Constitution is still
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.080]  in operation according to the Ninth and Tenth Amendment. So we can try to legitimize what
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.440]  they're doing by saying, oh, well, the marriage certificate. And for those that doubt this,
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.680]  it just came out in mainstream news. The heel blood they take from your baby goes into a
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.640]  federal DNA database. All of this is done criminally through color of law.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.080]  I agree, Alex. But if she goes back and just changes that,
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.040]  it may give her a little more power. That's all. God bless you all.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.440]  Thank you.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.760]  Absolutely. Well, the problem is they set the parameter across the board.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.120]  Then the cops are so used to violating rights, they think it's all normal.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.840]  Yeah. I find the problem is, too, for us that you... I like a lot of this stuff I hear and read
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.720]  about, you know, about the marriage license and birth certificates and trying to wipe out all that
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.120]  paper trail and all of that. But it's really hard to argue for me in court unless you're
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.280]  well-grounded. And I see it takes a lot of research. And we don't have an attorney.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.120]  We haven't had an attorney for five years.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.320]  Oh, your attorney didn't do a very good job for you, huh?
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.720]  No. No, I don't think any of them do.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.160]  Any lawyer that practices in your area is going to have deals with everybody
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.120]  and can be disbarred if they do a good job. You've got to have a good family lawyer that
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.080]  is friends of the family that you have known for decades and then they know all the tricks
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.600]  and will actually defend you.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.400]  And they have to know the Constitution. I mean, this case is entirely about the
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.840]  Constitution. And if you're not willing to stand up to the Constitution,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.040]  forget it. You can't possibly understand. I mean, we've gone in and said,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.640]  is the Constitution law? And an attorney will say to me, yeah,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.600]  it's law as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Wait a minute. Can't you read it for yourself?
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.800]  Why would I need a government agent to tell me what my law says?
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.320]  You've also got older Supreme Court rulings that are constitutional.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.880]  You can get that precedent and show it. And that is good on the record for appeals.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:12.320]  But the problem is they're going totally criminal now. I mean, when almost half the school in Austin,
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.760]  the kids and the families are under criminal charges, half the kids,
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.920]  three times late. I mean, when I went to Anderson High,
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.880]  I went to a government training camp here in Austin. I went two years in Dallas, two years here.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.360]  And in the government training camp, the school was so big, I had to carry my books in a bag.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.840]  I couldn't get from one end of the school to the other in three minutes.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:42.720]  And then if you were late three times. And I was making 100s and 99s and 98s and 100s
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.680]  when I graduated. And I still one time had to go to Saturday suspension
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.120]  because I had been late three times in that semester to class.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.400]  I mean, if you walked in 10 seconds before, I mean, after the bell. And I remember teachers
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.560]  getting in trouble. If good students got there late, they would just ignore that you came in
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.640]  late. I remember teachers getting reprimanded. They would have the principals walking around
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.840]  looking for... And this is decades ago. They would have teachers walking around trying to catch
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.600]  teachers that weren't putting kids into the system. And you go to Saturday school,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.640]  it's all the drug heads. It's all the thugs, all the gang members. You're in there,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.280]  people throwing spit wads. You're sitting facing forward. If you do one thing wrong,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.240]  you get two more Saturdays. That didn't happen to me. It's getting your kids into the criminal
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:38.080]  system. Yeah. Well, it kind of amazes me that they pretend that these grades are assessments
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:43.680]  of your educational ability. And then your grade gets knocked down if you miss so many classes.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.720]  If I can do the work, then who cares if I missed it? The grades not reflecting
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:57.040]  my education per se, it's arbitrary. I mean, look, we had people like the president during
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:04.800]  the civil war who could speak four languages and could write longhand in Latin. And Abraham Lincoln,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:14.880]  who was trained by his mommy, my father could speak Latin and could write by the time he was
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:22.160]  six years old. His grandmother read to him. She lived in the house and he slept in the same room
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.240]  with his bed next to hers in the old hundred and something year old house. And she would read the
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:32.800]  classics to him. And this is what we used to have when people didn't want to send their kids to
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.200]  school, they just didn't send them. And your kid went for about six months a year and it was locally
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.760]  controlled. And now that's totally changed. Now the federal government's going to control
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.880]  your education or lack thereof. And you're five times more likely to be abused in government
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.960]  schools, government custody and CPS custody. Well, I have to tell you, we put in an education plan
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:00.480]  under all this threat and the education plan has a section on it that says upon approval,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.880]  the Waltham school department and the department of social services takes full responsibility for
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:13.520]  the children's education or lack thereof. And they wouldn't accept it. They want no responsibility,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.240]  no accountability. And at the same time, they go into court and say, oh, we're responsible for the
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.800]  children, your honor. We have to do this testing. And when they kill the kids in custody, when they
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.600]  do all these horrible things to them and yes, some CPS in Florida has been caught selling them out,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.000]  the pedophile rings. That's Miami Herald, by the way, the head of the organization that runs the
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.800]  database convicted pedophile. They said that doesn't matter. 187 of them are known pedophiles.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.280]  And when all this happened, they said it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what we do to the kids.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.880]  And they will not prosecute the social workers and others that abuse the children. And these
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.240]  predators are drawn towards this. I mean, if you're a psychopath and a degenerate scumbag,
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:00.480]  you become a CPS worker. Yeah. You've got a whole slew of victims right there.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.880]  And nobody can stop you. You can just feed on them all you want.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.960]  Nope. And everybody will just keep giving you more because there's money in it.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.880]  I mean, God bless the children. Well, I have the Calhoun and Reader used
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.160]  at UT by social service people going to school for that. And it says,
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:24.240]  it says the age of the family belongs to barbarism. The age of the state is upon us.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.280]  And they say in the major source reference book for a four-year bachelor's,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:36.640]  they say that their job is to liquidate the family and create a government system.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:44.320]  Yeah. There's a book, Dan Johnson wrote this book called The Public Family, where he looks
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:51.040]  at the writings of Dewey back in the early 1900s when all of this stuff was taken off and compulsory
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:57.600]  education was moving out across the country. And he looks at his writings from substituting
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:03.040]  the state as mother of children. That was their entire purpose of the public schools.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.720]  And they were also into eugenics and how to break the family up. This led to forced
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.960]  sterilization of kids that made under a B plus. Amazing.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.760]  I know it's just, and they say in their own source books that they all use,
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.000]  we're going to break your families up. That's our job. And then they have the nerve in the news
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.279]  to act like they care about the family. It's like you said, it's all out in the open
[00:39:27.279 --> 00:39:30.240]  behind closed doors. Yeah. It's just right out in the open,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.800]  but then the news, although they love you, oh, they care about you. Oh, all these little pieces
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.080]  of propaganda they put out there. We'll come back and take some more calls, finish up with our guests,
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.920]  wrap up this powerful broadcast. This has been an eight plus show today.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.760]  Thank you. The Genesis communications
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:54.560]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.880]  Of course, I'll be back tonight. Nine to midnight central standard time going out on the AM and FM
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:24.800]  dial simulcasting at info wars.com and prison planet.com and on global shortwave at 5.085 and
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:35.200]  6890 at night during the day, 12.172 and 9320. And talking to our guests, Kim Bryant, who's 15
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.440]  and 13 year old son and daughter are under attack by the government for six years straight. They're
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:46.000]  winning all these awards on these different competitions for academia. It doesn't seem to
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.680]  matter to the government and the government says, the CPS worker says, we have legal custody
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:57.040]  of the children and we will do with them as we see fit. They are minors and they do what
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.560]  we tell them to. You will take tests. You will follow our orders. How can people help you,
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.840]  Mrs. Bryant? How do people get involved? Well, I've encouraged people to send letters.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.240]  We don't really have a legal fund, but if they want to write to the commissioner,
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:19.920]  Commissioner Spence of the Department of Social Services at 24 Farnsworth Street
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:29.360]  in Boston, Massachusetts. I'm not sure what the zip is. 02108 is probably close enough.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.520]  And when we confront them, when we fight them, when we're in the states resisting them,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.760]  they will move on to other states. We mentioned Michigan being better because it was one of the
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.720]  worst states and people fought it. We've got to have people fighting this, standing up,
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.680]  supporting those in your area when this happens. Yeah, I wish there was more support
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.480]  because it would be real nice if we had a groundswell of people at the court.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.920]  Now you're in Waltham, right? Yep. And where is that near and mass? Waltham is about 10 miles
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:04.320]  outside of Boston. Okay. We were on the air in Boston. That station sold at switch formats,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.920]  but we have a lot of listeners that listen on the internet and shortwave there. If they want to get
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:13.200]  in touch with you, to meet with you, to help you to get involved or to show up at court,
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.360]  how do they do that? An email address or something? I think email is the best way to reach me. I'm at
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:30.160]  freetobe at rcn.com. Free to be is all one word. F-R-E-E-T-O-B-E at rcn.com. All right. I want to
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.800]  really thank you for coming on the show. And I want to thank you for standing up for your family
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.160]  so that two more of the children of America will not be wrecked, mindless, brainwashed, heathen
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:46.800]  as the re-education factories are turning out. And to God's speed, we'll track your case.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.120]  You've got my number if you need us to come on the air and give out phone numbers or anything
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:57.600]  in the future. God bless you. Great. Thank you. Absolutely. Before I wrap up this show,
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.360]  I have made nine documentary films.
