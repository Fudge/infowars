[00:00.000 --> 00:18.800]  It's official, the United States is being broken into pieces.
[00:18.800 --> 00:23.600]  The Pentagon has openly declared war on the American people and all Trump supporters,
[00:23.600 --> 00:27.400]  labeling us Nazis, so they, the Captain America, smash us.
[00:27.400 --> 00:34.700]  There are now hundreds of current former CIA desk jockeys, analysts, posing for mainstream TV,
[00:34.700 --> 00:40.100]  showing their CIA badges and holding their finger up their earpieces with sunglasses on,
[00:40.100 --> 00:44.200]  saying they're coming to kill us.
[00:44.200 --> 00:45.800]  This is unbelievable.
[00:45.800 --> 00:48.300]  It doesn't scare me, it scares me for this country.
[00:48.300 --> 00:52.900]  What a bunch of poser, punk losers.
[00:52.900 --> 00:58.000]  And of course, who do they hate? The men that are left in the military that are patriots,
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  soon to be replaced by robots.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.800]  That's why they got the army wearing red high heels.
[01:02.800 --> 01:04.600]  That's why they put the transgender in.
[01:04.600 --> 01:08.200]  It's why they do everything they can to wreck the military
[01:08.200 --> 01:11.600]  because they want to dominate everything that was America,
[01:11.600 --> 01:13.700]  even though it's the source of their power.
[01:13.700 --> 01:15.100]  And they've captured America.
[01:15.100 --> 01:17.100]  They run America.
[01:17.100 --> 01:18.300]  They didn't steal the election.
[01:18.300 --> 01:23.200]  They took it by force.
[01:23.200 --> 01:29.900]  This morning, I was reading over info wars.com and I saw a link in a story to a Gateway Pundit article
[01:29.900 --> 01:34.600]  that I went to the actual Time Magazine article itself.
[01:34.600 --> 01:36.600]  And it was incredibly staggering.
[01:36.600 --> 01:41.500]  And just as we're going live here, we're about to post the live feed show feed.
[01:41.500 --> 01:47.500]  And I'd like to show that on screen so we can read you one quote out of this.
[01:47.500 --> 01:56.700]  But in this article, the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election,
[01:56.700 --> 02:06.300]  they say in there that it was a conspiracy of big money and big corporations in both parties
[02:06.300 --> 02:20.500]  to quote, remove Trump and install Biden.
[02:20.500 --> 02:22.600]  Think about that.
[02:22.600 --> 02:25.700]  That's what super villains do.
[02:25.700 --> 02:31.500]  They like to rub things in.
[02:31.500 --> 02:35.100]  And so if you go to the live show page that we post every day,
[02:35.100 --> 02:38.700]  usually it's just a few comments, a few links and a live feed, audio and video.
[02:38.700 --> 02:42.400]  But today, we've added an article and some links to it.
[02:42.400 --> 02:43.500]  You can go read this for yourself.
[02:43.500 --> 02:48.700]  But this is called rubbing it in.
[02:48.700 --> 02:50.700]  And that's what they do.
[02:50.700 --> 02:53.300]  They admit they steal it and they say, oh, but it was fair and square.
[02:53.300 --> 02:55.300]  But this is how we did it.
[02:55.300 --> 03:02.900]  An alliance between left-wing activists and business titans.
[03:02.900 --> 03:08.800]  And they go on to say, made sure that Trump was removed and Biden installed.
[03:08.800 --> 03:12.900]  That's a quote, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12.900 --> 03:17.300]  And it gets even more interesting.
[03:17.300 --> 03:20.600]  Another big article from gatewaypundit.com.
[03:20.600 --> 03:24.700]  Exclusive, the TCF center election fraud in Michigan.
[03:24.700 --> 03:26.700]  Really discovered video shows late night deliveries.
[03:26.700 --> 03:34.700]  That was officially closed with cardboard over the windows of tens of thousands of illegal ballots, eight hours after deadline.
[03:34.700 --> 03:41.000]  In the still of the night, you hear the wolf howl, honey sniffing around your dough.
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.200]  The still of the night, you hear the wolf howling, honey, telling me I got to have more, more votes.
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.800]  And this is all the total proof that all the Pentagon's watching you.
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.900]  The FBI is watching you, America.
[03:54.900 --> 03:59.400]  You, you don't talk about election fraud while you're a local talk show host.
[03:59.400 --> 04:00.400]  That's not allowed.
[04:00.400 --> 04:08.100]  Who said Biden said we're inside the dystopian now.
[04:08.100 --> 04:13.700]  The globalists are simply moving to mop up what's left of America and they're set to pass legislation.
[04:13.700 --> 04:18.400]  To register all guns and put you under the ATF of the Justice Department, no judge, no jury,
[04:18.400 --> 04:21.600]  where they can just take anybody's guns they want.
[04:21.600 --> 04:22.800]  And it's all official.
[04:22.800 --> 04:26.400]  They're now about to have a rule change the ATF.
[04:26.400 --> 04:32.400]  Again, that's the tutorial saying that basically any gun part is a firearm.
[04:32.400 --> 04:37.300]  They're moving towards that existential battle they want to have with us.
[04:37.300 --> 04:38.900]  Licking their chops.
[04:38.900 --> 04:41.600]  They tend to make it racial, even though it's not.
[04:41.600 --> 04:44.800]  It's a globalist foreign chai con takeover.
[04:44.800 --> 04:46.500]  Very, very sad.
[04:46.500 --> 04:50.200]  And the Pentagon is completely captured by traders at the top.
[04:50.200 --> 04:52.900]  Yes, the storm is here. It wasn't the storm you thought it would be though.
[04:52.900 --> 04:58.900]  Is it? No, it's the new World Order storm and it's here.
[04:58.900 --> 05:01.800]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[05:01.800 --> 05:06.700]  Hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[05:06.700 --> 05:10.100]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[05:10.100 --> 05:13.100]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[05:13.100 --> 05:14.700]  I didn't invent all this.
[05:14.700 --> 05:19.400]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity.
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.300]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[05:21.300 --> 05:25.100]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[05:25.100 --> 05:28.500]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[05:28.500 --> 05:33.100]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[05:33.100 --> 05:36.600]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.000]  by buying the great products at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles,
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.900]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation
[05:42.900 --> 05:46.700]  and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[05:46.700 --> 05:51.400]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.500]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[05:54.500 --> 06:17.200]  You are the Infowar, and I salute you.
[06:25.300 --> 06:35.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this February 5th, 2021 transmission.
[06:35.800 --> 06:45.700]  And we are now 15 days into the reign of the Skeleton King, Joe Biden.
[06:45.700 --> 06:54.300]  Installed big article out of Time Magazine, a big celebratory how they did it.
[06:54.300 --> 07:02.400]  Like when Hillary came to Libya, she said, I came, I saw, he died.
[07:02.400 --> 07:08.200]  Rubbing it in, Time Magazine reveals how elites stole election from Trump.
[07:08.200 --> 07:13.800]  Time Magazine admits there was, quote, a conspiracy to remove Trump and install Biden.
[07:13.800 --> 07:18.800]  Criminals love to brag, but it's always, they're undoing.
[07:18.800 --> 07:23.800]  Join us today, which you're now doing, and spread the word.
[07:23.800 --> 07:27.800]  Simply amazing, and they bragged it.
[07:27.800 --> 07:33.300]  Oh, outside of law, they got states through governors to change the rules
[07:33.300 --> 07:35.200]  so they could have all the dead people vote.
[07:35.200 --> 07:41.600]  It's a big celebration of how they worked as good criminals together.
[07:41.600 --> 07:42.500]  And how proud they are.
[07:42.500 --> 07:43.600]  Here's the article.
[07:43.600 --> 07:50.900]  Secret history of the shadow campaign that saved 2020 election, the installation.
[07:50.900 --> 07:55.400]  We've got new footage of the van showing up, eight hours of the deadline at 3 a.m., 4 a.m.
[07:55.400 --> 08:01.500]  Everybody else was locked out, and the police were there with their guns ready
[08:01.500 --> 08:08.500]  to make sure those special ballots got in there and Joe Joe won.
[08:08.500 --> 08:13.000]  So that's just one of the stacks we're going to be going over today.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  Let me just tell you about the others before I drill back into this in more detail.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.200]  Here's another big one, nationalfile.com.
[08:20.200 --> 08:26.400]  Medical examiners reportedly say Capitol top did not die from extinguisher attack
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.100]  but a heart attack two days earlier.
[08:30.100 --> 08:33.400]  And CNN's been forced now to change the fine print and actually admit that.
[08:33.400 --> 08:37.600]  So the greatest terror attack, bigger than Pearl Harbor, bigger than 9-11.
[08:37.600 --> 08:41.300]  That's what Chuck E. Schumer said, just the ultimate in evil.
[08:41.300 --> 08:44.800]  200 people go in, maybe 15 get in fights.
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.500]  The others are inside the velvet ropes.
[08:46.500 --> 08:52.700]  This was like Godzilla firing his heat ray in Tokyo.
[08:52.700 --> 08:55.500]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[08:55.500 --> 09:00.400]  And the left that hates police, normally they celebrate when cops get killed.
[09:00.400 --> 09:03.800]  We didn't even see it until Blitzer said, well, you know, the cops need to be more responsive
[09:03.800 --> 09:05.200]  and people stop shooting them en masse.
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.600]  Remember that like five years ago?
[09:06.600 --> 09:07.900]  The Black Lives Matter?
[09:07.900 --> 09:10.800]  Well, oh, they're so worried about this officer now.
[09:10.800 --> 09:13.600]  Oh my goodness, we need 30,000 troops permanently.
[09:13.600 --> 09:18.700]  We need the CIA to take out the insurgency to kill us.
[09:18.700 --> 09:26.200]  Hell, I got a clip coming up next segment where they actually say use drones on us
[09:26.200 --> 09:28.100]  if we don't wear masks.
[09:28.100 --> 09:29.500]  You're like, oh, that's a joke.
[09:29.500 --> 09:32.100]  No, no, the left is spoiling for a fight.
[09:32.100 --> 09:35.400]  So they wanted our guns the whole time.
[09:35.400 --> 09:39.700]  Exclusive FBI visited home of Trump's supporter who was working in D.C.
[09:39.700 --> 09:41.700]  But did not even attend the rally.
[09:41.700 --> 09:46.500]  Wow, they're letting everybody know we're watching you every move you make, every breath you take.
[09:46.500 --> 09:48.000]  And here's another big article.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.900]  XCI officers and current ones compare capital protesters to al-Qaeda call for counterinsurgency
[09:53.900 --> 09:56.900]  taxes, including killing them like this old lady.
[09:56.900 --> 10:02.500]  Kill, kill, kill, get up and kill, Marine.
[10:02.500 --> 10:04.300]  But these guys never kill anybody.
[10:04.300 --> 10:06.100]  It's why they're lusting after this war.
[10:06.100 --> 10:08.300]  It's all analyst.
[10:08.300 --> 10:11.800]  But they do order the killings.
[10:11.800 --> 10:16.300]  And I, I guess when the Green Berets aren't wearing our red high heels or learning how
[10:16.300 --> 10:20.500]  to be transgender, I guess they'll probably follow those orders and come kill the American
[10:20.500 --> 10:21.500]  people.
[10:21.500 --> 10:22.500]  It'll be easy.
[10:22.500 --> 10:26.700]  The first few they kill, but let's get a lot harder after that won't go too well.
[10:26.700 --> 10:33.400]  But I have a feeling all those military people actually aren't going to take part in this.
[10:33.400 --> 10:35.100]  Will they take part in killing grandma?
[10:35.100 --> 10:38.400]  Will they feel like big men?
[10:38.400 --> 10:40.660]  They stand over her body full of holes.
[10:40.660 --> 10:42.340]  Maybe she'll have to be tortured.
[10:42.340 --> 10:47.380]  Maybe, maybe, maybe we could put her in like a little barrier, bury her alive for a few
[10:47.380 --> 10:50.820]  hours until she tells us where the weapons are.
[10:50.820 --> 10:55.860]  We'll beat those dirty Americans, just like those Vietnamese, just like those Afghans
[10:55.860 --> 10:57.180]  will beat them.
[10:57.180 --> 10:58.180]  We'll beat them.
[10:58.180 --> 11:03.740]  Don't worry with our red high heels on and it's all part of degrading the military
[11:03.740 --> 11:05.180]  for the post-human system.
[11:05.180 --> 11:07.700]  Oh, all these big articles.
[11:07.700 --> 11:09.660]  There's so many articles I can't even track up this morning.
[11:09.660 --> 11:10.660]  I shouldn't have done it.
[11:10.660 --> 11:15.500]  I spent like 45 minutes reading articles for Roger Steaden and I are the masterminds of
[11:15.500 --> 11:16.500]  the capital debacle.
[11:16.500 --> 11:21.260]  Of course, the left are so stupid that they don't even understand.
[11:21.260 --> 11:29.500]  Why would we have the motive to make ourselves look like fools, you boobies?
[11:29.500 --> 11:31.500]  Unbelievable.
[11:31.500 --> 11:39.620]  Meanwhile, Senate, Tim's pushed through 1.9 trillion stimulus blueprint as Harris cast
[11:39.620 --> 11:43.460]  her first tiebreaker.
[11:43.460 --> 11:48.780]  Trump says he won't testify to impeachment trial, deny Democrats' request, he answered
[11:48.780 --> 11:54.340]  questions and I've got his letter here when he resigned out of Fag, well that's what they
[11:54.340 --> 12:00.100]  call it in Team America, out of SAG.
[12:00.100 --> 12:05.220]  You got to love this letter, so I'm going to get to that coming up.
[12:05.220 --> 12:09.580]  And continuing, the left is calling the capital riot an insurrection and a coup for a good
[12:09.580 --> 12:15.180]  reason, town hall rights, because that's what they are, is an insurrection and a coup against
[12:15.180 --> 12:20.100]  the country's very existence, mostly peaceful violence and dueling, double standards.
[12:20.100 --> 12:21.580]  We're going to look at that.
[12:21.580 --> 12:27.100]  Laura Ingraham says Biden Defense Chiefs starting ideological and un-American purge of the U.S.
[12:27.100 --> 12:28.100]  military.
[12:28.100 --> 12:32.540]  When they say white supremacists, they mean white people.
[12:32.540 --> 12:38.380]  When they say white supremacists, they mean Christians.
[12:38.380 --> 12:44.380]  When they say white supremacists, they mean pro-America and the military is simply aware
[12:44.380 --> 12:50.140]  of this at the lower ranks and unifies, this could be a teaching moment, and if they don't
[12:50.140 --> 12:53.740]  take the bait, same group that wants you to wear red high heels and tells you America
[12:53.740 --> 13:00.420]  sucks is openly in the payroll of a consortium of multinational corporations, the process
[13:00.420 --> 13:04.820]  of bringing this country down, just like they're doing every other country.
[13:04.820 --> 13:10.420]  And later we'll look at India going under Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030, they've been stubbornly
[13:10.420 --> 13:15.060]  fighting being insolidated and bankrupted as small farmers and business owners, and
[13:15.060 --> 13:21.580]  they're the model of victory just like the town grocery store in Naples, Florida, where
[13:21.580 --> 13:25.340]  there's no law, you've got to wear a mask, and there's regulations that if you say you
[13:25.340 --> 13:29.980]  have anxiety or medical condition, you don't have to wear it, but all these corporations
[13:29.980 --> 13:33.540]  want to enforce it, well now they're all mad that this one store isn't doing it, just
[13:33.540 --> 13:38.500]  like the Trump rallies weren't, it is a beautiful site, that is all coming up in great detail
[13:38.500 --> 13:43.140]  and all the different hyperventilating by Shep Smith, and the rest of it, it's going
[13:43.140 --> 13:47.620]  to be one hell of a transmission today.
[13:47.620 --> 13:52.940]  We're going to go to break here in a moment, and we're going to come back and plow into
[13:52.940 --> 13:59.180]  this first big story, the incredible deception of these people, and when I see an article
[13:59.180 --> 14:08.500]  about AOC Smollett, I think, oh, but didn't Hillary do that, didn't Brian Williams do
[14:08.500 --> 14:12.900]  that, and now Joe Biden's done it, saying he was shot at and shot down in helicopters
[14:12.900 --> 14:16.620]  and everything, so we'll play some clips of these famous liars, just remember what
[14:16.620 --> 14:21.740]  scum they are as they work for the Communist Chinese to shut down our industry.
[14:21.740 --> 14:25.620]  Separately though, ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget that we are listed supported
[14:25.620 --> 14:28.860]  and I'm very, very thankful for your support, and we have great products in this critical
[14:28.860 --> 14:31.540]  time for you and your family to enrich your life.
[14:31.540 --> 14:35.740]  My dad developed, he's a retired dentist, very high quality, activated charcoal concentrated
[14:35.740 --> 14:42.340]  toothpaste at infowarstore.com, you can also get it at Dr. Jones naturals.com and find
[14:42.340 --> 14:46.100]  a lot of other great products, including some, I misspoke yesterday, that we don't have
[14:46.100 --> 14:50.700]  at infowarstore.com, there's three or four products that we don't have, but actually
[14:50.700 --> 14:56.500]  for sale at drjonesnaturals.com, and he is a sponsor of his broadcast to keep us on
[14:56.500 --> 15:01.900]  air as we try to diversify, so drjonesnaturals.com, drjonesnaturals.com, or infowarstore.com,
[15:01.900 --> 15:06.420]  for the activated charcoal toothpaste, it really is high quality, it really is concentrated,
[15:06.420 --> 15:12.460]  it doesn't have the additives of the fillers of the aspartame or the fluoride, it's just
[15:12.460 --> 15:13.940]  really good.
[15:13.940 --> 15:22.020]  infowarstore.com, it is proprietary, and separately, RocketRest, hey, if you love knockout at infowarstore.com,
[15:22.020 --> 15:23.780]  RocketRest is even stronger.
[15:23.780 --> 15:31.820]  Some people like 50 proof whiskey, some people like 100 proof, and that's basically the allegories
[15:31.820 --> 15:37.820]  there, this is Mike Tyson versus Floyd Mayweather, they're both two different deals, I like them
[15:37.820 --> 15:42.180]  both, but RocketRest is really strong, blast off to sleep, blast off in the morning when
[15:42.180 --> 15:47.860]  you wake up, RocketRest, rock it off, into the wild blue yonder of infinity while you

[17:56.020 --> 18:25.660]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host, let me tell you how tyranny works, it can keep
[18:25.660 --> 18:32.580]  creeping along for a while, then just like water suddenly boils at a certain temp, boom,
[18:32.580 --> 18:38.640]  you're in boiling water, then it starts boiling over, and if you look at the world, it's going
[18:38.640 --> 18:44.740]  over the edge into a forced artificial global collapse out of which they're planning to
[18:44.740 --> 18:53.780]  build their new world order, so first what I want to hit here is the total lies of the
[18:53.780 --> 19:00.460]  democrats and the globalists and how they've set the standard now to be rewarded for lying,
[19:00.460 --> 19:09.820]  AOC can't stop lying, now claims Trump supporters planted bombs in DC even though no one knows
[19:09.820 --> 19:13.620]  who did plant the two, what looked like fake pipe bombs, but here's what's interesting,
[19:13.620 --> 19:16.860]  she knew she was in another building, she knew she wasn't there, she knew there weren't
[19:16.860 --> 19:20.340]  children's facilities she went to on the Texas border, she knew they weren't drinking out
[19:20.340 --> 19:28.020]  of toilets, brand new stainless steel sinks, she's an actress, she's a front person like
[19:28.020 --> 19:34.940]  Greta Thunberg, maybe a little smarter, Greta's autistic, but when you look at that, this
[19:34.940 --> 19:42.180]  is par for the course with Hillary, Brian Williams, Jesse Smollett, Biden now, so let's
[19:42.180 --> 19:49.900]  play this clip of AOC and then we'll show you the latest clip yesterday, Biden saying
[19:49.900 --> 19:55.060]  he's been in combat, I know I was there with him, we both got Congressional Medal of Honor,
[19:55.060 --> 19:56.060]  here it is.
[19:56.060 --> 20:04.900]  I jump into my bathroom and I close the door and I just keep hearing bang, bang, bang.
[20:04.900 --> 20:11.860]  I opened the door when all of a sudden I hear that whoever was trying to get inside got
[20:11.860 --> 20:23.100]  into my office and I just hear, where is she? Where is she? And this was the moment where
[20:23.100 --> 20:29.300]  I thought everything was over.
[20:29.300 --> 20:36.060]  That's Ted Cruz coming through the door.
[20:36.060 --> 20:38.020]  I mean I thought I was going to die.
[20:38.020 --> 20:42.980]  That was a Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, her dramatic recounting of
[20:42.980 --> 20:47.180]  her experience in her office during the U.S. Capitol riots last month, but critics and
[20:47.180 --> 20:51.300]  lawmakers are accusing her now of exaggerating that story, pointing out that she was not
[20:51.300 --> 20:55.140]  even in the Capitol building at the time, but in the Canon office building across from
[20:55.140 --> 20:56.140]  the Capitol.
[20:56.140 --> 21:00.780]  But they would never steal an election, ladies and gentlemen, even though they'd all brag
[21:00.780 --> 21:05.140]  about it in Time Magazine in a huge, giant report. Okay, we'll be going over, coming
[21:05.140 --> 21:09.980]  up later in the hour. Let's now move along to Joe Biden. You didn't know he was a combat
[21:09.980 --> 21:14.660]  vet? Never in the military. Yeah, he was shot at, too. You know, they admit the story
[21:14.660 --> 21:19.700]  isn't true. He had to admit it years ago. It doesn't matter, because here's the difference.
[21:19.700 --> 21:24.820]  When AOC got exposed the last two days, Paul Watson, the whole report on it, it's on infohorses.com,
[21:24.820 --> 21:30.020]  but it came out she was lying about being attacked or even being in fear. She then went
[21:30.020 --> 21:34.460]  and said, report everyone on Twitter saying this and Twitter banned thousands of people
[21:34.460 --> 21:39.060]  saying you cannot criticize her. And Snopes said it was true that she was under attack
[21:39.060 --> 21:47.660]  and that we were liars. That's right. It's all about rubbing your face in it. So I guess
[21:47.660 --> 21:52.900]  I'll give you the point. You talk about Smollett being a liar or Smollier as a lot of folks
[21:52.900 --> 21:59.420]  call him. Here is Joe Biden, the war hero, not only have great intellectual capacity,
[21:59.420 --> 22:03.900]  you have great personal courage. I've been with some of you when we've been shot at.
[22:03.900 --> 22:08.420]  I've been with some of you when we've been in places that you would not have any idea
[22:08.420 --> 22:13.680]  you'd want to be when you were going to school foreign policy and foreign service. They never
[22:13.680 --> 22:19.220]  told you what was going to happen. But you're an incredible group of individuals. Well, there
[22:19.220 --> 22:25.860]  you go. It's Rambo, five times the congressional medal of honor, winner, 14 silver stars, 90
[22:25.860 --> 22:31.180]  combat tours. Ladies and gentlemen, if you disagree with that, you are a white supremacist.
[22:31.180 --> 22:36.940]  So let's talk about Hillary said that she was in Bosnia, Herzegovina in the Balkans,
[22:36.940 --> 22:40.900]  and that she was shot at. But apparently they had footage of her landing and there was no
[22:40.900 --> 22:45.220]  one shooting in her, no firing anywhere in the area. Here it is. Her initial account
[22:45.220 --> 22:51.780]  of a 1996 trip to Bosnia. I remember landing under sniper fire. This newly released video
[22:51.780 --> 22:57.500]  debunked Hillary Clinton's recollection of a would be dangerous encounter as First Lady.
[22:57.500 --> 23:01.620]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just
[23:01.620 --> 23:07.260]  ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles. That was last week. Now confronted with new
[23:07.260 --> 23:13.020]  evidence, the New York Senator is backpedaling. You know, I made a mistake in describing it.
[23:13.020 --> 23:19.220]  I have said many times I have talked about this many times that we were, you know, very
[23:19.220 --> 23:24.820]  much told by the Secret Service and the military that we were going into a war zone. Clinton's
[23:24.820 --> 23:30.380]  campaign rival Barack Obama is blasting the remarks, saying they are all part of a pattern
[23:30.380 --> 23:35.660]  in which Clinton tries to exaggerate her role in policymaking during her husband's administration.
[23:35.660 --> 23:38.900]  Oh, that's enough. Gosh, lighten up guys. These guys all fight with each other and make
[23:38.900 --> 23:45.700]  no mistake. We're now in the third administration of Barack Hussein Obama, who man, as bad as
[23:45.700 --> 23:50.980]  he is, not as bad as Hillary, but still he didn't really get elected. So I hate his guts.
[23:50.980 --> 23:57.100]  But here's Brian Williams. Remember, he said he was in a helicopter shot down by an RPG,
[23:57.100 --> 24:02.100]  then a group of helicopters got shot at. Turns out none of it was true. He's the fact checker
[24:02.100 --> 24:07.540]  on MSNBC and NBC. He fact checks the president. So when you're like the known liar of the
[24:07.540 --> 24:14.820]  planet, well, then you are the fact checker. Hell, you should go run Snopes. They're the
[24:14.820 --> 24:23.700]  only people that are bigger liars than him. Here it is. See our colleague, Brian Williams
[24:23.700 --> 24:29.220]  is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call in the skies over Iraq. Brian, tell us
[24:29.220 --> 24:35.260]  about what you got yourself into. Well, in the end, Tom, it did give us a glimpse of
[24:35.260 --> 24:41.740]  the war being fought as few have seen it. We asked the US Army to take us on an air mission
[24:41.740 --> 24:47.380]  with them. They accepted. We knew there was risk involved. We knew we would be flying
[24:47.380 --> 24:53.260]  over Iraq. We discussed it. We weren't cavalier about it. We took off, and that is right about
[24:53.260 --> 24:59.180]  when things started to happen. What's the weather status? Right now, it's just gonna
[24:59.180 --> 25:05.380]  be locked and loaded on safe. Indeed, just before we're able to make our drop, radio
[25:05.380 --> 25:18.860]  traffic makes clear this routine mission is running into trouble. We quickly make our
[25:18.860 --> 25:25.620]  drop and then turn southwest. Suddenly without knowing why we learn we've been ordered to
[25:25.620 --> 25:31.740]  land in the desert. On the ground, we learned the Chinook ahead of us was almost blown out
[25:31.740 --> 25:39.300]  of the sky. That hole was made by a rocket propelled grenade or RPG fired from the ground.
[25:39.300 --> 25:43.940]  It punched cleanly through the skin of the ship. But amazingly, okay, let's stop right
[25:43.940 --> 25:49.340]  there. Turned out that wasn't even true. And he later lied and said it was his helicopter.
[25:49.340 --> 25:55.660]  Okay, so everybody remembers that. Now he is the main fact checker. Now let's get real
[25:55.660 --> 26:02.340]  here. The truth is, if somebody's sitting in a TV studio, you can't question them. AOC,
[26:02.340 --> 26:08.580]  Biden, Hillary, Ryan Williams, actually all are part of a secret space force operation.
[26:08.580 --> 26:12.980]  I was the captain. We went up into orbit to save the International Space Station last
[26:12.980 --> 26:18.380]  year. Here's actual footage of it. Can we show it? And the Earth was under attack, but
[26:18.380 --> 26:24.060]  we launched. We went up there and we took the aliens out before they could before they
[26:24.060 --> 26:30.020]  could destroy the Earth. Okay. This is actual footage right here that you're watching of
[26:30.020 --> 26:35.540]  your TV viewer. This is what happened to the Earth, but Hillary had a time machine when
[26:35.540 --> 26:40.340]  we were back in time and stopped it. Of course, none of that's true, but it doesn't matter.
[26:40.340 --> 26:45.180]  Because I work for Snopes and I work for Ryan Williams. And I am the fact checker. Of course,
[26:45.180 --> 26:48.900]  the truth is, the globals do want to destroy the Earth. That's their plan. They work for
[26:48.900 --> 26:55.180]  old PLC bub. We'll be right back. Please stay with us info wars.com tomorrow's news day.
[26:55.180 --> 26:59.820]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight
[26:59.820 --> 27:04.740]  months. They made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance
[27:04.740 --> 27:08.780]  and report them back to cell towers to track for every movement. This is for everybody.
[27:08.780 --> 27:14.780]  The way it gets better now, France has programs in their factories, government, push and sponsor
[27:14.780 --> 27:19.820]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars. Make social distance and report back to
[27:19.820 --> 27:24.260]  single computers. They're turning us into a commodity. Human animal clones have been
[27:24.260 --> 27:28.780]  around for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle
[27:28.780 --> 27:33.540]  of humans and making us obsolete. And big corporations downplay that they own us with
[27:33.540 --> 27:39.020]  these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced. Do you understand it is a takeover
[27:39.020 --> 27:43.500]  of the entire species of the genetic level. And now they're coming with dog collars and
[27:43.500 --> 27:47.620]  they're announcing in public schools in the U. S. Starting next year, it will begin. Did
[27:47.620 --> 27:52.740]  you hear me? Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[27:52.740 --> 27:58.140]  Imple Wars continue to spread the word to fight back. There are almost no free independent
[27:58.140 --> 28:02.940]  media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world. Imple Wars
[28:02.940 --> 28:07.980]  is stand alone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us
[28:07.980 --> 28:14.700]  up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism,
[28:14.700 --> 28:19.900]  the right to self defense and exposing the anti human globalist death agenda. That's
[28:19.900 --> 28:25.260]  why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at band on video. They're not allowed to be
[28:25.260 --> 28:30.740]  on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's so precious because the censorship
[28:30.740 --> 28:35.780]  expands to everyone, which it is now with AI monitoring, controlling what you can say
[28:35.780 --> 28:41.740]  and do. It's going to be the LAC's black band on video and the now redesigned ImpleWars.com
[28:41.740 --> 28:45.940]  that become more and more important, which they are. And the enemy is suing us, attacking
[28:45.940 --> 28:51.220]  us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down
[28:51.220 --> 28:58.020]  right now because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word now. As men age, they often
[28:58.020 --> 29:07.060]  experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness. And that's why we made
[29:07.060 --> 29:14.340]  one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically designed
[29:14.340 --> 29:22.420]  to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males. Now look,
[29:22.420 --> 29:28.900]  this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic
[29:28.900 --> 29:36.460]  chemicals and no unwanted additives. Yes. We're talking about ancient wisdom combined
[29:36.460 --> 29:42.300]  with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the
[29:42.300 --> 29:48.460]  most out of this herb packed formula. What are you waiting for? Go to the ImpleWars store.

[29:58.420 --> 30:23.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. You know, I think it's fair to say that if we're
[30:23.820 --> 30:32.740]  ever going to get this republic back, we have to admit that we've lost it. You could fairly
[30:32.740 --> 30:43.580]  say, I don't think it's open for argument that this country was born on July 4th, 1776
[30:43.580 --> 30:54.420]  and that it died on January 20th, 2021. Richard and Haas of the Council on Farm Relations,
[30:54.420 --> 30:59.420]  by the way, guys, I've been meaning to do this for a week. It's in the workout area,
[30:59.420 --> 31:03.900]  workout gym. This building has a workout gym for the crew of myself, small gym. I've
[31:03.900 --> 31:11.740]  got a desk in there and on it is a foreign affairs publication of the CFR bi-monthly
[31:11.740 --> 31:16.620]  has an eagle on the front. I'd like to show people that this segment of I can. So will
[31:16.620 --> 31:22.420]  somebody just go over to the gym and on the table is a book and will you please bring
[31:22.420 --> 31:27.580]  me the bi-monthly book? It's a book. It's not a magazine and I will show you what I'm
[31:27.580 --> 31:36.300]  talking about. But just going back, I mean, it shows for a couple of days. I keep forgetting
[31:36.300 --> 31:49.500]  to bring it over here. Richard and Haas said on the 7th of January, after the quote, most
[31:49.500 --> 31:53.260]  deadly attack since Pearl Harbor in 9-11 where one cop had a heart attack two days
[31:53.260 --> 31:57.460]  later and four citizens were killed because of a small riot, a giant crowd, a very small
[31:57.460 --> 32:09.820]  group rioted. He said that this you could mark as the end of America and American exceptionalism,
[32:09.820 --> 32:18.780]  but that's all they've been preaching forever is the end of the country and how America
[32:18.780 --> 32:24.660]  is not open for business. So when they turn the oil and the gas and the coal off, when
[32:24.660 --> 32:30.100]  they cut the pipelines off, and when they let China run these internal tariffs against
[32:30.100 --> 32:34.220]  us and India and everybody else, you don't have a chance to have meaningful jobs and
[32:34.220 --> 32:39.100]  businesses here. And not with the Gen to 2030, Gen to 2021 that comes in with all these regulations
[32:39.100 --> 32:45.300]  that are designed the system admits to make it prohibitive to do business unless you're
[32:45.300 --> 32:49.100]  a globalist multinational corporation that writes the laws where you're basically exempt
[32:49.100 --> 32:56.100]  from it. And that's what's so frustrating about this new world order is that the Chinese
[32:56.100 --> 33:00.900]  people are being exploited. They're not giving all our jobs because the Chinese want to empower
[33:00.900 --> 33:05.820]  their people. They're doing because they're slaves and they're being used to leverage
[33:05.820 --> 33:12.860]  out control economically of the planet. And when you look at a Greta Thunberg or you look
[33:12.860 --> 33:24.300]  at a Klaus Schwab or you look at any of these people, they all have private jets. They live
[33:24.300 --> 33:31.300]  in big mansions. They have three, four, five kids. They live opulent lifestyles. But then
[33:31.300 --> 33:35.820]  they literally tell you like John Kerry does, Oh, no, no, no, I have a private jet. You
[33:35.820 --> 33:41.700]  just can't fly commercial. You can't go on a vacation once a year. And there's all these
[33:41.700 --> 33:49.500]  sycophants just worshiping these people and they get away with it. And they get away with
[33:49.500 --> 33:58.140]  it. And they get away with it. And now they just believe it's their right to do all of
[33:58.140 --> 34:01.940]  this. So so here's the Foreign Affairs publication. I wanted to show you I was digging through
[34:01.940 --> 34:09.300]  one of my offices and found this from a couple years ago. This is a July, August 2019 issue.
[34:09.300 --> 34:13.340]  And you read this and it's all about how America sucks and America is over and how America
[34:13.340 --> 34:19.540]  is a worthless place to be and how we're a joke. And this is the ruling class in America
[34:19.540 --> 34:25.100]  that sold us off to foreign powers made themselves fabulously rich that is now conducting a purge
[34:25.100 --> 34:29.740]  of the military saying that white people are and conservatives are inherently bad to divide
[34:29.740 --> 34:37.020]  and conquer all of us while they dissolve the country's very borders. This is a takeover.
[34:37.020 --> 34:43.140]  What happened to the American century? And they just talk about how pathetic we are and
[34:43.140 --> 34:47.700]  how it's all over. The truth is, Trump had already reversed much of what they did and
[34:47.700 --> 34:53.980]  put the country back on a decent course, but they reversed the whole thing. Yeah, there's
[34:53.980 --> 35:01.140]  lots of other articles. The American dream is an illusion. Don't stand up for your country.
[35:01.140 --> 35:09.220]  Let us sell it off. The self-destruction of American power. Washington squandered the
[35:09.220 --> 35:16.300]  unipolar movement. Oh, just the whole thing is how America's trash. And now we're going
[35:16.300 --> 35:21.500]  to show you your trash because you're never going to reopen again. And China will be open
[35:21.500 --> 35:29.060]  forever. And so all the investments going to go there. And it's real simple that all
[35:29.060 --> 35:43.340]  their investments are guaranteed. Stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool. And
[35:43.340 --> 35:47.340]  so there is Biden right now giving a live speech at the White House about how he's going
[35:47.340 --> 35:52.340]  to give you all this free stuff. So let me see. You got one $2,000 check for the first
[35:52.340 --> 35:56.500]  half of the year being shut down. And now the next half of the year into this year, you're
[35:56.500 --> 36:06.140]  shut down and you get $2,000. But even though that won't pay for the average person for
[36:06.140 --> 36:12.580]  even a month, it all now goes into big box stores and Amazon and things that are allowed
[36:12.580 --> 36:20.860]  to stay open in this whole giant fraud. And so I'm going to hit the latest incredible
[36:20.860 --> 36:26.660]  COVID numbers of people fighting back in some real rays of sunshine with oak farms, seeded
[36:26.660 --> 36:29.820]  table, tables, Florida and how a movement like this expanding is how we're going to
[36:29.820 --> 36:34.220]  have to have our free society in the future, where we have our enclaves of free association
[36:34.220 --> 36:40.740]  where we do not submit, where we stand together and where we support each other. So I don't
[36:40.740 --> 36:49.040]  bring you all of this news and all of this information to be negative and to make you
[36:49.040 --> 36:58.300]  feel bad to take your hope. The only hope you've got is being honest about how much
[36:58.300 --> 37:05.380]  trouble we're all really collectively in and understanding that any quarter, any support,
[37:05.380 --> 37:11.500]  anything we give the globalists will be used against us. This is a very cold-blooded takeover.
[37:11.500 --> 37:14.780]  And these globalists don't like each other either. I mean, they are now. You read about
[37:14.780 --> 37:20.620]  Hillary, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates. They don't. They'll come in and eat $500 dinner. They
[37:20.620 --> 37:30.660]  don't give $1 tip. That's just the beginning of these people. They are just ruthless trash.
[37:30.660 --> 37:38.100]  The most soulless, hateful, inbred, demonic people the world could ever imagine. And that's
[37:38.100 --> 37:42.820]  why they lust after control of your body, your health, your mind. And that's why you
[37:42.820 --> 37:48.900]  cannot let them have it. And you have to understand that this is the animating contest of liberty
[37:48.900 --> 37:54.420]  that Thomas Jefferson talked about and that you get stronger fighting back. You don't
[37:54.420 --> 37:58.340]  get strong submitting. And oh, just two more months, three more months, six more months,
[37:58.340 --> 38:03.180]  a year, another year, okay, five years, okay, the mass never come off. Socky, the press
[38:03.180 --> 38:08.300]  secretary, we got that clip coming up. She said, oh, no, the mass never comes off, even
[38:08.300 --> 38:16.660]  to get the vaccine. It's never coming off. We're going to go to break. I just briefly
[38:16.660 --> 38:22.780]  again want to remind listeners that I'm very thankful for your support. And without you,
[38:22.780 --> 38:26.220]  we will not be here into the future. I want to thank you for supporting us in my books
[38:26.220 --> 38:31.140]  and films and t-shirts and non GMO heirloom seeds and storeable food. All of it is the
[38:31.140 --> 38:34.020]  highest quality you're going to find out there for decent prices. There's always stuff that
[38:34.020 --> 38:37.980]  costs way more that you could say is better to storeable food. But for the price, it's
[38:37.980 --> 38:40.940]  the best stuff out there. It's what I choose for my family. I would get prepared. I would
[38:40.940 --> 38:44.900]  get ready now and I would support this broadcast and support local stations. We have turbo
[38:44.900 --> 38:51.060]  charge your natural defenses. There's incredible new sales DNA force plus selling out the PQQ,
[38:51.060 --> 38:56.980]  the CoQ 10, the Rolls Royce for your cells. It is at 25% off selling out ultra 12 back
[38:56.980 --> 39:00.100]  and stock highest quality B 12, take it out of the tongue for higher absorption, read
[39:00.100 --> 39:06.220]  all things that B 12 does. This is the highest you're going to get. It's amazing 50% off.
[39:06.220 --> 39:11.060]  Liquid pure turmeric is selling out, but it's still massively discounted. The powdered turmeric
[39:11.060 --> 39:18.060]  bodies is sold out lung cleanse plus sold out back in stock sold out for a while. It's
[39:18.060 --> 39:24.740]  now back in stock 50% off. And we have the trader Joe's t-shirt. But let's go out to
[39:24.740 --> 39:31.620]  break with, well, let's come back from break with Joe Biden and some of the, some of the
[39:31.620 --> 39:38.780]  math he's engaged in about 300 Americans and I just got 200 million dosages for you. Doses.
[39:38.780 --> 39:42.220]  Wow. What a time to be alive. I'll tell you, this is not going to be boring. Not going
[39:42.220 --> 39:46.660]  to be boring. They're coming for your guns and the rest of the speech and they're openly
[39:46.660 --> 39:50.180]  saying they want to kill you and your family. And they've got a plan to carry it out. All
[39:50.180 --> 39:57.540]  right, hold it right back. Hey, Alex. How you doing, man? Is this the guy that called
[39:57.540 --> 40:02.340]  in about living defense? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get ahold of you since
[40:02.340 --> 40:08.780]  Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man,
[40:08.780 --> 40:13.500]  I got to get on that show and give him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be
[40:13.500 --> 40:18.820]  on Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell the world about living defense and what it did
[40:18.820 --> 40:25.180]  for me personally. Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20. Thanks to this info for
[40:25.180 --> 40:30.580]  store products. And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night. So I'm doing what
[40:30.580 --> 40:36.340]  I can, brother. So what my my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right
[40:36.340 --> 40:40.820]  with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense? Now you got to follow that
[40:40.820 --> 40:46.260]  up with the Microsoft Act. I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We
[40:46.260 --> 40:51.060]  didn't know we didn't screen your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later
[40:51.060 --> 40:53.860]  and you're here telling people about living defense, living defense, living defense.
[40:53.860 --> 41:00.740]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations.
[41:00.740 --> 41:06.020]  This is forced evolution or devolution. When you look at all the major research, all the
[41:06.020 --> 41:10.460]  major programs are carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter or
[41:10.460 --> 41:17.260]  more moral. No, it's turning humanity into a commodity. Now we see some propaganda like
[41:17.260 --> 41:22.260]  Communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers superman.
[41:22.260 --> 41:27.980]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops. We'll send things
[41:27.980 --> 41:32.420]  with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of die each time they try a new
[41:32.420 --> 41:36.500]  experimental vaccine. I've talked to high level folks inside the federal government
[41:36.500 --> 41:40.700]  and the state of Texas health department. They say Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people,
[41:40.700 --> 41:45.180]  but it's for a greater good. But that's not even true. And it violates the Geneva Convention,
[41:45.180 --> 41:49.700]  the Nuremberg Code, federal state law. This is violence being carried out against us by
[41:49.700 --> 41:56.260]  that attorney. And we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[41:56.260 --> 42:01.060]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't gonna let
[42:01.060 --> 42:06.940]  that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating
[42:06.940 --> 42:12.780]  from the United States, and it spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They were
[42:12.780 --> 42:17.700]  desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do. And so they put
[42:17.700 --> 42:23.660]  out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than Dallas. And
[42:23.660 --> 42:27.460]  now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me.
[42:27.460 --> 42:31.700]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us. And that's
[42:31.700 --> 42:36.140]  why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming. We told you this
[42:36.140 --> 42:40.420]  was coming. We were the first main target that we're still on air at m4wars.com and
[42:40.420 --> 42:44.820]  newswars.com and band dog video. Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without
[42:44.820 --> 42:49.580]  your financial support, we can't stay on air. So while you still can, go to m4warstore.com
[42:49.580 --> 42:55.140]  and get storeable foods and high quality products, supplements, you name it, at m4warstore.com.
[42:55.140 --> 43:01.620]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough
[43:01.620 --> 43:07.020]  of it. We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug. That's what fills
[43:07.020 --> 43:11.420]  my belly. That's what fills my soul. Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee. Folks, we
[43:11.420 --> 43:18.260]  have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com. Years. Never raised the price. Never. The Wake
[43:18.260 --> 43:22.820]  Up America blend, the best coffee. The crew here loves it. We drink it every day. And
[43:22.820 --> 43:27.700]  of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here. Everybody
[43:27.700 --> 43:32.180]  drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support info wars and keep the coffee
[43:32.180 --> 43:36.420]  supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend? Of course, read all the great
[43:36.420 --> 43:40.940]  reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star. When you have thousands of reviews,
[43:40.940 --> 43:44.980]  it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it five stars. So
[43:44.980 --> 43:48.140]  I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it five stars. That may be
[43:48.140 --> 43:58.340]  one or two people. Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[43:58.340 --> 44:12.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:12.540 --> 44:32.860]  So we tried to take the country back. We took large parts of the world back from the globalist.
[44:32.860 --> 44:38.100]  They counter-struck through fraud and installed Joe Biden. Huge article at Time Magazine just
[44:38.100 --> 44:41.660]  bragging about it all. We'll cover it some next hour. Max Kaiser is going to be joining
[44:41.660 --> 44:46.740]  us as well. But I want to take calls the first half hour, but I only want to put about six
[44:46.740 --> 44:50.460]  or seven callers on the board. I don't want to make other people hold. Take six, seven
[44:50.460 --> 44:56.140]  calls, start of the next hour. The Max Kaiser comes on bottom of the hour. Is America done
[44:56.140 --> 45:03.100]  for? Is America beyond the point of no return? I think it is. But unlike a person that dies,
[45:03.100 --> 45:06.860]  republics can rise again. But if we don't get back to God and back to common sense and
[45:06.860 --> 45:13.340]  back in reality, we have no hope. I almost felt guilty after the show yesterday reading
[45:13.340 --> 45:19.540]  you news articles out of the German news of per city thousands of young boys taken in
[45:19.540 --> 45:24.340]  place with brutal pedophiles to live with pedophiles and be raped by them so that they
[45:24.340 --> 45:29.380]  would never be heterosexual and have children as part of a depopulation program. 30,000
[45:29.380 --> 45:35.100]  in one German state alone. The nuns delivering little boys to be gang raped by up to 30 men,
[45:35.100 --> 45:39.900]  20, 30, 40 men. It's described till they were bleeding everywhere. You think I want
[45:39.900 --> 45:45.500]  to tell you that stuff? That's what's in the police reports. That's what's in the confessions.
[45:45.500 --> 45:50.020]  That's what's coming out in these trials. That's the government. That's liberals. They're
[45:50.020 --> 45:55.540]  about selfishness and killing babies in the womb, out of the womb, killing old people.
[45:55.540 --> 45:59.980]  They're not the moral high ground. They're monsters. And when you see them and they look
[45:59.980 --> 46:09.860]  evil and they act evil and they don't look normal, there's a reason because they are
[46:09.860 --> 46:17.260]  turned over to a spirit of destruction and of raw seeking of power. Not because they're
[46:17.260 --> 46:25.260]  powerful, but because they're weak. Now here's Saki. Every time I say this woman's name kind
[46:25.260 --> 46:29.060]  of ruined Saki for me. I like Saki. I don't like this Saki lady. You know, she was one
[46:29.060 --> 46:34.300]  of the operatives under Obama. She's back in. He's the one making fun of her military
[46:34.300 --> 46:39.820]  and all the rest of it. She's the globalist. And she said, oh, no, no, no, the vaccine
[46:39.820 --> 46:43.980]  doesn't mean you take the mask off. The vaccine doesn't mean you stop social distancing. Oh,
[46:43.980 --> 46:48.740]  no, because it doesn't help you. You see, here she is. What we're also trying to do is make
[46:48.740 --> 46:52.460]  our health and medical experts available to ensure people understand and I'll reiterate
[46:52.460 --> 46:58.500]  it here today. It's not just a vaccine is obviously an incredible medical breakthrough.
[46:58.500 --> 47:03.980]  And we want every American to have one. But even if you're vaccinated, social distancing,
[47:03.980 --> 47:07.860]  wearing masks are going to be essential and we'll need to continue communicating about
[47:07.860 --> 47:10.740]  that through health and medical experts. So what do you say to those folks? What do you
[47:10.740 --> 47:14.860]  say to the folks like those that we saw in this video and believe one of the folks who
[47:14.860 --> 47:20.820]  owns or runs that store who said he doesn't believe that 450,000 Americans. Yeah, all
[47:20.820 --> 47:25.420]  those big giant Trump rallies and you guys make up your cover cases with your fake PCR
[47:25.420 --> 47:30.700]  test, which you now admit is 96% fake. And so now you want anal swabs, it's always more,
[47:30.700 --> 47:34.660]  more more in the UN says they want rapid reaction teams to come in your house and Bill Gates
[47:34.660 --> 47:38.340]  came out earlier this week and said that I never played the clip. I'm gonna play it
[47:38.340 --> 47:45.980]  next hour, guys, pull up that Bill Gates video. So this is all going down. Now, if you look
[47:45.980 --> 47:51.740]  at this nice grocery store, Oak Farms seed to table, it simply says there is no lawn
[47:51.740 --> 47:58.020]  Florida. And if you don't want to wear one, you don't have to. Oh my gosh, they're not
[47:58.020 --> 48:02.180]  buying into the cult. They're educated. They're into health food. They're happy. Almost no
[48:02.180 --> 48:07.060]  one is wearing a mask. If you want to be an idiot, go ahead. But the globalists all use
[48:07.060 --> 48:12.380]  social pressure, peer pressure. Were they worried about the TV coming out of the third
[48:12.380 --> 48:16.020]  world killing millions? Were they worried about all the scabies, all the bubonic plague?
[48:16.020 --> 48:21.820]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. They're just worried about something they claim killed 400,000
[48:21.820 --> 48:24.820]  people. But as the owner said, that's pure bull. They're counting all the other deaths
[48:24.820 --> 48:31.220]  as that. We have the same number of deaths roughly in 2020 that we had in 2019. And that's
[48:31.220 --> 48:36.860]  the facts. They know that this is all a giant lie, but they're habituating hysteria and
[48:36.860 --> 48:41.820]  hypochondria over the common cold. And if you go to the wrong hospital, they'll intubate
[48:41.820 --> 48:46.860]  your ass when you got it. They'll kill you because they get $53,000 when they intubate
[48:46.860 --> 48:52.820]  you. You can hire the best hit man out there for $53,000. But that's why it's only certain
[48:52.820 --> 48:58.500]  hospitals that are doing all the killing. Like certain hospitals, harvest the baby parts.
[48:58.500 --> 49:02.220]  Governor Northam is one of those doctors that ran a hospital that harvest the babies. It's
[49:02.220 --> 49:06.740]  why they hired him. It's why he's passing laws to kill babies after they're born. This
[49:06.740 --> 49:14.460]  is a ghoul group. This is a science fiction horror moving. You're in 2021 and ain't cute
[49:14.460 --> 49:19.900]  and only waking up. We'll stop it. Here's a little bit of a boil down that we put together
[49:19.900 --> 49:24.580]  with a little bit of scary music over it because it's so scary to see free range humans not
[49:24.580 --> 49:29.580]  covering their dirty pie holes. Here it is. We all fantasize about a time when we won't
[49:29.580 --> 49:36.180]  have to wear the masks anymore. It's not now, but some at a supermarket in Florida appear
[49:36.180 --> 49:41.660]  to have decided that the time is now. Look at this. This was the scene at Oaks Farm seed
[49:41.660 --> 49:47.780]  and to table market in Naples today. NBC Sam Brock took this video, which went viral. It
[49:47.780 --> 49:52.900]  looks like it was taken pre pandemic, right? Most customers and employees not wearing masks
[49:52.900 --> 49:59.100]  at all. The scene inside Oaks Farm seed to table market taken less than 24 hours ago
[49:59.100 --> 50:05.020]  shows employees and customers young and old, almost entirely without masks. The store's
[50:05.020 --> 50:10.420]  policy includes mask exemption guidelines. The sign says if you have a medical condition
[50:10.420 --> 50:15.060]  that you don't have to wear a mask and nobody inside will ask about medical conditions.
[50:15.060 --> 50:19.980]  So masks are not enforced. The owner told Sam Brock this when questioned about the policy
[50:19.980 --> 50:23.860]  is your position about medical exemptions or is it about the fact that you don't think
[50:23.860 --> 50:27.980]  masks work and that the virus is not a real. I know that the mask don't work and I know
[50:27.980 --> 50:33.900]  that the virus has not has not killed 400,000 people in this country. That's total hogwash.
[50:33.900 --> 50:39.820]  In this state, that lasted this community before, not just for this is a COVID mask,
[50:39.820 --> 50:45.220]  but also for how he characterized the social justice movement as well. Get ahead. Florida
[50:45.220 --> 50:51.620]  does not have a mask mandate, but masks do work. The science is crystal clear. Oh, in
[50:51.620 --> 50:57.380]  July, the CDC director said the United States could get COVID under control in four to eight
[50:57.380 --> 51:02.940]  weeks. If we would only all wear masks and standard houses, which we did in the course,
[51:02.940 --> 51:06.500]  didn't fix anything except bankrupt the whole planet, which you guys doubled your money
[51:06.500 --> 51:13.100]  on. Shep Smith said so. No evidence of election fraud. And oh, the ACLU came out and said
[51:13.100 --> 51:19.700]  it's true that biological men can be in women's sports. They have no advantage. Guys, let's
[51:19.700 --> 51:24.060]  type in biological men and women's sports. Can we show some of the wrestling footage,
[51:24.060 --> 51:30.620]  the boxing footage, the bike racing footage, the 100 yard dashes where you'll have big
[51:30.620 --> 51:36.380]  dudes powerlifting, breaking national international championships. Like, whoa, I mean, because
[51:36.380 --> 51:40.380]  these aren't just dudes that are effeminate looking to say that they're a woman. This
[51:40.380 --> 51:45.580]  is huge giant dudes that were previously in one case of powerlifting was already competing
[51:45.580 --> 51:54.100]  at the collegiate level. And it's now a champion. Oh, I can't win as a boy. So I'm a girl. That's
[51:54.100 --> 52:02.660]  right. I'm a girl. What a circus, man. What an incredible criticism. I guess Minnesota
[52:02.660 --> 52:05.940]  got all the girls with their burkas on and used to put the Muslims down for wearing burkas
[52:05.940 --> 52:13.540]  in his jibs. Hell, we wear mid wear them. It's all a sign of submission. And there's
[52:13.540 --> 52:18.860]  so much of this footage, ladies and gentlemen, here's some black dudes just smoking the girls.
[52:18.860 --> 52:23.500]  But it's all right. These black dudes could not beat the other black dudes in track. So
[52:23.500 --> 52:29.020]  they just said, Hey, I'm going to, you know, put some pigtails on, put some blonde pigtails
[52:29.020 --> 52:38.660]  on and we're off to the races quite literally. So I just want to say that I salute the oak
[52:38.660 --> 52:43.500]  farms seed to table and I want to see if they have an online deal for things like beans
[52:43.500 --> 52:48.220]  or seeds or anything. And I'm going to reach out to seed the table and I'm going to see
[52:48.220 --> 52:52.260]  I'm going to buy some stuff from him here in Texas. I'm going to reward not being cowards.
[52:52.260 --> 52:56.620]  I'm going to reward fighting tearing. We need to get this duplicated. Now they know legally
[52:56.620 --> 52:59.860]  they can't make you wear a mask because of asthma or anxiety. So that's why when they
[52:59.860 --> 53:03.500]  first started this a year ago, they go, Now, don't make people at stores. If they say they
[53:03.500 --> 53:08.620]  have a health problem. Oh, but still the virtue signalers still enforce it. They still enforce
[53:08.620 --> 53:12.420]  it. Even though it kills their bottom line, everybody just goes to Amazon. They don't
[53:12.420 --> 53:17.540]  care. They love it. The petty power of being able to do it. Coincidence, COVID death rates
[53:17.540 --> 53:22.620]  plummet in weeks following Biden's inauguration, experts flabbergasted, but don't be fooled.
[53:22.620 --> 53:26.860]  They're going to take a little bit of pressure off and then clamp that sucker down 10 times
[53:26.860 --> 53:33.900]  harder. Five years at least. What's constant governor Tony ever's issues, new statewide
[53:33.900 --> 53:38.820]  mass mandate, one hour after state GOP voted to repeal previous mass mandate. And so is
[53:38.820 --> 53:43.260]  the Supreme Court, but he'll just keep passing new laws, even though he needs to be repealed.
[53:43.260 --> 53:49.460]  He needs to be withdrawn, recalled. He needs to be taken out of there. These are all petty
[53:49.460 --> 53:55.380]  dictators, but the people are waking up. But we need prosecutions of Bill Gates, prosecutions
[53:55.380 --> 54:00.700]  of Fauci. We need them to get in trouble. We need their emails, their coordination that
[54:00.700 --> 54:04.540]  have come out about how they're doing it for virtue signaling and to create control and
[54:04.540 --> 54:08.900]  to create fear and to vertically integrate and to set the precedent to whatever they
[54:08.900 --> 54:13.500]  want, whenever they want. See the full video of the horror MSM freaked out by shocking
[54:13.500 --> 54:21.500]  video of maskless supermarket. And it goes on from there so much to break down. All right,
[54:21.500 --> 54:24.820]  our number two, I got so much to tell you, I'm not even going to tell you what's coming
[54:24.820 --> 54:29.220]  up next hour, but there's just so much of it. But it's all extremely important on the
[54:29.220 --> 54:35.340]  upcoming impeachment trial on Trump's great letter resigning from the screen actors guild
[54:35.340 --> 54:42.340]  and the CIA plan to kill you and your family. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[54:42.340 --> 54:49.940]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source of
[54:49.940 --> 54:54.100]  food supply sale. It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality
[54:54.100 --> 54:59.180]  food you're going to find at infowarstore.com. The subsection is prepared with alex.com and
[54:59.180 --> 55:03.580]  as all these globalists do this and as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need
[55:03.580 --> 55:08.460]  to understand that you need 25 year food supply at the last 25 years, one month, three months,
[55:08.460 --> 55:11.580]  six months, one year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find. And
[55:11.580 --> 55:15.740]  it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of and you know you're getting good food
[55:15.740 --> 55:19.100]  at a very good price and you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much
[55:19.100 --> 55:25.660]  profit in this goes to us to fund our operation. So prepare with alex.com or info wars store.com
[55:25.660 --> 55:29.260]  you can find preparing this section there, water filtration, air filtration, it's all
[55:29.260 --> 55:32.860]  there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more. It's
[55:32.860 --> 55:36.700]  time to start getting prepared and it starts with self defense. It starts with being prepared
[55:36.700 --> 55:40.540]  and starts with horrible food. It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll
[55:40.540 --> 55:41.180]  win in the end.
[55:46.540 --> 55:52.140]  Anybody listening to my voice and simply search engines in the term, Davos group, technocracy
[55:52.140 --> 56:00.780]  or technocrats, you will get Clash Lob and John Claude, Junker and all the new order globalists
[56:00.780 --> 56:06.140]  like Gigi being saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that
[56:06.140 --> 56:10.860]  they want businessmen, technocrats over it. And that's who Clash Lob is. You might want to look
[56:10.860 --> 56:15.420]  into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[56:15.420 --> 56:20.380]  You might want to find out who this super villain is. You see, he believes because he's
[56:20.380 --> 56:24.860]  hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do it to you.
[56:24.860 --> 56:29.420]  You might want to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed
[56:29.420 --> 56:35.180]  since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own
[56:35.180 --> 56:40.140]  works. So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you
[56:40.140 --> 56:44.140]  before you take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[56:48.060 --> 56:50.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:50.780 --> 57:02.940]  And we are back live at our number two. Max Kaiser joins us at the bottom of the hour,
[57:02.940 --> 57:07.820]  but I want to take your calls on the future of America, the gun grab, the global government,
[57:07.820 --> 57:13.740]  the urge of the U.S. military, how much worse is it going to get and how fast we're in it now,
[57:13.740 --> 57:24.380]  the new world order, 877-789-2539-877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539. First time callers. I'm going to
[57:24.380 --> 57:29.260]  take six, seven calls in segment two and three. That's all the calls we're going to take right
[57:29.260 --> 57:33.180]  now because I don't want you to sit on hold. And then later I'll open the phones back up again
[57:33.180 --> 57:39.500]  for some questions for Max Kaiser on the economy in the third hour with him. He comes up joining
[57:39.500 --> 57:46.460]  us to talk about all these big issues. Here is a very, very important report by Brian Wilson.
[57:46.460 --> 57:52.540]  It's short, but it's powerful. It's at band.video in the Brian Wilson section. He's one of our editors
[57:52.540 --> 57:57.980]  and researchers. He also puts out reports, and it deals with Christian persecution. Will
[57:57.980 --> 58:03.660]  Christian persecution continue to escalate? And that really is the heart of this because the
[58:03.660 --> 58:07.660]  globalists have done all the numbers for a while. They know Christians are going to oppose
[58:07.660 --> 58:11.740]  their whole global government takeover. So here's that report.
[58:12.540 --> 58:21.100]  Will Christian persecution continue to rise in 2021? According to the Watchdog organization,
[58:21.100 --> 58:30.700]  Open Doors USA, the number of Christians murdered for their faith around the world rose 60% in 2020.
[58:30.700 --> 58:36.860]  A lot of this persecution is centered in Africa, which was one of the first places to receive the
[58:36.860 --> 58:44.460]  gospel. In July of 2020, 300 Christians were killed in Nigeria and thousands were forced to
[58:44.460 --> 58:51.660]  leave their homes. Nearly 2000 Christians were shot or hacked to death in raids on their villages
[58:51.660 --> 58:59.340]  since January of 2020 as a way to drive them off their farmland. On December 15th of 2020,
[58:59.340 --> 59:05.980]  federal troops in Ethiopia surrounded the Merriam of Zion Cathedral in the Tigrayan city
[59:05.980 --> 59:12.300]  of Aksum. They then forced the Christians into a square outside the cathedral where they opened
[59:12.300 --> 59:20.300]  fire on the crowd, killing at least 750 people. At the beginning of 2021, within less than three
[59:20.300 --> 59:27.500]  weeks, more than 100 Congolese in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo were
[59:27.500 --> 59:34.460]  killed by an Islamic extremist group with a clear Islamic expansionist agenda. An average of a dozen
[59:34.460 --> 59:40.540]  Christians a day are murdered across Africa due to their religious beliefs, and unfortunately,
[59:40.540 --> 59:47.420]  this number is a low estimate. In Asia, the first place to receive the gospel, overall persecution
[59:47.420 --> 59:54.860]  of Christians is steeply rising, leaving to the imagination what 2021 will be like. In 2019,
[59:54.860 --> 1:00:03.020]  persecution relief, a group dedicated to helping persecuted Christians in India, recorded 527 cases
[1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:11.260]  of persecution against Christians, compared to 447 cases in 2018. Hundreds of Christians were taken
[1:00:11.260 --> 1:00:17.340]  to concentration camps in North Korea over the past year, same as the year prior, and tens of
[1:00:17.340 --> 1:00:23.900]  thousands of Christians sit in gulags used for slave labor, similar to the Uyghur Muslims in
[1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:30.220]  China. The Chinese Communist Party surveils Christians across their country, forces Protestant
[1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:37.420]  churches to take down crosses from their interior and exterior, and even replaces the Ten Commandments
[1:00:37.420 --> 1:00:44.940]  with quotes from Mao and Xi Jinping, pushing for state worship. In Western societies, big tech
[1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:51.660]  companies, specifically Facebook, are moving their way toward total Christian persecution by banning
[1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:58.620]  the posting of Bible verses from BibleHub.com, similar to how the early Roman Catholic Church,
[1:00:58.620 --> 1:01:04.540]  and later the Holy Roman Empire, forbade the dissemination of the word of God, keeping the
[1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:11.260]  Holy Bible to themselves, to be falsely interpreted by their own high priests. Just as Christians
[1:01:11.260 --> 1:01:16.940]  were ruthlessly persecuted in the centuries following the death and resurrection of Christ,
[1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:22.140]  it seems this new millennium has a similar intolerance for those Christians that choose
[1:01:22.140 --> 1:01:28.460]  to follow His righteous light. So as global governments comes into fruition, God's people,
[1:01:28.460 --> 1:01:34.220]  whoever they are, wherever they may be, must come out of Babylon yet again, before they are
[1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:41.340]  compromised in the truth, forsake their faith, and are devoured by those beasts, those political
[1:01:41.340 --> 1:01:49.900]  systems that serve Satan. This is Brian Wilson with Infowars.com. All right, great job, Brian Wilson,
[1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:59.980]  stay with us. Infowars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance
[1:01:59.980 --> 1:02:06.620]  against tyranny. You built Infowars, you spread the word, you prayed for us, you bought the products,
[1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:12.620]  you called in, you made recommendations. Infowars is as much yours as it is mine, and that's why
[1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:17.980]  the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack,
[1:02:17.980 --> 1:02:22.380]  in many ways, we've become stronger. With Band-Aught Video, the redesigned Infowars,
[1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:29.020]  with all of our great crew, with documentary films, and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day,
[1:02:29.820 --> 1:02:35.260]  we are the resistance, you are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for
[1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:40.300]  you to continue to spread the word about it, and to continue for you to support, because
[1:02:40.300 --> 1:02:45.020]  this is something we built together. It's not just a national treasure, it's a treasure worldwide
[1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:49.020]  against the tyrants, and they know it, and they can't stand it. And as everything we talked about
[1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:52.540]  comes true, our credibility only goes up together. So I salute you all.
[1:02:52.540 --> 1:03:12.300]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:12.300 --> 1:03:22.780]  So, you can turn on MSNBC and CNN, and every host is saying, use the CIA and the military
[1:03:22.780 --> 1:03:27.020]  to crush Trump supporters. They're all terrorists. There's an enemy within.
[1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:32.460]  Tuna Tucker Carlson, he's covering it. More troops massing in DC, a purge of the military
[1:03:32.460 --> 1:03:38.700]  of conservatives. The pipeline's being cut off. The gas price is being exploded.
[1:03:38.700 --> 1:03:45.100]  All the reversals of Trump cutting the prices of prescription drugs.
[1:03:46.620 --> 1:03:49.420]  He paid the highest in the world. We're being ripped off by the establishment.
[1:03:49.420 --> 1:03:55.660]  It's not free market. It's all being reversed. Open borders, U.N. back in control with an
[1:03:55.660 --> 1:04:01.500]  executive order of our immigration system. Hundreds of thousands more refugees to be
[1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:08.620]  brought in by the U.N. This is what it is to be a captured occupied nation of the communist
[1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:15.740]  Chinese globalist green zone that is now DC. That's the occupied area the U.S. hasn't bagged at.
[1:04:16.620 --> 1:04:23.900]  Well, that's what this is here. And we see incredible lawlessness. So in that backdrop of
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:31.020]  the stack of articles I have here where current and former CIA calls for using counterinsurgency
[1:04:31.020 --> 1:04:37.340]  tactics. That means taking people's businesses away. It means killing them. It means arresting
[1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:43.580]  them. With all of that going on and this whole apparatus being turned inward on us as if it's
[1:04:43.580 --> 1:04:47.020]  supposed to intimidate us, I actually feel sorry for the globalists that actually kicked us off
[1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:52.620]  when they think they're about to. You talk about having a tiger by the tail. But okay,
[1:04:52.620 --> 1:05:02.060]  they take our kindness and restraint for weakness. Now on top of it, they're talking about drone
[1:05:02.060 --> 1:05:06.700]  striking people that don't wear masks because, you know, things would turn back on. The economy
[1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:10.380]  would come back if you'd just stay in your house and be non-essential and let your business go
[1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:16.540]  bankrupt and take that check. And Klaus Schwab says, though, he says no businesses with close
[1:05:16.540 --> 1:05:24.620]  contact ever are coming back. I'm going to play that clip next hour actually. This being put in
[1:05:24.620 --> 1:05:30.940]  a larger new report that I shot with Rob Do this morning and last night on this. Now the full
[1:05:30.940 --> 1:05:36.860]  videos on infowars.com, MSNBC hosts, suggests targeting COVID lockdown skeptics like domestic
[1:05:36.860 --> 1:05:44.700]  terrorists with drones. Remember, Obama said, hey, I'm pretty good at killing people. Yeah,
[1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:49.580]  you give the order of people get killed. You're so manly. It's so scary. It's so tough. But hey,
[1:05:49.580 --> 1:05:53.180]  you're black. So it's okay. It's like Tim Cook runs giant death camps in China. It's like,
[1:05:53.180 --> 1:05:56.540]  hey, dude, he's skinny. He hops around on the stage and he's gay. It's like, well,
[1:05:56.540 --> 1:06:01.740]  if he's running death camps, he's gay. Then that's a totally different thing. So let's go ahead here
[1:06:03.180 --> 1:06:09.500]  and play this MSNBC host. This idiot's name is saying that people that
[1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:15.420]  criticize the lockdowns of the mass will just kill us. Here it is. An MSNBC host suggested
[1:06:15.420 --> 1:06:21.180]  that Americans who criticize COVID lockdown should be treated as domestic terrorists and hit with
[1:06:21.180 --> 1:06:27.020]  drone strikes. And it barely even caused a ripple. Yeah, she actually suggested that.
[1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:32.380]  Nicole Wallace made the comments last week, but they haven't received one iota of the attention
[1:06:32.380 --> 1:06:40.380]  they deserve to take a look. There is until the end of April, a persistent threat of domestic extremism,
[1:06:40.380 --> 1:06:48.860]  domestic terrorism carried out in the ideology and around this belief that the election was fraudulent,
[1:06:48.860 --> 1:06:54.460]  that the COVID restrictions are unnecessary. All of those ideologies pushed by Donald Trump. But
[1:06:54.460 --> 1:07:00.700]  my question for you is around incitement. We had a policy and it was very controversial,
[1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:07.180]  it was carried out under the Bush years and under the Obama years of attacking terrorism at its root,
[1:07:07.740 --> 1:07:13.980]  going after and killing, and in the case of Amar al-Laki, an American, many American,
[1:07:13.980 --> 1:07:19.260]  with a drone strike for the crime of inciting violence, inciting terrorism. The way you root
[1:07:19.260 --> 1:07:25.100]  out terrorism is to take on, in the case of Islamic terrorism, kill those who incite it.
[1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:30.620]  So now they're literally comparing people who say, quote, COVID restrictions are unnecessary,
[1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:38.060]  to Anwar al-Laki, a propagandist for al-Qaeda, who was killed in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike.
[1:07:38.060 --> 1:07:43.420]  And that's not to say that al-Laki's killing was even legally justified. It wasn't. Essentially,
[1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:50.060]  he was executed for posting YouTube videos. Okay, so Paul's full video is at band.video
[1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:53.820]  and his band.video section. He's posting like three videos a day now. He's really turned the
[1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:58.780]  heat up. So great job, Paul. That full video is posted to band.video, but you just heard it,
[1:07:58.780 --> 1:08:04.060]  and it's everywhere. Former deputy director, current head of counterterrorism. All these guys
[1:08:05.580 --> 1:08:10.300]  are being quoted in here. I've read you the quotes about we've got to domestically kill people,
[1:08:10.940 --> 1:08:15.260]  and she's up there, this big warrior. She probably can't even load a gun. Probably never been in a
[1:08:15.260 --> 1:08:19.420]  fist fight, but she's like, it's time to start killing people. And they've got all these articles,
[1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:24.700]  I mean, literally hundreds of them. I can't even count them all. Major stories like Alex Jones
[1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:29.740]  and Roger Stone planned the capital attack. They need to be treated as insurgents and you kill
[1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:34.220]  insurgents. And I'm sitting there reading this. This doesn't scare me. It's like these people are
[1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:40.220]  nuts. We tried to have a rally against election fraud. We show up a couple hundred idiots out of
[1:08:40.220 --> 1:08:45.740]  a million breakthrough because the police were understaffed and have a riot and one cop dies
[1:08:45.740 --> 1:08:51.660]  two days later of a heart attack. They now admit it wasn't from the fire extinguisher and you guys
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:09:01.580]  call this the end of the world. Meanwhile, we've got this current Obama slash by administration
[1:09:01.580 --> 1:09:12.060]  official saying that Al Qaeda is on their side. That's Sullivan. There's no end to these people.
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:19.660]  Yeah, there's NPR treat domestic extremism as insurgency. Kill them. Wow, you guys are going
[1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:24.620]  to war with the biggest armed country in the world. Wow, that sounds like a good job.
[1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:29.980]  That sounds like that'll be real safe for people to carry it out. Let's take some calls from Frankie,
[1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:36.060]  Blake, Luke, Michael, Ken and Sal. I'm going to go to you real quick. Let's go to Ken in New Jersey.
[1:09:36.060 --> 1:09:44.860]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Today, I want to talk about building a brand new infrastructure
[1:09:45.660 --> 1:09:49.980]  to basically try to cancel out all the monopolies that the globalists have created.
[1:09:50.860 --> 1:09:56.380]  So I understand that info wars is, you know, you guys are doing a great job. I love your show.
[1:09:56.380 --> 1:10:00.460]  I listen almost every day. Yeah, well, I can barely stay on air. It's really easy pie in the
[1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:04.620]  sky to say we had to have all these big networks infrastructure. We've got the biggest infrastructure
[1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:10.300]  there is, even of Newsmax or anybody. And it's, it's, it's pitiful. I'm not complaining. I'm just
[1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:16.380]  saying theoretical stuff is always great. Yeah, I mean, I mean, the fact that you guys are the biggest
[1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:22.620]  for the patriotic movement, it's, it's insane. And the fact that all these mainstream media
[1:10:22.620 --> 1:10:28.220]  corporations hold the monopoly and nobody has, you know, basically created an infrastructure for
[1:10:28.220 --> 1:10:35.180]  patriots that's, you know, unheard of. So I feel like you have a voice, you know, other people
[1:10:35.180 --> 1:10:40.060]  in the patriotic movement have the money and the funds to create this infrastructure.
[1:10:40.700 --> 1:10:45.900]  I feel like we all need to pull our money together with individuals who would be responsible
[1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:51.900]  and financing this movement. Well, let me tell you what happens when somebody tries to build
[1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:55.260]  something like this. They start coming after you with lawyers, they threaten your family,
[1:10:55.260 --> 1:10:59.660]  and they cut your credit off. So most people actually won't touch freedom with a 10 foot poll.
[1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:04.860]  I appreciate your call. That's why we're in so much trouble. So you have to be ready to be in
[1:11:04.860 --> 1:11:09.100]  battle to stay on air and just hope people promote that you're on air to circumvent the sensors.
[1:11:09.660 --> 1:11:14.380]  Everything is the listeners. What I cover will end the globalist operation. It's the truth.
[1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:20.460]  But it only will do it if people by hand share the links, the articles, the videos, the information.
[1:11:21.180 --> 1:11:24.700]  And then if we had more infrastructure, we could be on more TV and radio stations
[1:11:24.700 --> 1:11:30.860]  and have more shows. But then that's like herding cats. Everybody's got different ideological ideas.
[1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:34.780]  I never tell my crew what to cover or do. I have general directions I want to go in.
[1:11:34.780 --> 1:11:37.260]  Then you end up having your other hosts want to tell you what to do.
[1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:42.380]  And so yeah, it's all theoretical stuff is all fine and dandy.
[1:11:44.460 --> 1:11:50.700]  I'm simply spending half my time trying to get money to pay to run this place. I mean,
[1:11:50.700 --> 1:11:58.460]  I crawl along, okay? I mean, crawl. And I'm not complaining. Just at least we can stay on the
[1:11:58.460 --> 1:12:04.780]  air for now. So if you want to see us do more, go buy books and films, go buy t-shirts, go sign up
[1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:10.220]  for auto ship, official 10% off on items you're going to want like DNA Force Plus, Ultra 12,
[1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:13.820]  vitamin mineral fusion, you sign up for auto ship, official 10% off the next order.
[1:12:13.820 --> 1:12:19.500]  And we hold back some of things that sell out. So you never sell out by signing up for auto ship.
[1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:24.460]  Yeah, but I mean, I've got three months of operating capital around this place.
[1:12:24.460 --> 1:12:29.420]  Can't expand with money like that. Okay. And so yeah, I've gotten these calls a lot over the years.
[1:12:29.420 --> 1:12:33.500]  Man, we need to fight. We need to build something. Boy, I sure as hell trying, brother.
[1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:37.180]  You hit my button. I'm not mad at you, but you just hit my button.
[1:12:37.740 --> 1:12:42.380]  I can't even launch a damn shopping cart. I can barely wipe my ass, man,
[1:12:42.380 --> 1:12:51.020]  because this country's falling apart. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:57.100]  I've got some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand
[1:12:57.100 --> 1:13:01.660]  in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[1:13:01.660 --> 1:13:08.060]  But here's the good news. Tumoric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation,
[1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:13.340]  so good for your immune system. And we've got two great tumeric formulas. One is body's ultimate
[1:13:13.340 --> 1:13:19.740]  tumeric formula that is a dried tumeric extract 95% humanoid. People love it. That's selling out.
[1:13:19.740 --> 1:13:25.020]  Despite that, it's still discounted and then for store.com. And then also selling out this week
[1:13:25.020 --> 1:13:30.540]  is our liquid tumeric extract is called liquid tumeric extract. People really love it. It's
[1:13:30.540 --> 1:13:35.580]  extremely strong as well. It's selling out and your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your
[1:13:35.580 --> 1:13:40.460]  body. It also funds the info war and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[1:13:40.460 --> 1:13:45.980]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and find so many other great
[1:13:45.980 --> 1:13:51.100]  items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the info war. God bless and good luck.
[1:13:52.300 --> 1:13:55.820]  So what's the most important part? Let's say the bulldozer running over the globalist. The
[1:13:55.820 --> 1:14:01.180]  treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but the fuel is
[1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:07.420]  paramount and that's my allegor. Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically
[1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:12.780]  work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average
[1:14:12.780 --> 1:14:16.700]  metabolic system metabolism of a human. Some people get 15 hours out of some people get about
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:20.780]  eight hours, but people take this people taking sports people cannot believe it's the best they've
[1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:27.100]  ever had because it's not high. Nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts, their
[1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:31.340]  post workouts, you can call us whatever you want. It's a total solution all around the best you're
[1:14:31.340 --> 1:14:36.940]  going to find. Turbo force without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together. It's
[1:14:36.940 --> 1:14:41.420]  like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:44.780]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body, your mind.
[1:14:44.780 --> 1:14:50.620]  It's a win-win 360 together infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:14:50.620 --> 1:14:56.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:20.620 --> 1:15:32.860]  I'm not mad at the last caller. He's absolutely right.
[1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:37.100]  We need networks and organizations that will tell the truth and lead the fight.
[1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:43.100]  That's why Brian Stelter and the globalists are saying shut down OAN, shut down Newsmax,
[1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:48.220]  shut down Tucker Carlson, shut down Alex Jones. And you saw as soon as Newsmax got attacked,
[1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:53.740]  they suddenly virtue signal and rolled over. And that's because these people will come after you.
[1:15:55.100 --> 1:16:00.220]  And so, yes, absolutely. We need to be on more radio stations. We need to be on more TV stations.
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:05.660]  We need to put up a fight. Here's the deal. I'll go to your calls. And Alex Jones here back live.
[1:16:06.860 --> 1:16:10.380]  We had this global awakening of the new world order, the child sex trafficking, you know,
[1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:16.940]  all of it, all this real stuff, the satanic heart of this thing. And then the Q movement came along
[1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:21.660]  three years ago and just said, I'm in charge. I'm the secret agent. People love something
[1:16:21.660 --> 1:16:27.500]  esoteric talking into a hole in the wall. And it told them everything was fine and we were invincible.
[1:16:30.300 --> 1:16:33.420]  And so there was this bandwagon effect of everyone feeling invincible,
[1:16:34.140 --> 1:16:38.140]  but they didn't do anything. And then when Trump got it stolen from him, well,
[1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:44.060]  then that deflates everybody and they feel defeated. And the Q leader said, just go home.
[1:16:44.060 --> 1:16:49.260]  It's all over. Enjoy the last few years of fun. You were basically in an online Dungeons and Dragons game.
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:57.740]  Well, I talk about all that because I knew it was coming. You mean to have our archivists get
[1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:01.580]  a hundred clips and be saying, listen, the president surrounded. He's outnumbered. They're
[1:17:01.580 --> 1:17:06.220]  going to steal the election. It's going to be a landslide emergency, emergency. I'm like,
[1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:12.860]  Joe, you don't duck the Q level. Actually, people walk to me like, in DC, Joe, you don't know the
[1:17:12.860 --> 1:17:18.060]  power of Q. You're not in the group. And I would just feel like they'd have this crazy look like
[1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:23.260]  I'm with the president. I'm with the secret group. And I'm like, dude, we're in trouble.
[1:17:23.260 --> 1:17:26.460]  I know all the inside stuff, emergency. Well, believe me, we're surrounded
[1:17:27.340 --> 1:17:33.100]  only by waking up. We have a shot. And so I just deal with this. They're going to cut your power
[1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:36.620]  off. They're coming for your guns. They're going to start a physical civil war. They're going to
[1:17:36.620 --> 1:17:43.820]  purge the military. I told you before the sixth, they were going to purge the military. I know what
[1:17:43.820 --> 1:17:51.340]  a globalist takeover is. We're getting our asses handed to us. And I know it's popular to tell
[1:17:51.340 --> 1:17:57.420]  people pie in the sky stuff like Pachennik was doing yesterday. All I see is our country getting
[1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:02.380]  its ass kicked up one side and down the other. So as I start seeing different, I'll tell you,
[1:18:02.380 --> 1:18:07.020]  but I'm not going to piss down your back and tell you it's raining. Never did it before. Never
[1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:16.380]  going to do it. We have to totally reject the globalist, Hollywood, all of it. The whole thing
[1:18:16.380 --> 1:18:24.060]  is poison. Reject it. That's what beats it, not fantasy land. Clarence in Wisconsin, where your
[1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:29.100]  governor just said, I don't care if the Supreme Court and the state legislature outlawed my
[1:18:29.100 --> 1:18:35.340]  legal mask lock down. It's going to continue. I got a new law, a new law, a new law. Welcome to
[1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:41.260]  the airwaves. Hey, Alex. Yeah, he needs to be recalled too. We're all tired of him, but
[1:18:41.260 --> 1:18:45.660]  living in a blue state now, I'm not happy with it whatsoever, Alex. But hey, buddy,
[1:18:46.220 --> 1:18:53.420]  I've had this conversation here coming up here with many from veterans to citizens to family.
[1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:57.980]  You know, I want you to think about this. And if there's veterans that are military active now
[1:18:57.980 --> 1:19:03.580]  and veterans from the past, you need to hear what I've got to say. You know, Alex, in World War
[1:19:03.580 --> 1:19:12.220]  II, we lost 407,000 men and women warriors, and they were fighting against fascism, imperialism,
[1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:21.500]  and certainly, what am I trying to say, the Italians, the fascism, okay, the Korean War,
[1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:28.620]  54,000 men and women killed, fighting against communism, Vietnam, 58,000 plus killed, fighting
[1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:36.860]  against communism, Iraq, Afghanistan, almost 7,000 killed, fighting terrorism, Alex. Middle East,
[1:19:38.540 --> 1:19:43.180]  this is a joke, that war, and we don't need any more of those, but we cannot forget our MIAs and
[1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:49.020]  our POWs, not to mention Arlington Cemetery, Normandy, France, all the men and women buried
[1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:54.300]  over there, too. You know, and I got a question for you, Alex, after my little spiel here.
[1:19:54.300 --> 1:19:57.740]  Do you think, I believe, and many people have given the answer on yes,
[1:19:58.300 --> 1:20:02.620]  have our men and women in the past that fought against all of these isms? Have they died in
[1:20:02.620 --> 1:20:07.100]  vain, Alex? No, I don't think they've died in vain, because that's what I wanted to start
[1:20:07.100 --> 1:20:10.540]  the segment with, but I get so mad at it and get to it. But the globalists are doing a super
[1:20:10.540 --> 1:20:16.220]  illegal, incredibly unpopular, and out of control. So if we just hold the course and expose the great
[1:20:16.220 --> 1:20:20.780]  reset, and the fact this is all planned, which is starting to happen with Laura Ingram, and
[1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:25.820]  Tucker Carlson, and Rush Limbaugh, I hope he hangs on for another 20 years, we need everybody,
[1:20:25.820 --> 1:20:31.020]  and all of you, if we just expose this as a plan, and expose that most of the medical workers say
[1:20:31.020 --> 1:20:36.140]  COVID's a fraud, but they censor them, then their whole house of cards comes down. They didn't
[1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:40.940]  launch this big desperate lockdown because they're strong. They're not trying to apperge the military
[1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:46.780]  and martial law and having the CIA on TV illegally say they're going to operate domestically and
[1:20:46.780 --> 1:20:52.220]  take on the people. That's not the sign of strong people. That's the strong of weak crooks who are
[1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:56.780]  being blackmailed by the Chinese communists to do their bidding. And so as it looked for me,
[1:20:56.780 --> 1:21:01.260]  it's very negative personally. For info wars, we're in the front lines of a fight.
[1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:06.060]  And so I'm up the front lines. I live in the front lines. I live deep behind enemy lines.
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:10.300]  So I can tell folks what's going on. Okay, because I've been swallowed up by the New World Order.
[1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:14.860]  I'm on the inside. I don't even want to be. I am literally in the belly of the whale here.
[1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:20.220]  I can tell you what's going on. And I just want to let listeners understand how serious it is.
[1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:25.660]  If you speak out and say no, and everybody starts speaking out in grocery stores and church,
[1:21:25.660 --> 1:21:29.740]  everywhere else, then we turn the tide. It's all information war. It's all truth.
[1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:34.700]  If you don't, then all the horrible things I'm going through, we're going to reach you. Okay.
[1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:39.740]  I'm just telling you, I'm already out ahead of you guys. And I've already seen what's coming. And
[1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:44.460]  it's not nice. It's not fun. And so God bless you and I appreciate your call, Clarence.
[1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:50.380]  It's the best of times, worst of times. Blake in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:56.620]  Yeah, Alex, you have been right about the purge, purge of the military. You've been talking about
[1:21:56.620 --> 1:22:00.700]  that for as long as I've been listening to you, you know, going back 15 or 20 years.
[1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:07.820]  So that brings me to what I wanted to talk about. So Operation Trust, it's still going,
[1:22:07.820 --> 1:22:13.500]  Q is still going. It's just taking other names, other forms. But I mean, we got people out there
[1:22:13.500 --> 1:22:17.580]  that basically saying the same thing as Q and they're saying that the, you know, this counter
[1:22:17.580 --> 1:22:22.700]  revolut or counter, uh, who is going to happen or whatever. Trump's still the president. He's
[1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:26.540]  well, he is really still the president. But I mean, they're saying like Pachynic yesterday
[1:22:26.540 --> 1:22:32.060]  was saying he's still in charge down in, down in, down in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. He's got,
[1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:36.860]  he's got his own White House there and all this BS that he was spreading yesterday. Now,
[1:22:36.860 --> 1:22:41.580]  this is just baloney. Now, here's the thing. If there's really a counter coup going on,
[1:22:41.580 --> 1:22:45.580]  I mean, if the military is really getting ready to arrest everybody and they're getting ready
[1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:51.740]  to put Trump back in charge and rest Biden, if this is really happening, why would they be telling
[1:22:51.740 --> 1:22:57.660]  it to us? I don't want them to tell it to us. If it's real, keep that damn mouth shut. They don't
[1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:03.900]  need to be telling you. The military at the top is run by globalist completely now.
[1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:09.100]  And you, you, you see the secretary of defense saying we're going to purge the Trump supporters
[1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:16.540]  out of the military. They have a 60 day stand down where the main job is searching the background
[1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:23.740]  of all your soldiers, airmen and Marines and to purge them. So again, world governments out in
[1:23:23.740 --> 1:23:27.420]  the open, vaccines killing you out in the open, great reset out in the open, none of its head,
[1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:34.940]  but everybody's like, I heard on an HN, I heard a Q code 97 QL4 DL9er. I don't listen to Alex Jones.
[1:23:34.940 --> 1:23:39.420]  I don't listen to documents. I don't look at facts. I don't look at the bill about to take my guns.
[1:23:39.420 --> 1:23:44.060]  We're winning. We're winning every, because people can't believe we're getting our ass kicked.
[1:23:46.860 --> 1:23:49.020]  But we're actually going to win it again. When we come back.
[1:23:50.380 --> 1:23:54.540]  You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity.
[1:23:54.540 --> 1:24:00.620]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians
[1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:05.340]  of this world. But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the
[1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:12.460]  planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to
[1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:18.700]  the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA vaccines,
[1:24:18.700 --> 1:24:27.420]  which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses where they inserted
[1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:36.220]  into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines
[1:24:37.020 --> 1:24:41.420]  and then remember you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:45.500]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting
[1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:49.340]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:23.020]  A new URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[1:25:23.580 --> 1:25:31.500]  But the new website is the resistance.video. The resistance.video. They're trying to block us
[1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:37.580]  because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new URL that links right to band.video
[1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:41.820]  and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the
[1:25:41.820 --> 1:25:47.900]  suppressed information is that the resistance.video. Share the link. The resistance.video. The

[1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:19.500]  I know it's scary to be going into a world government.
[1:27:22.940 --> 1:27:25.660]  You know, something Max Geiser said about before he went live with my producer.
[1:27:26.300 --> 1:27:31.980]  He said, I don't want to talk about U.S. politics. Well, neither do I because
[1:27:31.980 --> 1:27:38.380]  these presidents come and go, but the bureaucracy and the Pentagon now saying it wants to have the
[1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:43.260]  CIA kill citizens, and that it's with the Democrats and the ADL and Southern Prairie
[1:27:43.260 --> 1:27:50.620]  Law Center, it's just disgusting and illegal and conservatives are fetishizing the military.
[1:27:51.180 --> 1:27:55.900]  When, yeah, a lot of our sons and daughters and aunts and uncles and fathers and mothers were in
[1:27:55.900 --> 1:28:00.700]  the military and were great people. But that America is gone. We're in world government now.
[1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:08.780]  And only facing that we're in world government, corporate world government, the Gulag Archipelago,
[1:28:08.780 --> 1:28:13.340]  the digital casino Gulag that Max Geiser has talked about, or Matt Drudge talked about,
[1:28:14.780 --> 1:28:21.900]  the internet Gulag, only admitting that. And then ending partisanship, because I get Trump
[1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:27.100]  was a populist insurrectionist, but it got put to the side, only reaching out to the average
[1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:31.020]  Democrat saying you think world government, you think China having an upper hand, you think the
[1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:36.460]  shutdown of the dollar, you think Wall Street being exempt from taxes, you think all of this
[1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:41.980]  is really empowering the people and it's some idealistic system. No, it's not.
[1:28:44.380 --> 1:28:49.980]  And so it's now more important than ever that sentinels of news like info wars be on the air.
[1:28:50.940 --> 1:28:55.580]  And I know a lot of people didn't want to hear me when I told you Q was total lies run by the
[1:28:55.580 --> 1:29:00.780]  bad guys. And I know you didn't want to hear me when I said all those things, but it wasn't to be
[1:29:00.780 --> 1:29:07.260]  negative. It was to be truthful about how serious the situation is. So I want to get Max Kaiser on
[1:29:07.260 --> 1:29:13.420]  who's been a very successful famous stockbroker author researcher hosted TV shows on BBC and Al Jazeera
[1:29:13.420 --> 1:29:20.140]  and RT and the US and everywhere else and host big international shows as we speak,
[1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:24.300]  about 10 years ago, more than 10 years ago, but he really hammered it 10 years ago,
[1:29:24.300 --> 1:29:29.100]  about silver and the silver short squeeze being the key to bringing down this global
[1:29:29.100 --> 1:29:34.780]  assault on Garky and these corrupt hedge funds. And now I was like a couple of weeks ago, I said,
[1:29:34.780 --> 1:29:38.860]  watch silver will be bigger than GameStop and sure enough, it was because I said Max Kaiser
[1:29:38.860 --> 1:29:44.860]  called this, but a profit is always way ahead of their time. And he also called the first big
[1:29:44.860 --> 1:29:49.580]  run up of Bitcoin. He was on a year ago called the next big run up of Bitcoin. This time they
[1:29:49.580 --> 1:29:56.460]  didn't push it down as far. So he's here to give us his expert analysis on first big picture,
[1:29:56.460 --> 1:30:02.860]  please sir, about where we are, the derivatives, the overhang, the bubbles, who's in good positions,
[1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:09.740]  who isn't and just where we are and what individuals can do because I agree with you that
[1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:13.740]  talking about Trump at nauseam, the Democrats want to do that. They want to just keep us back in
[1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:17.420]  Trump land so that we're not looking at what's currently happening and they want the diversion
[1:30:17.420 --> 1:30:22.460]  of this impeachment trial coming up when all of that now is in the rearview mirror. Is that what
[1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:30.380]  you're getting at? Right. Hey, great to be back. Great to see you. I think a couple of things
[1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:36.460]  are very interesting right now. The Wall Street bets phenomenon of the last week or so is really
[1:30:36.460 --> 1:30:41.980]  important, really interesting. It exposed a lot of things definitively that needed to be exposed.
[1:30:41.980 --> 1:30:48.380]  And then of course, the silver squeeze came along and that is also very interesting.
[1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:55.740]  And of course, Bitcoin continues to be dominate the story, but going to Wall Street bets for a
[1:30:55.740 --> 1:31:02.220]  second. So this is a group of Reddit traders that figured out that there was one particular stock
[1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:07.660]  that was vulnerable to having a lot of people suddenly buy it and create what's called a short
[1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:15.180]  squeeze because the hedge funds had sold short stock. But what this revealed, Alex, I think,
[1:31:15.820 --> 1:31:21.740]  was the existence now definitively, we can talk about it, of naked short selling.
[1:31:21.740 --> 1:31:28.860]  Naked short selling is when hedge funds sell non-existent stock. They counterfeit sell orders.
[1:31:28.860 --> 1:31:34.380]  So in the case of GameStop, there was something like two times as many shares that existed
[1:31:34.380 --> 1:31:41.660]  entirely in the company's stock portfolio was sold on the market. So that was naked.
[1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:45.980]  And a lot of people have talked about this and said it doesn't exist. And the reason it's important
[1:31:45.980 --> 1:31:49.900]  is that it also dovetails into the silver story. So we've been saying now for years,
[1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:55.580]  the reason why silver doesn't really move the way it should is because there's an incentive by banks
[1:31:55.580 --> 1:32:02.460]  and Wall Street and central banks to keep the price of silver and gold as cheap as possible
[1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:07.740]  relative to the dollar. And they do it using naked short sales. They literally sell, in the
[1:32:07.740 --> 1:32:16.460]  case of silver, five to 10 times annual silver production in one morning. In one morning selling
[1:32:16.460 --> 1:32:21.420]  spree, they will sell 10 times annual silver production in these naked short sales or counterfeit
[1:32:21.420 --> 1:32:27.980]  sales to just bang the price down. And by the way, I said 10 years ago, you've been coming on for
[1:32:27.980 --> 1:32:33.260]  15 16 saying that Bob Chapman was always hammering that this is now mainstream back when you
[1:32:33.260 --> 1:32:38.380]  talked about it. Nobody talked about naked short selling of silver to again take paper
[1:32:38.380 --> 1:32:42.300]  that they didn't take delivery of silver and use that to artificially lower the price,
[1:32:42.300 --> 1:32:48.140]  which then allows them to hide inflation, correct? Well, it allows them to keep the support of the
[1:32:48.140 --> 1:32:54.460]  dollar and to keep gold and silver away from people's investment capital because if gold and
[1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:59.340]  silver were to really reflect the number of money that's been printed, and something like 30 or 40
[1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:03.180]  percent of all the money ever been printed in American history has been done so in the last
[1:33:03.180 --> 1:33:08.220]  few years, right? So the money printing is off the charts. What would be conservatively right now?
[1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:17.740]  Without the market manipulation, gold would right now be in the 27 to $2,800 per ounce
[1:33:17.740 --> 1:33:22.460]  level to be on the conservative side. That's, that's where it would be without the fake selling.
[1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:29.820]  It's around 1800. So it'd be a thousand dollars higher. Silver would be already 60 $70 an ounce
[1:33:29.820 --> 1:33:36.620]  without this manipulation going on. And so the game stop in Wall Street bets very blatantly
[1:33:36.620 --> 1:33:42.300]  exposed massive fraud going on with in this case, Melvin Capital. That's a hedge fund.
[1:33:42.300 --> 1:33:46.620]  When Melvin Capital had unrealized losses of a couple of billion dollars, guess who bailed them
[1:33:46.620 --> 1:33:52.380]  out? Citadel Capital. Citadel Capital bailed out Melvin Capital with money that they them
[1:33:52.380 --> 1:33:57.340]  themselves got in a bailout from the federal government last year. Who orchestrated that
[1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:01.420]  bailout? Moe could be one of their board members. Ben Bernanke, former Fed Chairman,
[1:34:01.420 --> 1:34:06.780]  sits on the board of Citadel Capital. Who bailed out Melvin Capital? Who covered those
[1:34:06.780 --> 1:34:14.700]  exposure to the short squeeze, as it's called, from the Reddit crowd? And now there's a lot of
[1:34:14.700 --> 1:34:19.660]  coordination going on with Robinhood and all these other trading apps all working together,
[1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:27.980]  which is called its anti-competitive behavior, which is technically illegal to clamp down on
[1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:34.140]  anybody who threatens the sanctity of these hedge funds. And the hedge funds and the folks who run
[1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:41.900]  the major funds like Citadel are, as Eric Holder said back in 2008, Alex,
[1:34:41.900 --> 1:34:46.060]  when under the Obama administration, he came up with what's called the Holder Doctrine,
[1:34:46.060 --> 1:34:51.100]  which states categorically that banks are above the law, that banks are too big to jail,
[1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:55.100]  that they enjoy a special status. They're systemically important to the economy, therefore
[1:34:55.100 --> 1:35:02.220]  a national security item. And then he revolving door goes into that law firm in DC, where he gets
[1:35:02.220 --> 1:35:07.420]  paid himself tens of millions of dollars, they get paid hundreds of millions to then represent
[1:35:07.420 --> 1:35:13.260]  those very same banks. Exactly. So it's a revolving door between the public sector and the private
[1:35:13.260 --> 1:35:18.380]  sector. And like Ben Bernanke is a great example. He went from being Fed Chairman to sitting on the
[1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:25.180]  board of Citadel. We had Janet Yellen, who left being the Fed Chairman, who gave speeches to
[1:35:25.180 --> 1:35:31.820]  Goldman Sachs and others for, we know, $800,000 she made in speaking fees. And now she's back at
[1:35:31.820 --> 1:35:38.780]  Treasury. So it's a revolving door. They go back and forth. She should recuse herself from many of
[1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:43.820]  these proceedings because she's been compromised. But that's not going to happen either.
[1:35:43.820 --> 1:35:48.140]  All right, Max, we got to go to break. We've got you into the next hour. Really happy to have you
[1:35:48.140 --> 1:35:57.180]  here. You're at orangepilldailydose.com. And you're at swanbitcoin.com. Also at Orangepill. You'll
[1:35:57.180 --> 1:36:04.620]  tell us about that when we come back. But I just want to ask million foot view, 35,000 foot view,
[1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:09.820]  one inch view, just in general, where the world is. I know it was volatile 15 years ago and we
[1:36:09.820 --> 1:36:15.180]  overvalued. Now where is it? And all the hyperinflation behavior and all the government's printing
[1:36:15.180 --> 1:36:20.060]  crazy and no one is even worried about price earnings ratios. And it just, it has a feeling
[1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:24.620]  of why am I republics in Bobway to me. But you're really the expert on this. And so I want to get
[1:36:24.620 --> 1:36:29.740]  your take on that. And obviously, I should get back into silver and gold. I mean, I already did that
[1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:34.940]  in the last six months. I've been out of it for four or five years. But I could smell it and see
[1:36:34.940 --> 1:36:39.820]  it coming. But how high is it going to go? And yes, again, I'm not against Bitcoin folks. I just
[1:36:39.820 --> 1:36:44.220]  get confused by the plethora of offerings. We'll talk about some of that with Max Kaiser as well.
[1:36:44.220 --> 1:36:52.940]  Tell folks he's on. We'll be right back. We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply,
[1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:58.220]  secure your own safe source of food supply sale. It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest
[1:36:58.220 --> 1:37:02.860]  price for high quality food. You're going to find at info or store.com. The subsection is prepared
[1:37:02.860 --> 1:37:07.420]  with Alex.com. And it's all these globalists do this. And as they hoard the food and as they prepare,
[1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:12.700]  you need to understand that you need 25 year foods to rely on the last 25 years, one month,
[1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:16.300]  three months, six months, one year supplies. And it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[1:37:16.300 --> 1:37:20.620]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of. And you know, you're getting good food
[1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:24.300]  at a very good price. And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:30.540]  in this goes to us to fund our operation. So prepare with Alex.com or info wars store.com.
[1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:34.620]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration. It's all there.
[1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:38.540]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more. It's time to start getting
[1:37:38.540 --> 1:37:42.300]  prepared. It starts with self defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible
[1:37:42.300 --> 1:37:46.060]  food. It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll let in the end.
[1:37:46.060 --> 1:37:52.540]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:58.540]  Other dictionaries have somewhere else. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[1:37:58.540 --> 1:38:05.500]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[1:38:05.500 --> 1:38:10.540]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:15.420]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:20.700]  COVID more dumbest thing they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people
[1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:27.260]  would be dead just eight months ago within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million if you count
[1:38:27.260 --> 1:38:32.620]  all of the people that died of other things. We're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are real
[1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:37.180]  numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:41.340]  never come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the
[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:47.500]  planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with
[1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:55.260]  and survive. There are thousands of ideologies out there. Hundreds of different political systems
[1:38:55.260 --> 1:39:00.620]  and most of them are funded by the globalist. Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the
[1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:05.500]  zeitgeist. That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down. I didn't invent
[1:39:05.500 --> 1:39:10.860]  all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity.
[1:39:10.860 --> 1:39:15.740]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back. And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[1:39:16.620 --> 1:39:21.660]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light
[1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:26.700]  in the dark of the night. That's since chills up my spine. So whatever you do, continue to support
[1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:31.580]  yourself and info wars by buying the great products and info wars store.com by spreading the articles
[1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:36.060]  by spreading the videos and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and
[1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:41.260]  the world for peace and discernment for myself and the whole info wars family. I want to thank

[1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:55.580]  and I salute you. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful
[1:39:55.580 --> 1:40:00.700]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this
[1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:07.100]  degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com.
[1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:12.780]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood
[1:40:12.780 --> 1:40:18.780]  pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[1:40:18.780 --> 1:40:25.100]  reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:31.900]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[1:40:31.900 --> 1:40:38.940]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[1:40:38.940 --> 1:40:45.580]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a
[1:40:45.580 --> 1:40:55.740]  friend family member or yourself at info wars store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:10.860]  It's the Alex Jones show and legendary investor and Bitcoin captain.
[1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:18.460]  Max Geyser is our guest. Let me throw this out there right now. It is more important than ever to
[1:41:18.460 --> 1:41:23.260]  keep independent media operations like info wars on air and it is you the listeners that keep us
[1:41:23.260 --> 1:41:28.140]  on air. We don't have the big sponsors. We don't have the big sugar daddies. None of that. We are
[1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:34.620]  supported by viewers and listeners like you and then I go out and I fight and I do all sorts of
[1:41:34.620 --> 1:41:38.700]  things behind the scenes just like it came out that I funded Trump rally against election fraud.
[1:41:38.700 --> 1:41:44.060]  They go oh you funded the insurrection. No they stole that from us and stole our victory.
[1:41:44.700 --> 1:41:49.100]  That was a horrible defeat what happened to the Capitol. 200 people out of a million
[1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:53.660]  being suckered into acting like idiots. But the point is you notice she turns out yeah okay
[1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:58.460]  Jones did fund some of that. That's where your money is going. I ain't a lot of money to fight
[1:41:58.460 --> 1:42:02.220]  and prosecute this war so I want to thank you all for your support plus these are great products

[1:42:52.300 --> 1:42:56.780]  support in keeping us on the air. But the way this works is every time we get a surge of money that
[1:42:56.780 --> 1:43:02.700]  comes in then the money stops coming in and it's just like I got to explain to folks we need funds
[1:43:02.700 --> 1:43:06.940]  to stay on air. Without you we cannot be here and be this independent voice in such a critical time
[1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:11.100]  they're trying to shut everybody down and we're fighting hard to stay on air. Going back to Max
[1:43:11.100 --> 1:43:17.020]  Kaiser again famous stock broker, TV host, newsman. Big picture for me and then next
[1:43:17.020 --> 1:43:23.900]  time we'll get into the technicals and Bitcoin and all of it. I mean you as just an American citizen
[1:43:23.900 --> 1:43:28.540]  how would you break down where the globe is? What's happening in the leadership of the system?
[1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:34.780]  What Wall Street is about to do? How the great reset obviously ties into that to kill Main Street
[1:43:34.780 --> 1:43:41.020]  and like the doubling of profits of big tech during the lockdown. I mean to me this is that
[1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:48.780]  super predatory Wall Street takeover you've been warning of. Yeah that's true. Every bank around
[1:43:48.780 --> 1:43:55.580]  the world is just printing lots of money and they do it in a coordinated fashion and it's about
[1:43:55.580 --> 1:43:59.980]  debt monetization. They print money and then they buy it back and they put it back on the balance sheet
[1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:07.340]  of the central bank and they do it really for only one reason and that is to keep the major banks
[1:44:07.340 --> 1:44:12.220]  in these countries from having to officially declare insolvency. All the major banks in the US
[1:44:12.220 --> 1:44:18.860]  and the UK and Europe are technically insolvent but to keep the capital structure of those banks
[1:44:18.860 --> 1:44:25.820]  alive the central banks create tons you know trillions and trillions of fiat money and they
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:32.300]  cycle it through the banks and the banks are able to continue operating and paying huge bonus money
[1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:39.260]  and huge salaries and but meanwhile outside of the banks the velocity of money which is to say
[1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:45.100]  how fast the money is going through the economy is almost at absolute zero. Small businesses
[1:44:45.100 --> 1:44:51.660]  are being destroyed. The cost of stuff like education, healthcare, transportation, all the
[1:44:51.660 --> 1:44:57.580]  vital services that are part of the economy the costs are skyrocketing. And Max slow down there
[1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:02.300]  we got time explain velocity of money and the fact that while they're giving themselves all this
[1:45:02.300 --> 1:45:06.540]  money none of it's trickling down because they did that on purpose obviously with a lockdown
[1:45:07.260 --> 1:45:12.860]  so explain what's happening there with money velocity. Right so you have it okay you have
[1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:18.780]  an insolvent bank and they need they need all the money they can get to keep their capital
[1:45:18.780 --> 1:45:24.220]  structure or their bond structure from having to declare insolvency. So the bank prints up lots of
[1:45:24.220 --> 1:45:29.580]  money and they say hey we're the bank we need a the central bank we need to print all this money
[1:45:29.580 --> 1:45:36.700]  because he to stimulate the economy to make the economy go faster. And so the way that the the
[1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:43.340]  machinery of that works is that essentially the central bank creates the money and it goes to
[1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:47.820]  the banks okay and the banks are in charge of distributing that money but the banks don't
[1:45:48.460 --> 1:45:53.580]  they keep it because they can't afford to lend it out because if they did they would have to
[1:45:53.580 --> 1:46:00.780]  declare insolvency. So the velocity of money is at a standstill it doesn't doesn't go into the economy.
[1:46:00.780 --> 1:46:08.700]  And so because the because the money doesn't get into the economy you don't have small businesses
[1:46:08.700 --> 1:46:13.660]  are not able to grow. So what happens is that government will say well small businesses aren't
[1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:19.820]  growing so what we need to do is to stimulate the economy by printing more money. So they print
[1:46:19.820 --> 1:46:24.620]  more money and then they give it to the banks to distribute and the banks keep it. And the whole
[1:46:24.620 --> 1:46:29.100]  thing is repeated over and over again now for 20 years. And then Main Street goes bankrupt in the
[1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:34.060]  final phase and they finally buy everything up and that's the final bailout vertical integration.
[1:46:35.820 --> 1:46:41.260]  It eventually ends up being owned by one or two players you know we've called this in the past
[1:46:41.260 --> 1:46:48.780]  neo feudalism right. So it's like only a few players end up owning 890 percent of the economy
[1:46:49.980 --> 1:46:57.100]  and everyone else is living you know like a pauper living like a you know a surf and this
[1:46:57.100 --> 1:47:01.580]  is what we're seeing more and more of this. You know a lot of the gains that were made over the
[1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:06.060]  past couple of decades pulling people out of poverty. We've heard that expression many times.
[1:47:06.060 --> 1:47:10.860]  Well now those people are going right back into poverty because the gains were completely artificial
[1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:17.660]  due to just an illusion that comes when you have a lot of money printing and it tends to seep out
[1:47:17.660 --> 1:47:22.700]  here and there. But now that it's all drying up and the banks are still there gobbling up all
[1:47:22.700 --> 1:47:30.380]  that liquidity. We're going into the situation where you have 90 percent of the wealth is controlled
[1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:36.860]  by a few oligarchs a few folks and everyone else is really really scrambling. So let me ask you this
[1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:40.780]  because you I'm not kissing your ass it's true. You called this on my show 15 16 years ago that
[1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:45.660]  this is where it was going at this certain point. They admit Klaus Schwab admits we're using the
[1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:49.660]  lockdown to consolidate and vertically integrate. It's for the earth we're going to lower the carbon
[1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:54.380]  footprint they fly around in private jets. John Kerry does that's their excuse for doing this.
[1:47:55.100 --> 1:47:59.420]  But clearly they're accelerating their vertical integration and this road to surf them
[1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:06.220]  and this high tech feudalistic system that you've talked about and it's moving so quickly. How the
[1:48:06.220 --> 1:48:09.820]  hell do they think they'll get away with it. I guess they just think the media will confuse
[1:48:09.820 --> 1:48:13.820]  people claiming there's racism and then we'll all fight with each other and that's the distraction
[1:48:13.820 --> 1:48:19.260]  because this is incredibly predatory. Right. They think they get away with it or they get
[1:48:19.260 --> 1:48:23.420]  away with it with collusion. Right. So all the banks around the world collude. They're
[1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:30.300]  anti competitive. They collude with each other. And now so here's I guess the difference between
[1:48:30.300 --> 1:48:35.100]  twenty twenty one and maybe the years leading up to twenty twenty one. Alex would be that
[1:48:35.820 --> 1:48:41.180]  the all of this money that's being printed by the World Reserve currency the U. S. dollar
[1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:46.940]  and is held by banks all over the world. Well these banks all over the world are concerned
[1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:51.260]  that eventually all this money printing will result in some kind of hyperinflation. So they've
[1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:57.340]  been stockpiling gold and they have been doing some deals with each other bilateral deals outside
[1:48:57.340 --> 1:49:05.180]  of the U. S. dollar. So at some point maybe probably in twenty twenty one countries like China Russia
[1:49:05.180 --> 1:49:11.260]  and others will decide that they really don't want to hold dollars anymore because they would
[1:49:11.260 --> 1:49:17.580]  prefer to just rely on their gold. And to some extent I believe we can talk about Bitcoin in
[1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:23.020]  this context. And as Christine Lagarde has mentioned Bitcoin is an escape valve for these
[1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:27.820]  countries to escape the U. S. dollar. And so she's laid out that she meant that to kind of be a
[1:49:27.820 --> 1:49:32.700]  warning. But she what she did was kind of tell everybody what how to how to escape. Okay. We
[1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:36.060]  have two minutes to break. Stay there. I want you to unpack that the next hour the next couple
[1:49:36.060 --> 1:49:40.300]  segments in detail. But clearly China is coming out with its own digital currency now.
[1:49:40.300 --> 1:49:46.620]  But just to finish that thought briefly it's all those dollars end up coming back to the U. S. and
[1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:52.060]  then you see the inflationary spike. Then you see prices got double and triple and quadruple
[1:49:52.060 --> 1:49:57.100]  that start over. I don't have to start over. So I mean so once this process hits once they start
[1:49:57.100 --> 1:50:01.420]  phasing out of the dollar then that's when hyperinflation happens. A lot of the dollars over
[1:50:01.420 --> 1:50:06.940]  the years shipped overseas you know manufacturing went to China and World Reserve currency is a
[1:50:06.940 --> 1:50:12.300]  dollar. But now we're at a phase where all those into a deglobalization phase. All these countries
[1:50:12.300 --> 1:50:18.700]  are basically de dollarizing. And so at some point probably in 2021 we're going to one wake up one
[1:50:18.700 --> 1:50:24.060]  day and like four or five trillion U. S. dollars are going to be sent back to the U. S. and then
[1:50:24.060 --> 1:50:28.780]  suddenly our purchasing power will get be demolished. And so what are you doing here in
[1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:35.180]  Bitcoin. Right. Well there's three ways to protect yourself. Bitcoin gold and silver. Now the
[1:50:35.180 --> 1:50:39.020]  problem with gold and silver as we've been talking about for a number of years is that
[1:50:39.020 --> 1:50:43.420]  the prices are completely in the control of these same people who are doing all the money
[1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:49.980]  printing. Having said that I think that they they will do OK in this environment but nowhere
[1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:57.020]  near as good as as Bitcoin because Bitcoin from here you know you're talking about a 40 X return.
[1:50:57.020 --> 1:51:00.940]  You're talking about move to four hundred thousand five hundred thousand even Citibank
[1:51:00.940 --> 1:51:05.740]  has a has a price prediction for Bitcoin of six hundred thousand dollars per coin. It's currently
[1:51:05.740 --> 1:51:10.700]  at thirty seven thousand. So I mean that's the fastest horse in the race as Paul Tudor Jones
[1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:16.060]  called it. It's the one thing you can't confiscate. It separates will stay there. I'll give you this.
[1:51:16.060 --> 1:51:22.140]  I was at Bilderberg with you 12 years ago and you let you just laid it all out the future
[1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:26.540]  and you were eating wine and drinking wine and eating a steak and you're just like Jones listen
[1:51:26.540 --> 1:51:32.540]  to me listen to me. I'm telling you this and I'm like whatever. I'm not going to. All right. All right.
[1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:35.660]  Max geysers here with us our number three straight ahead.
[1:51:39.180 --> 1:51:43.180]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How are you doing Alex.
[1:51:43.740 --> 1:51:47.100]  Man I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time brother. How are you.
[1:51:47.100 --> 1:51:52.860]  I love you man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA for I love it. I've been using it
[1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:57.500]  quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that
[1:51:57.500 --> 1:52:04.300]  it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkel has cited
[1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:11.580]  is an ion of four similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[1:52:11.580 --> 1:52:17.820]  So people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force we went out and
[1:52:17.820 --> 1:52:22.860]  looked at these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription
[1:52:22.860 --> 1:52:26.380]  but the doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product in
[1:52:26.380 --> 1:52:30.780]  them. It's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top
[1:52:30.780 --> 1:52:34.460]  brands together and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[1:52:40.140 --> 1:52:44.380]  The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[1:52:44.380 --> 1:52:49.260]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United
[1:52:49.260 --> 1:52:53.340]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip
[1:52:53.340 --> 1:53:00.220]  under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos group and
[1:53:00.220 --> 1:53:05.020]  Cloud Schwab all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:10.700]  Foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 20 30. It's here and only gets worse like being fed
[1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:17.740]  into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with
[1:53:17.740 --> 1:53:22.940]  realizing it's spiritual battle good versus evil and stopping abortion. We must start
[1:53:22.940 --> 1:53:28.460]  valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not
[1:53:28.460 --> 1:53:35.980]  disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare
[1:53:35.980 --> 1:53:45.660]  our basic God given human rights now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:59.020 --> 1:54:04.700]  All right Max Keiser is our guest here and let's get into some Bitcoin talk right now
[1:54:04.700 --> 1:54:09.100]  that in the big picture of the economy silver goal what he expects to happen with the lockdowns
[1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:13.740]  that are obviously designed to consolidate power and lower the velocity of money so inflation
[1:54:13.740 --> 1:54:17.100]  doesn't happen while the globalist consolidate power and they're able to buy everything up.
[1:54:17.100 --> 1:54:21.900]  Please let the dollar. What about the issue of Bitcoin that a very small percentage own the majority
[1:54:21.900 --> 1:54:27.900]  of it and so that we end up being back in the same area. Do we know how distributed Bitcoin is,
[1:54:27.900 --> 1:54:35.900]  the original Bitcoin? Yeah, you'd have, first of all, of the 21 million that a lever be created
[1:54:35.900 --> 1:54:41.100]  is estimated that about 4 million have been lost completely. I know I've lost a few over the years
[1:54:41.100 --> 1:54:44.460]  and I know many people that have also. I think you loaded some of my laptop. Who the hell knows
[1:54:44.460 --> 1:54:51.420]  where they are? Well, yeah, that's another story. It's unconfiscatable. Yes, great story in Germany
[1:54:51.420 --> 1:54:56.380]  today. Somebody was apparently the government was going to confiscate their Bitcoin, but
[1:54:56.380 --> 1:55:03.260]  he can't remember the past phrase. So the government's out of luck. And that's the story.
[1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:10.460]  It's unconfiscatable. But the distribution of Bitcoin, it does have some folks are you see
[1:55:10.460 --> 1:55:15.980]  some concentrations, but that's changing all the time and people like a micro strategy just put
[1:55:15.980 --> 1:55:20.940]  a billion dollars into it. And you see the number of whales, people who have a thousand Bitcoin,
[1:55:20.940 --> 1:55:27.500]  that's a new at a new all time high. I'm not I don't think that's not a really worry in terms of
[1:55:28.620 --> 1:55:34.540]  what you can't. Nobody has greater access to how Bitcoin operates from the person who has
[1:55:34.540 --> 1:55:39.500]  $10 in Bitcoin or the person who might have a billion dollars in Bitcoin. Either one of those
[1:55:39.500 --> 1:55:43.820]  people, they cannot change the protocol. So you don't get power. If you have a lot of Bitcoin,
[1:55:43.820 --> 1:55:48.540]  you can't change the protocol no matter how much Bitcoin you have. It's equal for everybody in that
[1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:53.500]  sense. The monetary policy of coins coming out every 10 minutes, that's immutable, never changes.
[1:55:53.500 --> 1:55:57.500]  Nobody can impact. So what do you make of Elon Musk a month or so ago saying, you know, me wanting
[1:55:57.500 --> 1:56:01.660]  to invest in Bitcoin, it was a beautiful girl, you know, on a rear end being a Bitcoin. I mean,
[1:56:01.660 --> 1:56:07.340]  what was he saying there that he really wants to invest in it? He likes it like a lot of smart
[1:56:07.340 --> 1:56:13.100]  people like it because holding fiat money is going to guarantee you're going to lose 15,
[1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:18.380]  20% a year in purchasing power. But it doesn't matter if Elon bought the $10 billion worth
[1:56:18.380 --> 1:56:24.220]  of Bitcoin today, he would not be able to influence Bitcoin in any way. Nobody can influence Bitcoin
[1:56:24.220 --> 1:56:31.900]  that the protocol that works it, the network, is set. You know, nobody can interrupt that.
[1:56:31.900 --> 1:56:37.420]  It's just not, it's within the realm of possibility. So it doesn't matter if there's
[1:56:37.420 --> 1:56:41.580]  a large concentration of this person or that person because they don't give you any power.
[1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:46.300]  Unlike in the fiat money system, if I have a lot of money, I can get a lot changed. I can go to
[1:56:46.300 --> 1:56:51.340]  Washington and I can influence on lobby Washington and I can get a law changed or I can, I can create
[1:56:51.340 --> 1:56:55.740]  a new law. And that's one of the reasons why the fiat money world has become so corrupt is that
[1:56:55.740 --> 1:57:00.380]  once you make a lot of money, Jamie Diamond or somebody else can go to Washington, they can lobby
[1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:06.380]  and they can take Glass-Steagall away, they can make it easier for them to do stuff that was
[1:57:06.380 --> 1:57:10.380]  illegal to begin with, right? With Bitcoin, you don't have that issue because nobody ever,
[1:57:10.380 --> 1:57:14.940]  it changes it, it's set forever. It's not going to change. So you don't get power
[1:57:14.940 --> 1:57:20.460]  with owning any additional Bitcoin. So that's not really an issue. You mentioned these other
[1:57:20.460 --> 1:57:25.260]  alternative projects that are out there that people talk about. Only every single one of those
[1:57:25.260 --> 1:57:29.900]  projects has what we would call a single point of failure. There's, there are people involved,
[1:57:29.900 --> 1:57:34.940]  there's a headquarters, there's, there's somebody in charge and that's a vulnerability. That's what
[1:57:34.940 --> 1:57:41.180]  that, you could get shut down. Only Bitcoin of all the projects is unique in that there's nobody
[1:57:41.180 --> 1:57:46.860]  at the center of it. There's no, the network has just repeated thousands and thousands of
[1:57:46.860 --> 1:57:51.500]  times all over the world and it's like guerrilla warfare. You knock out one area. It doesn't
[1:57:51.500 --> 1:57:57.180]  matter because it's already operating in another area and that's why Bitcoin is unique and you
[1:57:57.180 --> 1:58:01.500]  can't compare it to any of these other protocols. That's why I would say never put, never look at
[1:58:01.500 --> 1:58:07.180]  any of these other protocols or projects or coins because they're not as secure. They're all vulnerable
[1:58:07.180 --> 1:58:11.660]  and if you're going to get into this, why not just go with the one that's the best? It's, it,
[1:58:11.660 --> 1:58:15.980]  that it's, uh, why hasn't somebody else launched something with all the great, like usually the
[1:58:15.980 --> 1:58:20.140]  first thing is at the best, other better things come out and I'm not, I've studied it some, but
[1:58:20.140 --> 1:58:23.980]  it does look like the original Bitcoin is the most secure. That's, that's, that's a strange thing
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:29.180]  that something, you know, 15 years old is, is, is still the best today. Max Kaiser, we're back in
[1:58:29.180 --> 1:58:36.060]  60 seconds to answer that question and talk about the incredibly crazy waters that planet earth is
[1:58:36.060 --> 1:58:44.700]  cruising into. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, your host, newswars.com, infowars.com and band.video.
[1:58:48.700 --> 1:58:53.900]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less
[1:58:53.900 --> 1:58:59.260]  than the entire world. Info Wars has stand alone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at
[1:58:59.260 --> 1:59:05.260]  hundreds of stations picking us up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real
[1:59:05.260 --> 1:59:11.260]  issues of global populism, the right to self-defense and exposing the anti-human globalist death
[1:59:11.260 --> 1:59:18.060]  agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at band.video. They're not allowed to be
[1:59:18.060 --> 1:59:24.140]  on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's so precious because the censorship expands
[1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:29.740]  to everyone, which it is now with AI monitoring, controlling what you can stay and do. It's going
[1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:35.260]  to be the OACs, blackband.video and the now redesigned infowars.com that become more and more
[1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:41.260]  important, which they are. And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us,
[1:59:41.260 --> 1:59:45.820]  sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now because they're coming after
[1:59:45.820 --> 2:00:01.900]  everyone. So spread the word now.
[2:00:05.660 --> 2:00:11.100]  All right, Max Kaiser is the first guy to ever get serious with me concerning Bitcoin. And he's
[2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:15.660]  like, listen, you need to investigate. You look into it like 12 years ago. I'd heard of it. And
[2:00:15.660 --> 2:00:20.540]  here we are all these years later. And he came on like a year ago and he said, Bitcoin's going
[2:00:20.540 --> 2:00:25.100]  to explode again. It has. They tried to push it down, but not as much as last time. And I'm not
[2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:29.100]  here giving financial advice. I'm not here telling people what to get. Max Kaiser didn't pay me to
[2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:35.900]  come on. You know, the show, I had to really beg him to come on. But Bitcoin's great. Okay, let's
[2:00:35.900 --> 2:00:43.100]  talk about it. Whatever. But I really want his big picture view on gut level. Everybody always says
[2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:47.500]  the bubble's coming to an end. And now they locked us down to kill the velocity of money and expanded
[2:00:47.500 --> 2:00:51.740]  the bubble even more. So we're now in a false reality. But at a certain point, this thing's
[2:00:51.740 --> 2:00:55.740]  going to cave in. So we'll get back into Bitcoin in a minute. But but Max Kaiser getting early on
[2:00:55.740 --> 2:01:01.980]  the on show show. What do you make of who's winning the currency inflation war? Or is it already one
[2:01:01.980 --> 2:01:10.700]  unified global group in the US and China and the lockdowns and big tech doubling its profits under
[2:01:10.700 --> 2:01:17.820]  the lockdown and just Americans accepting and Canadians and folks in Europe accepting staying
[2:01:17.820 --> 2:01:22.780]  locked in their houses for a year. I mean, this is and then a supermarket doesn't wear masks or
[2:01:22.780 --> 2:01:27.100]  says you don't have to so the whole world freaks out. I mean, we're already in the dystopia is my
[2:01:27.100 --> 2:01:32.780]  view. So you predicted the dystopia was coming now that we're in the dystopia. What's your view of it
[2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:36.940]  and what's coming next? Like like like we're in the river of tyranny. What's around the bend or
[2:01:36.940 --> 2:01:43.740]  what's over the waterfall Max Kaiser? Right? Well, I think the difference really is the difference
[2:01:43.740 --> 2:01:52.300]  between deglobalization and globalization. So we had a period of globalization for really 30 years,
[2:01:52.300 --> 2:01:57.500]  particularly when China came in through the World Trade Organization under Clinton,
[2:01:57.500 --> 2:02:03.260]  they brought China in and we entered into this period of globalization. And so there's tremendous
[2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:09.100]  symbiotic relationship, if you will, between China and the US, right? We sent them their jobs
[2:02:09.100 --> 2:02:14.380]  and they sent us cheap goods. And even though wages in the US were flat, the goods, you know,
[2:02:14.380 --> 2:02:18.700]  the prices for stuff from China like electronics and clothes and things like that were falling.
[2:02:18.700 --> 2:02:23.100]  So people in America had a sense that their quality of life wasn't going down just because
[2:02:23.100 --> 2:02:27.180]  their wages were going down because the price of stuff was actually getting going down faster.
[2:02:27.980 --> 2:02:38.300]  But starting with 2016, the message was deglobalization. And this means that countries are
[2:02:38.300 --> 2:02:46.300]  more now going to be competing with each other in competing with each other on technology,
[2:02:46.300 --> 2:02:52.220]  for example, China has their own technological standards with G5 and other technological
[2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:56.700]  areas. They're breaking away from the globe. They're not trying to create a globalized world.
[2:02:56.700 --> 2:03:01.980]  They're trying to create their own standards with technology and also in financial services,
[2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:06.380]  you know, with Jack Ma over there at Alibaba. He's got Ant Group. That combined
[2:03:07.260 --> 2:03:12.700]  is the biggest financial institution in the world. You've got like the Robin Hood of China,
[2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:19.420]  which is just now becoming a big company is servicing a billion users. So China is really,
[2:03:19.980 --> 2:03:26.220]  I think, feeling that it can break away from this globalized economy and really assert itself in
[2:03:26.220 --> 2:03:32.380]  a more of a deglobalized way and take control, take command of the global economy. And we see
[2:03:32.380 --> 2:03:38.060]  that elsewhere. You know, countries are separating. Now, what this does is it removes a lot of the
[2:03:38.060 --> 2:03:43.180]  economies of scale for these economies. And so we see that right now in the commodities market.
[2:03:43.180 --> 2:03:48.060]  So the commodities markets, commodity prices are starting to go higher because of this
[2:03:48.060 --> 2:03:52.140]  deglobalization and everyone essentially putting in the same order for the same thing
[2:03:52.140 --> 2:03:56.460]  because they're competing with each other. So we're entering into a secular bull market in
[2:03:56.460 --> 2:04:01.820]  commodities. All the commodities, agricultural, precious metals across the board, they're starting
[2:04:01.820 --> 2:04:08.700]  to enter into this secular bull market. That means that the ability for the central banks to
[2:04:08.700 --> 2:04:15.820]  hide this inflationary trend by buying back its own paper, monetizing its own debt,
[2:04:15.820 --> 2:04:21.100]  is going to become increasingly more difficult and probably impossible. And we know it's
[2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:24.860]  impossible because they're introducing something called negative interest rates. And a negative
[2:04:24.860 --> 2:04:29.340]  interest rate. And by the way, you predicted that on the show 10 years ago, hammered it five years
[2:04:29.340 --> 2:04:35.740]  ago. Now it's officially here been here a few years now. Simply insane. So it's growing. So
[2:04:35.740 --> 2:04:40.140]  $18 trillion worth of negative interest rates around the world. And that trend is growing in
[2:04:40.140 --> 2:04:44.860]  the Bank of England is now saying they're going to introduce negative interest rates. So this is
[2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:50.460]  an admission. This is like waving the white flag. This is like saying we've run out of ideas. And
[2:04:50.460 --> 2:04:55.260]  now we're just going to take money right out of people's bank accounts to service the debts of
[2:04:55.260 --> 2:05:00.620]  our banks. Like I explained earlier, the banks are insolvent, but the government's in bed with
[2:05:00.620 --> 2:05:04.940]  them and they need to just shovel cash at them. And instead of just printing money and giving it
[2:05:04.940 --> 2:05:09.660]  to them, they're going to let them just take it directly from people's savings accounts and pensions
[2:05:09.660 --> 2:05:15.900]  et cetera, through a negative interest rate. So that's really the beginning of wholesale theft,
[2:05:15.900 --> 2:05:22.780]  you know, organized global banking theory using this. We have this organized UN Klaus Schwab
[2:05:22.780 --> 2:05:28.060]  Bill Gates, I don't know, not a fan of lockdown, clearly to consolidate the power to bankrupt
[2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:34.460]  Main Street, the crime of the century, the crime of the millennia. To me, how do you see that
[2:05:34.460 --> 2:05:40.700]  crime going? And if they're successful, what's the next phase? I mean, my God, if we don't stand up
[2:05:40.700 --> 2:05:46.140]  for ourselves here, there's no checks and balances by state government, by courts. I talk to state
[2:05:46.140 --> 2:05:50.540]  government. I talk to governors. These dudes don't know how to find their ass, Max. I'm not even
[2:05:50.540 --> 2:05:55.100]  thinking of myself that smart. You know, 20 times more than I do about finance and banking and
[2:05:55.100 --> 2:06:00.940]  stock markets. I talk to governors. They don't know anything, brother. They go, Oh, I talked to my
[2:06:00.940 --> 2:06:06.540]  broker. I mean, governors don't know what's going on. And if there's this level, then how much will
[2:06:06.540 --> 2:06:12.460]  the financial establishment abuse people till we're all homeless? Right. So the game plan, it's
[2:06:12.460 --> 2:06:19.340]  very seductive because they will start to talk about MMT, modern monetary theory and universal
[2:06:19.340 --> 2:06:25.420]  basic income. And they're going to forgive all the student debts, right? So they're going to seduce
[2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:30.620]  people with the money printing, which is what we've seen in countries like Venezuela and other
[2:06:30.620 --> 2:06:35.180]  countries where the government, all they do is they try to appease folks by printing money. So
[2:06:35.180 --> 2:06:41.740]  this is the US is now saying with MMT and universal basic income and forgiving of all these debts.
[2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:47.660]  They're just saying like, okay, we're going to forget about having an economy based on a meritocratic
[2:06:47.660 --> 2:06:52.860]  capitalist free market system where a capital formation is key. We're just going to try to
[2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:58.380]  keep the mob away from our doorstep by giving them as much paper money as we possibly can.
[2:06:58.380 --> 2:07:06.140]  And of course, the value that paper money goes down. And geopolitically, I'm not just
[2:07:06.140 --> 2:07:13.100]  kind of throwing this back in to do it. But there are countries now in the geopolitical scene
[2:07:13.100 --> 2:07:19.900]  that are figuring out that with Bitcoin, they have a way to escape this. It's just come out that
[2:07:19.900 --> 2:07:25.260]  the country of Ukraine is now going to use atomic energy, their atomic energy to actively
[2:07:25.260 --> 2:07:30.620]  mine Bitcoin for the country of Ukraine. And that's on top of several other countries who are
[2:07:30.620 --> 2:07:37.100]  either mining or hoarding Bitcoin as a strategic asset to protect themselves against a world that
[2:07:37.100 --> 2:07:45.100]  goes full Venezuela. It's true. You said this years ago that they'll finally just start firing
[2:07:45.100 --> 2:07:49.500]  money at people and Google lock money and video game money for how long you're online. But it's
[2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:55.020]  all devalued. It's all like coupons. It's all crap. And now even conservative events have strippers
[2:07:55.660 --> 2:08:00.540]  firing money at crowds and everywhere is the image of money being fired. And the average
[2:08:00.540 --> 2:08:05.260]  person really believes this is valuable. Even though it doesn't always hallmark the Titanic
[2:08:05.260 --> 2:08:15.340]  going under. It's just what happens when you have political gridlock for 20, 30 years and allow
[2:08:16.300 --> 2:08:23.020]  bankers and corporations to drain the system of the equity of the capital. And you're left with
[2:08:23.020 --> 2:08:30.380]  nothing else left that you can do. They mean obviously the time to have a day of reckoning
[2:08:30.380 --> 2:08:36.300]  and to let me put into a different context. I think you'll like this. We have seen over the
[2:08:36.300 --> 2:08:43.020]  history the gold vigilantes and the bond vigilantes. And let me explain. When you have a gold standard
[2:08:43.020 --> 2:08:49.260]  obviously your economic parameters are set by this gold standard. If a one country gets into
[2:08:49.260 --> 2:08:53.660]  too much debt versus the other countries it has to be resolved using gold. And that's the way it
[2:08:53.660 --> 2:09:02.460]  was done for 100 years and it was fine. Then we went to what's basically you know a fiat money
[2:09:02.460 --> 2:09:07.980]  standard and a paper standard and a U.S. dollar standard. And this was what tying the global
[2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:13.340]  economy together. And during that period of time we had what were called the bond vigilantes.
[2:09:13.340 --> 2:09:18.620]  And this was very big during the Clinton administration. When we recall Hillary Clinton
[2:09:18.620 --> 2:09:24.460]  was trying to pass a lot of free health care for all. And the bond market on Wall Street
[2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:31.660]  crashed the bond market in 93 as a way to let the Washington know that you can't pay for this.
[2:09:31.660 --> 2:09:36.060]  We're not going to let this happen. It's inflation. This is the inside smart stuff here.
[2:09:36.060 --> 2:09:39.420]  It's why we love you. We're back in a few minutes. Hold that thought. We'll continue
[2:09:39.420 --> 2:09:44.860]  on to talk about what unfolded the past and know the future with Max Kaiser. You can find his new
[2:09:44.860 --> 2:09:50.460]  website when we come back. I've got some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has
[2:09:50.460 --> 2:09:54.700]  sold out because people understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever
[2:09:54.700 --> 2:10:00.540]  to boost your body's natural defenses. But here's the good news. Turmeric acts in very similar
[2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:05.500]  ways and is so good for inflammation. So good for your immune system. And we've got two great
[2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:11.660]  turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract 95 per
[2:10:11.660 --> 2:10:16.540]  super humanoid. People love it. That's selling out. But despite that, it's still discounted
[2:10:16.540 --> 2:10:22.300]  at infowarstore.com. And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract. It's
[2:10:22.300 --> 2:10:27.500]  called liquid turmeric extract. People really love it. It's extremely strong as well. It's selling
[2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:32.940]  out and your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body. It also funds the info war and

[2:11:03.820 --> 2:11:08.940]  the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year foods that will lie at the

[2:11:35.900 --> 2:11:39.580]  getting prepared. It starts with self defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with
[2:11:39.580 --> 2:11:43.660]  horrible food. It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll let in the end.
[2:11:43.660 --> 2:12:03.900]  You're listening to the alex jones show. Monday through friday.
[2:12:03.900 --> 2:12:21.500]  I'm a father of four children. I got a great family, great wife. And I
[2:12:22.940 --> 2:12:26.940]  am addicted to information. I mean, I used to like to watch movies and stuff. My wife's like,
[2:12:26.940 --> 2:12:31.660]  What are you doing reading the tablet while we're watching a movie? And I'm like watching Max
[2:12:31.660 --> 2:12:36.540]  Kaiser. I'm reading hundreds of articles a day scanning over hundreds of articles a day. I'm
[2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:41.580]  addicted to it. And I can tell you Max Kaiser is not steering you wrong when he's telling you
[2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:48.860]  that we're on top of a cascade of time bombs and bubbles within bubbles. And I know as an audience
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:54.380]  you already get this, but the feeling of not even dread. I don't have a feeling of dread.
[2:12:55.420 --> 2:12:59.180]  I used to have that now I have the feeling like once you go over the edge of the cliff or once
[2:12:59.180 --> 2:13:02.700]  your car runs off the road, you're like going down a cliff. It's happened to me once 200 foot
[2:13:02.700 --> 2:13:09.180]  cliff. Thank God it rolled five times. I didn't die. But a tornado blew me off the road. My dad
[2:13:09.180 --> 2:13:13.100]  was in the car with me. It almost killed him. But once you're kind of over the side of the
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:17.740]  cliff, you're not even scared anymore. It's like, wow, I'm a fly to the air in an SUV of 300 foot,
[2:13:17.740 --> 2:13:22.700]  200 foot down a cliff. There's that feeling Max that we're over the cliff. I mean, is that an
[2:13:22.700 --> 2:13:27.660]  accurate statement that we're not sure how far down it is or what the terrain is? We just flew
[2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:31.820]  off the highway or have we not run off the highway yet? And what are those scenarios? Because you
[2:13:31.820 --> 2:13:37.740]  got cut off by the break. Go ahead. As far as flying off the cliff, that would be starting in
[2:13:37.740 --> 2:13:43.740]  1971. When we closed the gold window, we entered an experiment never been tried before that no
[2:13:43.740 --> 2:13:48.620]  currency in the world would be backed by anything like gold or anything like solid like that. It
[2:13:48.620 --> 2:13:53.260]  would all be backed by other currency. So we entered this period. And the only thing keeping
[2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:57.180]  it together, you know, to continue where I left off there, the only thing keeping it together
[2:13:57.180 --> 2:14:03.740]  was this idea that the bond market would not be fooled if any one of the country decided to go
[2:14:03.740 --> 2:14:11.660]  hyperinflation. And so that's what kept things in check for a couple of years. But starting with
[2:14:11.660 --> 2:14:15.900]  Alan Greenspan, but then picking up with Ben Bernanke over there at the Federal Reserve,
[2:14:15.900 --> 2:14:21.740]  we entered a new period where the bond vigilantes were destroyed because the central bank
[2:14:21.740 --> 2:14:28.540]  put out told the market that no matter how many bonds are being issued, how many treasury bonds
[2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:32.940]  are being issued, or even junk bonds and corporate bonds, no matter how many are issued, we will
[2:14:32.940 --> 2:14:41.740]  stand as a buyer. We will buy everything and everything all day to make sure that there's
[2:14:41.740 --> 2:14:46.300]  never going to be any interruption to what's happening in that corporate sector and that
[2:14:46.300 --> 2:14:54.860]  banking sector in terms of their desire to grab ever greater pieces of the overall economy
[2:14:54.860 --> 2:15:02.940]  without any competition, right? The bond market stood against conglomeration. But then the central
[2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:07.500]  bank decided that they would reinvent themselves as assistant to the conglomeration. That's why
[2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:12.220]  Ben Bernanke sits on the board of Citadel, a hedge fund. And that's what came out during the
[2:15:12.220 --> 2:15:18.700]  GameStop scandal just this past week, was that this hedge fund is owned by Citadel, the Melbourne
[2:15:18.700 --> 2:15:24.620]  Capital. And they're all playing a rigged game. And they're counterfeiting sell orders on the
[2:15:24.620 --> 2:15:29.020]  exchange, just like they counterfeit silver sell orders. And just like they counterfeit U.S.
[2:15:29.020 --> 2:15:35.740]  Treasury bonds, it's a huge counterfeiting scam. And the Fed does it. But so does the ECB in Europe,
[2:15:35.740 --> 2:15:40.140]  the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan is probably the biggest counterfeiter of them all.
[2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:44.940]  And that will work together. You got cut off, though, at the break. You were getting into
[2:15:44.940 --> 2:15:49.100]  how when Hillary wanted the free health care thing, how the bond market said no.
[2:15:50.300 --> 2:15:57.420]  So in 1993, Clinton administration, Hillary was very big on free health care. And then
[2:15:57.420 --> 2:16:04.940]  Robin Reuben, I believe, was at Treasury at the time. And they staged essentially this bond collapse
[2:16:04.940 --> 2:16:11.420]  to scare the Clintons away from doing anything like that. And there was a famous quote from Bill
[2:16:11.420 --> 2:16:16.300]  Clinton, who said, when he dies, he wants to come back as the bond market, because the bond
[2:16:16.300 --> 2:16:24.060]  market has all the power. And at that time, that was true. But within 10 years, the bond market
[2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:30.300]  has lost all of its power, because the central bank is now sitting on literally trillions and
[2:16:30.300 --> 2:16:35.820]  trillions of dollars worth of junk bonds that they bought back from Wall Street. So everything is
[2:16:35.820 --> 2:16:41.340]  into one giant consolidation now. And so of course, by logic, it's not going to consolidate us,
[2:16:41.340 --> 2:16:46.380]  say we're not essential, and make us join to the ever hive while it destroys all competition,
[2:16:46.380 --> 2:16:52.380]  while annihilates small farms, while it cuts off energy, everything to make it more powerful,
[2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:54.700]  even though it's the thing the black hole destroying everything.
[2:16:54.700 --> 2:17:01.340]  I'll give you a great example of this. The American company, Tiffany, the jeweler,
[2:17:01.980 --> 2:17:09.180]  was recently bought by a European luxury brand, LVMH, and they used, how did they buy Tiffany's?
[2:17:09.180 --> 2:17:15.420]  They borrowed money from the European central bank at 0% interest to buy an American company,
[2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:21.420]  Tiffany's, and now it's a European company. So the central bank was funding a hostile raid
[2:17:21.420 --> 2:17:27.900]  of an American company with 0% money. So yeah, now they own something like
[2:17:27.900 --> 2:17:31.340]  an enormous amount of the global luxury market is owned by one person.
[2:17:31.340 --> 2:17:32.140]  And if you can buy-
[2:17:32.140 --> 2:17:38.140]  That is beyond huge. Explain that to people, because the US used to do this for US power,
[2:17:38.140 --> 2:17:43.020]  which was a big enough problem. But now it's EU, it's China, and it seems like the US is
[2:17:43.020 --> 2:17:47.820]  being bought up. We're not, but we're losing power. Why have the globalist decided that it's the end
[2:17:47.820 --> 2:17:52.060]  of the American century in all these CFR articles? Why are they so obsessed with that?
[2:17:54.540 --> 2:18:00.380]  Well, I think they want to appear like they have an interest in saving America's interest,
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:06.940]  but clearly they don't. It's not, it's a, you know, it's the globalists, right? I mean,
[2:18:06.940 --> 2:18:14.780]  this is a phrase that can sound, you know, as a fringe idea, but nevertheless,
[2:18:14.780 --> 2:18:21.020]  you've got a cadre of powerful people in different countries who have access to central banks,
[2:18:21.020 --> 2:18:24.620]  and there's 0% money to buy out. Well, they call themselves globalists, Max. You know,
[2:18:24.620 --> 2:18:27.260]  the New York Times says it's anti-semitic. What's that to do with anything? They just
[2:18:27.260 --> 2:18:30.460]  throw that out there. I mean, the globalists call themselves globalists.
[2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:38.060]  Right. So, like when, like a Davos, for example, you know, a world economic forum,
[2:18:38.060 --> 2:18:42.700]  what is that all about? It's like a convention of globalists. It's a convention of predatory
[2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:49.740]  buyers of private equity. You know, it's another phrase that describes this group of folks,
[2:18:49.740 --> 2:18:53.660]  private equity. Private equity, back when I was on Wall Street in the 80s, it was called
[2:18:53.660 --> 2:19:01.020]  corporate rating, or a green mail with people like Carl Icahn of that day, and Ted Turner and
[2:19:01.020 --> 2:19:07.100]  others were the raiders, corporate raiders, and then they became activist investors, and now
[2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:12.220]  they're private equity. Mitt Romney, by the way, has made his bones in private equity, but they're
[2:19:12.220 --> 2:19:18.300]  able to buy companies, strip the assets, take huge profits for themselves, fire a lot of people,
[2:19:18.300 --> 2:19:24.940]  destroy the pension accounts. I mean, that's kind of a funny example, but some of the funny
[2:19:24.940 --> 2:19:28.940]  things stick in my head. The company of Twinkies, you know, the company that makes Twinkies in New
[2:19:28.940 --> 2:19:33.580]  York, they were a subject of a billion-dollar leveraged buyout by a private equity group.
[2:19:33.580 --> 2:19:37.740]  They bought the entire Twinkie company. They fired everybody. They destroyed the pensions,
[2:19:37.740 --> 2:19:42.380]  and then they relaunched as a stripped-down operation, and the people who leveraged that,
[2:19:42.380 --> 2:19:46.140]  who did the deal, you know, became billionaires, but all the workers were fired and the pensions
[2:19:46.140 --> 2:19:51.740]  were destroyed. So that's just a typical deal. Then we see billions and billions, hundreds of
[2:19:51.740 --> 2:19:57.740]  billions of dollars with these private equity deals all the time, funded with zero percent money.
[2:19:57.740 --> 2:20:04.860]  That's the key, and that's what I call interest rate apartheid. If you're part of the Davos crowd,
[2:20:04.860 --> 2:20:11.100]  you get interest rates for you. They charge a zero. If you're on an American Express card or
[2:20:11.100 --> 2:20:16.700]  Visa card, you're being charged, what, 16, 17 percent, which is a huge difference from that
[2:20:16.700 --> 2:20:22.780]  and zero. And here's another very interesting question. Since the beginning of the Greenspan
[2:20:22.780 --> 2:20:28.860]  era, that is to say the end of the Volcker era, when interest rates were over 20 percent on the
[2:20:28.860 --> 2:20:35.740]  10-year Treasury bond, they've come all the way down to, let's call it, one percent or less. How
[2:20:35.740 --> 2:20:41.020]  come, and if you're a private equity... Stay there. We're going to get to the answer on the other side.
[2:20:44.220 --> 2:20:49.820]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first-ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now
[2:20:49.820 --> 2:20:56.060]  available at InfoWarsStore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health
[2:20:56.060 --> 2:21:01.580]  world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation
[2:21:01.580 --> 2:21:07.900]  and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god
[2:21:07.900 --> 2:21:13.820]  Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan
[2:21:13.820 --> 2:21:19.180]  people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[2:21:19.180 --> 2:21:25.100]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill
[2:21:25.100 --> 2:21:31.180]  by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including,
[2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:37.740]  but not limited to, German Kamamil, organic Skolkapp, and Balarian root. We do expect to
[2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:43.900]  sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:21:45.260 --> 2:21:50.220]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let
[2:21:50.220 --> 2:21:56.620]  that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating from the United
[2:21:56.620 --> 2:22:02.940]  States, and it spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They were desperate. They admitted
[2:22:02.940 --> 2:22:08.220]  their own publications. They didn't know what to do. And so they put out 80 million fake ballots,
[2:22:08.220 --> 2:22:14.300]  violated state law, and stole it better than death. And now they're coming after the president,
[2:22:14.300 --> 2:22:18.540]  they're coming after you, they're coming after me. They're shutting everybody off the internet,
[2:22:18.540 --> 2:22:22.460]  they're trying to totally censor us. And that's why InfoWars is still in the fight,
[2:22:22.460 --> 2:22:26.860]  because we knew this was coming. We told you this was coming. We were the first main target
[2:22:26.860 --> 2:22:32.700]  that we're still on air at infowars.com and newswars.com and band up video. Without your word
[2:22:32.700 --> 2:22:36.220]  of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay on air. So while

[2:23:31.900 --> 2:23:35.820]  unless literally everybody gives it five stars. So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much
[2:23:35.820 --> 2:23:40.780]  everybody gives it five stars. That may be one or two people. Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee
[2:23:40.780 --> 2:23:49.420]  only available at infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:49.420 --> 2:24:06.860]  Some heads are going to roll. What's gonna happen? Literally, we wake up homeless.
[2:24:06.860 --> 2:24:15.740]  From enemies, born and domestic. It's Alex Jones. Who was the founding father? I forget.
[2:24:15.740 --> 2:24:23.500]  Was it Thomas Jefferson? I forget. Instead, if we ever let central banks control the issuance
[2:24:23.500 --> 2:24:28.780]  of currency and credit, our grandchildren will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers
[2:24:28.780 --> 2:24:33.740]  conquered. And so now I've been talking to Max Kaiser more than 15 years. I've watched what he
[2:24:33.740 --> 2:24:39.020]  warned of and others warned of come true, just like they said it would. And now we're here in this
[2:24:39.020 --> 2:24:44.060]  La La Land wonderland where the banks go, by the way, stay in your house, wear a mask forever,
[2:24:44.060 --> 2:24:49.420]  but we don't. Because this is how we implode the economy. So there's not too much inflation.
[2:24:50.060 --> 2:24:57.100]  Well, we live like kings on giant private estates, 50,000 acres, 20,000 acres, 100,000 acres, 20
[2:24:57.100 --> 2:25:02.780]  bedrooms, helicopter pads, hundreds of, you know, hookers, whatever they want, little kids, you
[2:25:02.780 --> 2:25:09.580]  name it. This is total Marie Antoinette on steroids. This is this is just over the top.
[2:25:09.580 --> 2:25:17.020]  And so Max Kaiser, getting back to you, a famous stockbroker, Bitcoin leader, all of it,
[2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:24.060]  not trying to scare people. But how long can this go? And if you predicted this phase of zero
[2:25:24.060 --> 2:25:30.860]  interest rates for the establishment, high interest for us, this gulag casino model,
[2:25:31.420 --> 2:25:34.860]  will then give us give us the next five years, the next 10 years, what's coming?
[2:25:34.860 --> 2:25:41.020]  Right. Quick. I'm just going to mention swanbitcoin.com forward slash
[2:25:41.660 --> 2:25:44.700]  I don't know. Let's just get into Bitcoin right now. I promise we get into Bitcoin. Let's talk.
[2:25:44.700 --> 2:25:47.820]  I know. I just want to mention that. And then I'll get it. No, no, no, no. Let's start over.
[2:25:47.820 --> 2:25:51.420]  We'll get into that big question I just asked later. Spend some time on Bitcoin. How far
[2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:55.420]  you predicted the first big run, because the second big run, where's Bitcoin right now?
[2:25:55.420 --> 2:26:00.860]  What do you think's the best areas? What I want to do Alex is to pick up where we left off and
[2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:06.780]  talk about interest rates for a second and, and how the game is played. If that's okay. So
[2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:10.220]  another word, let's get into Bitcoin first. Cause I said, we talked about Bitcoin.
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:14.380]  Get into Bitcoin now. Then we'll talk about it. I'm in midstream, you know, I, I can't,
[2:26:14.380 --> 2:26:18.540]  during the break, it all came like a crystal vision of my brain. I just, I just wanted to
[2:26:18.540 --> 2:26:25.500]  get to Bitcoin. Start. Go ahead. Right. So the 20, 25 years, you've seen interest rates come down
[2:26:25.500 --> 2:26:30.460]  and they're being forced down. Central banks are buying bonds that forces interest rates down.
[2:26:30.460 --> 2:26:37.820]  Now think about the dynamic here, because this is a way to redistribute wealth in America
[2:26:38.460 --> 2:26:44.220]  and to put a lot of it into the hands of the top one-tenth of 1%. And it goes like this.
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:49.660]  If interest rates are coming down for 20, 25 years, and we know that's true in the mortgage
[2:26:49.660 --> 2:26:55.100]  market, right? New mortgages have come down sharply over the last 15 years, true or false.
[2:26:55.100 --> 2:27:00.860]  That's true. And they keep coming down. But how come credit card rates have not come down?
[2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:05.420]  They've been around 16, 17, 18%, they spend that way for 10 years. Credit card interest rates
[2:27:05.420 --> 2:27:12.140]  have never come down. And let's, let's examine that a little bit. It's because the housing market
[2:27:12.140 --> 2:27:17.740]  has an asset on a bank's balance sheet with low mortgage rates. The value of the asset,
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:24.300]  the house on the balance sheet goes up by almost exponential degree as you find that
[2:27:24.300 --> 2:27:31.980]  people are panic buying real assets like houses. And that's on the bank's balance sheet. And so
[2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:38.220]  people with assets and the people with assets to that, to that nature are getting a lot richer.
[2:27:38.220 --> 2:27:44.140]  Because now let's look at the people who are consumers who might not have a house. They
[2:27:44.140 --> 2:27:47.900]  can't afford a house. It's too expensive because the prices have been jacked up in this way.
[2:27:47.900 --> 2:27:53.900]  But they pay 16, 17% interest on their credit card. So you see what happens is that if you're,
[2:27:53.900 --> 2:27:59.740]  you're forced into a consumer model without owning any assets. And probably 80% of Americans
[2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:05.340]  have no assets whatsoever. It's just hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck. They're just surviving.
[2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:12.780]  And they're paying 18% of that credit card. If, if the economy was being run in a way that there
[2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:18.140]  would be some equilibrium in all facets of it, and it wasn't being run by a few bankers for their
[2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:22.620]  benefit, credit card interest rates would be similar to mortgage rates. You'd be paying
[2:28:22.620 --> 2:28:28.380]  two or 3% interest on your credit card. But because they control the financial markets,
[2:28:28.380 --> 2:28:34.700]  they control the, and the visa and mastercard is a duopoly. There's no competition. And they're
[2:28:34.700 --> 2:28:40.940]  allowed to operate as a duopoly or an oligopoly in this economy. It's a way to constantly bleed
[2:28:41.580 --> 2:28:46.940]  money in the form of interest, what I call interest rate apartheid. You're bleeding money from 80 to
[2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:53.100]  90% of the population. Well, at the same time, offering your friends who are buying assets,
[2:28:53.100 --> 2:28:58.140]  and you're buying houses for $100 million a pop and watching them go to $150 million out in the
[2:28:58.140 --> 2:29:03.980]  Hamptons, right? Because you're using that as a rising asset value because of the low interest
[2:29:03.980 --> 2:29:09.980]  rates, and then using that house as collateral to go buy another house. And by the way, the financing
[2:29:09.980 --> 2:29:17.020]  of that second home was also near 0%. So this is how interest rates are used in a very subtle way
[2:29:17.020 --> 2:29:23.020]  to create this huge wedge. If somebody in Washington wanted to actually do something about
[2:29:23.020 --> 2:29:28.300]  the way the economy is currently corrupted to favor bankers and their corrupt practices,
[2:29:28.300 --> 2:29:33.740]  they would immediately lobby to drop interest rates down to 2% where they should be relative to
[2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:39.740]  where interest rates have been for the past 20 years, categorically undeniably. It's like
[2:29:39.740 --> 2:29:45.420]  two plus two equals four. You can't argue that. But there's no greater lobbyists in Washington
[2:29:45.420 --> 2:29:49.420]  than Visa and MasterCard. Those are probably the two biggest lobbyists there are,
[2:29:49.420 --> 2:29:58.380]  and they just drain that capital out. So that's my point about the subtle way that the economy
[2:29:58.380 --> 2:30:04.060]  is being drained of all equity. And people are becoming poverty stricken, and they are relying
[2:30:04.060 --> 2:30:10.700]  more and more on interest on credit cards because the wages are horrible. And now we've got real
[2:30:10.700 --> 2:30:15.020]  inflation because as the rest of the world, this bring it to the geopolitical level,
[2:30:15.020 --> 2:30:19.660]  as the rest of the world begins to de-globalize and pull away from the dollar, and they're tired
[2:30:19.660 --> 2:30:23.580]  of funding America's wars, I mean, the current administration has been in office for five or
[2:30:23.580 --> 2:30:28.060]  six wars. They're immediately, I think they started three wars in the past two weeks. That's
[2:30:28.060 --> 2:30:35.260]  just an excuse to raise taxes, to raise interest rates on consumer debt to drain the people that
[2:30:35.260 --> 2:30:39.660]  way, and et cetera. Now, when you look at the United States, and you say, well, where in the
[2:30:39.660 --> 2:30:46.780]  States is there any pocket of hope? And the answer is Wyoming. Wyoming is to Bitcoin,
[2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:53.420]  what Colorado was to marijuana. You know, marijuana was started off in the states rights,
[2:30:53.420 --> 2:30:59.420]  and now it's going to go to the federal level. Wyoming is now lobbying for Bitcoin rights,
[2:30:59.420 --> 2:31:04.460]  has become a Bitcoin state. We've got the senator from Wyoming is on the Finance Committee in
[2:31:04.460 --> 2:31:10.940]  Washington, DC. She's fully Bitcoinized. And that's where the revolution is going to start in
[2:31:10.940 --> 2:31:15.500]  Wyoming. Then it'll spread to other states because Wyoming's economy will start to thrive. It's
[2:31:15.500 --> 2:31:20.060]  already attracting these incredibly powerful, profitable Bitcoin companies to the state of
[2:31:20.060 --> 2:31:25.980]  Wyoming. Everyone's flocking there now. And then that will, that will spread out. So that's the,
[2:31:25.980 --> 2:31:32.460]  that's the ray of hope in all this is Wyoming. Senator Lumis or Lumis, I believe she pronounces
[2:31:32.460 --> 2:31:39.500]  it Lumis. She is a Bitcoin brilliant. And she's on this Senate Finance Committee right now as of
[2:31:39.500 --> 2:31:44.220]  this week, fighting for Bitcoin rights. And that's the bright spot in America right now.

[2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:30.780]  i want to be clear i believe in capitalism i believe in free markets but we've never had a
[2:38:30.780 --> 2:38:35.980]  perfect one humans aren't perfect we're not god but we have private central banks and private
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:43.740]  banks that control regulators above the markets and they've always had an evil hand an inside job
[2:38:43.740 --> 2:38:53.340]  an insider trading uh you know leg up but now it's completely rigged and when you see some
[2:38:53.340 --> 2:38:57.580]  small traders get together and go and have a little bit of victory oh my god it's the end of the world
[2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:01.500]  and they're just going to feed the whole economy into this thing
[2:39:02.780 --> 2:39:06.140]  and and then now you've got these billionaires and these people that control trillion dollar
[2:39:06.140 --> 2:39:11.100]  companies running death camps in china but they're liberal so it's okay and they're like oh we don't
[2:39:11.100 --> 2:39:16.780]  need wealth anymore everyone should be poor you need to learn to be poor and they're like literally
[2:39:16.780 --> 2:39:21.180]  worth hundreds of billions of dollars running everything with 20 yachts and 30 airplanes and
[2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:28.460]  20 mansions and all these wives and they're lecturing us we got to eat bugs i just don't
[2:39:28.460 --> 2:39:33.500]  see it going well but they think oh we'll have robots and there'll be our security force i mean
[2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:40.140]  these guys are really delusional max let's talk about the mindset of the eric schmitz and the
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:48.060]  jeff bezos's and the jeff zuckerberg's and all of them are mark zuckerberg and jeff zucker's
[2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:54.140]  overseeing it i mean these guys are like whistling past the political graveyard in my view i don't
[2:39:54.140 --> 2:39:58.860]  even hate them i'm not out to get them i'm just they just seem crazy funding black lives matter
[2:39:58.860 --> 2:40:03.820]  oh hey we fund the black people you mean the movement that says break up their families uh but
[2:40:04.940 --> 2:40:10.300]  then you're on death camps in china it's i mean we can see what they're doing and i just it seems
[2:40:10.300 --> 2:40:15.500]  like such a reckless move such an incredible consolidation they've all got their own private
[2:40:15.500 --> 2:40:22.220]  space fleets and they're all competing to be george jetson it just it has delusions of grandeur
[2:40:22.220 --> 2:40:27.980]  and collapse written all over it my view do you think i'm wrong well yeah to follow up on what
[2:40:27.980 --> 2:40:34.700]  we're saying um in a second ago because i tend to think in terms of banking central banking so
[2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:40.700]  let's let me ask you this question so according to the federal reserve bank and the folks in
[2:40:40.700 --> 2:40:47.660]  washington there's deflation and interest rates are near zero percent and they need to stay at
[2:40:47.660 --> 2:40:54.060]  zero as a matter of fact they go to need to go to negative rates okay if that's true then alex
[2:40:54.060 --> 2:41:02.700]  jones why can't you decide to open a bank and your bank is going to not have any overdrawn
[2:41:02.700 --> 2:41:09.820]  overdrawn penalties it's going to offer our savers four percent on their money not one tenth of one
[2:41:09.820 --> 2:41:17.980]  percent and um the bank has a credit card and the credit card doesn't have 16 or 17 interest the
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:25.020]  charges three percent interest okay now that bank if that if that bank opened today it would be
[2:41:25.020 --> 2:41:31.500]  very quickly the most profitable and biggest bank in america and so if this is free market
[2:41:31.500 --> 2:41:37.660]  capitalism and and and we really do have the ability to start businesses here in america why
[2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:42.940]  can't alex jones open that bank tomorrow uh and and have the most profitable bank in america and
[2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:47.100]  which would be the reason is profitable is because he acknowledges the fact that interest rates are
[2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:53.420]  at these historic lows the reason is that as we described there is no competition the competition
[2:41:53.420 --> 2:42:00.940]  has been squeezed out we have an oligarchy of a few banks and they keep rates artificially high
[2:42:00.940 --> 2:42:08.220]  for the peasants and they keep them low for their real estate speculating and corporate speculating
[2:42:08.220 --> 2:42:16.300]  clientele uh us as who are doing their bidding in washington so we have two we have two americas
[2:42:16.300 --> 2:42:22.300]  we have a peasant class and we have the oligarchs and america by the way their foreign policy
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:26.460]  according to the current administration is to defend democracy all over the world
[2:42:26.460 --> 2:42:32.860]  which is excuse the fresh my expression but that's complete horseshit because they need to look at
[2:42:32.860 --> 2:42:40.140]  america and decide whether or not they want to have an oligarchy in america of wall street bankers
[2:42:40.140 --> 2:42:45.980]  manipulating the interest rates to an extent of creating a permanent american peasant class
[2:42:45.980 --> 2:42:49.740]  that's the only a really question that needs to be asked right now and max you just said it and you
[2:42:49.740 --> 2:42:56.620]  know saying that it's horseshit isn't enough it's bull fucking shit and you're totally right and
[2:42:56.620 --> 2:43:01.900]  they're creating a class system again the thing america tried to get away from to the use racism
[2:43:01.900 --> 2:43:06.700]  as a false class battle when really it's the ultra banks against us all and so i think we need to
[2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:13.900]  unify old young black white gay straight whatever for a code of a social contract again that operates
[2:43:13.900 --> 2:43:18.780]  but what in in a few minutes would that social contract look like when do we start reforming
[2:43:18.780 --> 2:43:26.620]  how long does this robber baronning go on as christine legard has said there's only one escape
[2:43:26.620 --> 2:43:33.180]  there's only one thing they can't control and that's bitcoin it still has a 40x return available
[2:43:33.980 --> 2:43:39.660]  people should be accumulating it because it's unconfiscatable but this is a one concept i'll
[2:43:39.660 --> 2:43:44.620]  leave you with alex and it's a concept i want you to think hard about it's the only time in history
[2:43:44.620 --> 2:43:50.460]  we've seen the separation of state and money that's a remarkable statement we've had the separation
[2:43:50.460 --> 2:43:55.660]  of church and state and that was part of the enlightenment and the moves toward creating
[2:43:55.660 --> 2:44:02.540]  the united states etc but we've never ever had separation of state and money we can literally
[2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:08.860]  on the bitcoin network we've created our own unconfiscatable hard money that's better than
[2:44:08.860 --> 2:44:16.780]  gold in many ways and we don't need to it will defund the nation state well listen let me say
[2:44:16.780 --> 2:44:21.500]  this max i remember bill berg 12 years ago when nobody was on bitcoin you said all this so you
[2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:27.100]  definitely picked a winner then no one can deny that you picked like the triple crown winning horse
[2:44:27.100 --> 2:44:32.220]  when it was just a full you know three days old out of its mother's womb sitting there you know
[2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:37.820]  suckling and so how were you able to pick that out of that whole sea of upstart things as the big
[2:44:37.820 --> 2:44:46.380]  winner i had in los angeles created a virtual currency in 1996 that i have a patent on and
[2:44:46.380 --> 2:44:54.380]  it's patent number 5956170 and i was already aware of digital currencies and like and and
[2:44:54.380 --> 2:45:00.700]  virtual currencies and so in bitcoin i was introduced to it in 2011 at a dollar i immediately
[2:45:00.700 --> 2:45:07.260]  recognized that it was a huge advance on this idea of a virtual or digital currency back in
[2:45:07.260 --> 2:45:12.300]  the 90s when i was running the hollywood stock exchange there were many gaming gaming sites at
[2:45:12.300 --> 2:45:17.820]  that time during the dot com frenzy that used play money let's call play money or virtual money
[2:45:17.820 --> 2:45:22.620]  but it's all centralized and you could never really cross it over to the real world the genius
[2:45:22.620 --> 2:45:28.860]  of bitcoin is that it's decentralized and that the encrypted shield that protects it is impenetrable
[2:45:28.860 --> 2:45:35.500]  in the shaw 256 passing algorithm runs at 160 quintillion calculations per second and now to
[2:45:35.500 --> 2:45:40.140]  give you an idea how strong that is every single grain of sand when you add it all up on planet
[2:45:40.140 --> 2:45:46.780]  earth is seven quintillion grains of sand the bitcoin protocol is running at 150 to 160 quintillion
[2:45:46.780 --> 2:45:51.900]  calculations per second right now that's the unimpenetrable encrypted shield that protects
[2:45:51.900 --> 2:45:57.740]  it from all outside forces no government can attack it no group of governments can attack it
[2:45:57.740 --> 2:46:02.780]  it's you are living in the bitcoin wire if it gets big enough if it gets big enough they
[2:46:02.780 --> 2:46:11.020]  wouldn't be able to stop it that that moment passed long ago it became unstoppable almost
[2:46:11.020 --> 2:46:16.460]  within two years after it was burnt so but by by 2011 2012 it was already on its way to become
[2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:20.700]  okay so who is the real i remember this japanese guy but i asked you so many times who is the real
[2:46:20.700 --> 2:46:25.660]  inventor of bitcoin do you know well satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym of the guy who wrote
[2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:29.580]  the white paper and then he disappeared and for and that that's one of the greatest strengths of
[2:46:29.580 --> 2:46:34.780]  bitcoin because we know from every other coin for example ethereum is the second biggest coin
[2:46:34.780 --> 2:46:41.020]  but it's essentially run by vitalik and if it vitalik got hit by a bus ethereum would go would
[2:46:41.020 --> 2:46:46.220]  be destroyed all these other coins have centralized operations that are vulnerable to
[2:46:46.220 --> 2:46:51.900]  the founders ripping people off and by the way ethereum is has a lot of a lot of good person
[2:46:51.900 --> 2:46:58.220]  knew this was coming and launched a pure system up front to defeat it and then disappeared because
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:47:04.860]  20 years before there had been several attempts and they came close to something but and then but
[2:47:04.860 --> 2:47:10.460]  whenever they did remember there was a project called e gold which was a precursor of bitcoin
[2:47:10.460 --> 2:47:16.300]  and the founder ended up getting in huge trouble with the regulators and oh i remember i had like
[2:47:16.300 --> 2:47:22.060]  ron paul's brother trying to get me in it right so so the creator of bitcoin realized that if this
[2:47:22.060 --> 2:47:25.820]  was going to really do what it's supposed to do he needed to become anonymous the second it went
[2:47:25.820 --> 2:47:31.260]  live because otherwise he would be like julien assange sitting in a torture cell in london right
[2:47:31.260 --> 2:47:39.100]  now uh or or some other persecuted individual so he very wisely became uh anonymous and and
[2:47:39.100 --> 2:47:44.380]  that's the greatest gift ever it's it's a gift equal to jesus christ in my opinion who came to
[2:47:44.380 --> 2:47:50.700]  this world to give us the gift of love satoshi nakamoto is christ 2.0 and he gave us the gift
[2:47:50.700 --> 2:47:55.580]  of bitcoin if you don't now you're getting john lennon on us let's just say he's way below jesus but i
[2:47:55.580 --> 2:48:00.620]  get your allegory hey i think this is our best interview in 15 years very powerful police come
[2:48:00.620 --> 2:48:06.060]  back again soon uh max keiser yoji max keiser dot com but what's the best site for people swan

[2:48:30.380 --> 2:48:39.020]  begun we have the technocrats are controlling the food supply secure your own safe source of
[2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:43.580]  food supply sale it's the new prices in 2021 but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're

[2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:53.100]  all these globalists do this and as they hoard the food and as they prepare you need to understand
[2:48:53.100 --> 2:48:57.900]  that you need 25 year foods that rely on the last 25 years one month three months six months
[2:48:57.900 --> 2:49:01.580]  one year supplies and it's the highest quality you're going to find and it's just good to have
[2:49:01.580 --> 2:49:06.060]  that checkbox taken care of and you know you're getting good food at a very good price and you
[2:49:06.060 --> 2:49:10.380]  know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our

[2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:28.220]  it starts with being prepared it starts with horrible food it starts with digging in with a
[2:49:28.220 --> 2:49:37.340]  long globalist fight you'll win in the end the globalists are taking control of the entire human
[2:49:37.340 --> 2:49:45.260]  genome they are forcing mutations this is forced evolution or de-evolution when you look at all
[2:49:45.260 --> 2:49:49.740]  the major research all the major programs are carrying out they are not to produce people
[2:49:49.740 --> 2:49:56.220]  that are smarter or folks that live longer or more moral no it's turning humanity into a commodity
[2:49:56.220 --> 2:50:01.340]  now we see some propaganda like communist china bragging hey we've done m r and a vaccines to
[2:50:01.340 --> 2:50:07.660]  make our soldiers superman that's a way to make it sexy that hey we're experimenting on our troops
[2:50:07.660 --> 2:50:11.900]  we'll say thanks for that into our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they
[2:50:11.900 --> 2:50:17.020]  tried a new experimental vaccine i'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government
[2:50:17.020 --> 2:50:20.780]  and the state of texas health department they say alex we know it hurts a lot of people
[2:50:20.780 --> 2:50:25.500]  this is for a greater good but that's not even true and it violates the Geneva convention the
[2:50:25.500 --> 2:50:30.780]  nuremberg code federal state law this is violence being carried out against us by medic charity
[2:50:30.780 --> 2:50:33.340]  and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary
[2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:39.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:51:03.340 --> 2:51:07.260]  when you're out there without care yeah i was out of touch
[2:51:08.940 --> 2:51:14.380]  but it wasn't because i didn't know enough welcome back ladies and gentlemen and we've
[2:51:14.380 --> 2:51:20.300]  got breaking news the amazing kassandra fairbanks the gateway pundit dot com

[2:51:33.740 --> 2:51:38.460]  been blocked on twitter for daring to put that out because you're supposed to go along with a big
[2:51:38.460 --> 2:51:45.020]  line we've got two articles the great writers and info wars dot com like kelemic brine and kit
[2:51:45.020 --> 2:51:50.860]  daniels and others have written msm admits bipartisan quote shadow campaign engage in
[2:51:50.860 --> 2:51:58.300]  conspiracy to prevent trump victory and they lay it all out how they censored and suppressed people
[2:51:58.300 --> 2:52:05.180]  ahead of time how they blocked trump showing the election fraud they admit the whole thing it is
[2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:12.140]  simply insane but the good news is we're still on air and other organizations are still on air

[2:56:31.500 --> 2:56:35.980]  our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the
[2:56:35.980 --> 2:56:41.340]  resistance dot video share the link the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:56.940]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:57:01.260 --> 2:57:05.020]  according to bill gates and claus schwa that run the devos group of the united nations
[2:57:05.020 --> 2:57:10.860]  covered response the mask are never coming off did you hear that the master never coming off
[2:57:10.860 --> 2:57:16.540]  and any business or any sport or any activity that has humans in close proximity is going to be
[2:57:16.540 --> 2:57:22.940]  ended this is the end of civilization and life as we know it and it's called living in a giant prison
[2:57:23.580 --> 2:57:29.260]  but we know that many industries which rely particularly on physical interaction
[2:57:29.260 --> 2:57:37.740]  will have difficulties to survive normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated
[2:57:38.300 --> 2:57:44.460]  the entire global population and and so what policies should we have because until we get
[2:57:45.020 --> 2:57:51.820]  almost everybody vaccinated globally we still won't be fully back to normal we want to go
[2:57:52.540 --> 2:57:58.060]  you know in manufacture and do construction and go to school but there will be things like big
[2:57:58.060 --> 2:58:03.820]  public events where the risk will outweigh the risk of a disease rebound even after you get
[2:58:03.820 --> 2:58:07.580]  vaccinated you still got to keep taking the shots and wear the mask even after you get
[2:58:07.580 --> 2:58:12.140]  vaccinated you now learn it doesn't picture from covid because they've never had a vaccine for the
[2:58:12.140 --> 2:58:18.540]  common cold and covid is based on that but even after you're vaccinated uh social distancing
[2:58:18.540 --> 2:58:22.780]  wearing masks are going to be essential and we'll need to continue communicating about that
[2:58:22.780 --> 2:58:28.060]  through health and medical experts this is not a pre-pandemic video shoppers at this napal's
[2:58:28.060 --> 2:58:34.780]  grocery store aren't wearing masks and employees aren't either so we've never been wearing that
[2:58:34.780 --> 2:58:40.860]  alfie oaks is making national headlines for not enforcing mask wearing at his oak's farms
[2:58:40.860 --> 2:58:45.820]  seed to table market customers can wear a full bodysuit and if you're afraid of bumping your
[2:58:45.820 --> 2:58:51.900]  head then put on a football helmet oaks seed to table market in napal's florida has committed an
[2:58:51.900 --> 2:58:57.180]  incredible thought crime they're looking at the science the research and the facts and saying
[2:58:57.180 --> 2:59:01.020]  if you don't want to wear a mask in our store you don't have to because after all there's
[2:59:01.020 --> 2:59:06.780]  not a law in florida and most areas that have put laws in place are unconstitutional and courts
[2:59:06.780 --> 2:59:12.460]  have already found that not just here but in germany and in suite and other areas they have
[2:59:12.460 --> 2:59:17.420]  found that the mass do not protect you they actually give you viral pneumonia in many cases
[2:59:17.420 --> 2:59:22.540]  and that it's nothing but a giant virtue signal the sign out front outlines if you have a medical
[2:59:22.540 --> 2:59:27.820]  condition that prevents you from wearing a mask you are exempt and we cannot legally ask you about
[2:59:27.820 --> 2:59:34.460]  your medical condition all the mainstream media is gaslighting us they're so scared look at the
[2:59:34.460 --> 2:59:40.460]  horror of these people inside a grocery store almost no one's wearing masks how dare them
[2:59:40.460 --> 2:59:45.580]  shepherd smith says listen we all dream of the day the mask come off but that day's not here
[2:59:45.580 --> 2:59:51.580]  no we all fantasize about a time when we won't have to wear the masks anymore it's not now
[2:59:52.300 --> 2:59:58.380]  yes chef we know it's not here because biden of the un bill gates all of them admit that the masks
[2:59:58.380 --> 3:00:04.620]  are permanent and we're being habituated to never take them off this is about humans being dirty
[3:00:05.180 --> 3:00:11.740]  humans being bad humans not even able to have sex without a mask on this is about the state
[3:00:11.740 --> 3:00:16.460]  literally coming to our lives and setting up a federal and international task force to come
[3:00:16.460 --> 3:00:21.740]  into people's houses and demand contact tracing and actually break families up and take their
[3:00:21.740 --> 3:00:28.220]  children this is a united nation's world government power grab and what you're witnessing in naples
[3:00:28.220 --> 3:00:32.860]  florida and not just in that town but with the governor and others is the model for the united
[3:00:32.860 --> 3:00:37.580]  states and the rest of the world using free association and working with private companies
[3:00:37.580 --> 3:00:42.860]  and private corporations to decide that we're still human we still have rights and we are not
[3:00:42.860 --> 3:00:47.660]  going to live in this dystopic nightmare anymore though the owner alphi oaks made it clear this
[3:00:47.660 --> 3:00:52.540]  is about much more than that you don't think masks work and that the virus is not a real
[3:00:52.540 --> 3:00:58.140]  thing i hope the masks don't work and i know that the virus has not has not killed 400 000 people
[3:00:58.140 --> 3:01:05.340]  in this country that's that total hogwash in fact the us covet death toll has now exceeded 450 000
[3:01:05.340 --> 3:01:09.500]  and health experts have been adamant that wearing masks would save countless lives
[3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:14.860]  probably the most important things we see mask use up over 85 percent and that's been
[3:01:14.860 --> 3:01:20.380]  a critical part of getting these numbers down but inside this supermarket lines of uncovered
[3:01:20.380 --> 3:01:27.500]  faces prompting mostly heavy criticism i can't stop watching this my jaw is literally on my desk
[3:01:27.500 --> 3:01:32.940]  this should be a crime people across the country are dying because of behavior like this and from
[3:01:32.940 --> 3:01:38.380]  a woman mourning her father's death from covid this makes my stomach turn and my heart sink
[3:01:38.380 --> 3:01:43.420]  the horse can't be led to water even though a tsunami is heading its way this is not about
[3:01:43.420 --> 3:01:49.260]  your health it's the democrats in california that passed a law that you can give people hiv
[3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:55.820]  or hepatitis knowingly and not even get in trouble and it expands on from there in the last decade
[3:01:55.820 --> 3:02:00.540]  millions of people have died in the u.s from governor's district tv almost all of it coming in
[3:02:00.540 --> 3:02:06.060]  from the third world and under obama they stopped even testing people when they came in
[3:02:06.060 --> 3:02:11.980]  trump started again now biden is talking about killing that program as well and increasing
[3:02:11.980 --> 3:02:17.420]  the number of refugees that come to united states but it's not just tb it's bubonic plague and hundreds
[3:02:17.420 --> 3:02:21.980]  of other diseases that were cured that were non-existent in the u.s and are now back with
[3:02:21.980 --> 3:02:28.140]  a vengeance and let's not forget all of the giant hepatitis outbreaks in democrat controlled cities
[3:02:28.140 --> 3:02:33.100]  in california and other areas where they allow all these drug addict homeless by the thousands to
[3:02:33.100 --> 3:02:37.900]  sleep on the street and defecate on the street that's now spreading the general public and police
[3:02:37.900 --> 3:02:43.180]  officers and trash collectors are catching these diseases no the left doesn't care about the giant
[3:02:43.180 --> 3:02:47.260]  rat infestations in new york they don't care about the open borders they don't care about any of it
[3:02:47.260 --> 3:02:53.260]  they want you to wear a mask because they said so and they want federal police tsa on checkpoints at
[3:02:53.260 --> 3:02:59.420]  bus stations and train stations to enforce it it's all happening it's a dystopia run out of the
[3:02:59.420 --> 3:03:05.180]  united nations and america is waking up so if i lived in florida i'd drive a hundred miles
[3:03:05.180 --> 3:03:09.420]  every week to shop at this store instead of other stores and i'm looking for stores
[3:03:09.420 --> 3:03:14.700]  in austin texas aren't in this cult we have family property out in east texas i'm seriously
[3:03:14.700 --> 3:03:19.340]  thinking about moving there because when i went and visited family a few months ago no one was
[3:03:19.340 --> 3:03:23.980]  wearing mask in the east texas towns and on the way back to austin almost no one was wearing mask
[3:03:23.980 --> 3:03:29.500]  until we got into the town this is a leftist sacrament it's their new religion of humans are
[3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:34.460]  dirty we hurt the environment we've got to be depopulated the post-human future is here and
[3:03:34.460 --> 3:03:40.540]  it's a symbol of our surrender a symbol of our slavery and to watch the horror and the fear and
[3:03:40.540 --> 3:03:47.100]  the look oh my god you're not wearing a mask when it's all a fraud is incredibly disgusting
[3:03:47.100 --> 3:03:50.700]  so all of us have to start demonstrating we all have to start going into stores and point out
[3:03:50.700 --> 3:03:56.060]  this is a fraud because this is an oppressive system that's never going away again they tell
[3:03:56.060 --> 3:04:01.500]  you just a little bit longer 15 days to cut the curve three months to do this oh just wear your
[3:04:01.500 --> 3:04:06.540]  mask for another month and then oh you didn't do a good enough job sorry that mask is never coming
[3:04:06.540 --> 3:04:13.180]  off now communist china is invading hong kong and using the mask mandate and contact tracers
[3:04:13.180 --> 3:04:17.580]  as a pretext to grab and stack a lot of their homes and they're setting up in canada and australia
[3:04:17.580 --> 3:04:23.820]  and germany and england this is a worldwide un takeover and a cover for literal martial law and
[3:04:23.820 --> 3:04:28.380]  secret arrest our capitals surrounded by troops they're announcing there's an enemy within and the
[3:04:28.380 --> 3:04:34.780]  cia is gonna act domestically like trump supporters are al-qaeda to crush us we have to come together
[3:04:34.780 --> 3:04:39.420]  with our own communities our own economies as americans and reject this globalist takeover
[3:04:39.420 --> 3:04:44.780]  and it starts by having the facts educating people the facts and taking the damn mask off
[3:04:44.780 --> 3:04:50.540]  oaks has sparked controversy before his facebook post calling the covet 19 pandemic
[3:04:50.540 --> 3:04:56.300]  and the black lives matter movement a hoax his comments costing him a multimillion dollar kids
[3:04:56.300 --> 3:05:03.340]  lunch contract with the collier county school board and while his no mask policy has generated
[3:05:03.340 --> 3:05:11.100]  criticism it's also been bringing a lot of people what do you tell people or health officials
[3:05:11.100 --> 3:05:16.220]  who say you might be putting people i just say just say please do your research please do please
[3:05:16.220 --> 3:05:20.540]  do your critical thinking and research trump really fumbled the ball going along with this whole
[3:05:20.540 --> 3:05:24.300]  vaccine hoax and he's some other things that were really bad he let big tech take over and
[3:05:24.300 --> 3:05:29.500]  censor everybody and that was his undoing but the greatest thing about trump in the last year
[3:05:29.500 --> 3:05:34.860]  was looking at those giant rallies of 20,000 30,000 100,000 200,000 almost nobody wearing mask
[3:05:34.860 --> 3:05:40.060]  people sing to the hoax and now that basic understanding is awakening people in a chain
[3:05:40.060 --> 3:05:46.700]  reaction the pcr tests are fake 96 false positive it's like a bad cold most people die of other
[3:05:46.700 --> 3:05:51.020]  things they put it in the column this is all admitted but big tech is trying to censor this
[3:05:51.020 --> 3:05:57.260]  truth so big media dinosaur media can gaslight us and tell us to keep our damn mask on you know
[3:05:57.260 --> 3:06:04.300]  we all fantasize about a time when we won't have to wear the masks anymore it's not now but some at
[3:06:04.300 --> 3:06:10.380]  a supermarket in florida appear to have decided that the time is now look at this this was the
[3:06:10.380 --> 3:06:16.940]  scene at oaks farm seed and to table market in naples today nbc sam brock took this video which

[3:09:20.860 --> 3:09:37.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show with nick baggage
[3:09:43.100 --> 3:09:48.540]  and welcome back it's good to be here this uh friday morning just before noon in my part
[3:09:48.540 --> 3:09:54.860]  of the world and afternoon most of the rest in the listening audience today uh i appreciate everyone
[3:09:54.860 --> 3:10:01.500]  who's here today you know i was thinking about um that last segment um before that alex was doing
[3:10:01.500 --> 3:10:08.380]  on the bitcoin and my oldest son you know when that first kicked in he hit me up and said dad
[3:10:08.380 --> 3:10:13.900]  you got to do this you got to do this i didn't let's talk and uh and and he did that and did
[3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:20.700]  really well with it when it was about seven bucks and he still has it so he did really good um
[3:10:21.660 --> 3:10:27.580]  but you know it's so it was so uh abstract to me i mean it's like you got fiat which is really
[3:10:27.580 --> 3:10:33.020]  weird you know right i mean and then you have bitcoin which was explained really well in the
[3:10:33.020 --> 3:10:39.340]  last hour and uh better than i could ever do anyway um having said all that you know we're
[3:10:39.340 --> 3:10:44.300]  entering this really unstable time that everyone is seeing and i still say the clouds are just
[3:10:44.300 --> 3:10:51.420]  gathering you haven't seen anything yet and as uh bad as that is you know i i think that's really
[3:10:51.420 --> 3:10:56.940]  what we're dealing with and you know thinking about banking you know one of my uh dear friends has
[3:10:56.940 --> 3:11:02.780]  this concept called astral banking which is kind of weird or or i could think about it a little
[3:11:02.780 --> 3:11:07.820]  differently you know storing treasures in heaven what does that mean you know storing up treasures
[3:11:07.820 --> 3:11:13.100]  in heaven and so i want to talk a little bit about that astral banking uh how does that work
[3:11:13.100 --> 3:11:17.660]  and it's been what we've been talking about uh indirectly indirectly over the last few weeks
[3:11:18.380 --> 3:11:24.700]  when i've been on and the idea of doing things that you can do rather than this uh oxymoron
[3:11:24.700 --> 3:11:30.940]  people throw around like it's real called doing the impossible which if you stop and think about
[3:11:30.940 --> 3:11:36.220]  how do you do the impossible uh do the possible and that's what i've been saying a lot lately
[3:11:36.220 --> 3:11:41.820]  and i think that's where we get our power back feel a little less helpless you know and you see it
[3:11:41.820 --> 3:11:47.020]  all over you know i get a lot of different uh interactions with people during the week something
[3:11:47.020 --> 3:11:51.500]  by email and in person i can still circulate around in my part of the world a little bit
[3:11:52.220 --> 3:12:01.180]  and you know what i get is a lot of uh complaint and victimhood and whining and a lot of stuff
[3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:09.180]  about stuff that either fears that don't happen or dreams that never come true you know and and
[3:12:09.180 --> 3:12:14.460]  rather or dream in the impossible dream right which doesn't happen either you know and so i'm
[3:12:14.460 --> 3:12:20.300]  thinking again about this what gets our power back and it's being able to take effective
[3:12:20.300 --> 3:12:28.620]  actions on the things that we individually know with certainty with conviction what we can do
[3:12:28.620 --> 3:12:34.620]  and a lot of it doesn't involve anything but our good will and effort and uh and other things are
[3:12:34.620 --> 3:12:40.060]  material you know and alex was saying in the last hour in the last couple hours you know the network
[3:12:40.540 --> 3:12:46.620]  takes resources some of us volunteer our time i do others do and and then material resources
[3:12:46.620 --> 3:12:52.300]  pay for the team to keep this thing going so so if you can buy good products support the team in
[3:12:52.300 --> 3:12:57.580]  that way and that's great we we all appreciate seeing that happen and allows us to continue doing
[3:12:57.580 --> 3:13:03.500]  continue doing what we do but when i think about astral banking it's a little bit different it's
[3:13:03.500 --> 3:13:12.780]  this idea that we can do good works we can do things that that we feel are just or right or
[3:13:12.780 --> 3:13:19.900]  rational are good they represent the sense of goodness in us and kindness in us and we can
[3:13:19.900 --> 3:13:25.820]  express that everywhere we go and i've talked about this sort of the magic ingredients and i
[3:13:25.820 --> 3:13:33.260]  hate that word but i'm trying to think of a better word um but it's the combination of things that
[3:13:33.260 --> 3:13:38.380]  make things happen and you have thought and you have emotion we talked about it before
[3:13:38.380 --> 3:13:45.580]  when these get combined with intention that pushes them out then you have real things being done
[3:13:45.580 --> 3:13:52.380]  when you know with conviction what you're going to do what you know you can do so begin to do that
[3:13:52.380 --> 3:13:57.980]  you know sort of set it up in the morning and i talked about this too kind of how do we equip
[3:13:57.980 --> 3:14:07.980]  the saints if you will or equip this generation of um of a new kind of uh revolutionary perhaps
[3:14:07.980 --> 3:14:15.660]  maybe one that goes deep first inside so when we project outside we do it with real power not
[3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:22.700]  this nonsense we see played out on cnn in fox you know but i'm talking about something deeper
[3:14:22.700 --> 3:14:29.420]  something more real something that uh represents the spark of divinity that resides in all of us
[3:14:29.420 --> 3:14:37.660]  and here's the action uh in this as we project into the world from this place uh there's power
[3:14:37.660 --> 3:14:43.420]  in that ladies and gentlemen that is dwarfs anything you see out there in the world it only
[3:14:43.420 --> 3:14:51.820]  takes one the right one to ignite that spark within um and then the game changes and there's
[3:14:51.820 --> 3:14:59.660]  millions i believe uh rising into the possibility of this right now and alex has said it you know
[3:14:59.660 --> 3:15:06.940]  and uh and i was saying at 25 over 25 years ago now um that around this time this is what we would
[3:15:06.940 --> 3:15:12.780]  see going on a lot of chaos but at the same time this big uh reawakening uh to the essence of what
[3:15:12.780 --> 3:15:20.540]  we are has created human beings and i said it a bit differently you know and um 20 years ago
[3:15:20.540 --> 3:15:27.500]  25 years ago but if you read it carefully it's all right there and and then all of this in the last
[3:15:27.500 --> 3:15:35.500]  uh uh 25 30 years now uh info wars right and what has that been about changing the way we see the
[3:15:35.500 --> 3:15:41.900]  world that's what we've been about you know re-examining what is in all these little slogans
[3:15:41.900 --> 3:15:47.100]  like doing the impossible you know like the unconscious which i talked about last week
[3:15:47.100 --> 3:15:53.100]  there is no un-in-conscious you know if you take it if you take the un-out it actually comes into
[3:15:53.100 --> 3:15:59.660]  your present form and you and you're doing that right uh that's what it means to be created in
[3:15:59.660 --> 3:16:08.460]  the likeness and image of a creator that you are plugged in and awake and aware and you know it
[3:16:08.460 --> 3:16:14.460]  and you behave differently because of it and the energy comes into you because of it but truth is
[3:16:14.460 --> 3:16:22.140]  really relevant here and i talked a lot about that over the last few weeks your own truth are you
[3:16:22.140 --> 3:16:29.020]  lying to yourself or you're lying to god or you're lying to who you lie into and if you are clean that
[3:16:29.020 --> 3:16:36.620]  up get that cleaned up and admit what you don't know and ask for knowledge
[3:16:36.620 --> 3:16:42.780]  you know reveal your heart that's what i'm saying is a different way to pray don't be the
[3:16:42.780 --> 3:16:51.020]  whining victim pleading you know don't do that you know you don't need to do that you think the
[3:16:51.020 --> 3:16:59.260]  universe doesn't know what you need get beyond that you know get beyond that and have a conversation
[3:16:59.260 --> 3:17:07.180]  with someone who wants to relate with you that's where the universe is at creating the image and
[3:17:07.180 --> 3:17:13.660]  likeness you know this this trip back to the garden that's what we're on we're we've fallen out of it
[3:17:13.660 --> 3:17:20.220]  we're we're making our trip back to the garden that's what i think we're doing here in the earth we
[3:17:20.220 --> 3:17:26.460]  can do it with respect and dignity and the honor that we were created to be when we look in the eyes
[3:17:26.460 --> 3:17:32.780]  of another human soul when we see the honor of what they are as well that's what we have
[3:17:32.780 --> 3:17:40.780]  in this year of 2021 as much as the horror shows going on all around us and we see it we hear it
[3:17:40.780 --> 3:17:47.980]  we've heard it all and we're feeling it i mean there's no denying what we're feeling either
[3:17:47.980 --> 3:17:53.740]  but let's pay attention to those feelings and as we do we gain control of them and they no longer
[3:17:53.740 --> 3:17:59.660]  jerk us around the room by our shirt callers we're the info wars and you're the info warrior
[3:17:59.660 --> 3:18:05.020]  and what does that mean that means we have real power in what we are this is dr. nick faggots
[3:18:05.020 --> 3:18:11.260]  we'll be right back after these messages anybody listening to my voice and simply search
[3:18:11.260 --> 3:18:18.620]  in the term davos group technocracy we're technocrats you will get claus Schwab and
[3:18:18.620 --> 3:18:27.500]  john claude yunker and all the new world order globalists like gg pink saying that they no longer
[3:18:27.500 --> 3:18:33.340]  want elected leaders over governments but they want businessmen technocrats over and that's who
[3:18:33.340 --> 3:18:38.220]  claus Schwab is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched the covet 19 lockdowns
[3:18:38.220 --> 3:18:42.220]  to bankrupt you and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is
[3:18:42.860 --> 3:18:47.420]  but you see he believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it
[3:18:47.420 --> 3:18:51.180]  that he has the right to do it to you you might want to find out who he works for yours directly
[3:18:51.180 --> 3:18:56.860]  for prince charles he developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability that means
[3:18:56.860 --> 3:19:02.780]  worldwide neo feudalism in his own words so you might want to find out how he talks about using
[3:19:02.780 --> 3:19:07.180]  vaccines for sterilization before you take those shots you might just want to find out who this
[3:19:07.180 --> 3:19:14.140]  villain is all right there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different
[3:19:14.140 --> 3:19:20.140]  political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip
[3:19:20.140 --> 3:19:23.980]  of the spear of the zeitgeist that's what the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut
[3:19:23.980 --> 3:19:29.180]  it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana and what
[3:19:29.180 --> 3:19:34.140]  really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:40.060]  popular like it's always been that's what the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[3:19:40.060 --> 3:19:46.060]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine so whatever you do

[3:21:39.260 --> 3:21:43.900]  so glad to be back you know uh just before the break i was talking a little bit about
[3:21:43.900 --> 3:21:50.860]  um this relationship with the creation and how so many people come at it sort of as a victim
[3:21:50.860 --> 3:21:55.980]  mining and groveling you know and this is really not the relationship i i believe the
[3:21:55.980 --> 3:22:01.500]  creator really wants with us it's a conversation revealing your heart if you will um in that
[3:22:01.500 --> 3:22:07.740]  conversation um acknowledging the limits of what you know you know being honest for that
[3:22:07.740 --> 3:22:12.780]  self examination that i was talking about before the break you know this idea of going
[3:22:12.780 --> 3:22:19.500]  internally and sort of reexamining the base questions you know um do you still have doubt
[3:22:19.500 --> 3:22:24.700]  you know and i mentioned that last week you know the doubt that the size of a mustard seed does
[3:22:24.700 --> 3:22:31.980]  much damage is the faith and everyone seems to muster the doubt pretty easy um in terms of how
[3:22:31.980 --> 3:22:39.980]  we approach life so acknowledging what we don't know is not a sin it's a reality okay and uh
[3:22:39.980 --> 3:22:44.700]  and that's what we got to start with is what we know don't do the impossible because you can
[3:22:45.580 --> 3:22:50.140]  do the possible because you can that's faith and conviction that rolls up with that makes
[3:22:50.140 --> 3:22:55.740]  it possible to get it done and the next steps reveal themselves um the other piece that i
[3:22:55.740 --> 3:23:00.860]  was talking about before the break was this idea of how we view each other divinely you know it
[3:23:00.860 --> 3:23:07.100]  makes it hard to punch someone in the nose you know when you're viewing them that way and i mean
[3:23:07.100 --> 3:23:12.540]  that sincerely because um and i'm not saying you don't block the punch and you know you kind of step
[3:23:12.540 --> 3:23:18.780]  back get ready to do what you got to do but you know there's a balancing act in all of this and when
[3:23:18.780 --> 3:23:27.180]  you turn it to um defense and that might have to do with a lot of force too uh but before you turn
[3:23:27.180 --> 3:23:32.540]  all that on there's a lot of other steps in the game and that's where i think um we have an opportunity
[3:23:32.540 --> 3:23:37.580]  on a one-on-one with each other meeting people where they are which i say often but seeing what's
[3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:44.300]  possible uh that's the mark of true leadership to look in a human being's eyes and see the creative
[3:23:44.300 --> 3:23:49.660]  human soul in there and the potential that exists within them and that's kind of a gateway i mean
[3:23:49.660 --> 3:23:56.140]  as i see it the way i perceive people but then backing off of that how are they living in the
[3:23:56.140 --> 3:24:03.100]  life they're leading and that defines them in a certain way and that's where you should meet them
[3:24:04.540 --> 3:24:11.020]  in the way they've decided to define themselves within the world and project outward in the world
[3:24:11.580 --> 3:24:16.620]  and what decided that was their internal dialogue with whatever they got going on there
[3:24:16.620 --> 3:24:23.180]  and so recognizing the potential in people is is truly a gift it's something we should all
[3:24:23.180 --> 3:24:29.020]  um try and do but also meeting people where they are and not being heard in the process
[3:24:29.020 --> 3:24:34.460]  and that's not about judging others that's about judging your own parameters against the evidence
[3:24:34.460 --> 3:24:40.540]  in front of you the facts that present themselves and those facts may lead you to moderate your
[3:24:40.540 --> 3:24:46.380]  relationships quite a lot you know uh it may do right i mean those are how we make judgments about
[3:24:46.380 --> 3:24:51.740]  who we let in our lives and who we don't and and here's the thing i see is if it's all
[3:24:51.740 --> 3:24:58.140]  complaint and victimhood and whining we need to re-examine all that or if it's all talking about
[3:24:58.700 --> 3:25:03.820]  people we need to re-examine all that let's talk about ideas and principles and things that change
[3:25:03.820 --> 3:25:08.700]  things let's talk about the facts that we all need to be informed on which is what we get from so
[3:25:08.700 --> 3:25:15.900]  much of the week from the various hosts they bring us lots of data and information that we get to
[3:25:15.900 --> 3:25:20.940]  index and use to push our political agendas forward and we need to do that i mean i mean it we
[3:25:20.940 --> 3:25:27.420]  need to do it more than now than ever last week i talked about note cards you know get a box of note
[3:25:27.420 --> 3:25:32.620]  cards at your local store and start writing handwritten notes to each other but write them to
[3:25:32.620 --> 3:25:39.660]  your congressman handwritten notes and your u.s senator if you don't think it matters i can tell
[3:25:39.660 --> 3:25:45.020]  you my brother was in the u.s senate my father was in the united states house of representative my
[3:25:45.020 --> 3:25:51.500]  brother other brother is in the state legislative legislature here my uncle was in minnesota i mean
[3:25:51.500 --> 3:25:57.420]  it goes on and on and let me tell you something and i'm a second generation american my father was
[3:25:57.420 --> 3:26:02.940]  first generation and his father was an immigrant so things can happen in this country still
[3:26:04.220 --> 3:26:09.020]  you know if you work hard and do things and my grandfather when he came he's digging
[3:26:09.020 --> 3:26:15.100]  holes underground before they went open pit and iron mining you know uh for a buck a day or whatever
[3:26:15.100 --> 3:26:20.220]  it was back then it wasn't much it was like a buck a day and you know when you look at all of what
[3:26:20.220 --> 3:26:26.860]  we've done in this country and what we see going down the toilet right now on a platform of bad
[3:26:26.860 --> 3:26:36.380]  values that we see being projected into our lives by this insane liberal left at this moment and i
[3:26:36.380 --> 3:26:42.620]  gotta say this too my son my son one of my my smart son you know you brought up this you know hey
[3:26:42.620 --> 3:26:50.300]  you want to piss off the left live for a hundred years you know i love that you know really live
[3:26:50.300 --> 3:26:55.340]  for a hundred years that means take care of yourself get the stress levels under control take a look
[3:26:55.340 --> 3:27:01.580]  at the supplements on info wars they're the best the best ingredients best quality best best
[3:27:01.580 --> 3:27:09.900]  and it is the two for right and so do that and and live to be a hundred years old and piss them off
[3:27:11.820 --> 3:27:17.740]  you know and make your family happy stick around and do something meaningful uh with our lives and
[3:27:17.740 --> 3:27:24.220]  this is our opportunity this world right now should be a world of true abundance and it's not
[3:27:24.220 --> 3:27:30.780]  because of a few that are manipulating our life liberty and our pursuit of happiness and every
[3:27:30.780 --> 3:27:37.580]  way first you know and now within a digital way you know think about it most of our life is intruded
[3:27:37.580 --> 3:27:44.700]  upon digitally this network has been intruded upon digitally the right to say what we feel and know
[3:27:45.340 --> 3:27:54.140]  and believe has been limited by a few who want to take everything and control everyone in every
[3:27:54.140 --> 3:28:01.980]  way i've been talking about it for over 30 years we have all of our books and videos are still
[3:28:02.700 --> 3:28:09.260]  the best sources of the detail and how this all got built you know and it's here on info wars
[3:28:09.260 --> 3:28:14.860]  the info war store but when we get into these issues about real empowerment gets back to
[3:28:14.860 --> 3:28:21.340]  individuals once again and so i use this last hour to kind of remind all of us of what we might
[3:28:21.340 --> 3:28:30.060]  be able to do we plug into the universal and dial it up a bit in terms of how we individually choose
[3:28:30.060 --> 3:28:37.100]  to project ourselves into this nasty filthy world that we're stuck in for a while and here's the thing
[3:28:37.820 --> 3:28:45.180]  the faith of a mustard seed remember and move mountains and the equal and unequal is doubt
[3:28:45.180 --> 3:28:51.580]  which also moves mountains okay where they're coming from who's creating the doubt and who's
[3:28:51.580 --> 3:28:58.940]  creating the faith this is another of the big lies that everyone's bought into incrementally
[3:28:58.940 --> 3:29:06.540]  and how they master the doubt mechanism to keep you in the earth in your flesh lost in fear
[3:29:07.100 --> 3:29:12.060]  because that's what it is ladies and gentlemen you can look at the science of what happens
[3:29:12.060 --> 3:29:19.500]  between your ears and what happens is you get incoherent brain patterns as a kind of that are
[3:29:19.500 --> 3:29:27.980]  related to the reptilian brain that you just run from the lion hey not a lion in the 21st century
[3:29:27.980 --> 3:29:35.420]  it requires heart and head to come together to make sure we're dialed into the universal in the
[3:29:35.420 --> 3:29:45.180]  way that we were created to be left brain right brain in balance listening to the heart how we feel
[3:29:45.180 --> 3:29:51.900]  about what we think and not falling into the addiction of thinking and feeling i'm going to
[3:29:51.900 --> 3:29:56.060]  get into that too in the next segment the last segment of the day because this addiction has
[3:29:56.060 --> 3:30:02.140]  never talked about you talk about sex and drugs and alcohol and uh food but nobody talks about
[3:30:02.140 --> 3:30:08.140]  about the emotional addictions right the thought addictions what do they charge up you know they
[3:30:08.140 --> 3:30:14.140]  release the same kind of endorphins in the brain and they become addictive behaviors fear is one
[3:30:14.140 --> 3:30:20.380]  of them boy that's a charge people like that big adrenaline rush you know jump off a cliff with a
[3:30:20.380 --> 3:30:25.900]  parachute you know out of a plane with another kind of parachute you know jump on a ski slope and

[3:32:17.580 --> 3:32:22.780]  up as the guardians of this world but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system
[3:32:22.780 --> 3:32:29.260]  and poisoning the planet they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human
[3:32:29.260 --> 3:32:36.140]  on earth to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target humanity with the mRNA
[3:32:36.140 --> 3:32:43.500]  vaccines which are not vaccines they are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[3:32:44.620 --> 3:32:51.820]  were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems go read the actual inserts
[3:32:52.620 --> 3:32:58.940]  for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned this is the equivalent of an alien
[3:32:58.940 --> 3:33:03.580]  takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's little green men the globalists are acting
[3:33:03.580 --> 3:33:07.420]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us it's all the same in the end
[3:33:09.740 --> 3:33:15.020]  there are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the united states much less
[3:33:15.020 --> 3:33:20.300]  than the entire world info wars to stand alone with our own radio and tv satellite uplinks at
[3:33:20.300 --> 3:33:27.020]  hundreds of stations picking us up almost no one else has that especially anybody covering real issues
[3:33:27.020 --> 3:33:33.580]  of global populism the right to self-defense and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda
[3:33:33.580 --> 3:33:39.420]  that's why when we go out and shoot videos they're at bandot video they're not allowed to be on
[3:33:39.420 --> 3:33:45.660]  twitter on youtube on facebook that's why it's so precious because the censorship expands to
[3:33:45.660 --> 3:33:50.860]  everyone which it is now with ai monitoring controlling what you can say and do it's going
[3:33:50.860 --> 3:33:56.380]  to be the oasis black bandot video and the now redesigned info wars dot com to become more and more

[3:35:18.460 --> 3:35:37.420]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick baggage
[3:35:37.420 --> 3:35:51.340]  yeah what a day today you know i want to get back into this issue of addictions and i want to cover
[3:35:51.340 --> 3:35:59.340]  the i cover three really quick because i've covered them before but this idea of food food energy
[3:35:59.340 --> 3:36:05.740]  right is about balancing all of addictions are really about energy regulation within our system
[3:36:05.740 --> 3:36:11.420]  but we we live so much in the flesh that is projected in that way so we use these physical
[3:36:11.420 --> 3:36:18.860]  forms and we kind of attack it from the body in which is really a kind of the upside down way
[3:36:18.860 --> 3:36:24.940]  it should be energetically spiritually driven in to what we do to project our body out because
[3:36:24.940 --> 3:36:31.020]  that's actually how it actually works the physics of it actually says that we're the outward projection
[3:36:31.020 --> 3:36:36.140]  of our internal arrangement of energy that's what fact we are according to the best quantum
[3:36:36.140 --> 3:36:42.780]  physicists that ever lived on the face of the earth and the underlying of that is uh consciousness
[3:36:42.780 --> 3:36:49.180]  not unconsciousness like people lie about but consciousness that is what it is and so even
[3:36:49.180 --> 3:36:56.380]  the best of the best in science recognize that god exists as a universal consciousness for lack of a
[3:36:56.380 --> 3:37:02.620]  better way of you know phrasing what god god is even god doesn't name himself because he can't get a
[3:37:02.620 --> 3:37:09.500]  name around it you know so so that's that that's there that's the concrete of science now how
[3:37:09.500 --> 3:37:15.660]  does that translate into the material in terms of addictions uh food food energy you know how do
[3:37:15.660 --> 3:37:24.700]  you balance it well the quickest charge is sugars the most white sugar in fact or corn syrup right
[3:37:24.700 --> 3:37:30.300]  these are pure poison all right i mean they are white sugar maybe a little bit better honey a lot
[3:37:30.300 --> 3:37:36.540]  better because of a lot of other reasons but natural sugars uh need to be considered as the best
[3:37:36.540 --> 3:37:42.220]  replacement the other is an addiction to moderate energy and it also fires the adrenals it does
[3:37:42.220 --> 3:37:50.540]  things to yet in the long range it does damage okay food addictions carbohydrates sugars
[3:37:50.540 --> 3:37:56.060]  simple sugars all of it you know it's where does that addiction go and what does it do it reduces
[3:37:56.060 --> 3:38:02.380]  in the brain endorphins and things oh yeah that feels great you know so you're addicted you get the
[3:38:02.380 --> 3:38:10.700]  little charge boom boom boom all day long drugs medications legal and illegal same deal alcohol
[3:38:11.260 --> 3:38:17.180]  same deal right it's about moderating energy some to bring you up some to knock you down some to do
[3:38:17.180 --> 3:38:23.900]  this some to do that most of its energy management problems you know that manifest in the body in
[3:38:23.900 --> 3:38:30.060]  various ways you think about sexual energy the big one you know that one's like totally abused
[3:38:31.340 --> 3:38:37.740]  many ways um or you know and again it's about the body right flesh moderating energy and
[3:38:37.740 --> 3:38:46.780]  so on and and creative energy is what is behind all those chemical reacts and see is the energetic
[3:38:47.340 --> 3:38:53.980]  activity that also plays into play now thought and emotion as an addiction because they release
[3:38:53.980 --> 3:38:59.820]  the same chemicals you see in the body depending on how they're managed right and we tend to habituate
[3:38:59.820 --> 3:39:07.260]  to the negative ones fear anxiety um and others because they release things you know we get a charge
[3:39:07.260 --> 3:39:13.500]  out of that it's adrenal charge it's not a good way to balance our system at all it's the wrong way
[3:39:15.340 --> 3:39:23.260]  the other emotions love faith um uh empathy compassion they charge up a whole different
[3:39:23.260 --> 3:39:30.380]  system within the body uh and within the mind and emotions that drive us a different way
[3:39:30.380 --> 3:39:37.660]  that move from fear to faith that move from doubt to knowing to faith to knowing with conviction
[3:39:38.540 --> 3:39:43.580]  knowing that's a deeper level than belief i've talked about belief a lot in the past you know i've
[3:39:43.580 --> 3:39:48.540]  talked about it in the analogy of the woman in saudi arabia wearing the black garb and feeling
[3:39:48.540 --> 3:39:53.740]  happy and good about herself and the woman in france walking down the beach without her top on
[3:39:53.740 --> 3:39:58.300]  naked from the waist up feeling good about herself and the woman in iowa looking at both
[3:39:58.300 --> 3:40:05.020]  these guys know boy i feel really good here and iowa how i'm doing are they wrong well within
[3:40:05.020 --> 3:40:12.220]  their belief structures they're absolutely correct within their neighborhood so to speak um but again
[3:40:12.220 --> 3:40:17.020]  is it a knowing do they have some universal knowing some great truth than any of it no
[3:40:17.980 --> 3:40:24.940]  none zero the knowing is something else it's a higher level that we would all agree on as human
[3:40:24.940 --> 3:40:30.060]  created souls these other things or beliefs that we hang an awful lot on that aren't truths
[3:40:30.860 --> 3:40:37.740]  and the reflections of the flesh usually fear and anxiety or something um but but they draw from
[3:40:37.740 --> 3:40:43.660]  they draw us down into the earth in a way that wasn't intended i don't i don't believe um
[3:40:44.380 --> 3:40:48.140]  we're supposed to rise out of this into a level of knowing which comes from
[3:40:48.140 --> 3:40:55.340]  from what we know to be right and true and taking actions against that that's fate that's doing the
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:41:01.020]  possible that's uh doing the conscious thing that's listening to your heart and head bringing the
[3:41:01.020 --> 3:41:06.940]  left and right back in balance that i've talked about the way we were created to be and there's
[3:41:06.940 --> 3:41:13.020]  ways to do this techniques to do this simple ways to do this let me give a few of them real quickly
[3:41:13.020 --> 3:41:20.460]  you know um a way to increase thinking a simple way hold your breath as long as you can and here's
[3:41:20.460 --> 3:41:27.580]  what happens the body goes oh no i'm i'm running out of oxygen and what it does is it dilates the
[3:41:27.580 --> 3:41:31.500]  vessels and veins going then out of the head because it wants to keep the brain alive that's
[3:41:31.500 --> 3:41:36.700]  the last organ living and they stay dilated for about 30 minutes you can do this with little
[3:41:36.700 --> 3:41:41.260]  kids as a game you know before they're five do it every once in a while just throw it out there
[3:41:41.260 --> 3:41:45.900]  after a grandparent you know and you have little kids around or your parents you have little kids
[3:41:45.900 --> 3:41:51.020]  around and you're not out working somewhere else but this is something you can do when they're young
[3:41:51.020 --> 3:41:55.580]  and it'll stay then what happens is blood flow stays a bit dilated you know and so they get a
[3:41:55.580 --> 3:42:00.540]  little more blood flow a little more oxygen a little more garbage you know that needs to get out
[3:42:00.540 --> 3:42:07.420]  of the the brain you know so in terms of the blood vein barrier and moving toxins out that
[3:42:07.420 --> 3:42:12.860]  that may be there and so there's things you can do breathing simple technique of breathing through
[3:42:12.860 --> 3:42:20.940]  the nose to a to a five count and then slow to a ten count out the mouth do that ten times your
[3:42:20.940 --> 3:42:27.340]  brain activity slows goes back into a rhythm stress dissipates just after three times another
[3:42:27.340 --> 3:42:32.380]  thing simple tool i give people all the time you know you can do this together with your
[3:42:32.380 --> 3:42:39.340]  significant other your spouse gazing connect with your spouse just gaze in their eyes when you have
[3:42:39.340 --> 3:42:46.860]  those opportunity for an intimate moment and and hold it for 10 15 minutes you'll be amazed you'll
[3:42:46.860 --> 3:42:53.340]  connect at a deeper level and and i think that's really what's missing emotion and thought as an
[3:42:53.340 --> 3:42:59.740]  addicted behavior how do you manage that one it's the easiest one to manage all you have to do
[3:42:59.740 --> 3:43:04.780]  is when you're experiencing like overactive thinking overactive emotion of the two i'm
[3:43:04.780 --> 3:43:11.020]  running together just pay attention just notice what you think notice what you're feeling and then
[3:43:11.020 --> 3:43:16.860]  you're in control of it actually and the emotions don't grab you anymore and the thoughts don't take
[3:43:16.860 --> 3:43:24.060]  you down the rabbit hole the fear and anxiety on stuff never was and never will or perhaps it takes
[3:43:24.060 --> 3:43:29.980]  you into the dreamland of what never will but take come back into what is now in this moment that you
[3:43:29.980 --> 3:43:36.140]  can act on against what you know to be right and true begin moving out of doubt and into faith
[3:43:36.140 --> 3:43:42.380]  this is how you do it one step at a time it's not that complex but it requires an internal
[3:43:42.380 --> 3:43:48.060]  look again and a real clear view of your own internal honesty as you look at other people
[3:43:48.060 --> 3:43:54.780]  and start to assess how you're behaving not how they're behaving how you're behaving and interacting
[3:43:54.780 --> 3:44:00.220]  in the world and projecting in it and i can tell you if you take people's anger that's projected
[3:44:00.220 --> 3:44:06.140]  every day and it is and yeah it has to be vented in different ways and i know listeners have
[3:44:06.140 --> 3:44:11.500]  contacted me it's one of the reasons info war serves that purpose too because it allows people to
[3:44:11.500 --> 3:44:17.180]  really release anger in a way that's not going to hurt anybody and is strongly opinionated
[3:44:17.180 --> 3:44:22.620]  because it should be because we got a big balancing act to do here against what's coming at us and
[3:44:22.620 --> 3:44:28.540]  what's been coming at us for a long time and the and the hosts and alex and the team everybody
[3:44:29.420 --> 3:44:35.420]  is here to provide not just the information but the tools for transformation so we can make it
[3:44:35.420 --> 3:44:43.740]  through because at the end of the day it's like you know the peacemakers the humble will inherit
[3:44:43.740 --> 3:44:50.860]  this earth not these bad guys and i won't say it again you know somebody tap me on the shoulder
[3:44:50.860 --> 3:44:56.060]  on that but there is there's some bad actors out there and there's not very many truly evil people
[3:44:56.060 --> 3:45:02.860]  but they do exist they do exist there's a lot of deception in the world right now and discernment
[3:45:02.860 --> 3:45:10.140]  is needed at a higher level than ever and so as we roll up into the weekend on this friday afternoon
[3:45:10.140 --> 3:45:17.980]  let's take stock of who we are let's remember to give our families and our friends our touch
[3:45:17.980 --> 3:45:26.540]  this weekend physically if we can reach out by the phone if we can send a handwritten note do
[3:45:26.540 --> 3:45:33.020]  something extraordinary for someone you don't even know if you're feeling depressed go and meet
[3:45:33.020 --> 3:45:40.860]  somebody in the street and and give them something good lift don't drag lift in the world right now
[3:45:40.860 --> 3:45:46.940]  because we can't because of who we are because of what we are and because what we believe is
[3:45:47.580 --> 3:45:53.660]  life liberty in the pursuit of happiness is still an honorable thing to believe in this is dr
[3:45:53.660 --> 3:46:04.620]  nick baggage we'll be back next Friday
