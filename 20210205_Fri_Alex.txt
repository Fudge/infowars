[00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:18.932]  It's official, the United States is being broken into pieces.
[00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:27.480]  The Pentagon has openly declared war on the American people and all Trump supporters, labeling us Nazis so they, the Captain America, smash us.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:41.472]  There are now hundreds of current and former CIA desk jockeys, analysts, posing for mainstream TV, showing their CIA badges and holding their finger up their ear pieces with sunglasses on, saying they're coming to kill us.
[00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:45.837]  This is unbelievable.
[00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:46.838]  And it doesn't scare me.
[00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.440]  It scares me for this country.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.024]  What a bunch of poser, punk losers.
[00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.067]  And of course, who do they hate?
[00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:58.150]  The men that are left in the military that are patriots.
[00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.072]  Soon to be replaced by robots.
[00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:02.835]  That's why they got the army wearing red high heels.
[00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.657]  That's why they put the transgender in.
[00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:05.999]  That's why they do everything they can
[00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:11.724]  To wreck the military because they want to dominate everything that was America.
[00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:13.885]  Even though it's the source of their power.
[00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:15.125]  They've captured America.
[00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.126]  They run America.
[00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:21.287]  They didn't steal the election, they took it.
[00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:23.308]  By force.
[00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:33.192]  This morning I was reading over InfoWars.com and I saw a link in a story to a Gateway Pundit article and I went to the actual Time Magazine article itself
[00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:36.748]  And it was incredibly staggering.
[00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:40.591]  And just as we're going live here, we're about to post the live feed show feed.
[00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:47.555]  And I'd like to show that on screen so we can read you one quote out of this.
[00:01:47.555 --> 00:02:01.725]  But in this article, the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election, they say in there that it was a conspiracy of big money
[00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:20.533]  And big corporations of both parties to quote, remove Trump and install Biden.
[00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.774]  Think about that.
[00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:25.857]  That's what super villains do.
[00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:29.319]  They like to rub things in.
[00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:38.741]  And so if you go to the live show page that we post every day, usually it's just a few comments, a few links and a live feed, audio and video.
[00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.482]  But today we've added an article and some links to it.
[00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:48.824]  You can go read this for yourself, but this is called rubbing it in.
[00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:50.765]  And that's what they do.
[00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:55.447]  They admit they steal it and they say, oh, but it was fair and square, but this is how we did it.
[00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:58.608]  An alliance between left-wing activists and business titans.
[00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:08.934]  And they go on to say, made sure that Trump was removed and Biden installed.
[00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:12.999]  That's a quote, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:17.424]  And it gets even more interesting.
[00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:19.367]  Another big article from gatewaypundit.com.
[00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:34.777]  Exclusive, the TCF Center Election Fraud in Michigan, newly discovered video shows late night deliveries after it was officially closed, with cardboard over the windows, of tens of thousands of illegal ballots eight hours after deadline.
[00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:39.399]  In the still of the night, you hear the wolf howl, honey, sniffing around your door.
[00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:45.061]  In the still of the night, you hear the wolf howl at honey, telling me I gotta have more votes.
[00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:52.830]  And this is all the total proof, but oh, the Pentagon's watching you.
[00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.991]  The FBI's watching you, America.
[00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:59.413]  You don't talk about election fraud while you're a local talk show host.
[00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:00.414]  That's not allowed.
[00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:01.014]  Who said?
[00:04:01.014 --> 00:04:05.176]  Biden said.
[00:04:05.176 --> 00:04:12.540]  We're inside the dystopia now, and the globalists are simply moving to mop up what's left of America, and they're set to pass legislation.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.682]  To register all guns and put you under the ATF of the Justice Department, no judge, no jury, where they can just take anybody's guns they want.
[00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:22.762]  And it's all official.
[00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.383]  They're now about to have a rule change to the ATF.
[00:04:26.383 --> 00:04:27.683]  Again, that's dictatorial.
[00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:32.364]  Saying that basically any gun part is a firearm.
[00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:37.485]  They're moving towards that existential battle they want to have with us.
[00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.865]  Lickin' their chops.
[00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:40.725]  They intend to make it racial, even though it's not.
[00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:43.286]  It's a globalist, foreign, chi-com takeover.
[00:04:44.844 --> 00:04:46.525]  Very, very sad.
[00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:50.227]  And the Pentagon is completely captured by traitors at the top.
[00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:51.047]  Yes, the storm's here.
[00:04:51.047 --> 00:04:53.128]  It wasn't the storm you thought it would be, though, is it?
[00:04:53.128 --> 00:04:58.971]  No, it's the New World Order storm, and it's here.
[00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:01.852]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:03.853]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:05.394]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:10.110]  Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.192]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:14.754]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:21.319]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.122]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:28.528]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:31.430]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.152]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:46.704]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:48.625]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:54.528]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:05:54.528 --> 00:06:06.893]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:15.436]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:35.996]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this February 5th, 2021 transmission.
[00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:45.823]  And we are now 15 days into the reign of the skeleton king, Joe Biden.
[00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:52.568]  Installed big article out of Time Magazine, a big celebratory
[00:06:53.462 --> 00:06:54.163]  How they did it.
[00:06:54.163 --> 00:07:02.451]  Kind of like when Hillary came to Libya and she said, I came, I saw, he died.
[00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:08.237]  Rubbing it in, Time Magazine reveals how elites stole election from Trump.
[00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:13.763]  Time Magazine admits there was, quote, a conspiracy to remove Trump and install Biden.
[00:07:13.763 --> 00:07:15.485]  Criminals love to brag, but it's always
[00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:18.717]  They're undoing.
[00:07:18.717 --> 00:07:23.822]  Join us today, which you're now doing, and spread the word.
[00:07:23.822 --> 00:07:26.904]  Simply amazing.
[00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:35.111]  And they bragged that, oh, outside of law, they got states through governors to change the rules so they could have all the dead people vote.
[00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:42.297]  It's a big celebration of how they worked as good criminals together and how proud they are.
[00:07:42.297 --> 00:07:43.438]  Here's the article.
[00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:46.220]  The secret history of the shadow campaign that saved
[00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:50.894]  2020 election the installation.
[00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:54.778]  We've got new footage of the van showing up eight hours of the deadline at 3 a.m.
[00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:55.399]  4 a.m.
[00:07:55.399 --> 00:08:08.491]  Everybody else was locked out and the police were there with their guns ready to make sure those special ballots got in there and Jojo won.
[00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:10.934]  So that's just one of the stacks we're going to be
[00:08:12.383 --> 00:08:13.043]  Going over today.
[00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:17.005]  Let me just tell you about the others before I drill back into this in more detail.
[00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:19.187]  Here's another big one.
[00:08:19.187 --> 00:08:20.267]  Nationalfile.com.
[00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:30.133]  Medical examiners reportedly say Capitol Top did not die from extinguisher attack, but a heart attack two days earlier.
[00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:33.474]  And CNN's been forced out of change the fine print and actually admit that.
[00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:37.637]  So the greatest terror attack, bigger than Pearl Harbor, bigger than 9-11.
[00:08:37.637 --> 00:08:38.917]  That's what Chuckie Schumer said.
[00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.138]  Just the ultimate in evil.
[00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:44.844]  Two hundred people go in, there'll be fifteen getting fights.
[00:08:44.844 --> 00:08:46.885]  The others are inside the velvet ropes.
[00:08:46.885 --> 00:08:52.767]  This was like Godzilla firing his heat ray in Tokyo.
[00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:55.728]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[00:08:55.728 --> 00:08:56.788]  And the left that hates police.
[00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:00.090]  Normally they celebrate when cops get killed.
[00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:05.174]  We didn't even see it until Blitzer said, well, you know, the cops need to be more responsive and people stopped shooting them in mass.
[00:09:05.174 --> 00:09:06.615]  Remember that like five years ago?
[00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:07.896]  The Black Lives Matter?
[00:09:07.896 --> 00:09:10.839]  Well, oh, they're so worried about this officer now.
[00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:11.859]  Oh my goodness.
[00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:13.581]  We need 30,000 troops permanently.
[00:09:13.581 --> 00:09:18.665]  We need the CIA to take out the insurgency to kill us.
[00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:20.266]  Hell, I got a clip coming up next segment.
[00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:28.050]  Where they actually say, use drones on us if we don't wear a mask.
[00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.512]  You're like, oh that's a joke.
[00:09:29.512 --> 00:09:32.076]  No, no, the left is spoiling for a fight.
[00:09:32.076 --> 00:09:33.298]  So they wanted our guns the whole time.
[00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.692]  Exclusive FBI visited home of Trump supporter who was working in D.C.
[00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:41.593]  but did not even attend the rally.
[00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:44.334]  Wow, they're letting everybody know, we're watching you.
[00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.515]  Every move you make, every breath you take.
[00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:48.095]  And here's another big article.
[00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:52.357]  Ex-CIA officers and current ones compare Capitol protesters to Al Qaeda.
[00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:55.618]  Call for counterinsurgency tactics including killing them.
[00:09:55.618 --> 00:09:56.939]  Like this old lady.
[00:09:56.939 --> 00:09:59.640]  Kill, kill, kill.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.261]  Get up and kill, Marine!
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.083]  But these guys never kill anybody, that's why they're lusting after this war.
[00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:08.305]  It's all analysts.
[00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:11.808]  But they do order the killings.
[00:10:11.808 --> 00:10:21.136]  And I guess when the Green Berets aren't wearing their red high heels or learning how to be transgender, I guess they'll probably follow those orders and come kill the American people.
[00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:25.659]  It'll be easy the first few they kill, but it'll just get a lot harder after that.
[00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:27.601]  Won't go too well.
[00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:30.764]  But I have a feeling all those military people actually aren't going to take part in this.
[00:10:33.285 --> 00:10:34.846]  Will they take part in killing Grandma?
[00:10:34.846 --> 00:10:37.148]  Will they feel like big men?
[00:10:37.148 --> 00:10:40.470]  Will they stand over her body full of holes?
[00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.753]  Maybe she'll have to be tortured!
[00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:50.698]  Maybe we can put her in like a little... bury her alive for a few hours until she tells us where the weapons are.
[00:10:50.698 --> 00:10:52.440]  We'll beat those dirty Americans!
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.801]  Just like those Vietnamese!
[00:10:54.801 --> 00:10:55.982]  Just like those Afghans!
[00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:57.043]  We'll beat them!
[00:10:57.043 --> 00:10:57.624]  We'll beat them!
[00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.185]  Don't worry with our red high heels on!
[00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.313]  And it's all part of degrading the military for the post-human system.
[00:11:05.313 --> 00:11:06.173]  Oh!
[00:11:06.173 --> 00:11:07.074]  All these big articles.
[00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:09.256]  There's so many articles I can't even keep track of.
[00:11:09.256 --> 00:11:10.437]  This morning I shouldn't have done it.
[00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:17.863]  I spent like 45 minutes reading articles where Roger Stone and I are the masterminds of the Capitol debacle.
[00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:21.165]  Of course the left are so stupid that they don't even understand.
[00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:29.491]  Why would we have the motive to make ourselves look like fools, you boobies?
[00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:31.073]  Unbelievable.
[00:11:33.217 --> 00:11:43.322]  Meanwhile, Senate Dems push through $1.9 trillion stimulus blueprint as Harris casts her first tiebreaker.
[00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:49.244]  Trump says he won't testify at impeachment trial, denying Democrats' request to answer questions.
[00:11:49.244 --> 00:11:53.466]  And I've got his letter here when he resigned out of FAG.
[00:11:53.466 --> 00:11:55.967]  Well, that's what they call it in Team America.
[00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:56.328]  Out of SAG.
[00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:05.168]  You gotta love this letter, so I'm going to get to that coming up.
[00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:17.134]  And continuing, the left is calling the Capitol riot an insurrection and a coup for a good reason, Town Hall writes, because that's what they are, is an insurrection and a coup against the country's very existence.
[00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:20.035]  Mostly peaceful violence and dueling double standards.
[00:12:20.035 --> 00:12:21.496]  We're going to look at that.
[00:12:21.496 --> 00:12:27.119]  Laura Ingram says Biden defense chiefs starting ideological and un-American purge of the U.S.
[00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:27.639]  military.
[00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.720]  When they say white supremacists, they mean white people.
[00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:38.238]  When they say white supremacists, they mean Christians.
[00:12:38.238 --> 00:12:42.961]  When they say white supremacists, they mean pro-America.
[00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:49.285]  And if the military is simply aware of this at the lower ranks and unifies, this could be a teaching moment.
[00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:51.346]  And if they don't take the bait.
[00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:54.148]  Same group that wants you to wear red high heels and tells you America sucks.
[00:12:57.099 --> 00:13:04.741]  Is open on the payroll of a consortium of multinational corporations in the process of bringing this country down just like they're doing every other country.
[00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:09.703]  And later we'll look at India going under Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030.
[00:13:09.703 --> 00:13:14.944]  They've been stubbornly fighting being consolidated and bankrupted as small farmers and business owners.
[00:13:14.944 --> 00:13:20.086]  And they're the model of victory just like the town grocery store in Naples, Florida
[00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:22.987]  Where there's no law, you gotta wear a mask.
[00:13:22.987 --> 00:13:29.169]  And there's regulations that if you say you have anxiety or medical condition, you don't have to wear it.
[00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:30.669]  But all these corporations want to enforce it.
[00:13:30.669 --> 00:13:33.390]  Well, now they're all mad that this one store isn't doing it.
[00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.151]  Just like the Trump rallies weren't.
[00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:36.711]  It is a beautiful sight.
[00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:42.253]  That is all coming up in great detail and all the different hyperventilating by Shep Smith.
[00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:47.615]  And the rest of it, it's going to be one hell of a transmission today.
[00:13:49.599 --> 00:13:57.947]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and we're going to come back and plow into this first big story, the incredible deception of these people.
[00:13:57.947 --> 00:14:07.716]  When I see an article about AOC Smollett, I think, oh, but didn't Hillary do that?
[00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:08.797]  Didn't Brian Williams do that?
[00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:09.978]  And now Joe Biden's done it.
[00:14:11.056 --> 00:14:13.497]  He was shot at and shot down in helicopters and everything.
[00:14:13.497 --> 00:14:16.178]  So we'll play some clips of these famous liars.
[00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:21.780]  Just remember what scum they are as they work for the Communist Chinese to shut down our industry.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.702]  Separately though, ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget that we are illicitly supported.
[00:14:25.702 --> 00:14:31.504]  I'm very, very thankful for your support and we have great products in this critical time for you and your family to enrich your life.
[00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:36.266]  My dad developed, he's a retired dentist, very high quality activated charcoal concentrated toothpaste.
[00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:37.647]  We're good to go.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.703]  of this broadcast to keep us on air as we try to diversify.
[00:14:57.703 --> 00:15:04.329]  So drjonesnaturals.com, drjonesnaturals.com or infowarsstore.com for the activated charcoal toothpaste.
[00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:05.390]  It really is high quality.
[00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.771]  It really is concentrated.
[00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:12.216]  It doesn't have the additives or the fillers or the aspartame or the fluoride.
[00:15:12.216 --> 00:15:13.717]  It's just really good.
[00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:15.179]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:16.860]  It is proprietary.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.262]  And separately, RocketRest.
[00:15:18.262 --> 00:15:20.524]  Hey, if you love Knockout and infowarsstore.com,
[00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.578]  Rocket Rest is even stronger.
[00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:26.422]  Some people like 50 proof whiskey.
[00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:29.427]  Some people like 100 proof.
[00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:32.291]  And that's basically the allegories there.
[00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:33.793]  This is Mike Tyson versus...
[00:15:34.974 --> 00:15:35.734]  Floyd Mayweather.
[00:15:57.677 --> 00:15:58.879]  I've got some bad news.
[00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:07.169]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:08.630]  But here's the good news.
[00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:16.900]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:23.265]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:23.965]  People love it.
[00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:25.246]  That's selling out.
[00:16:25.246 --> 00:16:28.648]  Despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[00:16:28.648 --> 00:16:32.691]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.952]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:35.753]  People really love it.
[00:16:35.753 --> 00:16:37.534]  It's extremely strong as well.
[00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:38.674]  It's selling out.
[00:16:38.674 --> 00:16:41.716]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:45.639]  It also funds the InfoWar and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.861]  So thank you all for your support.
[00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:55.668]  Please visit InfoWarStore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the InfoWar.
[00:16:55.668 --> 00:16:56.529]  God bless and good luck!
[00:16:58.697 --> 00:17:01.178]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[00:17:01.178 --> 00:17:04.259]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:09.881]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:12.142]  The subsection is PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:17:12.142 --> 00:17:13.722]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:15.583]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[00:17:16.383 --> 00:17:19.266]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply.
[00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:24.472]  In the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one-year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're gonna find.
[00:17:24.472 --> 00:17:35.185]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[00:17:35.185 --> 00:17:36.046]  So, prepare it, Alex!
[00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:38.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:23.634]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:18:23.634 --> 00:18:25.055]  Let me tell you how tyranny works.
[00:18:25.055 --> 00:18:31.298]  You can keep creeping along for a while, but then just like water suddenly boils at a certain temp.
[00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:32.439]  Boom!
[00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:34.520]  You're in boiling water.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.501]  Then it starts boiling over.
[00:18:36.501 --> 00:18:40.504]  And if you look at the world, it's going over the edge into a forced
[00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:49.272]  Artificial global collapse out of which they're planning to build their new world order.
[00:18:49.272 --> 00:19:01.985]  So first, what I want to hit here is the total lies of the Democrats and the globalists and how they've set the standard now to be rewarded for lying.
[00:19:01.985 --> 00:19:03.327]  AOC can't stop lying.
[00:19:05.376 --> 00:19:12.402]  Now claims Trump supporters planted bombs in D.C., even though no one knows who did plant the two what look like fake pipe bombs.
[00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:13.563]  But here's what's interesting.
[00:19:13.563 --> 00:19:14.864]  She knew she was in another building.
[00:19:14.864 --> 00:19:16.325]  She knew she wasn't there.
[00:19:16.325 --> 00:19:19.448]  She knew there weren't children's facilities she went to on the Texas border.
[00:19:19.448 --> 00:19:21.510]  She knew they weren't drinking out of toilets.
[00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.413]  Brand new stainless steel sinks.
[00:19:25.413 --> 00:19:26.995]  She's an actress.
[00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:29.317]  She's a front person like Greta Thunberg.
[00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:31.038]  Maybe a little smarter.
[00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:31.839]  Greta's autistic.
[00:19:33.968 --> 00:19:41.934]  But when you look at that, this is par for the course with Hillary, Brian Williams, Jussie Smollett, Biden now.
[00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:48.239]  So let's play this clip of AOC, and then we'll show you the latest clip.
[00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:51.802]  Yesterday, Biden saying he's been in combat.
[00:19:51.802 --> 00:19:52.863]  I know, I was there with him.
[00:19:52.863 --> 00:19:55.045]  We both got Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:56.886]  Here it is.
[00:19:56.886 --> 00:20:02.570]  I jump into my bathroom, and I close the door, and I just keep hearing pain.
[00:20:05.228 --> 00:20:13.471]  I opened the door when all of a sudden I hear that whoever was trying to get inside got into my office.
[00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:16.171]  And I just hear, where is she?
[00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:18.652]  Where is she?
[00:20:18.652 --> 00:20:27.935]  And this was the moment where I thought everything was over.
[00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:34.177]  That's Ted Cruz coming through the door.
[00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.911]  I mean, I thought I was going to die.
[00:20:37.911 --> 00:20:45.079]  That was Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, her dramatic recounting of her experience in her office during the U.S.
[00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.441]  Capitol riots last month.
[00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:55.651]  But critics and lawmakers are accusing her now of exaggerating that story, pointing out that she was not even in the Capitol building at the time, but in the Cannon office building across from the Capitol.
[00:20:56.937 --> 00:21:00.120]  But they would never steal an election, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.823]  Even though they now brag about it in Time Magazine in a huge, giant report.
[00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:06.725]  Okay, we'll be going over, coming up later in the hour.
[00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.967]  Let's now move along to Joe Biden.
[00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.089]  You didn't know he was a combat vet?
[00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:11.810]  Never in the military?
[00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.991]  Yeah, he was shot at too.
[00:21:12.991 --> 00:21:15.233]  Even though they admit this story, is it true?
[00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.834]  He had to admit it years ago.
[00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:17.915]  Doesn't matter!
[00:21:17.915 --> 00:21:19.617]  Because here's the difference.
[00:21:19.617 --> 00:21:24.241]  When AOC got exposed the last two days, Paul Watson did a whole report on it, it's on InfoWars.com,
[00:21:25.928 --> 00:21:29.390]  And it came out she was lying about being attacked or even being in fear.
[00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:35.814]  She then went and said, report everyone on Twitter saying this, and Twitter banned thousands of people saying you cannot criticize her.
[00:21:35.814 --> 00:21:42.439]  And Snopes said it was true that she was under attack and that we were liars!
[00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:43.840]  That's right!
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.282]  It's all about rubbing your face in it.
[00:21:47.282 --> 00:21:48.303]  So I guess I'll get to the point.
[00:21:48.303 --> 00:21:53.326]  You talk about Smollett being a liar, or Smollier as a lot of folks call him.
[00:21:54.738 --> 00:21:56.099]  Here is Joe Biden, the war hero.
[00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:57.500]  Well, there you go.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:57.741]  It's Rambo.
[00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:28.018]  Five-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, 14 silver stars, 90 combat tours.
[00:22:28.018 --> 00:22:31.882]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you disagree with that, you are a white supremacist.
[00:22:31.882 --> 00:22:42.892]  Oh, so let's talk about Hillary, said that she was in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Balkans, and that she was shot at, but apparently they had footage of her landing, and there was no one shooting at her, no firing anywhere in the area.
[00:22:42.892 --> 00:22:43.173]  Here it is.
[00:22:44.298 --> 00:22:47.881]  Your initial account of a 1996 trip to Bosnia.
[00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:50.343]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:22:50.343 --> 00:22:57.448]  This newly released video debunks Hillary Clinton's recollection of a would-be dangerous encounter as first lady.
[00:22:57.448 --> 00:23:04.573]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[00:23:04.573 --> 00:23:05.874]  That was last week.
[00:23:05.874 --> 00:23:09.417]  Now confronted with new evidence, the New York senator is backpedaling.
[00:23:09.517 --> 00:23:13.200]  You know, I made a mistake in describing it.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:24.490]  I have said many times, I have talked about this many times, that we were, you know, very much told by the Secret Service and the military that we were going into a war zone.
[00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:35.860]  Clinton's campaign rival, Barack Obama, is blasting the remarks, saying they are all part of a pattern in which Clinton tries to exaggerate her role in policymaking during her husband's administration.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.201]  Oh gosh, lighten up guy.
[00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:38.763]  Yeah, these guys all fight with each other.
[00:23:38.763 --> 00:23:50.957]  And make no mistake, we're now in the third administration of Barack Hussein Obama, who, man, as bad as he is, he's not as bad as Hillary, but still, he didn't really get elected, so I hate his guts.
[00:23:50.957 --> 00:23:52.178]  But here's Brian Williams.
[00:23:54.087 --> 00:23:59.590]  Remember he said he was in a helicopter shot down by an RPG, then a group of helicopters got shot at.
[00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.050]  Turns out none of it was true.
[00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.472]  He's the fact checker on MSNBC and NBC.
[00:24:04.472 --> 00:24:05.633]  He fact checks the president.
[00:24:05.633 --> 00:24:12.816]  So when you're like the known liar of the planet, well then, you are the fact checker.
[00:24:12.816 --> 00:24:14.657]  Hell, you should go run Snopes.
[00:24:14.657 --> 00:24:16.198]  They're the only people that are bigger liars than him.
[00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:20.980]  Here it is.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.100]  See?
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:28.384]  Our colleague Brian Williams is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call on the skies over Iraq.
[00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:30.325]  Brian, tell us about what you got yourself into.
[00:24:32.577 --> 00:24:38.282]  Well, in the end, Tom, it did give us a glimpse of the war being fought, as few have seen it.
[00:24:38.282 --> 00:24:39.663]  We asked the U.S.
[00:24:39.663 --> 00:24:42.926]  Army to take us on an air mission with them.
[00:24:42.926 --> 00:24:43.887]  They accepted.
[00:24:43.887 --> 00:24:45.888]  We knew there was risk involved.
[00:24:45.888 --> 00:24:48.450]  We knew we would be flying over Iraq.
[00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.671]  We discussed it.
[00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:51.273]  We weren't cavalier about it.
[00:24:51.273 --> 00:24:55.857]  We took off, and that is right about when things started to happen.
[00:24:55.857 --> 00:24:56.797]  What's the weapon status?
[00:24:58.272 --> 00:25:01.695]  Right now it should still be locked and loaded on safe.
[00:25:01.695 --> 00:25:09.861]  Indeed, just before we're able to make our drop, radio traffic makes clear this routine mission is running into trouble.
[00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:11.822]  We took fire on the way in.
[00:25:11.822 --> 00:25:13.683]  We currently are not under fire.
[00:25:13.683 --> 00:25:17.086]  I say again, not under fire, but we'd look for some type of security.
[00:25:17.086 --> 00:25:17.846]  Over.
[00:25:17.846 --> 00:25:22.390]  We quickly make our drop and then turn southwest.
[00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.873]  Suddenly, without knowing why, we learn we've been ordered to land in the desert.
[00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:32.683]  On the ground, we learned the Chinook ahead of us was almost blown out of the sky.
[00:25:32.683 --> 00:25:39.268]  That hole was made by a rocket-propelled grenade, or RPG, fired from the ground.
[00:25:39.268 --> 00:25:45.513]  It punched cleanly through the skin of the ship, but amazingly... Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:25:45.513 --> 00:25:47.154]  Turned out that wasn't even true.
[00:25:47.154 --> 00:25:49.936]  And he later lied and said it was his helicopter.
[00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:51.477]  Okay, so everybody remembers that.
[00:25:51.477 --> 00:25:53.219]  Now he is the main fact-checker.
[00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:56.377]  Now, let's get real here.
[00:25:56.377 --> 00:26:01.682]  The truth is, if somebody's sitting in a TV studio, you can't question them.
[00:26:01.682 --> 00:26:08.730]  AOC, Biden, Hillary, Brian Williams, actually all are part of a secret Space Force operation.
[00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.071]  I was the captain.
[00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:13.755]  We went up into orbit to save the International Space Station last year.
[00:26:13.755 --> 00:26:14.696]  Here's actual footage of it.
[00:26:14.696 --> 00:26:15.156]  Can we show it?
[00:26:16.195 --> 00:26:19.759]  Uh, and the Earth was under attack, but we launched.
[00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:24.905]  We went up there and we, uh, we took the aliens out before they could, uh, before they could destroy the Earth.
[00:26:24.905 --> 00:26:26.186]  Okay?
[00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:30.771]  This is actual footage right here that you're watching of your TV viewer.
[00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:37.038]  Uh, this is what happened to the Earth, but, uh, Hillary had a time machine, went back in time and stopped it.
[00:26:38.046 --> 00:26:39.847]  Of course, none of that's true, but it doesn't matter.
[00:26:39.847 --> 00:26:43.350]  Because I work for Snopes, and I work for Brian Williams.
[00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.812]  And I am the fact checker.
[00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:47.554]  Of course, the truth is, the Globals do want to destroy the Earth.
[00:26:47.554 --> 00:26:48.515]  That's their plan.
[00:26:48.515 --> 00:26:50.296]  They work for old P. L. Z. Bob.
[00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:51.357]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:51.357 --> 00:26:52.538]  Please stay with us.
[00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:53.779]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:54.760]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.301]  We told you it was coming.
[00:26:56.301 --> 00:27:07.788]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them social distance and report them back to cell towers to track their every movement.
[00:27:07.788 --> 00:27:08.909]  This is for everybody.
[00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:10.450]  The wave gets better.
[00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:21.017]  Now France has programs in their factories, government-pushed and sponsored, to make everyone wear actual dog collars that make you social distance and report back to single computers.
[00:27:21.017 --> 00:27:22.678]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[00:27:23.198 --> 00:27:25.701]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[00:27:25.701 --> 00:27:26.762]  It's all being announced.
[00:27:26.762 --> 00:27:31.348]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[00:27:31.348 --> 00:27:36.834]  And big corporations now claim that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[00:27:36.834 --> 00:27:37.775]  Do you understand?
[00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:38.216]  It is a fact.
[00:27:38.636 --> 00:27:39.096]  We're good.
[00:27:55.936 --> 00:28:02.463]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[00:28:02.463 --> 00:28:08.489]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks and hundreds of stations picking us up.
[00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:18.939]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.944]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[00:28:23.944 --> 00:28:28.408]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[00:28:28.408 --> 00:28:42.861]  That's why it's so precious, because if censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do, it's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important.
[00:28:43.181 --> 00:28:44.182]  Which they are.
[00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:51.745]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[00:28:51.745 --> 00:28:53.605]  Because they're coming after everyone.
[00:28:53.605 --> 00:28:56.266]  So spread the word now.
[00:28:56.266 --> 00:29:04.450]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:29:05.734 --> 00:29:10.478]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:12.819]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:21.666]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:32.534]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:33.494]  Yes.
[00:29:33.494 --> 00:29:38.417]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:45.321]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:29:45.321 --> 00:29:46.382]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:29:46.382 --> 00:29:48.243]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:29:48.243 --> 00:29:51.065]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:29:51.065 --> 00:29:58.209]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:58.209 --> 00:30:00.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:31.556]  You know, I think it's fair to say that if we're ever going to get this republic back, we have to admit that we've lost it.
[00:30:31.556 --> 00:30:41.445]  You could fairly say, and I don't think it's open for argument, that this country was born on July 4th, 1776, and that it died on January 20th,
[00:30:50.202 --> 00:30:50.883]  2021.
[00:30:50.883 --> 00:30:55.725]  Richard N. Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:57.586]  By the way, guys, I've been meaning to do this for a week.
[00:30:57.586 --> 00:31:00.388]  It's in the workout area, workout gym.
[00:31:00.388 --> 00:31:02.609]  This building has a workout gym for the crew and myself.
[00:31:02.609 --> 00:31:03.809]  Small gym.
[00:31:03.809 --> 00:31:11.813]  I've got a desk in there, and on it is a foreign affairs publication of the CFR bimonthly.
[00:31:11.813 --> 00:31:13.434]  Has an eagle on the front.
[00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:16.436]  I'd like to show people that this segment if I can.
[00:31:16.436 --> 00:31:18.077]  So will somebody just go over to the gym,
[00:31:18.953 --> 00:31:21.494]  And on the table is a book.
[00:31:21.494 --> 00:31:24.115]  And will you please bring me the bi-monthly book.
[00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:26.435]  It's a book, not a magazine.
[00:31:26.435 --> 00:31:29.076]  And I will show you what I'm talking about.
[00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:35.718]  But just going back... I've been meaning to show this for a couple days.
[00:31:35.718 --> 00:31:41.660]  I keep forgetting to bring it over here.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.441]  Richard and Haas said...
[00:31:45.897 --> 00:32:01.602]  On the 7th of January, after the quote, most deadly attack since Pearl Harbor and 9-11, where one cop had a heart attack two days later and four citizens were killed because of a small riot, a giant crowd, a very small group rioted.
[00:32:01.602 --> 00:32:13.366]  He said that this you could mark as the end of America and American exceptionalism, but that's all they've been preaching forever.
[00:32:15.211 --> 00:32:16.472]  is the end of the country.
[00:32:27.655 --> 00:32:35.520]  And when they let China run these internal tariffs against us, and India, and everybody else, you don't have a chance to have meaningful jobs and businesses here.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:44.985]  And not with Agenda 2030, Agenda 21, that comes in with all these regulations that are designed, the system admits, to make it prohibitive to do business.
[00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:51.049]  Unless you're a globalist, multinational corporation that writes the laws, where you're basically exempt from it.
[00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:53.170]  And that's what's so frustrating about this new world order.
[00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:57.541]  Is that the Chinese people are being exploited.
[00:32:57.541 --> 00:33:01.863]  They're not giving all our jobs because the Chinese want to empower their people.
[00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:10.908]  They're doing it because they're slaves and are being used to leverage out control economically of the planet.
[00:33:10.908 --> 00:33:19.453]  And when you look at a Greta Thunberg or you look at a Klaus Schwab or you look at any of these people,
[00:33:22.708 --> 00:33:24.029]  They all have private jets.
[00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:25.169]  They live in big mansions.
[00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.591]  They have three, four, five kids.
[00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:30.993]  They live opulent lifestyles.
[00:33:30.993 --> 00:33:35.756]  But then they literally tell you, like John Kerry does, oh, no, no, no, I have a private jet.
[00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:37.797]  You just can't fly commercial.
[00:33:37.797 --> 00:33:41.099]  You can't go on a vacation once a year.
[00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:46.542]  And there's all these sycophants just worshiping these people.
[00:33:46.542 --> 00:33:48.623]  And they get away with it.
[00:33:48.623 --> 00:33:49.664]  And they get away with it.
[00:33:49.664 --> 00:33:51.705]  And they get away with it.
[00:33:53.098 --> 00:33:58.600]  And now they just believe it's their right to do all of this.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.281]  So here's the Foreign Affairs publication I wanted to show you.
[00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:04.523]  I was digging through one of my offices and found this from a couple years ago.
[00:34:04.523 --> 00:34:09.204]  This is a July-August 2019 issue.
[00:34:09.204 --> 00:34:15.687]  And you read this and it's all about how America sucks and America is over and how America is a worthless place to be and how we're a joke.
[00:34:17.093 --> 00:34:34.849]  And this is the ruling class in America that sold us off to foreign powers, made themselves fabulously rich, that is now conducting a purge of the military saying that white people and conservatives are inherently bad to divide and conquer all of us, while they dissolve the country's very borders.
[00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:36.891]  This is a takeover.
[00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:38.833]  What happened to the American century?
[00:34:41.118 --> 00:34:44.500]  And they just talk about how pathetic we are and how it's all over.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:53.686]  The truth is Trump had already reversed much of what they did and put the country back on a decent course, but they reversed the whole thing.
[00:34:53.686 --> 00:34:55.007]  Yeah, there's lots of other articles.
[00:34:55.007 --> 00:34:59.530]  The American Dream is an illusion.
[00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.011]  Don't stand up for your country.
[00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:02.012]  Let us sell it off.
[00:35:05.014 --> 00:35:07.875]  The self-destruction of American power.
[00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:10.776]  Washington squandered the unipolar movement.
[00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:15.437]  Oh, just the whole thing is how America's trash.
[00:35:15.437 --> 00:35:18.818]  And now we're going to show you your trash, because you're never going to reopen again.
[00:35:18.818 --> 00:35:22.459]  And China will be open forever.
[00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:24.059]  And so all the investment's going to go there.
[00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:28.881]  And it's real simple.
[00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:32.542]  Then all their investments are guaranteed.
[00:35:32.542 --> 00:35:33.662]  Stroke of the pen.
[00:35:35.982 --> 00:35:40.145]  Law of the land.
[00:35:40.145 --> 00:35:43.267]  Kind of cool!
[00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:49.772]  And so there is Biden right now giving a live speech at the White House about how he's going to give you all this free stuff.
[00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:54.215]  So let me see, you got one $2,000 check for the first half of the year being shut down.
[00:35:54.215 --> 00:35:57.438]  And now the next half of the year, end of this year, you're shut down and you get $2,000!
[00:35:57.438 --> 00:35:57.538]  But!
[00:36:04.497 --> 00:36:16.134]  Even though that won't pay for the average person for even a month, it all now goes into big box stores and Amazon and things that are allowed to stay open in this whole giant fraud.
[00:36:19.434 --> 00:36:40.342]  And so I'm going to hit the latest incredible COVID numbers of people fighting back and some real rays of sunshine with Oak Farm, Seed the Table, Tables Florida and how a movement like this expanding is how we're going to have our free society in the future where we have our enclaves, a free association where we do not submit, where we stand together and where we support each other.
[00:36:40.342 --> 00:36:46.064]  So I don't bring you all of this news and all of this information
[00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:51.526]  To be negative and to make you feel bad and to take your hope.
[00:36:51.526 --> 00:37:07.770]  The only hope you've got is being honest about how much trouble we're all really collectively in and understanding that any quarter, any support, anything we give the globalists will be used against us.
[00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.730]  This is a very
[00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:11.422]  Cold-blooded takeover.
[00:37:11.422 --> 00:37:13.323]  And these globalists don't like each other, either.
[00:37:13.323 --> 00:37:14.343]  I mean, they are mad.
[00:37:14.343 --> 00:37:14.943]  You read about it.
[00:37:14.943 --> 00:37:20.546]  Hillary, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, they don't... They'll come in and eat $500 dinner.
[00:37:20.546 --> 00:37:25.408]  They don't give one dollar tip.
[00:37:25.408 --> 00:37:27.249]  That's just the beginning of these people.
[00:37:27.249 --> 00:37:30.610]  They are just ruthless trash.
[00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.932]  The most soulless, hateful, inbred,
[00:37:35.643 --> 00:37:42.306]  Demonic people the world could ever imagine and that's why they lust after control of your body, your health, your mind.
[00:37:42.306 --> 00:37:45.108]  And that's why you cannot let them have it.
[00:37:45.108 --> 00:37:51.671]  And you have to understand that this is the animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:37:51.671 --> 00:37:53.992]  And that you get stronger fighting back.
[00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:55.973]  You don't get strong submitting.
[00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:59.475]  I know just two more months, three more months, six more months, a year, another year.
[00:37:59.475 --> 00:38:00.716]  Okay, five years.
[00:38:00.716 --> 00:38:02.517]  Okay, the mask never come off.
[00:38:02.517 --> 00:38:04.438]  Saki, the press secretary, we got that clip coming up.
[00:38:05.592 --> 00:38:12.076]  She said, oh, no, the mask never comes off, even to get the vaccine.
[00:38:12.076 --> 00:38:15.318]  It's never coming off.
[00:38:15.318 --> 00:38:16.079]  We're going to go to break.
[00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:17.720]  I just briefly again want to remind listeners.
[00:38:18.732 --> 00:38:22.014]  That I'm very thankful for your support.
[00:38:22.014 --> 00:38:24.396]  And without you, we will not be here into the future.
[00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:30.440]  I want to thank you for supporting us in buying books and films and t-shirts and non-GMO heirloom seeds and storable food.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.422]  All of it is the highest quality you're going to find out there for decent prices.
[00:38:33.422 --> 00:38:38.646]  There's always stuff that costs way more that you could say is better than storable food, but for the price, it's the best stuff out there.
[00:38:38.646 --> 00:38:39.547]  It's what I choose for my family.
[00:38:40.067 --> 00:38:40.767]  I would get prepared.
[00:38:40.767 --> 00:38:41.608]  I would get ready now.
[00:38:41.608 --> 00:38:44.429]  And I would support this broadcast and support local stations.
[00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:46.970]  We have TurboCharger Natural Defenses.
[00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.331]  These incredible new sales.
[00:38:48.331 --> 00:38:50.572]  DNA Force Plus selling out.
[00:38:50.572 --> 00:38:53.453]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the Rolls-Royce for yourselves.
[00:38:53.453 --> 00:38:55.554]  It is at 25% off.
[00:38:55.554 --> 00:38:56.335]  Selling out.
[00:38:56.335 --> 00:38:57.455]  Ultra 12 back in stock.
[00:38:57.455 --> 00:38:58.155]  Highest quality B12.
[00:38:58.155 --> 00:38:59.296]  Take it out of the tongue.
[00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:00.016]  For higher absorption.
[00:39:00.016 --> 00:39:01.117]  Read all the things that B12 does.
[00:39:01.117 --> 00:39:02.838]  This is the highest you're going to get.
[00:39:03.678 --> 00:39:04.238]  It's amazing.
[00:39:04.238 --> 00:39:05.959]  50% off.
[00:39:05.959 --> 00:39:10.322]  Liquid Pure Turmeric is selling out, but it's still massively discounted.
[00:39:10.322 --> 00:39:12.343]  The Powdered Turmeric Bodies is sold out.
[00:39:12.343 --> 00:39:17.286]  Lung Cleanse Plus, sold out back in stock.
[00:39:17.286 --> 00:39:18.887]  Sold out for a while, it's now back in stock.
[00:39:18.887 --> 00:39:20.348]  50% off.
[00:39:20.348 --> 00:39:23.990]  And we have the Trader Joe's t-shirt.
[00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.093]  But let's go out to break with, well let's come back from break with
[00:39:29.807 --> 00:39:37.290]  Joe Biden and some of the math he's engaged in, about 300 Americans, and he's got 200 million dosages for you.
[00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.651]  Doses.
[00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:39.851]  Wow, what a time to be alive.
[00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:41.772]  I'll tell you this, it's not going to be boring.
[00:39:41.772 --> 00:39:42.772]  Not going to be boring.
[00:39:42.772 --> 00:39:46.094]  They're coming for your guns and the rest of the speech.
[00:39:46.094 --> 00:39:48.615]  And they're openly saying they want to kill you and your family.
[00:39:48.615 --> 00:39:50.115]  And they've got a plan to carry it out.
[00:39:50.115 --> 00:39:50.856]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:39:54.076 --> 00:39:56.477]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:59.319]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[00:39:59.319 --> 00:40:00.059]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:00.499]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:00.499 --> 00:40:08.023]  I've been trying to get ahold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[00:40:08.023 --> 00:40:11.665]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[00:40:11.665 --> 00:40:19.949]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:22.750]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old going on 20.
[00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:26.052]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[00:40:26.052 --> 00:40:26.892]  We didn't know.
[00:40:26.892 --> 00:40:28.533]  We didn't screen your call.
[00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:29.313]  We had no idea.
[00:40:29.313 --> 00:40:33.375]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:34.095]  Living Defense.
[00:40:34.095 --> 00:40:34.876]  Living Defense.
[00:40:54.164 --> 00:40:58.045]  Globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[00:40:58.045 --> 00:41:00.606]  They are forcing mutations.
[00:41:00.606 --> 00:41:04.207]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[00:41:04.207 --> 00:41:12.750]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or are more moral.
[00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:13.411]  No.
[00:41:13.411 --> 00:41:15.891]  It's turning humanity into a commodity.
[00:41:15.891 --> 00:41:22.974]  Now we see some propaganda, like communist China bragging, Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen!
[00:41:23.454 --> 00:41:26.916]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[00:41:26.916 --> 00:41:33.841]  We'll say things that would happen to our troops, and thousands and thousands die each time they try a new experimental vaccine.
[00:41:33.841 --> 00:41:38.424]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[00:41:38.424 --> 00:41:41.566]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[00:41:41.566 --> 00:41:43.127]  But that's not even true.
[00:41:43.127 --> 00:41:47.570]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:52.974]  This is violence being carried out against us by medicine tyranny, and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[00:41:56.136 --> 00:42:02.701]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[00:42:02.701 --> 00:42:12.609]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the United States that had spread across the world from the UK to Brazil.
[00:42:12.609 --> 00:42:13.330]  They were desperate.
[00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.831]  They admitted their own publications.
[00:42:14.831 --> 00:42:17.052]  They didn't know what to do.
[00:42:17.052 --> 00:42:20.075]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law,
[00:42:21.391 --> 00:42:23.532]  And stole it better than Dallas.
[00:42:23.532 --> 00:42:27.374]  And now they're coming after the President, they're coming after you, they're coming after me.
[00:42:27.374 --> 00:42:31.415]  They're shutting everybody off the internet, they're trying to totally censor us.
[00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:35.497]  And that's why InfoWars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[00:42:35.497 --> 00:42:42.120]  We told you this was coming, we were the first main target, and we're still on air at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.823]  Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay on air.
[00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:55.530]  So while you still can, go to mfulmorestore.com and get storable foods and high-quality products, supplements, you name it, at mfulmorestore.com.
[00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.613]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America Coffee.
[00:42:59.613 --> 00:43:00.894]  I just love it.
[00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:01.915]  I can't get enough of it.
[00:43:03.029 --> 00:43:05.271]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:06.492]  That's what fills my mug.
[00:43:06.492 --> 00:43:07.653]  That's what fills my belly.
[00:43:07.653 --> 00:43:09.155]  That's what fills my soul.
[00:43:09.155 --> 00:43:11.097]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:43:11.097 --> 00:43:15.221]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:15.221 --> 00:43:15.841]  Years.
[00:43:15.841 --> 00:43:17.543]  Never raised the price.
[00:43:17.543 --> 00:43:17.843]  Never.
[00:43:17.843 --> 00:43:20.365]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[00:43:20.365 --> 00:43:21.547]  The crew here loves it.
[00:43:21.547 --> 00:43:22.748]  We drink it every day.
[00:43:22.748 --> 00:43:27.212]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:29.753]  Everybody drinks coffee, or just about everybody.
[00:43:29.753 --> 00:43:35.335]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend.
[00:43:35.335 --> 00:43:36.896]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[00:43:36.896 --> 00:43:38.157]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:39.217]  4.9 star.
[00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:44.920]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.901]  So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a 5 star, except maybe one or two people.
[00:43:48.901 --> 00:43:51.622]  Patriot Blend, 100% organic coffee.
[00:43:51.622 --> 00:43:55.064]  Only available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:58.149 --> 00:44:12.360]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.922]  Lockdowns can run on for a long time.
[00:44:18.354 --> 00:44:22.017]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:44:22.017 --> 00:44:24.960]  Run on for a long time.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.463]  Run on for a long time.
[00:44:29.463 --> 00:44:30.785]  So we tried to take the country back.
[00:44:30.785 --> 00:44:32.806]  We took large parts of the world back from the globalists.
[00:44:32.806 --> 00:44:35.348]  They counterstruck through fraud and stalled Joe Biden.
[00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:38.972]  Huge article at Time Magazine just bragging about it all.
[00:44:38.972 --> 00:44:40.632]  We'll cover it some next hour.
[00:44:40.632 --> 00:44:42.873]  Max Keiser is going to be joining us as well.
[00:44:42.873 --> 00:44:47.935]  But I want to take calls the first half hour, but I only want to put about six or seven callers on the board.
[00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:49.796]  So I don't make other people hold.
[00:44:49.796 --> 00:44:52.337]  Take six, seven calls, start of the next hour.
[00:44:52.337 --> 00:44:54.917]  The Max Keiser comes on bottom of the hour.
[00:44:54.917 --> 00:44:56.518]  Is America done for?
[00:44:56.518 --> 00:44:58.759]  Is America beyond the point of no return?
[00:44:58.759 --> 00:44:59.299]  I think it is.
[00:45:00.882 --> 00:45:04.866]  But unlike a person that dies, republics can rise again.
[00:45:04.866 --> 00:45:08.870]  But if we don't get back to God and back to common sense and back to reality, we have no hope.
[00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:15.317]  You know, I almost felt guilty after the show yesterday, reading you news articles out of the German news.
[00:45:17.017 --> 00:45:29.328]  Of Perth City, thousands of young boys taken in place with brutal pedophiles to live with pedophiles and be raped by them so that they would never be heterosexual and have children as part of a depopulation program.
[00:45:29.328 --> 00:45:31.450]  30,000 in one German state alone.
[00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:36.534]  The nuns delivering little boys to be gang raped by up to 30 men, 20, 30, 40 men.
[00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:37.455]  It's described.
[00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:39.216]  So they were bleeding everywhere.
[00:45:39.216 --> 00:45:40.718]  You think I want to tell you that stuff?
[00:45:42.469 --> 00:45:43.910]  That's what's in the police reports.
[00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.371]  That's what's in the confessions.
[00:45:45.371 --> 00:45:47.753]  That's what's coming out in these trials.
[00:45:47.753 --> 00:45:48.774]  That's the government.
[00:45:48.774 --> 00:45:49.915]  That's liberals.
[00:45:49.915 --> 00:45:55.399]  They're about selfishness and killing babies in the womb, out of the womb, killing old people.
[00:45:55.399 --> 00:45:56.960]  They're not the moral high ground.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.601]  They're monsters.
[00:45:58.601 --> 00:46:05.827]  And when you see them, and they look evil, and they act evil, and they don't look normal, there's a reason.
[00:46:08.885 --> 00:46:16.768]  Because they are turned over to a spirit of destruction and of raw seeking of power.
[00:46:16.768 --> 00:46:21.110]  Not because they're powerful, but because they're weak.
[00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.051]  Now here's Psaki.
[00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:26.433]  Every time I say this woman's name, it kind of ruins Psaki for me.
[00:46:26.433 --> 00:46:27.033]  I like Psaki.
[00:46:27.033 --> 00:46:28.053]  I don't like this Psaki lady.
[00:46:28.053 --> 00:46:30.334]  You know, she was one of the operatives under Obama.
[00:46:30.334 --> 00:46:31.035]  She's back in.
[00:46:31.035 --> 00:46:35.237]  She's the one making fun of her military and all the rest of it.
[00:46:35.237 --> 00:46:35.977]  She's the globalist.
[00:46:37.936 --> 00:46:39.277]  And she said, oh, no, no, no.
[00:46:39.277 --> 00:46:41.238]  The vaccine doesn't mean you take the mask off.
[00:46:41.238 --> 00:46:43.900]  The vaccine doesn't mean you stop social distancing.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.841]  Oh, no, because it doesn't help you.
[00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:46.462]  You see, here she is.
[00:46:47.376 --> 00:46:55.042]  What we're also trying to do is make our health and medical experts available to ensure people understand, and I'll reiterate it here today, it's not just a vaccine.
[00:46:55.042 --> 00:47:00.126]  It's obviously an incredible medical breakthrough, and we want every American to have one.
[00:47:00.126 --> 00:47:09.274]  But even after you're vaccinated, social distancing, wearing masks are going to be essential, and we'll need to continue communicating about that through health and medical experts.
[00:47:09.494 --> 00:47:10.517]  What do you say to those folks?
[00:47:10.517 --> 00:47:13.423]  What do you say to the folks like those that we saw in this video?
[00:47:13.423 --> 00:47:18.294]  I believe one of the folks who owns or runs that store who said he doesn't believe that 450,000 Americans...
[00:47:20.472 --> 00:47:29.339]  Yeah, all those big giant Trump rallies, and you guys make up your COVID cases with your fake PCR test, which you now admit is 96% fake, and so now you want anal swabs.
[00:47:29.339 --> 00:47:36.964]  It's always more, more, more, and the UN says they want rapid reaction teams to come in your house, and Bill Gates came out earlier this week and said that.
[00:47:36.964 --> 00:47:37.945]  I never played the clip.
[00:47:37.945 --> 00:47:39.386]  I'm gonna play it next hour, guys.
[00:47:39.386 --> 00:47:40.967]  Pull up that Bill Gates video.
[00:47:40.967 --> 00:47:45.010]  So, this is all going down.
[00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.434]  Now, if you look at this nice grocery store, Oak Farms' Seed to Table,
[00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:55.395]  It simply says, there is no law in Florida, and if you don't want to wear one, you don't have to.
[00:47:55.395 --> 00:47:59.197]  Oh my gosh, they're not buying into the cult.
[00:47:59.197 --> 00:48:00.037]  They're educated.
[00:48:00.037 --> 00:48:01.078]  They're into health food.
[00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:01.798]  They're happy.
[00:48:01.798 --> 00:48:03.779]  Almost no one is wearing a mask.
[00:48:03.779 --> 00:48:06.000]  If you want to be an idiot, go ahead.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.881]  But the globalists all use social pressure.
[00:48:10.114 --> 00:48:10.674]  Peer pressure.
[00:48:10.674 --> 00:48:13.236]  Were they worried about all the TB coming in out of the third world, killing millions?
[00:48:13.236 --> 00:48:16.277]  Were they worried about all the scabies, all the bubonic plague?
[00:48:16.277 --> 00:48:18.398]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:18.398 --> 00:48:22.020]  They're just worried about something they claim killed 400,000 people.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.801]  But as the owner said, that's pure bull.
[00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:25.442]  They're counting all the other deaths as that.
[00:48:25.442 --> 00:48:31.045]  We have the same number of deaths, roughly, in 2020 than we had in 2019.
[00:48:31.045 --> 00:48:31.845]  And that's the facts.
[00:48:31.845 --> 00:48:32.485]  They know that.
[00:48:32.485 --> 00:48:39.029]  This is all a giant lie, but they're habituating hysteria and hypochondria over the common cold.
[00:48:40.213 --> 00:48:42.714]  And if you go to the wrong hospital, they'll intubate your ass when you got it.
[00:48:42.714 --> 00:48:43.655]  They'll kill you.
[00:48:43.655 --> 00:48:47.817]  Because they get $53,000 when they intubate you.
[00:48:47.817 --> 00:48:51.819]  You can hire the best hitman out there for $53,000.
[00:48:51.819 --> 00:48:55.501]  But that's why it's only certain hospitals that are doing all the killing.
[00:48:55.501 --> 00:48:57.322]  Like certain hospitals harvest the baby parts.
[00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:02.185]  Governor Northam is one of those doctors that ran a hospital that harvested babies.
[00:49:02.185 --> 00:49:03.786]  It's why they hired him.
[00:49:03.786 --> 00:49:06.648]  It's why he's passing laws that kill babies after they're born.
[00:49:06.648 --> 00:49:08.510]  This is a ghoul group.
[00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.292]  This is a science fiction horror movie.
[00:49:12.292 --> 00:49:13.333]  You're in 2021.
[00:49:13.333 --> 00:49:14.554]  It ain't cute.
[00:49:14.554 --> 00:49:16.796]  And only waking up.
[00:49:16.796 --> 00:49:17.376]  Well, stop it.
[00:49:17.376 --> 00:49:26.002]  Here's a little bit of a boil down that we put together with a little bit of scary music over it, because it's so scary to see free-range humans not covering their dirty pie holes.
[00:49:26.002 --> 00:49:26.363]  Here it is.
[00:49:27.176 --> 00:49:32.298]  We all fantasize about a time when we won't have to wear the masks anymore.
[00:49:32.298 --> 00:49:33.458]  It's not now.
[00:49:33.458 --> 00:49:39.060]  But some at a supermarket in Florida appear to have decided that the time is now.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:39.740]  Look at this.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:44.841]  This was the scene at Oaks Farm Seed and To Table Market in Naples today.
[00:49:44.841 --> 00:49:47.742]  NBC's Sam Brock took this video, which went viral.
[00:49:47.742 --> 00:49:50.423]  It looks like it was taken pre-pandemic, right?
[00:49:50.423 --> 00:49:52.744]  Most customers and employees not wearing masks
[00:49:53.184 --> 00:49:54.105]  At all!
[00:49:54.105 --> 00:50:04.690]  The scene inside Oaks Farm's Seed to Table Market, taken less than 24 hours ago, shows employees and customers, young and old, almost entirely without masks.
[00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.673]  The store's policy includes mask exemption guidelines.
[00:50:08.673 --> 00:50:16.977]  The sign says if you have a medical condition that you don't have to wear a mask, and nobody inside will ask about medical conditions, so masks are not enforced.
[00:50:16.977 --> 00:50:20.019]  The owner told Sam Brock this when questioned about the policy.
[00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:26.400]  Is your position then about medical exemptions or is it about the fact that you don't think masks work and that the virus is not a real option?
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:32.464]  I know that the masks don't work and I know that the virus has not killed 400,000 people in this country.
[00:50:32.464 --> 00:50:33.885]  That's total hogwash.
[00:50:33.885 --> 00:50:39.809]  And Mr. Roach faced backlash from this community before, not just for his positions on COVID and masks.
[00:50:40.129 --> 00:50:44.871]  But also for how he's characterized the social justice movement as well, dickhead.
[00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:49.292]  Florida does not have a mask mandate, but masks do work.
[00:50:49.292 --> 00:50:51.553]  The science is crystal clear.
[00:50:51.553 --> 00:51:00.757]  In July, the CDC director said the United States could get COVID under control in four to eight weeks if we would only all wear masks.
[00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:04.318]  And standard houses, which we did, and of course it didn't fix anything.
[00:51:04.318 --> 00:51:06.579]  Except bankrupt the whole planet, which you guys doubled your money on.
[00:51:07.327 --> 00:51:08.969]  Shep Smith said so.
[00:51:08.969 --> 00:51:11.351]  No evidence of election fraud.
[00:51:11.351 --> 00:51:17.198]  And, oh, the ACLU came out and said it's true that biological men can be in women's sports.
[00:51:17.198 --> 00:51:19.440]  They have no advantage.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.023]  Guys, let's type in biological men in women's sports.
[00:51:22.023 --> 00:51:28.010]  Can we show some of the wrestling footage, the boxing footage, the bike racing footage, the 100-yard dashes?
[00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:34.699]  Where you'll have big dudes powerlifting, breaking national and international championships.
[00:51:34.699 --> 00:51:35.560]  Like, whoa!
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:40.244]  I mean, because these aren't just dudes that are effeminate looking that say that they're a woman.
[00:51:40.244 --> 00:51:49.411]  This is huge, giant dudes that were previously, in one case of powerlifting, was already competing at the collegiate level, and is now a champion!
[00:51:49.411 --> 00:51:50.432]  Oh, duh!
[00:51:50.432 --> 00:51:53.895]  I can't win as a boy, so I'm a girl!
[00:51:53.895 --> 00:51:55.416]  That's right, I'm a girl!
[00:51:59.013 --> 00:52:00.454]  What a circus, man.
[00:52:00.454 --> 00:52:01.615]  What an incredible course.
[00:52:01.615 --> 00:52:02.635]  This is, I guess, Minnesota.
[00:52:02.635 --> 00:52:04.196]  You got all the girls with their burqas on.
[00:52:04.196 --> 00:52:06.538]  And who used to put the Muslims down for wearing burqas and hijabs?
[00:52:06.538 --> 00:52:09.039]  Hell, we wear, men wear them.
[00:52:09.039 --> 00:52:11.341]  It's all a sign of submission.
[00:52:11.341 --> 00:52:15.864]  And there's so much of this footage, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:15.864 --> 00:52:18.566]  Yeah, here's some black dudes just smoking the girls.
[00:52:19.462 --> 00:52:20.123]  But it's alright.
[00:52:20.123 --> 00:52:23.407]  These black dudes could not beat the other black dudes in track.
[00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:27.952]  So they just said, hey, I'm gonna, you know, put some pigtails on.
[00:52:27.952 --> 00:52:34.080]  Put some blonde pigtails on and we're off to the races quite literally.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.263]  So, I just want to say that I salute the
[00:52:38.439 --> 00:52:40.200]  Oak Farms Seed to Table.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:45.144]  And I'm going to see if they have an online deal for anything like beans or seeds or anything.
[00:52:45.144 --> 00:52:47.525]  And I'm going to reach out to Seed to Table.
[00:52:47.525 --> 00:52:50.688]  And I'm going to see, I'm going to buy some stuff from them here in Texas.
[00:52:50.688 --> 00:52:52.369]  I'm going to reward not being cowards.
[00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:53.970]  I'm going to reward fighting tyranny.
[00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.871]  We need to get this duplicated.
[00:52:55.871 --> 00:52:59.193]  Now they know legally they can't make you wear a mask because of asthma or anxiety.
[00:52:59.193 --> 00:53:04.537]  So that's why when they first started this a year ago, they go, now don't make people at stores if they say they have a health problem.
[00:53:04.537 --> 00:53:06.599]  Oh, but still the virtue signal is still in force.
[00:53:07.574 --> 00:53:08.795]  They still enforce it.
[00:53:08.795 --> 00:53:10.537]  Even though it kills their bottom line.
[00:53:10.537 --> 00:53:12.059]  Everybody just goes to Amazon.
[00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:12.820]  They don't care.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.501]  They love it.
[00:53:13.501 --> 00:53:15.904]  The petty power of being able to do it.
[00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:16.584]  Coincidence!
[00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:20.289]  COVID death rates plummet in weeks following Biden's inauguration.
[00:53:20.289 --> 00:53:21.570]  Experts flabbergasted.
[00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.092]  But don't be fooled.
[00:53:23.092 --> 00:53:27.237]  They're going to take a little bit of pressure off and then clamp that sucker down ten times harder.
[00:53:28.863 --> 00:53:30.424]  Five years at least.
[00:53:30.424 --> 00:53:40.068]  Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issues new statewide mask mandate one hour after state GOP voted to repeal previous mask mandate and so does the Supreme Court.
[00:53:40.068 --> 00:53:43.549]  But he'll just keep passing new laws even though he needs to be repealed.
[00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:46.090]  He needs to be withdrawn, recalled.
[00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.531]  He needs to be taken out of there.
[00:53:48.531 --> 00:53:52.152]  These are all petty dictators, but the people are waking up.
[00:53:52.152 --> 00:53:54.553]  But we need prosecutions of Bill Gates.
[00:53:54.553 --> 00:53:55.974]  Prosecutions of Fauci.
[00:53:57.227 --> 00:53:58.629]  We need them to get in trouble.
[00:53:58.629 --> 00:54:06.441]  We need their emails, their coordination that have come out about how they're doing it for virtue signaling and to create control and to create fear and to vertically integrate.
[00:54:07.557 --> 00:54:10.057]  And to set the precedent to whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:54:10.057 --> 00:54:11.798]  See the full video of the horror.
[00:54:11.798 --> 00:54:16.959]  MSM freaked out by shocking video of maskless supermarket.
[00:54:16.959 --> 00:54:18.939]  And it goes on from there.
[00:54:18.939 --> 00:54:20.760]  So much to break down.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.800]  Alright, hour number two.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.600]  I got so much to tell you, I'm not even gonna tell you what's coming up next hour.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.921]  But there's just so much of it.
[00:54:26.921 --> 00:54:33.102]  But it's all extremely important on the upcoming impeachment trial on Trump's great letter resigning from the
[00:54:34.002 --> 00:54:38.425]  Screen Actors Guild and the CIA plan to kill you and your family.
[00:54:38.425 --> 00:54:39.045]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:45.669]  Stay with us.
[00:54:45.669 --> 00:54:48.170]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:51.252]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[00:54:51.252 --> 00:54:56.875]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at info or store dot com.
[00:54:56.875 --> 00:54:59.117]  The subsection is prepared with Alex dot com.
[00:54:59.117 --> 00:55:00.697]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.579]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare,
[00:55:03.379 --> 00:55:07.423]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply in the last 25 years.
[00:55:07.423 --> 00:55:11.447]  One month, three months, six months, one-year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[00:55:11.447 --> 00:55:22.177]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[00:55:22.177 --> 00:55:23.699]  So, prepareitalex.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:25.780]  We're good to go.
[00:55:46.656 --> 00:55:53.963]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search engine the term Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[00:55:53.963 --> 00:56:02.111]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd, Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying,
[00:56:02.831 --> 00:56:06.134]  That they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[00:56:06.134 --> 00:56:08.816]  That they want businessmen technocrats over them.
[00:56:08.816 --> 00:56:10.077]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[00:56:10.077 --> 00:56:15.562]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[00:56:15.562 --> 00:56:18.284]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[00:56:19.395 --> 00:56:24.519]  He believes, because he's hidden it to blame you, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[00:56:24.519 --> 00:56:26.280]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.102]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[00:56:28.102 --> 00:56:32.625]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[00:56:32.625 --> 00:56:36.168]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism, in his own words.
[00:56:36.168 --> 00:56:41.592]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[00:56:41.592 --> 00:56:44.094]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:57.529]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:57.529 --> 00:57:01.333]  And we are back live at hour number two.
[00:57:01.333 --> 00:57:08.920]  Max Keiser joins us at the bottom of the hour, but I want to take your calls on the future of America, the gun grab, the global government, the urge of the U.S.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.562]  military.
[00:57:10.562 --> 00:57:12.283]  How much worse is it going to get and how fast?
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:13.960]  We're in it now.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.721]  The New World Order.
[00:57:14.721 --> 00:57:15.261]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:15.261 --> 00:57:16.101]  877-789-Alex.
[00:57:16.101 --> 00:57:17.342]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:17.342 --> 00:57:27.966]  First-time callers, I'm going to take six, seven calls in segment two and three.
[00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:30.788]  That's all the calls we're going to take right now because I don't want you to sit on hold.
[00:57:30.788 --> 00:57:38.691]  And then later, I'll open the phones back up again for some questions for Max Keiser on the economy in the third hour with him.
[00:57:38.691 --> 00:57:40.452]  But he comes up joining us to talk about
[00:57:40.652 --> 00:57:42.055]  All these big issues.
[00:57:42.055 --> 00:57:46.606]  Here is a very, very important report by Brian Wilson.
[00:57:46.606 --> 00:57:46.987]  It's short.
[00:57:47.793 --> 00:57:49.414]  But it's powerful.
[00:57:49.414 --> 00:57:53.576]  It's at band.video in the Brian Wilson section, one of our editors and researchers.
[00:57:53.576 --> 00:57:55.457]  It also puts out reports.
[00:57:55.457 --> 00:57:57.918]  And it deals with Christian persecution.
[00:57:57.918 --> 00:58:02.040]  Will Christian persecution continue to escalate?
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.062]  And that really is the heart of this because the globalists have done all the numbers for a while.
[00:58:06.062 --> 00:58:11.025]  They know Christians are going to oppose their whole global government takeover.
[00:58:11.025 --> 00:58:11.765]  So here's that report.
[00:58:12.679 --> 00:58:18.285]  Will Christian persecution continue to rise in 2021?
[00:58:18.285 --> 00:58:27.716]  According to the watchdog organization Open Doors USA, the number of Christians murdered for their faith around the world rose 60% in 2020.
[00:58:30.859 --> 00:58:37.844]  A lot of this persecution is centered in Africa, which was one of the first places to receive the gospel.
[00:58:37.844 --> 00:58:45.990]  In July of 2020, 300 Christians were killed in Nigeria, and thousands were forced to leave their homes.
[00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:53.135]  Nearly 2,000 Christians were shot or hacked to death in raids on their villages since January of 2020.
[00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:56.819]  As a way to drive them off their farmland.
[00:58:56.819 --> 00:59:07.089]  On December 15th of 2020, federal troops in Ethiopia surrounded the Mariam of Zion Cathedral in the Tigrayan city of Aksum.
[00:59:07.089 --> 00:59:14.856]  They then forced the Christians into a square outside the cathedral, where they opened fire on the crowd, killing at least 750 people.
[00:59:16.818 --> 00:59:33.108]  At the beginning of 2021, within less than three weeks, more than 100 Congolese in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo were killed by an Islamic extremist group with a clear Islamic expansionist agenda.
[00:59:33.348 --> 00:59:39.357]  An average of a dozen Christians a day are murdered across Africa due to their religious beliefs.
[00:59:39.357 --> 00:59:42.822]  And unfortunately, this number is a low estimate.
[00:59:42.822 --> 00:59:49.672]  In Asia, the first place to receive the gospel, overall persecution of Christians is steeply rising.
[00:59:49.932 --> 00:59:54.256]  Leaving to the imagination what 2021 will be like.
[00:59:54.256 --> 01:00:01.722]  In 2019, Persecution Relief, a group dedicated to helping persecuted Christians in India, recorded 527 cases of persecution against Christians.
[01:00:05.525 --> 01:00:09.689]  Compared to 447 cases in 2018.
[01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:16.776]  Hundreds of Christians were taken to concentration camps in North Korea over the past year, same as the year prior.
[01:00:16.776 --> 01:00:24.664]  And tens of thousands of Christians sit in gulags, used for slave labor, similar to the Uyghur Muslims in China.
[01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:28.808]  The Chinese Communist Party surveils Christians across their country.
[01:00:29.028 --> 01:00:42.660]  ...forces Protestant churches to take down crosses from their interior and exterior, and even replaces the Ten Commandments with quotes from Mao and Xi Jinping, pushing for state worship.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:55.531]  In Western societies, big tech companies, specifically Facebook, are moving their way toward total Christian persecution by banning the posting of Bible verses from BibleHub.com.
[01:00:55.811 --> 01:01:10.265]  Similar to how the early Roman Catholic Church, and later the Holy Roman Empire, forbade the dissemination of the Word of God, keeping the Holy Bible to themselves, to be falsely interpreted by their own high priests.
[01:01:10.265 --> 01:01:16.791]  Just as Christians were ruthlessly persecuted in the centuries following the death and resurrection of Christ,
[01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:24.234]  It seems this new millennium has a similar intolerance for those Christians that choose to follow His righteous light.
[01:01:24.234 --> 01:01:43.722]  So as global government comes into fruition, God's people, whoever they are, wherever they may be, must come out of Babylon yet again, before they are compromised in the truth, forsake their faith, and are devoured by those beasts, those political systems that serve Satan.
[01:01:44.082 --> 01:01:48.486]  This is Brian Wilson with InfoWars.com.
[01:01:48.486 --> 01:01:49.987]  Alright, great job Brian Wilson.
[01:01:49.987 --> 01:01:50.568]  Stay with us.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:02:01.185]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:02.626]  You built InfoWars.
[01:02:02.626 --> 01:02:04.127]  You spread the word.
[01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:05.348]  You prayed for us.
[01:02:05.348 --> 01:02:06.729]  You bought the products.
[01:02:06.729 --> 01:02:07.869]  You called in.
[01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:09.230]  You made recommendations.
[01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:11.912]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[01:02:11.912 --> 01:02:20.078]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[01:02:20.078 --> 01:02:23.580]  With Band.Video, the redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.001]  With documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day.
[01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:31.342]  We are the resistance.
[01:02:31.342 --> 01:02:32.222]  You are the resistance.
[01:02:32.222 --> 01:02:42.364]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[01:02:42.364 --> 01:02:43.645]  It's not just a national treasure.
[01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:48.086]  It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it.
[01:02:48.086 --> 01:02:51.727]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:52.627]  So I salute you all.
[01:02:55.534 --> 01:03:03.557]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:24.243]  So, you can turn on MSNBC and CNN and every host is saying, use the CIA and the military to crush Trump supporters.
[01:03:24.243 --> 01:03:25.623]  They're all terrorists.
[01:03:25.623 --> 01:03:26.524]  There's an enemy within.
[01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:28.124]  Tune in to Tucker Carlson.
[01:03:28.124 --> 01:03:29.425]  He's covering it.
[01:03:29.425 --> 01:03:31.445]  More troops massing in DC.
[01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:35.407]  A purge of the military of conservatives.
[01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:36.747]  The pipeline's being cut off.
[01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:40.468]  The gas price is being exploded.
[01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:41.589]  All the reversals of
[01:03:42.512 --> 01:03:46.795]  Trump cutting the prices of prescription drugs.
[01:03:46.795 --> 01:03:47.956]  They pay the highest in the world.
[01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:49.377]  We're being ripped off by the establishment.
[01:03:49.377 --> 01:03:50.958]  It's not free market.
[01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:53.160]  It's all being reversed.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:53.901]  Open borders.
[01:03:53.901 --> 01:03:59.785]  The UN back in control with an executive order of our immigration system.
[01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:05.069]  Hundreds of thousands more refugees to be brought in by the UN.
[01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:10.954]  This is what it is to be a captured, occupied nation with a communist, Chinese, globalist, green zone that is now DC.
[01:04:13.697 --> 01:04:14.918]  That's the occupied area the U.S.
[01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.798]  has in Baghdad.
[01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:20.580]  Well, that's what this is here.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.501]  And we see incredible lawlessness.
[01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:34.366]  So in that backdrop of the stack of articles I have here, where current and former CIA calls for using counterinsurgency tactics.
[01:04:34.366 --> 01:04:36.827]  That means taking people's businesses away.
[01:04:36.827 --> 01:04:37.587]  It means killing them.
[01:04:37.587 --> 01:04:38.708]  It means arresting them.
[01:04:40.714 --> 01:04:51.158]  With all of that going on and this whole apparatus being turned inward on us as if it's supposed to intimidate us, I actually feel sorry for the globalists that actually kicked us off where they think they're about to.
[01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:53.339]  You talk about having a tiger by the tail.
[01:04:53.339 --> 01:04:55.300]  But okay.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.661]  They take our kindness and restraint for weakness.
[01:05:00.103 --> 01:05:04.386]  Now on top of it, they're talking about drone striking people that don't wear masks.
[01:05:04.386 --> 01:05:06.267]  Because, you know, things would turn back on.
[01:05:06.267 --> 01:05:13.112]  The economy would come back if you just stay in your house and be non-essential and let your business go bankrupt and take that check.
[01:05:13.112 --> 01:05:17.956]  And Klaus Schwab says, though, he says, no businesses with close contact ever are coming back.
[01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:24.140]  I'm going to play that clip next hour, actually.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:29.364]  This is being put in a larger new report that I shot with Rob Due this morning and last night on this.
[01:05:30.742 --> 01:05:39.237]  Yeah, the full videos on Infowars.com MSNBC host suggests targeting COVID lockdown skeptics like domestic terrorists with drones.
[01:05:39.237 --> 01:05:43.905]  Remember, Obama said, hey, I'm pretty good at killing people.
[01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.042]  Yeah, you give the order and people get killed.
[01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.062]  You're so manly.
[01:05:47.062 --> 01:05:48.643]  It's so scary.
[01:05:48.643 --> 01:05:49.243]  It's so tough.
[01:05:49.243 --> 01:05:50.804]  But hey, you're black, so it's okay.
[01:05:50.804 --> 01:05:52.864]  It's like Tim Cook runs giant death jams in China.
[01:05:52.864 --> 01:05:54.625]  It's like, hey dude, he's skinny.
[01:05:54.625 --> 01:05:56.066]  He hops around on the stage and he's gay.
[01:05:56.066 --> 01:05:58.067]  It's like, well, if he's running death jams, he's gay.
[01:05:58.067 --> 01:06:00.548]  Then that's a totally different thing.
[01:06:00.548 --> 01:06:05.250]  So let's go ahead here and play this MSNBC host.
[01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:08.451]  Forget what this idiot's name is.
[01:06:08.451 --> 01:06:12.933]  Saying that people that criticize the lockdowns and the mask will just kill us.
[01:06:12.933 --> 01:06:13.253]  Here it is.
[01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:25.097]  An MSNBC host suggested that Americans who criticise Covid lockdown should be treated as domestic terrorists and hit with drone strikes, and it barely even caused a ripple.
[01:06:25.097 --> 01:06:27.137]  Yeah, she actually suggested that.
[01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:33.280]  Nicole Wallace made the comments last week, but they haven't received one iota of the attention they deserved.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:33.700]  Take a look.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:52.038]  There is, until the end of April, a persistent threat of domestic extremism, domestic terrorism, carried out in the ideology and around this belief that the election was fraudulent, that the COVID restrictions are unnecessary.
[01:06:52.038 --> 01:06:54.500]  All of those ideologies pushed by Donald Trump.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.722]  But my question for you is around incitement.
[01:06:58.063 --> 01:07:18.596]  We had a policy, and it was very controversial, it was carried out under the Bush years and under the Obama years, of attacking terrorism at its root, of going after and killing, and in the case of Amr al-Awlaki, an American, a Yemeni American, with a drone strike for the crime of inciting violence, inciting terrorism.
[01:07:18.596 --> 01:07:23.619]  The way you root out terrorism is to take on, in the case of Islamic terrorism, kill
[01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:25.180]  Those who incite it.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:38.249]  So now they're literally comparing people who say, quote, COVID restrictions are unnecessary to Anwar al-Awlaki, a propagandist for al-Qaeda who was killed in Yemen by a US drone strike.
[01:07:38.249 --> 01:07:42.032]  And that's not to say that al-Awlaki's killing was even legally justified.
[01:07:42.032 --> 01:07:43.032]  It wasn't.
[01:07:43.032 --> 01:07:46.495]  Essentially, he was executed for posting YouTube videos.
[01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:48.196]  Okay, so, false video.
[01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:51.418]  He's at Band.Video in his Band.Video section.
[01:07:51.418 --> 01:07:53.299]  He's posting like three videos a day now.
[01:07:53.299 --> 01:07:54.179]  He's really turned the heat up.
[01:07:54.179 --> 01:07:55.280]  So great job, Paul.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.621]  That full video is posted to Band.Video.
[01:07:57.621 --> 01:07:58.962]  But you just heard it.
[01:07:58.962 --> 01:07:59.782]  And it's everywhere.
[01:07:59.782 --> 01:08:01.043]  Former Deputy Director.
[01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:03.264]  Current Head of Counterterrorism.
[01:08:03.264 --> 01:08:07.646]  All these guys are being quoted in here.
[01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:11.108]  I've read you the quotes about we've got to domestically kill people.
[01:08:11.108 --> 01:08:12.849]  And she's up there, this big warrior.
[01:08:12.849 --> 01:08:14.830]  She probably can't even load a gun.
[01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:15.771]  Probably never been in a fistfight.
[01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:17.552]  But she's like, it's time to start killing people.
[01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:27.601]  And they've got all these articles, I mean literally hundreds of them, I can't even count them all, major stories like Alex Jones and Roger Stone planned the Capitol attack.
[01:08:27.601 --> 01:08:31.044]  They need to be treated as insurgents and you kill insurgents.
[01:08:31.044 --> 01:08:33.307]  And I'm sitting there reading this, this doesn't scare me.
[01:08:33.307 --> 01:08:34.669]  It's like these people are nuts.
[01:08:36.442 --> 01:08:47.790]  We tried to have a rally against election fraud, we show up, a couple hundred idiots out of a million break through because the police were understaffed, and have a riot, and one cop dies two days later of a heart attack.
[01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:51.232]  They now admit it wasn't from the fire extinguisher.
[01:08:51.232 --> 01:08:56.256]  And you guys call this the end of the world.
[01:08:56.256 --> 01:09:04.882]  Meanwhile, we've got this current Obama-slash-Biden administration official saying that Al Qaeda is on their side.
[01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:10.211]  That's Sullivan.
[01:09:10.211 --> 01:09:12.212]  There's no end to these people.
[01:09:12.212 --> 01:09:13.872]  Yeah, there's NPR.
[01:09:13.872 --> 01:09:16.193]  Treat domestic extremism as insurgency.
[01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:18.554]  Kill them!
[01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:23.355]  Wow, you guys are going to war with the biggest armed country in the world.
[01:09:23.355 --> 01:09:25.755]  Wow, that sounds like a good job.
[01:09:25.755 --> 01:09:28.516]  That sounds like that'll be real safe for people to carry it out.
[01:09:28.516 --> 01:09:33.757]  Let's take some calls from Frankie, Blake, Luke, Michael, Ken, and Sal.
[01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:35.038]  I'm gonna go to you real quick.
[01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:36.158]  Let's go to Ken in New Jersey.
[01:09:36.158 --> 01:09:36.418]  Go ahead.
[01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:51.002]  Hey Alex, today I want to talk about building a brand new infrastructure to basically try to cancel out all the monopolies that the globalists have created.
[01:09:51.002 --> 01:09:53.725]  So I understand that InfoWars is
[01:09:54.474 --> 01:09:55.855]  You know, you guys are doing a great job.
[01:09:55.855 --> 01:09:56.495]  I love your show.
[01:09:56.495 --> 01:09:57.815]  I listen almost every day.
[01:09:57.815 --> 01:09:59.656]  Yeah, well, I can barely stay on air.
[01:09:59.656 --> 01:10:03.017]  It's real easy pie in the sky to say we gotta have all these big networks and infrastructure.
[01:10:03.017 --> 01:10:08.719]  We've got the biggest infrastructure there is, even of Newsmax or anybody, and it's pitiful.
[01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:09.880]  I'm not complaining.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.221]  I'm just saying, theoretical stuff's always great.
[01:10:13.221 --> 01:10:19.583]  Yeah, I mean, the fact that you guys are the biggest for the patriotic movement, it's insane.
[01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.864]  And the fact that all these
[01:10:21.693 --> 01:10:29.857]  Mainstream media corporations hold the monopoly and nobody has, you know, basically created an infrastructure for patriots.
[01:10:29.857 --> 01:10:31.778]  That's, you know, unheard of.
[01:10:31.778 --> 01:10:40.203]  So I feel like you have a voice, you know, other people in the patriotic movement have the money and the funds to create this infrastructure.
[01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:46.006]  I feel like we all need to pool our money together with individuals who would be responsible
[01:10:46.741 --> 01:10:53.006]  Well, let me tell you what happens when somebody tries to build something like this.
[01:10:53.006 --> 01:10:57.390]  They start coming after you with lawyers, they threaten your family, and they cut your credit off.
[01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:00.553]  So most people actually won't touch freedom with a 10-foot pole.
[01:11:00.553 --> 01:11:01.714]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:01.714 --> 01:11:03.695]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:11:03.695 --> 01:11:09.841]  So you have to be ready to be embattled, to stay on air, and just hope people promote that you're on air to circumvent the censors.
[01:11:09.841 --> 01:11:10.862]  Everything is the listeners.
[01:11:11.707 --> 01:11:15.173]  What I cover will end the globalist operation, it's the truth.
[01:11:15.173 --> 01:11:20.521]  But it only will do it if people, by hand, share the links, the articles, the videos, the information.
[01:11:21.414 --> 01:11:25.757]  And then if we had more infrastructure, we could be on more TV and radio stations and have more shows.
[01:11:25.757 --> 01:11:28.739]  But then that's like herding cats.
[01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:31.120]  Everybody's got different ideological ideas.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.922]  I never tell my crew what to cover or do.
[01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.963]  I have general directions I want to go in.
[01:11:34.963 --> 01:11:38.025]  Then you end up having your other host wanting to tell you what to do.
[01:11:38.025 --> 01:11:40.967]  And so, yeah, it's all theoretical stuff.
[01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:42.388]  It's all fine and dandy.
[01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:50.553]  I'm simply spending half my time trying to get money to pay to run this place.
[01:11:50.553 --> 01:11:53.435]  I mean, I crawl along, okay?
[01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:54.456]  I mean, crawl.
[01:11:54.456 --> 01:11:56.737]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:11:56.737 --> 01:11:59.259]  Just at least we can stay on the air for now.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.561]  So if you want to see us do more, go buy books and films.
[01:12:03.561 --> 01:12:04.322]  Go buy t-shirts.
[01:12:04.322 --> 01:12:05.502]  Go sign up for AutoShip.
[01:12:05.502 --> 01:12:11.344]  Additional 10% off on items you're going to want, like DNA Force Plus, Ultra 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:12:11.344 --> 01:12:13.965]  You sign up for AutoShip, additional 10% off the next order.
[01:12:13.965 --> 01:12:19.607]  And we hold back some of things that sell out, so you never sell out by signing up for AutoShip.
[01:12:19.607 --> 01:12:21.228]  Yeah, but I mean, I've got
[01:12:22.168 --> 01:12:24.610]  Three months of operating capital to run this place.
[01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:26.351]  Can't expand with money like that.
[01:12:26.351 --> 01:12:27.212]  Okay?
[01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:29.513]  And so, yeah, I've gotten these calls a lot over the years.
[01:12:29.513 --> 01:12:30.954]  Man, we need to fight.
[01:12:30.954 --> 01:12:31.895]  We need to build something.
[01:12:31.895 --> 01:12:33.936]  Boy, I sure as hell trying, brother.
[01:12:33.936 --> 01:12:34.677]  You hit my button.
[01:12:34.677 --> 01:12:37.959]  I'm not mad at you, but you just hit my button.
[01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:40.381]  I can't even launch a damn shopping cart.
[01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:42.563]  I can barely wipe my ass, man.
[01:12:42.563 --> 01:12:46.105]  Because this country's falling apart.
[01:12:46.105 --> 01:12:46.706]  We'll be right back.
[01:12:46.706 --> 01:12:47.066]  Stay with us.
[01:12:52.284 --> 01:12:53.465]  I've got some bad news.
[01:12:53.465 --> 01:13:01.756]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[01:13:01.756 --> 01:13:03.217]  But here's the good news.
[01:13:03.217 --> 01:13:11.487]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:17.872]  One is Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:13:17.872 --> 01:13:18.552]  People love it.
[01:13:18.552 --> 01:13:19.773]  That's selling out.
[01:13:19.773 --> 01:13:23.235]  But despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[01:13:23.235 --> 01:13:27.278]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.559]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[01:13:29.559 --> 01:13:30.360]  People really love it.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.121]  It's extremely strong as well.
[01:13:32.121 --> 01:13:33.261]  It's selling out.

[01:13:52.456 --> 01:13:55.759]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[01:13:55.759 --> 01:13:59.222]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[01:13:59.222 --> 01:14:02.865]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegory.
[01:14:03.902 --> 01:14:14.970]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:17.292]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:23.036]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[01:14:23.036 --> 01:14:29.261]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:30.682]  It's a total solution.
[01:14:30.682 --> 01:14:31.863]  All around the best you're going to find.
[01:14:31.963 --> 01:14:32.963]  Turbo Force.
[01:14:32.963 --> 01:14:35.224]  Without you, we don't roll.
[01:14:35.224 --> 01:14:36.924]  With you, we surge forward together.
[01:14:36.924 --> 01:14:38.965]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[01:14:38.965 --> 01:14:41.585]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[01:14:41.585 --> 01:14:44.606]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:45.626]  It's a win-win.
[01:14:45.626 --> 01:14:46.146]  360 together.
[01:14:46.146 --> 01:14:47.187]  Info or store.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:14:47.187 --> 01:14:48.527]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:08.639 --> 01:15:20.606]  I'm not mad at the last caller, he's absolutely right.
[01:15:34.048 --> 01:15:37.949]  We need networks and organizations that will tell the truth and lead the fight.
[01:15:37.949 --> 01:15:46.351]  That's why Brian Stelter and the globalists are saying shut down OAN, shut down Newsmax, shut down Tucker Carlson, shut down Alex Jones.
[01:15:46.351 --> 01:15:51.832]  And you saw as soon as Newsmax got attacked, they suddenly virtue signaled and rolled over.
[01:15:51.832 --> 01:15:53.773]  And that's because these people will come after you.
[01:15:55.256 --> 01:15:59.078]  And so, yes, absolutely, we need to be on more radio stations.
[01:15:59.078 --> 01:16:00.319]  We need to be on more TV stations.
[01:16:00.319 --> 01:16:02.420]  We need to put up a fight.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.340]  Here's the deal.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.601]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:07.022]  And Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:16:07.022 --> 01:16:11.424]  We had this global awakening of the New World Order, the child sex trafficking, you know, all of it.
[01:16:11.424 --> 01:16:13.746]  All this real stuff.
[01:16:13.746 --> 01:16:15.807]  The satanic heart of this thing.
[01:16:15.807 --> 01:16:20.709]  And then the Q movement came along three years ago and just said, I'm in charge, I'm the secret agent.
[01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.071]  People love something esoteric, talking into a hole in the wall.
[01:16:25.464 --> 01:16:30.486]  And it told him everything was fine and we were invincible.
[01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:36.268]  And so there was this bandwagon effect of everyone feeling invincible, but they didn't do anything.
[01:16:36.268 --> 01:16:41.190]  And then when Trump got it stolen from him, well then that deflates everybody and they feel defeated.
[01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:46.752]  And the Q leader said, just go home, it's all over, enjoy the last few years of fun.
[01:16:46.752 --> 01:16:52.414]  You were basically in an online Dungeons and Dragons game.
[01:16:52.414 --> 01:16:53.835]  Well, I talk about all that because
[01:16:55.151 --> 01:16:56.612]  I knew it was coming.
[01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:05.640]  You mean to have our archivist get a hundred clips of me saying, listen, the president's surrounded, he's outnumbered, they're going to steal the election, it's going to be a landslide, emergency, emergency.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.843]  I'm like, Jones, you don't talk the Q level.
[01:17:09.843 --> 01:17:11.725]  Actually, people walk to me like, in D.C.
[01:17:11.725 --> 01:17:16.009]  go, Jones, you don't know the power of Q, you're not in the group.
[01:17:16.009 --> 01:17:18.110]  And I would just be like, they'd have this crazy look like.
[01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:20.412]  I'm with the president.
[01:17:20.412 --> 01:17:21.733]  I'm with the secret group.
[01:17:21.733 --> 01:17:23.434]  And I'm like, dude, we're in trouble.
[01:17:23.434 --> 01:17:24.775]  I know all the inside stuff.
[01:17:24.775 --> 01:17:25.455]  Emergency.
[01:17:25.455 --> 01:17:27.497]  Believe me, we're surrounded.
[01:17:27.497 --> 01:17:29.478]  Only by waking up, we have a shot.
[01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.960]  And so I just deal with this.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.461]  They're going to cut your power off.
[01:17:33.461 --> 01:17:34.622]  They're coming for your guns.
[01:17:34.622 --> 01:17:36.443]  They're going to start a physical civil war.
[01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.684]  They're going to purge the military.
[01:17:38.684 --> 01:17:43.508]  I told you before the 6th, they were going to purge the military.
[01:17:43.508 --> 01:17:45.169]  I know what a globalist takeover is.
[01:17:46.852 --> 01:17:50.073]  We're getting our asses handed to us.
[01:17:50.073 --> 01:17:56.136]  And I know it's popular to tell people pie-in-the-sky stuff like Pchenik was doing yesterday.
[01:17:56.136 --> 01:18:00.738]  All I see is our country getting its ass kicked up one side and down the other.
[01:18:00.738 --> 01:18:02.579]  Soon as I start seeing different, I'll tell you.
[01:18:02.579 --> 01:18:05.460]  But I'm not gonna piss down your back and tell you it's raining.
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.881]  Never did it before!
[01:18:06.881 --> 01:18:07.721]  Never gonna do it!
[01:18:11.872 --> 01:18:16.014]  We have to totally reject the globalist Hollywood, all of it.
[01:18:16.014 --> 01:18:17.195]  The whole thing's poison.
[01:18:17.195 --> 01:18:19.836]  Reject it.
[01:18:19.836 --> 01:18:22.658]  That's what beats it, not fantasy land.
[01:18:22.658 --> 01:18:31.242]  Clarence in Wisconsin, where you're governor, just said, I don't care if the Supreme Court and the state legislature outlawed my illegal mask lockdown.
[01:18:31.242 --> 01:18:32.203]  It's going to continue.
[01:18:32.203 --> 01:18:35.124]  I got a new law, a new law, a new law.
[01:18:35.124 --> 01:18:35.885]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:18:36.724 --> 01:18:37.445]  Hey, Alex.
[01:18:37.445 --> 01:18:39.747]  Yeah, he needs to be recalled too.
[01:18:39.747 --> 01:18:45.172]  We're all tired of him, but living in a blue state now, I'm not happy with it whatsoever, Alex.
[01:18:45.172 --> 01:18:52.999]  But hey, buddy, I've had this conversation here, coming up here with many, from veterans to citizens to family.
[01:18:53.619 --> 01:19:01.726]  You know, I want you to think about this, and if there's veterans that are military active now and veterans from the past, you need to hear what I've got to say.
[01:19:01.726 --> 01:19:12.274]  You know, Alex, in World War II, we lost 407,000 men and women warriors, and they were fighting against fascism, imperialism,
[01:19:13.555 --> 01:19:20.279]  And certainly, what am I trying to say, the Italians, the fascism, okay.
[01:19:20.279 --> 01:19:25.663]  The Korean War, 54,000 men and women killed fighting against communism.
[01:19:25.663 --> 01:19:30.025]  Vietnam, 58,000 plus killed fighting against communism.
[01:19:30.025 --> 01:19:36.430]  Iraq, Afghanistan, almost 7,000 killed fighting terrorism, Alex.
[01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.910]  Middle East,
[01:19:38.728 --> 01:19:50.598]  This is a joke, that war, and we don't need any more of those, but we cannot forget our MIAs and our POWs, not to mention Arlington Cemetery, Normandy, France, all the men and women buried over there, too.
[01:19:50.598 --> 01:19:54.501]  You know, and I got a question for you, Alex, after my little spiel here.
[01:19:54.501 --> 01:20:03.329]  Do you think, I believe, and many people have given the answer on yes, have our men and women in the past that fought against all of these isms, have they died in vain, Alex?
[01:20:04.813 --> 01:20:09.435]  No, I don't think they've died in vain, because that's what I wanted to start the segment with, but I get so mad I didn't get to it.
[01:20:09.435 --> 01:20:13.856]  What the globalists are doing is super illegal, incredibly unpopular, and out of control.
[01:20:13.856 --> 01:20:28.242]  So if we just hold the course and expose the Great Reset, and the fact this is all planned, which is starting to happen with Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, I hope he hangs on for another 20 years, we need everybody, and all of you, if we just expose this is a plan,
[01:20:29.215 --> 01:20:35.881]  And expose that most of the medical workers say COVID's a fraud, but they censor them, then their whole house of cards comes down.
[01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:39.324]  They didn't launch this big desperate lockdown because they're strong.
[01:20:39.324 --> 01:20:48.072]  They're not trying to purge the military and marshal law and having the CIA on TV illegally say they're going to operate domestically and take on the people.
[01:20:48.072 --> 01:20:49.714]  That's not the sign of strong people.
[01:20:49.714 --> 01:20:54.739]  That's the strong of weak crooks who are being blackmailed by the Chinese communists to do their bidding.
[01:20:55.259 --> 01:20:58.781]  And so, for me, it's very negative, personally.
[01:20:58.781 --> 01:21:03.304]  For Infowars, we're in the front lines of a fight, and so I'm up the front lines.
[01:21:03.304 --> 01:21:04.325]  I live in the front lines.
[01:21:04.325 --> 01:21:08.428]  I live deep behind enemy lines, so I can tell folks what's going on, okay?
[01:21:08.428 --> 01:21:10.489]  Because I've been swallowed up by the New World Order.
[01:21:10.489 --> 01:21:11.330]  I'm on the inside.
[01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:12.571]  I don't even want to be.
[01:21:12.571 --> 01:21:15.052]  I am literally in the belly of the whale here.
[01:21:15.052 --> 01:21:20.316]  I can tell you what's going on, and that's why I want to let listeners understand how serious it is.
[01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:27.874]  If you speak out and say no, and everybody starts speaking out in grocery stores and church, everywhere else, then we turn the tide.
[01:21:27.874 --> 01:21:29.215]  It's all information war.
[01:21:29.215 --> 01:21:30.735]  It's all truth.
[01:21:30.735 --> 01:21:34.897]  If you don't, then all the horrible things I'm going through are going to reach you, okay?
[01:21:34.897 --> 01:21:41.120]  I'm just telling you, I'm already out ahead of you guys, and I've already seen what's coming, and it's not nice.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.241]  It's not fun.
[01:21:42.241 --> 01:21:44.182]  And so, God bless you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:21:44.182 --> 01:21:46.323]  Clarence.
[01:21:46.323 --> 01:21:48.464]  It's the best of times, worst of times.
[01:21:48.464 --> 01:21:50.105]  Blake in California, you're on the air.
[01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:50.405]  Go ahead.
[01:21:52.031 --> 01:21:55.852]  Yeah, Alex, you have been right about the purge, purge of the military.
[01:21:55.852 --> 01:22:01.653]  You've been talking about that for as long as I've been listening to you, you know, going back 15 or 20 years.
[01:22:01.653 --> 01:22:04.913]  Um, so that brings me to what I wanted to talk about.
[01:22:04.913 --> 01:22:07.934]  So Operation Trust, it's still going.
[01:22:07.934 --> 01:22:09.214]  Q is still going.
[01:22:09.214 --> 01:22:12.135]  It's just taking other names, other forms.
[01:22:12.135 --> 01:22:18.636]  But I mean, we got people out there that are basically saying the same thing as Q. And they're saying that the, you know, this counterrevolution or counter
[01:22:19.536 --> 01:22:20.017]  We're good.
[01:22:38.647 --> 01:22:52.354]  Here's the thing, if there's really a counter coup going on, I mean if the military is really getting ready to arrest everybody and they're getting ready to put Trump back in charge and arrest Biden, if this is really happening, why would they be telling it to us?
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.701]  I don't want them to tell it to us.
[01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:57.463]  If it's real, keep that damn mouth shut.
[01:22:57.463 --> 01:22:58.904]  They don't need to be telling you.
[01:22:58.904 --> 01:23:00.404]  No, no, listen, listen, listen.
[01:23:00.404 --> 01:23:03.967]  The military at the top is run by globalists completely now.
[01:23:03.967 --> 01:23:09.890]  And you see the Secretary of Defense saying, we're going to purge the Trump supporters out of the military.
[01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:10.911]  They have a 60 day
[01:23:13.326 --> 01:23:21.770]  Stand down, where the main job is searching the background of all your soldiers, airmen, and marines, and to purge them.
[01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:24.272]  So, again, world government's out in the open.
[01:23:24.272 --> 01:23:25.772]  Vaccine's killing you out in the open.
[01:23:25.772 --> 01:23:27.013]  Great reset out in the open.
[01:23:27.013 --> 01:23:33.877]  None of it's hidden, but everybody's like, I heard on an HN, I heard a Q code 97QL4DL9er.
[01:23:33.877 --> 01:23:35.117]  I don't listen to Alex Jones.
[01:23:35.117 --> 01:23:36.238]  I don't listen to documents.
[01:23:36.238 --> 01:23:37.478]  I don't look at facts.
[01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:39.560]  I don't look at the bill about to take my guns.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:40.300]  We're winning!
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.902]  We're winning, Eric, because people can't believe we're getting our ass kicked.
[01:23:44.902 --> 01:23:47.823]  We're actually going to win it again.
[01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:50.564]  I'll explain when we come back.
[01:23:50.564 --> 01:23:52.764]  You must guard your humanity.
[01:23:52.764 --> 01:23:55.625]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[01:23:55.625 --> 01:23:58.406]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[01:23:58.406 --> 01:24:02.548]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[01:24:02.548 --> 01:24:05.769]  But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poison the planet.
[01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:14.318]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth through the GMO crops.
[01:24:14.318 --> 01:24:21.306]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:25.551]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses.
[01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:28.562]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:55.428]  The Resistance not video.
[01:24:55.428 --> 01:24:57.652]  The Resistance not video.
[01:24:57.652 --> 01:24:59.835]  The Resistance not video.
[01:24:59.835 --> 01:25:01.999]  The Resistance not video.
[01:25:01.999 --> 01:25:03.681]  The Resistance not video.
[01:25:04.838 --> 01:25:13.844]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Ban.Video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[01:25:13.844 --> 01:25:18.647]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:22.990]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the Globalists are on our tail.
[01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:24.350]  I'm good.

[01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:56.348]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:17.715 --> 01:27:23.139]  I know it's scary to be going into a world government.
[01:27:23.139 --> 01:27:26.481]  You know, something Max Keiser said right before he went live with my producer.
[01:27:26.481 --> 01:27:27.861]  He said, I don't want to talk about U.S.
[01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:29.563]  politics.
[01:27:29.563 --> 01:27:35.426]  Well, neither do I. Because these presidents come and go.
[01:27:35.426 --> 01:27:41.490]  But the bureaucracy and the Pentagon now saying it wants to have the CIA kill citizens.
[01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:44.572]  And that it's with the Democrats and the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:27:45.911 --> 01:27:52.035]  It's just disgusting and illegal and the conservatives are fetishizing the military.
[01:27:52.035 --> 01:27:58.359]  When, yeah, a lot of our sons and daughters and aunts and uncles and fathers and mothers were in the military and were great people.
[01:27:58.359 --> 01:28:00.020]  But that America's gone!
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.923]  We're in world government now!
[01:28:03.923 --> 01:28:13.449]  And only facing that we're in world government, corporate world government, the gulag archipelago, the digital casino gulag that Max Keiser's talked about or Matt Drudge talked about,
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.900]  The internet gulag.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:26.182]  Only admitting that, and then ending partisanship, because I get Trump was a populist insurrectionist, but it got put to the side.
[01:28:26.182 --> 01:28:41.586]  Only reaching out to the average Democrat and saying, you think world government, you think China having an upper hand, you think the shutdown of the dollar, you think Wall Street being exempt from taxes, you think all of this is really empowering the people and is some idealistic system?
[01:28:41.586 --> 01:28:42.046]  No, it's not.
[01:28:44.551 --> 01:28:51.155]  And so it's now more important than ever that sentinels of news like InfoWars be on the air.
[01:28:51.155 --> 01:28:56.258]  And I know a lot of people didn't want to hear me when I told you Q was total lies run by the bad guys.
[01:28:56.258 --> 01:29:04.623]  And I know you didn't want to hear me when I said all those things, but it wasn't to be negative, it was to be truthful about how serious the situation is.
[01:29:05.987 --> 01:29:20.295]  So I want to get Max Keiser on, who's been a very successful, famous stockbroker, author, researcher, host of TV shows on BBC, and Al Jazeera, and RT, and the US, and everywhere else, and hosts big international shows as we speak.
[01:29:20.295 --> 01:29:31.821]  About 10 years ago, more than 10 years ago, but he really hammered it 10 years ago, about silver and the silver short squeeze being the key to bringing down this globalist oligarchy and these corrupt hedge funds.
[01:29:31.821 --> 01:29:32.202]  And now,
[01:29:33.536 --> 01:29:36.578]  I was like, a couple weeks ago, I said, watch, silver will be bigger than GameStop.
[01:29:36.578 --> 01:29:37.599]  And sure enough, it was.
[01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:43.722]  Because I said, Max Keiser called this, but a profit is always way ahead of their time.
[01:29:43.722 --> 01:29:46.064]  And he also called the first big run up of Bitcoin.
[01:29:46.064 --> 01:29:49.246]  He was on a year ago, called the next big run up of Bitcoin.
[01:29:49.246 --> 01:29:50.686]  This time, they didn't push it down as far.
[01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:57.791]  So he's here to give us his expert analysis on first big picture, please, sir, about where we are.
[01:29:59.261 --> 01:30:12.752]  The derivatives, the overhang, the bubbles, who's in good positions, who isn't, and just where we are and what individuals can do because I agree with you that talking about Trump ad nauseam, the Democrats want to do that.
[01:30:12.752 --> 01:30:22.119]  They want to just keep us back in Trump land so that we're not looking at what's currently happening and they want the diversion of this impeachment trial coming up when all of that now is in the rearview mirror.
[01:30:22.119 --> 01:30:22.980]  Is that what you're getting at?
[01:30:25.009 --> 01:30:25.410]  Right.
[01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:27.432]  Hey, great to be back.
[01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:28.914]  Great to see you.
[01:30:28.914 --> 01:30:32.018]  I think a couple of things are very interesting right now.
[01:30:32.018 --> 01:30:37.204]  The Wall Street bets phenomenon of the last week or so is really important.
[01:30:37.204 --> 01:30:37.965]  Really interesting.
[01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:42.150]  It exposed a lot of things definitively that needed to be exposed.
[01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:43.051]  And then, of course, the
[01:30:43.726 --> 01:30:49.469]  Silver squeeze came along and that is also very interesting.
[01:30:49.469 --> 01:30:54.552]  And of course, Bitcoin continues to be dominate the story.
[01:30:54.552 --> 01:30:56.293]  But going to Wall Street Bets for a second.
[01:30:56.293 --> 01:31:12.303]  So this is a group of Reddit traders that figured out that there was one particular stock that was vulnerable to having a lot of people suddenly buy it and create what's called a short squeeze because the hedge funds had sold short stock.
[01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:21.925]  But what this revealed, Alex, I think, was the existence now, definitively, we can talk about it, of naked short selling.
[01:31:21.925 --> 01:31:26.948]  Naked short selling is when hedge funds sell non-existent stock.
[01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.049]  They counterfeit sell orders.
[01:31:29.049 --> 01:31:40.316]  So in the case of GameStop, there was something like two times as many shares that existed entirely in the company's stock portfolio was sold on the market.
[01:31:40.316 --> 01:31:40.937]  So that was naked.
[01:31:41.914 --> 01:31:44.696]  And a lot of people have talked about this and said it doesn't exist.
[01:31:44.696 --> 01:31:48.739]  And the reason it's important is that it also dovetails into the silver story.
[01:31:48.739 --> 01:32:03.991]  So we've been saying now for years, the reason why silver doesn't really move the way it should is because there's an incentive by banks and Wall Street and central banks to keep the price of silver and gold cheap, as cheap as possible relative to the dollar.
[01:32:03.991 --> 01:32:06.533]  And they do it using naked short sells.
[01:32:06.533 --> 01:32:08.535]  They literally sell, in the case of silver,
[01:32:09.535 --> 01:32:21.842]  Uh, you know, 5 to 10 times annual silver production in one morning and in one morning selling spree, they will sell 10 times annual silver production in these naked short sales or counterfeit sales.
[01:32:22.469 --> 01:32:25.110]  To just bang the price down.
[01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:29.851]  And by the way, I said 10 years ago, you've been coming on for 15, 16 saying that.
[01:32:29.851 --> 01:32:31.931]  Bob Chapman was always hammering that.
[01:32:31.931 --> 01:32:33.071]  This is now mainstream.
[01:32:33.071 --> 01:32:44.274]  Back when you talked about it, nobody talked about naked short selling of silver to again take paper that they didn't take delivery of silver and use that to artificially lower the price, which then allows them to hide inflation, correct?
[01:32:45.495 --> 01:33:04.515]  Well, it allows them to keep the support of the dollar and to keep gold and silver away from people's investment capital, because if gold and silver were to really reflect the number of money that's been printed, and something like 30 or 40 percent of all the money ever been printed in American history has been done so in the last few years, right?
[01:33:04.515 --> 01:33:06.677]  So the money printing is off the charts.
[01:33:06.677 --> 01:33:08.279]  So what would gold be conservatively right now?
[01:33:09.778 --> 01:33:19.920]  Without the market manipulation, gold would right now be in the $2,700 to $2,800 per ounce level to be on the conservative side.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.601]  That's that's where it would be without the fake selling.
[01:33:22.601 --> 01:33:23.841]  It's around $1,800.
[01:33:23.841 --> 01:33:26.221]  So it'd be $1,000 higher.
[01:33:26.221 --> 01:33:32.523]  Silver would be already $60, $70 an ounce without this manipulation going on.
[01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:34.823]  And so the game stop in Wall Street bets.
[01:33:35.303 --> 01:33:37.586]  Very blatantly exposed.
[01:33:37.586 --> 01:33:41.390]  Massive fraud going on with, in this case, Melvin Capital.
[01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:42.471]  That's a hedge fund.
[01:33:42.471 --> 01:33:47.376]  When Melvin Capital had unrealized losses of a couple of billion dollars, guess who bailed them out?
[01:33:47.376 --> 01:33:48.718]  Citadel Capital.
[01:33:48.718 --> 01:33:55.946]  Citadel Capital bailed out Melvin Capital with money that they themselves got in a bailout from the federal government last year.
[01:33:56.539 --> 01:33:58.100]  Who orchestrated that bailout?
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.801]  Mol could be one of their board members.
[01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:03.724]  Ben Bernanke, former Fed Chairman, sits on the board of Citadel Capital.
[01:34:03.724 --> 01:34:05.385]  Who bailed out Melvin Capital?
[01:34:05.385 --> 01:34:12.911]  Who covered those exposure to the short squeeze, as it's called, from the Reddit crowd?
[01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:25.380]  And now there's a lot of coordination going on with Robinhood and all these other trading apps all working together, which is called anti-competitive behavior, which is technically illegal.
[01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:31.834]  To clamp down on anybody who threatens the sanctity of these hedge funds.
[01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:48.886]  And the hedge funds and the folks who run the major funds, like Citadel, are, as Eric Holder said back in 2008, Alex, under the Obama administration, he came up with what's called the Holder Doctrine, which states categorically that banks are above the law.
[01:34:49.406 --> 01:34:58.012]  That banks are too big to jail, that they enjoy a special status, they're systemically important to the economy, therefore a national security item.
[01:34:58.012 --> 01:35:01.954]  And then a revolving door goes into that law firm in D.C.
[01:35:01.954 --> 01:35:08.579]  where he gets paid himself tens of millions of dollars, they get paid hundreds of millions to then represent those very same banks.
[01:35:09.761 --> 01:35:10.401]  Exactly.
[01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:14.362]  So it's a revolving door between the public sector and the private sector.
[01:35:14.362 --> 01:35:16.743]  And a banker like Ben Bernanke is a great example.
[01:35:16.743 --> 01:35:19.524]  He went from being Fed chairman to sitting on the board of Citadel.
[01:35:19.524 --> 01:35:30.607]  We had Janet Yellen, who left being the Fed chairman, who gave speeches to Goldman Sachs and others for, we know, $800,000 she made in speaking fees.
[01:35:30.607 --> 01:35:32.368]  And now she's back at Treasury.
[01:35:32.888 --> 01:35:35.589]  So, it's a revolving door.
[01:35:35.589 --> 01:35:37.109]  They go back and forth.
[01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:43.491]  She should recuse herself from any of these proceedings because she's been compromised, but that's not going to happen either.
[01:35:43.491 --> 01:35:45.551]  All right, Max, we've got to go to break.
[01:35:45.551 --> 01:35:47.392]  We've got you into the next hour.
[01:35:47.392 --> 01:35:48.472]  Really happy to have you here.
[01:35:48.472 --> 01:35:57.175]  You're at orangepilldailydose.com, and you're at swanbitcoin.com, also at Orange Pill.
[01:35:57.175 --> 01:35:58.055]  You'll tell us about that.
[01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:07.474]  When we come back, but I just want to ask, million foot view, 35,000 foot view, one inch view, just in general, where the world is.
[01:36:07.474 --> 01:36:10.615]  I know it was volatile 15 years ago and we overvalued.
[01:36:10.615 --> 01:36:11.456]  Now, where is it?
[01:36:11.456 --> 01:36:18.539]  And all the hyperinflation behavior and all the government's printing crazy and no one is even worried about price earnings ratios.
[01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:24.181]  And it just, it has a feeling of Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe to me, but you're really the expert on this.
[01:36:24.181 --> 01:36:25.402]  And so I want to get your take on that.
[01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:29.011]  Obviously, I should get back into silver and gold.
[01:36:29.011 --> 01:36:31.352]  I mean, I already did that the last six months.
[01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.673]  I've been out of it for four or five years.
[01:36:33.673 --> 01:36:35.454]  But I could smell it, see it coming.
[01:36:35.454 --> 01:36:37.595]  But how high is it going to go?
[01:36:37.595 --> 01:36:39.675]  And yes, again, I'm not against Bitcoin, folks.
[01:36:39.675 --> 01:36:42.517]  I just get confused by the plethora of offerings.
[01:36:42.517 --> 01:36:44.397]  We'll talk about some of that with Max Keiser as well.
[01:36:44.397 --> 01:36:45.478]  Tell folks he's on.
[01:36:45.478 --> 01:36:45.818]  Be right back.
[01:36:50.666 --> 01:37:07.561]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply secure your own safe source of food supply sale it's the new prices in 2021 but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at info or store.com the subsection is prepared with alex.com and it's all these globalists do this and as they hoard the food and as they prepare
[01:37:08.362 --> 01:37:12.425]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply in the last 25 years.
[01:37:12.425 --> 01:37:16.448]  One month, three months, six months, one-year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're gonna find.
[01:37:16.448 --> 01:37:26.596]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[01:37:27.156 --> 01:37:30.458]  So, preparewithalex.com or infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:30.458 --> 01:37:32.519]  You can find the preparedness section there.
[01:37:32.519 --> 01:37:34.640]  Water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.761]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more.
[01:37:37.761 --> 01:37:39.042]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[01:37:39.042 --> 01:37:40.362]  It starts with self-defense.
[01:37:40.362 --> 01:37:41.703]  It starts with being prepared.
[01:37:41.703 --> 01:37:42.663]  It starts with storable food.
[01:37:42.663 --> 01:37:43.904]  It starts with digging in.
[01:37:43.904 --> 01:37:46.105]  With a long, globalist fight, you'll win in the end.
[01:37:49.266 --> 01:37:53.368]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[01:37:53.368 --> 01:37:55.729]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[01:37:55.729 --> 01:38:03.372]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[01:38:03.372 --> 01:38:07.254]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[01:38:07.254 --> 01:38:10.735]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[01:38:10.735 --> 01:38:13.156]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[01:38:13.156 --> 01:38:15.557]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought!
[01:38:15.557 --> 01:38:17.358]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine!
[01:38:18.118 --> 01:38:24.381]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[01:38:24.381 --> 01:38:25.321]  Okay?
[01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:29.903]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:32.184]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[01:38:32.184 --> 01:38:33.004]  These are real numbers.
[01:38:33.004 --> 01:38:34.285]  These are real facts.
[01:38:34.285 --> 01:38:41.668]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[01:38:42.168 --> 01:38:42.949]  Rebuke it.
[01:38:42.949 --> 01:38:43.770]  Stand up against it.
[01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:45.893]  This is slavery.
[01:38:45.893 --> 01:38:50.598]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[01:38:50.598 --> 01:38:53.501]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:38:53.501 --> 01:38:55.504]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:38:55.504 --> 01:38:57.086]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:38:58.405 --> 01:39:01.689]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:39:01.689 --> 01:39:04.833]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:06.395]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:39:06.395 --> 01:39:12.962]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:39:12.962 --> 01:39:15.766]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[01:39:16.823 --> 01:39:20.164]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:39:20.164 --> 01:39:23.085]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:39:23.085 --> 01:39:24.786]  That sends chills up my spine.
[01:39:24.786 --> 01:39:38.330]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:40.251]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:39:40.931 --> 01:39:46.173]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:39:46.173 --> 01:39:50.214]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:39:50.214 --> 01:39:54.055]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:39:54.055 --> 01:39:58.376]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:39:58.376 --> 01:40:06.879]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:40:07.239 --> 01:40:23.844]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:40:23.844 --> 01:40:34.887]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:40:35.387 --> 01:40:43.871]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:53.215]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:40:53.215 --> 01:40:55.857]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:05.745 --> 01:41:13.712]  It's the Alex Jones Show and legendary investor and Bitcoin captain Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:41:13.712 --> 01:41:17.115]  Let me throw this out there right now.
[01:41:17.115 --> 01:41:20.878]  It is more important than ever to keep independent media operations like InfoWars on air.
[01:41:22.208 --> 01:41:23.589]  And it is you, the listeners, that keep us on air.
[01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:25.030]  We don't have the big sponsors.
[01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:27.491]  We don't have the big sugar daddies.
[01:41:27.491 --> 01:41:27.912]  None of that.
[01:41:27.912 --> 01:41:32.275]  We are supported by viewers and listeners like you.
[01:41:32.275 --> 01:41:35.677]  And then I go out and I fight and I do all sorts of things behind the scenes.
[01:41:35.677 --> 01:41:38.919]  Just like it came out that I funded Trump rally against election fraud.
[01:41:38.919 --> 01:41:40.800]  They go, oh, you funded the insurrection.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.883]  No, they stole that from us and stole our victory.
[01:41:44.883 --> 01:41:48.185]  That was a horrible defeat, what happened at the Capitol.
[01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:51.007]  200 people out of a million being suckered into acting like idiots.
[01:41:51.926 --> 01:41:55.091]  But the point is, you noticed, it turns out, yeah, okay, Jones did fund some of that.
[01:41:55.091 --> 01:41:57.515]  That's where your money's going.
[01:41:57.515 --> 01:41:59.699]  And I need a lot of money to fight and prosecute this war.
[01:41:59.699 --> 01:42:02.985]  So I want to thank you all for your support, plus these are great products you already need.
[01:42:04.133 --> 01:42:05.374]  Ultra 12 has been sold out.
[01:42:05.374 --> 01:42:06.475]  It's the highest quality B12.

[01:42:08.376 --> 01:42:09.637]  It's sublingual.
[01:42:09.637 --> 01:42:12.219]  It's the next best way, other than injection, to take it.
[01:42:12.219 --> 01:42:13.420]  You don't take this as injection.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.821]  It's not designed for that.
[01:42:14.821 --> 01:42:16.382]  You take it under the tongue, sit there for a minute.
[01:42:16.382 --> 01:42:17.863]  It tastes sweet naturally.
[01:42:17.863 --> 01:42:21.225]  It is so good for your immunity, your body, your stamina.
[01:42:21.225 --> 01:42:22.206]  It's amazing.

[01:42:29.634 --> 01:42:30.795]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:42:30.795 --> 01:42:31.335]  It's amazing.

[01:42:32.336 --> 01:42:33.837]  Liquid Pure Turmeric.
[01:42:33.837 --> 01:42:35.038]  The Powdered Turmeric sold out.
[01:42:35.038 --> 01:42:35.779]  This is still available.
[01:42:35.779 --> 01:42:36.720]  Not long.

[01:42:43.846 --> 01:42:44.526]  Lung Cleanse.
[01:42:44.526 --> 01:42:46.848]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:50.851 --> 01:42:54.533]  I'm very thankful for your support and keeping us on the air.
[01:42:54.533 --> 01:43:00.715]  But the way this works is every time we get a surge of money that comes in, then the money stops coming in.
[01:43:00.715 --> 01:43:03.756]  And it's just like, I got to explain to folks, we need funds to stay on air.
[01:43:03.756 --> 01:43:06.998]  Without you, we cannot be here and be this independent voice in such a critical time.
[01:43:06.998 --> 01:43:10.139]  They're trying to shut everybody down and we're fighting hard to stay on air.
[01:43:10.139 --> 01:43:16.802]  Going back to Max Keiser, again, famous stockbroker, TV host, newsman, big picture for me.
[01:43:16.802 --> 01:43:19.103]  And then next time we'll get into the technicals and Bitcoin and all of it.
[01:43:20.345 --> 01:43:39.118]  I mean, you as just an American citizen, how would you break down where the globe is, what's happening in the leadership of the system, what Wall Street's about to do, how the Great Reset obviously ties into that to kill Main Street, and like the doubling of profits of big tech during the lockdown.
[01:43:39.118 --> 01:43:44.082]  I mean, to me, this is that super predatory Wall Street takeover you've been warning of.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.082]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:43:48.082 --> 01:43:54.530]  Every bank around the world is just printing lots of money and they do it in a coordinated fashion.
[01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:56.893]  And it's about debt monetization, right?
[01:43:56.893 --> 01:43:58.775]  They print money and then they buy it back.
[01:43:58.775 --> 01:44:00.978]  They put it back on the balance sheet of the central bank.
[01:44:01.684 --> 01:44:10.887]  And they do it really for only one reason, and that is to keep the major banks in these countries from having to officially declare insolvency.
[01:44:10.887 --> 01:44:12.367]  All the major banks in the U.S.
[01:44:12.367 --> 01:44:12.888]  and the U.K.
[01:44:12.888 --> 01:44:16.409]  and Europe are technically insolvent.
[01:44:16.409 --> 01:44:26.972]  But to keep the capital structure of those banks alive, the central banks create tons, you know, trillions and trillions of fiat money, and they cycle it through the banks.
[01:44:27.792 --> 01:44:33.937]  And the banks are able to continue operating and paying huge bonus money and huge salaries.
[01:44:33.937 --> 01:44:42.863]  But meanwhile, outside of the banks, the velocity of money, which is to say how fast the money is going through the economy, is almost at absolute zero.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.022]  Small businesses are being destroyed.
[01:44:47.022 --> 01:44:57.026]  The cost of stuff like education, healthcare, transportation, all the vital services that are part of the economy, the costs are skyrocketing.
[01:44:57.026 --> 01:44:57.746]  Max, slow down there.
[01:44:57.746 --> 01:44:58.427]  We've got time.
[01:44:58.427 --> 01:45:05.010]  Explain the velocity of money and the fact that while they're giving themselves all this money, none of it's trickling down.
[01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:07.491]  They did that on purpose, obviously, with the lockdown.
[01:45:07.491 --> 01:45:09.672]  So explain what's happening there with money velocity.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:22.928]  Right, so you have an insolvent bank and they need all the money they can get to keep their capital structure or their bond structure from having to declare insolvency.
[01:45:22.928 --> 01:45:33.556]  So the bank prints up lots of money and they say, hey, we're the central bank, we need to print all this money to stimulate the economy, to make the economy go faster.
[01:45:34.156 --> 01:45:44.319]  And so the way that the machinery of that works is that essentially the central bank creates the money and it goes to the banks.
[01:45:44.319 --> 01:45:47.059]  And the banks are in charge of distributing that money.
[01:45:47.059 --> 01:45:48.880]  But the banks don't.
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:49.940]  They keep it.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.280]  Because they can't afford to lend it out.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.581]  Because if they did, they would have to declare insolvency.
[01:45:55.464 --> 01:45:58.546]  So the velocity of money is at a standstill.
[01:45:58.546 --> 01:46:00.968]  It doesn't, doesn't go into the economy.
[01:46:00.968 --> 01:46:10.456]  And so, um, because the, because the money doesn't get into the economy, um, you don't have small businesses are not able to grow.
[01:46:10.456 --> 01:46:15.039]  So what happens is the government will say, well, small businesses aren't growing.
[01:46:15.039 --> 01:46:19.443]  So what we need to do is to stimulate the economy by printing more money.
[01:46:19.443 --> 01:46:23.666]  So they print more money and then they give it to the banks to distribute and the banks keep it.
[01:46:24.395 --> 01:46:27.441]  And the whole thing is repeated over and over again now for 20 years.
[01:46:27.441 --> 01:46:34.154]  And then Main Street goes bankrupt in the final phase and they finally buy everything up and that's the final bailout vertical integration.
[01:46:35.993 --> 01:46:39.317]  It eventually ends up being owned by one or two players.
[01:46:39.317 --> 01:46:43.020]  You know, we've called this in the past neo-feudalism, right?
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:50.288]  So it's like only a few players end up owning eight, 90% of the economy.
[01:46:50.288 --> 01:46:56.935]  And everyone else is living, you know, like a pauper, living like a, you know, a serf.
[01:46:56.935 --> 01:46:57.496]  And this is what
[01:46:57.956 --> 01:46:59.237]  We're seeing more and more of this.
[01:46:59.237 --> 01:47:04.240]  You know, a lot of the gains that were made over the past couple of decades pulling people out of poverty.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.242]  We've heard that expression many times.
[01:47:06.242 --> 01:47:18.690]  Well, now those people are going right back into poverty because the gains were completely artificial due to just an illusion that comes when you have a lot of money printing and it tends to seep out here and there.
[01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:27.516]  But now that it's all drying up and the banks are still there gobbling up all that liquidity, we're going into the situation where you have
[01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:35.418]  90% of the wealth is controlled by a few oligarchs, a few folks, and everyone else is really, really scrambling.
[01:47:35.418 --> 01:47:38.741]  So let me ask you this, because I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[01:47:38.741 --> 01:47:43.487]  You called this on my show 15, 16 years ago that this is where it was going at this certain point.
[01:47:43.487 --> 01:47:47.632]  They admit, Klaus Schwab admits, we're using the lockdown to consolidate and vertically integrate.
[01:47:48.132 --> 01:47:51.954]  It's for the earth, we're going to lower the carbon footprint, but they fly around in private jets.
[01:47:51.954 --> 01:47:52.754]  John Kerry does.
[01:47:52.754 --> 01:47:55.275]  That's their excuse for doing this.
[01:47:55.275 --> 01:48:05.820]  But clearly they're accelerating their vertical integration and this road to serfdom, and this high-tech feudalistic system that you've talked about, and it's moving so quickly.
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:07.761]  How the hell do they think they'll get away with it?
[01:48:07.761 --> 01:48:13.904]  I guess they just think the media will confuse people, claiming there's racism, and then we'll all fight with each other, and that's the distraction?
[01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:16.125]  Because this is incredibly predatory.
[01:48:17.375 --> 01:48:17.935]  Right.
[01:48:17.935 --> 01:48:20.836]  They think they get away with it or they get away with it with collusion.
[01:48:20.836 --> 01:48:21.056]  Right.
[01:48:21.056 --> 01:48:23.077]  So all the banks around the world collude.
[01:48:23.077 --> 01:48:25.578]  They're anti-competitive.
[01:48:25.578 --> 01:48:28.239]  They collude with each other.
[01:48:28.239 --> 01:48:33.461]  And now so here's I guess the difference between 2021 and maybe the years leading up to 2021, Alex, would be that
[01:48:35.914 --> 01:48:43.916]  The all of this money that's being printed by the World Reserve currency, the US dollar, and it's held by banks all over the world.
[01:48:43.916 --> 01:48:51.019]  Well, these banks all over the world are concerned that eventually all this money printing will result in some kind of hyperinflation.
[01:48:51.019 --> 01:48:53.519]  So they've been stockpiling gold.
[01:48:53.519 --> 01:48:58.821]  And they have been doing some deals with each other, bilateral deals outside of the US dollar.
[01:48:58.821 --> 01:49:00.581]  So at some point, maybe probably in 2021,
[01:49:03.146 --> 01:49:14.877]  Countries like China, Russia and others will decide that they really don't want to hold dollars anymore because they would prefer to just rely on their gold.
[01:49:14.877 --> 01:49:18.760]  And to some extent, I believe we can talk about Bitcoin in this context.
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.703]  And as Christine Lagarde has mentioned, Bitcoin is an escape valve.
[01:49:22.383 --> 01:49:22.823]  I think so.
[01:49:41.489 --> 01:49:46.555]  But just to finish that thought briefly, all those dollars end up coming back to the U.S.
[01:49:46.555 --> 01:49:49.178]  and then you see the inflationary spike.
[01:49:49.178 --> 01:49:52.622]  Then you see prices double and triple and quadruple.
[01:49:52.622 --> 01:49:55.266]  Start over, I don't know, start over.
[01:49:55.266 --> 01:49:59.731]  So once this process hits, once they start phasing out of the dollar, then that's when hyperinflation happens.
[01:50:00.472 --> 01:50:07.434]  A lot of the dollars over the years shipped overseas, you know, manufacturing went to China and world reserve currency is the dollar.
[01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:15.035]  But now we're at a phase where all those into a de-globalization phase, all these countries are basically de-dollarizing.
[01:50:15.035 --> 01:50:20.977]  And so at some point, probably in 2021, we're going to wake up one day and like four or five trillion U.S.
[01:50:20.977 --> 01:50:23.597]  dollars are going to be sent back to the U.S.
[01:50:23.597 --> 01:50:25.858]  And then suddenly our purchasing power will get
[01:50:26.338 --> 01:50:27.199]  Be demolished.
[01:50:27.199 --> 01:50:28.521]  And so what are you doing?
[01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:29.522]  You're in Bitcoin?
[01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:30.924]  Right.
[01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:33.747]  Well, there's three ways to protect yourself.
[01:50:33.747 --> 01:50:35.009]  Bitcoin, gold and silver.
[01:50:35.009 --> 01:50:44.220]  Now, the problem with gold and silver, as we've been talking about for a number of years, is that the prices are completely in the control of the same people who are doing all the money printing.
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.562]  Having said that, I think that
[01:50:46.122 --> 01:50:52.764]  They will do okay in this environment, but nowhere near as good as Bitcoin.
[01:50:52.764 --> 01:50:57.125]  Because Bitcoin, from here, you know, you're talking about a 40x return.
[01:50:57.125 --> 01:50:58.306]  You're talking about moves to $400,000, $500,000.
[01:50:58.306 --> 01:51:01.126]  Even Citibank has a price prediction for Bitcoin of $600,000 per coin.
[01:51:01.126 --> 01:51:01.947]  It's currently at $37,000.
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:11.421]  So, I mean, that's the fastest horse in the race, as Paul Tudor Jones called it.
[01:51:11.421 --> 01:51:13.601]  It's the one thing you can't confiscate.
[01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:15.162]  It separates... Well, stay there.
[01:51:15.162 --> 01:51:16.242]  I'll give you this.
[01:51:16.242 --> 01:51:22.804]  I was at Bilderberg with you 12 years ago, and you just laid it all out, the future.
[01:51:22.804 --> 01:51:26.405]  And you were drinking wine and eating a steak, and you're just like, Jones!
[01:51:26.405 --> 01:51:27.465]  Listen to me!
[01:51:27.465 --> 01:51:28.445]  Listen to me!
[01:51:28.445 --> 01:51:32.706]  I'm telling you this, and I'm like, eh, whatever, I'm not gonna... Alright, alright.
[01:51:32.706 --> 01:51:33.806]  Max Keiser's here with us.
[01:51:33.806 --> 01:51:35.747]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:51:39.349 --> 01:51:41.050]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[01:51:41.050 --> 01:51:42.432]  Thank you for holding.
[01:51:42.432 --> 01:51:43.933]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:51:43.933 --> 01:51:45.374]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[01:51:45.374 --> 01:51:46.615]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[01:51:46.615 --> 01:51:47.315]  How are you?
[01:51:47.315 --> 01:51:48.116]  I love you, man.
[01:51:48.116 --> 01:51:50.438]  I want to make a quick plug.
[01:51:50.438 --> 01:51:52.320]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:52:08.753]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[01:52:09.429 --> 01:52:14.831]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[01:52:14.831 --> 01:52:26.575]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive product in them.
[01:52:26.575 --> 01:52:28.336]  It's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[01:52:28.336 --> 01:52:33.037]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[01:52:33.037 --> 01:52:34.498]  So thanks for the plug.
[01:52:40.219 --> 01:52:54.229]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:56.250]  It's all now completely official.
[01:52:56.250 --> 01:53:01.034]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab.
[01:53:01.614 --> 01:53:07.259]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation and all the rest of them.
[01:53:07.259 --> 01:53:08.240]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:08.920]  It's here.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:14.305]  And only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[01:53:16.118 --> 01:53:22.440]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.621]  We must start valuing human life again.
[01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:31.524]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[01:53:31.524 --> 01:53:34.265]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[01:53:34.265 --> 01:53:37.686]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[01:53:43.146 --> 01:53:45.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:45.888 --> 01:53:54.555]  Alright, Max Keiser is our guest here.
[01:54:02.928 --> 01:54:18.300]  And let's get into some Bitcoin talk right now, that in the big picture of the economy, silver, gold, what he expects to happen with the lockdowns that are obviously designed to consolidate power and lower the velocity of money so inflation doesn't happen while the globalists consolidate power and they're able to buy everything up, pays for the dollar.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:25.425]  What about the issue with Bitcoin that a very small percentage own the majority of it, and so that we end up being back in the same area?
[01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:28.768]  I mean, do we know how distributed Bitcoin is, the original Bitcoin?
[01:54:30.836 --> 01:54:39.664]  Yeah, you'd have, first of all, of the 21 million that'll ever be created, it's estimated that about 4 million have been lost completely.
[01:54:39.664 --> 01:54:42.547]  I know I've lost a few over the years, and I know many people that have also lost.
[01:54:42.547 --> 01:54:44.128]  I think you loaded some of them on a laptop.
[01:54:44.128 --> 01:54:45.009]  Who the hell knows where they are?
[01:54:45.009 --> 01:54:47.852]  Well, yeah, that's another story.
[01:54:47.852 --> 01:54:48.893]  It's unconfiscatable.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.902]  Yes, there's a great story in Germany today.
[01:54:51.902 --> 01:54:59.750]  Somebody was, apparently the government was going to confiscate their Bitcoin, but he can't remember the passphrase.
[01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:01.652]  So the government's out of luck.
[01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:03.391]  And that's the story.
[01:55:03.391 --> 01:55:04.772]  It's unconfiscatable.
[01:55:04.772 --> 01:55:13.497]  But the distribution of Bitcoin, it does have some, some folks are, you see some concentrations, but that's changing all the time.
[01:55:13.497 --> 01:55:17.539]  And people like MicroStrategy just put a billion dollars into it.
[01:55:17.539 --> 01:55:22.903]  And you see the number of whales, people who have a thousand Bitcoin, that's at a new all time high.
[01:55:22.903 --> 01:55:27.566]  I'm not, I don't think that's not a really worry in terms of
[01:55:28.769 --> 01:55:38.993]  What you can't, nobody has greater access to how Bitcoin operates from the person who has $10 in Bitcoin or the person who might have a billion dollars in Bitcoin.
[01:55:38.993 --> 01:55:41.934]  Either one of those people, they cannot change the protocol.
[01:55:41.934 --> 01:55:43.035]  So you don't get power.
[01:55:43.035 --> 01:55:46.356]  If you have a lot of Bitcoin, you can't change the protocol, no matter how much Bitcoin you have.
[01:55:47.294 --> 01:55:49.275]  It's equal for everybody in that sense.
[01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:54.618]  The monetary policy of coins coming out every 10 minutes, that's immutable, never changes, nobody can impact that.
[01:55:54.618 --> 01:56:01.421]  So what do you make of Elon Musk a month or so ago saying, you know, me wanting to invest in Bitcoin, it was a beautiful girl, you know, on her rear end being a Bitcoin.
[01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:04.023]  I mean, what was he saying there, that he really wants to invest in it?
[01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:15.257]  He likes it, like a lot of smart people like it, because holding fiat money is going to guarantee you're going to lose 15-20% a year in purchasing power.
[01:56:15.257 --> 01:56:22.962]  But it doesn't matter if Elon bought $10 billion worth of Bitcoin today, he would not be able to influence Bitcoin in any way.
[01:56:22.962 --> 01:56:24.763]  Nobody can influence Bitcoin.
[01:56:24.763 --> 01:56:27.445]  The protocol that works it, the network,
[01:56:27.965 --> 01:56:28.265]  Yes.
[01:56:47.398 --> 01:56:52.242]  I can influence and lobby Washington, and I can get a law changed, or I can create a new law.
[01:56:52.242 --> 01:57:03.110]  And that's one of the reasons why the fiat money world has become so corrupt, is that once you make a lot of money, Jamie Dimon or somebody else can go to Washington, they can lobby, and they can take Glass-Steagall away.
[01:57:03.110 --> 01:57:07.993]  They can make it easier for them to do stuff that was illegal to begin with, right?
[01:57:07.993 --> 01:57:11.256]  With Bitcoin, you don't have that issue, because nobody ever changes it.
[01:57:11.256 --> 01:57:13.057]  It's set forever.
[01:57:13.057 --> 01:57:13.797]  It's not going to change.
[01:57:13.797 --> 01:57:15.739]  So you don't get power with owning
[01:57:16.238 --> 01:57:18.138]  Any additional Bitcoin.
[01:57:18.138 --> 01:57:19.679]  So that's not really an issue.
[01:57:19.679 --> 01:57:24.120]  You mentioned these other alternative projects that are out there that people talk about.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:28.360]  Only every single one of those projects has what we would call a single point of failure.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.041]  There's there are people involved.
[01:57:30.041 --> 01:57:31.501]  There's a headquarters.
[01:57:31.501 --> 01:57:33.501]  There's there's somebody in charge.
[01:57:33.501 --> 01:57:34.662]  And that's a vulnerability.
[01:57:34.662 --> 01:57:36.842]  That's what that you could get shut down.
[01:57:36.842 --> 01:57:42.163]  Only Bitcoin of all the projects is unique in that there's nobody at the center of it.
[01:57:43.184 --> 01:57:49.468]  The network is just repeated thousands and thousands of times all over the world and it's like guerrilla warfare.
[01:57:49.468 --> 01:57:53.751]  You knock out one area, it doesn't matter because it's already operating in another area.
[01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:59.342]  And that's why Bitcoin is unique, and you can't compare it to any of these other protocols.
[01:57:59.342 --> 01:58:05.823]  That's why I would say never look at any of these other protocols or projects or coins, because they're not as secure.
[01:58:05.823 --> 01:58:07.344]  They're all vulnerable.
[01:58:07.344 --> 01:58:12.725]  And if you're going to get into this, why not just go with the one that's the best?
[01:58:12.725 --> 01:58:17.446]  Why hasn't somebody else launched something with all the great, like, usually the first thing isn't the best.
[01:58:17.446 --> 01:58:18.726]  Other better things come out.
[01:58:18.726 --> 01:58:22.987]  And I've studied it some, but it doesn't look like the original Bitcoin is the most secure.
[01:58:22.987 --> 01:58:24.027]  That's a strange thing.
[01:58:24.787 --> 01:58:28.070]  Something, you know, 15 years old is still the best today.
[01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:38.380]  Max Keiser, we're back in 60 seconds to answer that question and talk about the incredibly crazy waters that planet Earth is cruising into.
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:44.326]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, your host, newswars.com, infowars.com, and band.video.
[01:58:48.817 --> 01:58:55.339]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[01:58:55.339 --> 01:59:01.360]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:11.803]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[01:59:12.603 --> 01:59:16.825]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[01:59:16.825 --> 01:59:21.287]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:29.691]  That's why it's so precious, because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[01:59:29.691 --> 01:59:36.614]  It's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[01:59:37.054 --> 01:59:44.623]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[01:59:44.623 --> 01:59:46.525]  They're coming after everyone.
[01:59:46.525 --> 01:59:47.447]  So spread the word now.
[02:00:05.811 --> 02:00:10.795]  All right, Max Keiser is the first guy to ever get serious with me concerning Bitcoin.
[02:00:10.795 --> 02:00:14.218]  And he's like, listen, you can investigate it, you can look into it like 12 years ago.
[02:00:14.218 --> 02:00:15.699]  I'd heard of it.
[02:00:15.699 --> 02:00:21.885]  And here we are all these years later, and he came on like a year ago, and he said, Bitcoin's going to explode again.
[02:00:21.885 --> 02:00:22.325]  It has.
[02:00:22.325 --> 02:00:24.867]  They tried to push it down, but not as much as last time.
[02:00:24.867 --> 02:00:26.749]  And I'm not here giving financial advice.
[02:00:26.749 --> 02:00:28.170]  I'm not here telling people what to get.
[02:00:28.170 --> 02:00:30.512]  Max Keiser didn't pay me to come on the show.
[02:00:30.512 --> 02:00:32.313]  I had to really beg him to come on.
[02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:35.571]  Bitcoin's great.
[02:00:35.571 --> 02:00:36.872]  Okay, let's talk about it.
[02:00:36.872 --> 02:00:37.232]  Whatever.
[02:00:37.232 --> 02:00:42.456]  But I really want his big picture view on gut level.
[02:00:42.456 --> 02:00:50.523]  Everybody always says the bubble's coming to an end, and now they locked us down to kill the velocity of money and expanded the bubble even more, so we're now in a false reality.
[02:00:50.523 --> 02:00:52.585]  But at a certain point, this thing's going to cave in.
[02:00:52.585 --> 02:00:58.269]  So we'll get back into Bitcoin in a minute, but Max Keiser, again, here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:58.269 --> 02:01:03.254]  What do you make of who's winning the currency inflation war, or is it already one unified global group?
[02:01:04.275 --> 02:01:12.793]  The US and China and the lockdowns and big tech doubling its profits under the lockdown and just Americans...
[02:01:14.187 --> 02:01:19.851]  Accepting and Canadians and folks in Europe accepting staying locked in their houses for a year.
[02:01:19.851 --> 02:01:25.395]  I mean this is and then a supermarket doesn't wear masks or says you don't have to so the whole world freaks out.
[02:01:25.395 --> 02:01:28.037]  I mean we're already in the dystopias my view.
[02:01:28.037 --> 02:01:32.040]  So you predict the dystopia was coming now that we're in the dystopia.
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:34.262]  What's your view of it and what's coming next.
[02:01:34.262 --> 02:01:36.003]  Like we're in the river of tyranny.
[02:01:36.003 --> 02:01:39.886]  What's around the bend or what's over the waterfall Max Geiser.
[02:01:39.886 --> 02:01:40.447]  Right.
[02:01:40.447 --> 02:01:40.907]  Well I think.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.142]  The difference really is the difference between de-globalization and globalization.
[02:01:47.142 --> 02:01:57.706]  So we had a period of globalization for really 30 years, particularly when China came in through the World Trade Organization under Clinton.
[02:01:57.706 --> 02:02:01.948]  They brought China in and we entered into this period of globalization.
[02:02:01.948 --> 02:02:08.010]  And so there's tremendous symbiotic relationship, if you will, between China and the U.S., right?
[02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:10.611]  We sent them their jobs and they sent us cheap goods.
[02:02:11.277 --> 02:02:18.859]  And even though wages in the US were flat, the goods, you know, the prices for stuff from China, like electronics and clothes and things like that, were falling.
[02:02:18.859 --> 02:02:28.140]  So people in America had a sense that their quality of life wasn't going down just because their wages were going down, because the price of stuff was actually going down faster.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:35.882]  But starting with 2016, the message was de-globalization.
[02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:40.903]  And this means that countries are more now going to be
[02:02:41.849 --> 02:02:46.393]  Competing with each other and competing with each other on technology.
[02:02:46.393 --> 02:02:53.660]  For example, China has their own technological standards with G5 and other technological areas.
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:55.062]  They're breaking away from the globe.
[02:02:55.062 --> 02:02:56.844]  They're not trying to create a globalized world.
[02:02:56.844 --> 02:03:02.169]  They're trying to create their own standards with technology and also in financial services.
[02:03:02.169 --> 02:03:06.473]  You know, Jack Ma over there at Alibaba, he's got Ant Group that combined.
[02:03:07.432 --> 02:03:10.073]  It's the biggest financial institution in the world.
[02:03:10.073 --> 02:03:18.736]  You've got like the Robin Hood of China, which is which is just now becoming a big company is servicing a billion users.
[02:03:18.736 --> 02:03:31.140]  So China is really, I think, feeling that it can break away from this globalized economy and really assert itself in a more of a de-globalized way and take control, take command of the global economy.
[02:03:31.938 --> 02:03:34.539]  And we see that in elsewhere.
[02:03:34.539 --> 02:03:36.400]  Countries are separating.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.642]  Now what this does is it removes a lot of the economies of scale for these economies.
[02:03:40.642 --> 02:03:43.303]  And so we see that right now in the commodities markets.
[02:03:43.303 --> 02:03:46.785]  So the commodities markets, commodity prices are starting to go higher.
[02:03:47.325 --> 02:03:53.932]  Because of this de-globalization and everyone essentially putting in the same order for the same thing because they're competing with each other.
[02:03:53.932 --> 02:03:57.236]  So we're entering into a secular bull market in commodities.
[02:03:57.236 --> 02:04:04.484]  All the commodities, agriculturals, precious metals, across the board, they're starting to enter into this secular bull market.
[02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:20.132]  That means that the ability for the central banks to hide this inflationary trend by buying back its own paper, monetizing its own debt, is going to become increasingly more difficult and probably impossible.
[02:04:20.132 --> 02:04:24.554]  And we know it's impossible because they're introducing something called negative interest rates.
[02:04:24.554 --> 02:04:30.077]  And a negative interest rate... And by the way, you predicted that on the show 10 years ago, hammered it 5 years ago.
[02:04:30.077 --> 02:04:31.157]  Now it's officially here.
[02:04:31.157 --> 02:04:32.418]  It's been here a few years now.
[02:04:33.378 --> 02:04:35.220]  Simply insane.
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:35.661]  It's growing.
[02:04:35.661 --> 02:04:44.189]  So $18 trillion worth of negative interest rates around the world and that trend is growing and the Bank of England is now saying they're going to introduce negative interest rates.
[02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:45.830]  So this is an admission.
[02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:47.412]  This is like waving the white flag.
[02:04:47.412 --> 02:04:55.920]  This is like saying we've run out of ideas and now we're just going to take money right out of people's bank accounts to service the debts of our banks.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:03.343]  Like I explained earlier, the banks are insolvent, but the government's in bed with them and they need to just shovel cash at them.
[02:05:03.343 --> 02:05:12.106]  And instead of just printing money and giving it to them, they're going to let them just take it directly from people's savings accounts and pensions, et cetera, through a negative interest rate.
[02:05:12.106 --> 02:05:14.367]  So that's really the beginning of wholesale.
[02:05:15.575 --> 02:05:19.516]  You know, organized global banking thievery using this.
[02:05:19.516 --> 02:05:32.159]  We have this organized UN, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, I know you're not a fan of, lockdown, clearly to consolidate the power to bankrupt Main Street, the crime of the century, the crime of the millennia.
[02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:34.020]  To me, how do you see that?
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:35.540]  Crime going.
[02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:39.341]  And if they're successful, what's the next phase?
[02:05:39.341 --> 02:05:45.582]  I mean, my God, if we don't stand up for ourselves here, there's no checks and balances by state government, by courts.
[02:05:45.582 --> 02:05:46.882]  I talk to state government.
[02:05:46.882 --> 02:05:47.743]  I talk to governors.
[02:05:47.743 --> 02:05:50.203]  These dudes don't know how to find their ass, Max.
[02:05:50.203 --> 02:05:52.064]  I'm not even thinking of myself that smart.
[02:05:52.064 --> 02:05:56.124]  You know 20 times more than I do about finance and banking and stock markets.
[02:05:56.124 --> 02:05:57.125]  I talk to governors.
[02:05:57.125 --> 02:05:59.065]  They don't know anything, brother.
[02:05:59.645 --> 02:06:01.846]  They go, oh, I talked to my broker.
[02:06:01.846 --> 02:06:03.807]  I mean, governors don't know what's going on.
[02:06:03.807 --> 02:06:11.190]  And if there's this level, then how much will the financial establishment abuse people till we're all homeless?
[02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:11.450]  Right.
[02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:20.914]  So the game plan, it's very seductive because they will start to talk about MMT, modern monetary theory and universal basic income.
[02:06:20.914 --> 02:06:24.055]  And they're already going to forgive all the student debts.
[02:06:24.055 --> 02:06:24.555]  Right.
[02:06:24.555 --> 02:06:25.776]  So they're going to seduce people.
[02:06:26.391 --> 02:06:35.255]  And with the money printing, which is what we've seen in countries like Venezuela and other countries where the government all they do is they try to appease folks by printing money.
[02:06:35.255 --> 02:06:36.075]  So this is the U.S.
[02:06:36.075 --> 02:06:41.898]  is now saying with MMT and universal basic income and forgiving of all these debts.
[02:06:41.898 --> 02:06:47.360]  They're just saying like, OK, we're going to forget about having an economy based on a meritocratic
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:51.563]  Capitalist free market system where capital formation is key.
[02:06:51.563 --> 02:06:58.568]  We're just going to try to keep the mob away from our doorstep by giving them as much paper money as we possibly can.
[02:06:58.568 --> 02:07:01.650]  And of course, the value of that paper money goes down.
[02:07:01.650 --> 02:07:08.755]  And, you know, geopolitically, I'm not I'm not, you know, just kind of throwing this back in to do it.
[02:07:08.755 --> 02:07:15.360]  But there are there are countries now in the geopolitical scene that are figuring out
[02:07:15.834 --> 02:07:18.657]  That with Bitcoin, they have a way to escape this.
[02:07:18.657 --> 02:07:28.086]  It's just come out that the country of Ukraine is now going to use atomic energy, their atomic energy, to actively mine Bitcoin for the country of Ukraine.
[02:07:28.086 --> 02:07:38.497]  And that's on top of several other countries who are either mining or hoarding Bitcoin as a strategic asset to protect themselves against a world that goes full Venezuela.
[02:07:38.877 --> 02:07:41.519]  And what you just said is key.
[02:07:41.519 --> 02:07:42.280]  It's true.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:49.346]  You said this years ago that they'll finally just start firing money at people, and google log money, and video game money for how long you're online.
[02:07:49.346 --> 02:07:52.209]  But it's all devalued, it's all like coupons, it's all crap.
[02:07:52.209 --> 02:07:57.373]  And now even conservative events have strippers firing money at crowds.
[02:07:57.373 --> 02:08:00.096]  And everywhere is the image of money being fired.
[02:08:00.096 --> 02:08:03.218]  And the average person really believes this is valuable.
[02:08:03.218 --> 02:08:05.841]  Doesn't it always hallmark the Titanic going under?
[02:08:07.893 --> 02:08:20.818]  It's just what happens when you have political gridlock for 20-30 years and allow bankers and corporations to drain the system of the equity of the capital.
[02:08:21.762 --> 02:08:26.064]  And you're left with nothing else left that you can do.
[02:08:26.064 --> 02:08:33.887]  I mean, obviously, the time to have a day of reckoning and to let me let me put into a different context.
[02:08:33.887 --> 02:08:35.368]  I think you'll like this.
[02:08:35.368 --> 02:08:40.130]  We have seen over the history, the gold vigilantes and the bond vigilantes.
[02:08:40.130 --> 02:08:40.770]  And let me explain.
[02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:47.699]  When you have a gold standard, obviously your economic parameters are set by this gold standard.
[02:08:47.699 --> 02:08:53.227]  If one country gets into too much debt versus the other countries, it has to be resolved using gold.
[02:08:53.227 --> 02:08:56.652]  And that's the way it was done for a hundred years, and it was fine.
[02:08:57.079 --> 02:09:04.546]  Then we went to what's basically, you know, a fiat money standard and a paper standard and a U.S.
[02:09:04.546 --> 02:09:05.967]  dollar standard.
[02:09:05.967 --> 02:09:09.811]  And this was what tying the global economy together.
[02:09:09.811 --> 02:09:13.534]  And during that period of time, we had what were called the bond vigilantes.
[02:09:13.534 --> 02:09:20.921]  And this was very big during the Clinton administration when, if you recall, Hillary Clinton was trying to pass a lot of free health care.
[02:09:21.522 --> 02:09:22.603]  For all.
[02:09:22.603 --> 02:09:31.869]  And the bond market on Wall Street crashed the bond market, the 93, as a way to let Washington know that you can't pay for this.
[02:09:31.869 --> 02:09:33.049]  We're not going to let this happen.
[02:09:33.049 --> 02:09:33.790]  It's inflationary.
[02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:36.271]  Max, this is the inside smart stuff here.
[02:09:36.271 --> 02:09:36.772]  That's why we love you.
[02:09:36.772 --> 02:09:38.093]  We're back in a few minutes.
[02:09:38.093 --> 02:09:38.793]  Hold that thought.
[02:09:38.793 --> 02:09:43.596]  We'll continue on to talk about what unfolded in the past and know the future with Max Keiser.
[02:09:43.596 --> 02:09:45.437]  You can find his new website.
[02:09:45.437 --> 02:09:46.218]  Why don't we come back?
[02:09:47.239 --> 02:09:48.440]  I've got some bad news.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:56.708]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[02:09:56.708 --> 02:09:58.169]  But here's the good news.
[02:09:58.169 --> 02:10:06.437]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[02:10:07.157 --> 02:10:12.822]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:10:12.822 --> 02:10:13.523]  People love it.
[02:10:13.523 --> 02:10:14.844]  That's selling out.
[02:10:14.844 --> 02:10:18.186]  Despite that, it's still discounted at infowarestore.com.
[02:10:18.186 --> 02:10:22.230]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:10:22.230 --> 02:10:24.512]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:10:24.512 --> 02:10:25.353]  People really love it.
[02:10:25.353 --> 02:10:27.114]  It's extremely strong as well.
[02:10:27.114 --> 02:10:28.215]  It's selling out.

[02:10:53.831 --> 02:10:59.453]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:10:59.453 --> 02:11:01.694]  The subsection is prepared with Alex.com.
[02:11:01.694 --> 02:11:03.275]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[02:11:03.275 --> 02:11:05.156]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[02:11:05.956 --> 02:11:08.899]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply.
[02:11:08.899 --> 02:11:14.023]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one-year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[02:11:14.023 --> 02:11:24.752]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[02:11:24.752 --> 02:11:28.716]  So, preparewithalex.com or infowarsstore.com, you can find
[02:11:28.916 --> 02:11:29.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:02.921 --> 02:12:08.145]  Monday through Friday, Harrison Smith kicks it off with American Journal, 8 a.m.
[02:12:08.145 --> 02:12:10.266]  Central Texas time.
[02:12:10.266 --> 02:12:11.447]  Then I come on at 11 a.m.
[02:12:11.447 --> 02:12:13.709]  Central, then Owen Shroyer at 3 p.m.
[02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:15.450]  with The War Room.
[02:12:15.450 --> 02:12:18.332]  And I'm a father of four children.
[02:12:18.332 --> 02:12:21.254]  I've got a great family, great wife.
[02:12:21.254 --> 02:12:21.574]  And I...
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:24.760]  I am addicted to information.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.581]  I mean, I used to like to watch movies and stuff.
[02:12:26.581 --> 02:12:27.901]  My wife's like, what are you doing?
[02:12:27.901 --> 02:12:30.502]  Reading the tablet while we're watching a movie.
[02:12:30.502 --> 02:12:32.543]  And I'm like, watching Max Keiser.
[02:12:32.543 --> 02:12:36.304]  I'm reading hundreds of articles a day, scanning over hundreds of articles a day.
[02:12:36.304 --> 02:12:37.904]  I'm addicted to it.
[02:12:37.904 --> 02:12:47.827]  And I can tell you, Max Keiser's not steering you wrong when he's telling you that we're on top of a cascade of time bombs and bubbles within bubbles.
[02:12:47.827 --> 02:12:52.188]  And I know as an audience, you already get this, but the feeling of not even dread
[02:12:53.291 --> 02:12:55.653]  I don't have a feeling of dread.
[02:12:55.653 --> 02:12:56.393]  I used to have that.
[02:12:56.393 --> 02:13:01.637]  Now I have the feeling, like, once you go over the edge of the cliff, or once your car runs off the road, and you're, like, going down a cliff.
[02:13:01.637 --> 02:13:03.398]  It's happened to me once, a 200-foot cliff.
[02:13:03.398 --> 02:13:04.599]  Thank God it rolled five times.
[02:13:04.599 --> 02:13:06.140]  I didn't die.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:08.982]  But a tornado blew me off the road.
[02:13:08.982 --> 02:13:10.163]  My dad was in the car with me.
[02:13:10.163 --> 02:13:11.624]  It almost killed him.
[02:13:11.624 --> 02:13:14.366]  But once you're kind of over the side of the cliff, you're not even scared anymore.
[02:13:14.366 --> 02:13:18.709]  It's like, wow, I'm going to fly into the air in an SUV, you know, 300-foot, 200-foot down a cliff.
[02:13:19.537 --> 02:13:22.220]  There's that feeling, Max, that we're over the cliff.
[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:23.902]  I mean, is that an accurate statement?
[02:13:23.902 --> 02:13:26.906]  That we're not sure how far down it is or what the terrain is?
[02:13:26.906 --> 02:13:28.828]  We just flew off the highway?
[02:13:28.828 --> 02:13:30.490]  Or have we not run off the highway yet?
[02:13:30.490 --> 02:13:31.731]  And what are those scenarios?
[02:13:31.731 --> 02:13:32.852]  Because you got cut off by the break.
[02:13:32.852 --> 02:13:33.113]  Go ahead.
[02:13:35.021 --> 02:13:41.266]  As far as flying off the cliff, that would be starting in 1971 when we closed the gold window.
[02:13:41.266 --> 02:13:48.732]  We entered an experiment, never been tried before, that no currency in the world would be backed by anything like gold or anything like solid like that.
[02:13:48.732 --> 02:13:51.294]  It would all be backed by other fiat currency.
[02:13:51.294 --> 02:14:04.644]  So we entered this period and the only thing keeping it together, you know, to continue where I left off there, the only thing keeping it together was this idea that the bond market would not be fooled if any one of the country decided to go hyperinflation.
[02:14:05.906 --> 02:14:10.132]  And so that's what kept things in check for a couple of years.
[02:14:10.132 --> 02:14:21.788]  But starting with Alan Greenspan, but then picking up with Ben Bernanke over there at the Federal Reserve, we entered a new period where the bond vigilantes were destroyed because the central bank
[02:14:22.751 --> 02:14:34.638]  Put out told the market that no matter how many bonds that are being issued, how many Treasury bonds are being issued or even junk bonds and corporate bonds, no matter how many are issued, we will stand as a buyer.
[02:14:34.638 --> 02:14:48.906]  We will buy everything and everything all day to make sure that there's never going to be any interruption to what's happening in that corporate sector and that banking sector in terms of their
[02:14:49.904 --> 02:14:57.294]  Desire to grab ever greater pieces of the overall economy without any competition, right?
[02:14:57.294 --> 02:15:07.206]  The bond market stood against conglomeration, but then the central bank decided that they would reinvent themselves as assistant to the conglomeration.
[02:15:07.206 --> 02:15:07.567]  That's why.
[02:15:08.187 --> 02:15:22.443]  Ben Bernanke sits on the board of Citadel, a hedge fund, and that's what came out during the GameStop scandal just this past week, was that this hedge fund is owned by Citadel, the Melvin capital, and they're all playing a rigged game and they're counterfeiting
[02:15:22.944 --> 02:15:25.225]  And by the way, you got cut off, though, at the break.
[02:15:25.225 --> 02:15:29.205]  You were getting into how, when Hillary wanted the free health care thing, how the bond market said no.
[02:15:50.425 --> 02:15:56.950]  So in 1993, under the Clinton administration, Hillary was very big on free health care.
[02:15:56.950 --> 02:16:00.312]  And then Robin Rubin, I believe, was at Treasury at the time.
[02:16:00.312 --> 02:16:09.138]  And they staged, essentially, the bond collapse to scare the Clintons away from doing anything like that.
[02:16:09.138 --> 02:16:17.764]  And there was a famous quote from Bill Clinton, who said, when he dies, he wants to come back as the bond market, because the bond market has all the power.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:20.801]  And at that time, that was true.
[02:16:20.801 --> 02:16:35.047]  But within 10 years, the bond market has lost all of its power because the central bank is now sitting on literally trillions and trillions of dollars worth of junk bonds that they have bought back from Wall Street banks.
[02:16:35.047 --> 02:16:38.069]  So everything is into one giant consolidation now.
[02:16:38.069 --> 02:16:38.709]  And so, of course,
[02:16:39.269 --> 02:16:55.634]  By logic, it's not going to consolidate us, say we're not essential, and make us join the EverHive while it destroys all competition, while it annihilates small farms, while it cuts off energy, everything to make it more powerful, even though it's the thing, the black hole, destroying everything.
[02:16:55.634 --> 02:16:58.736]  I'll give you a great example of this.
[02:16:58.736 --> 02:17:05.938]  The company, the American company Tiffany, the jeweler, was recently bought by a European luxury brand, LVMH,
[02:17:07.111 --> 02:17:09.334]  And they used, how did they buy Tiffany's?
[02:17:09.334 --> 02:17:16.442]  They borrowed money from the European Central Bank at 0% interest to buy an American company, Tiffany's.
[02:17:16.442 --> 02:17:18.104]  And now it's a European company.
[02:17:18.104 --> 02:17:23.490]  So the Central Bank was funding a hostile raid of an American company with 0% money.
[02:17:25.166 --> 02:17:32.032]  So yeah, now they own something like an enormous amount of the global luxury market is owned by one person.
[02:17:32.032 --> 02:17:33.073]  That is beyond huge.
[02:17:33.073 --> 02:17:34.834]  Explain that to people.
[02:17:34.834 --> 02:17:35.835]  Because the U.S.
[02:17:35.835 --> 02:17:37.997]  used to do this for U.S.
[02:17:37.997 --> 02:17:39.738]  power, which was a big enough problem.
[02:17:39.738 --> 02:17:43.041]  But now it's EU, it's China, and it seems like the U.S.
[02:17:43.041 --> 02:17:43.762]  is being bought up.
[02:17:43.762 --> 02:17:46.044]  We're losing power.
[02:17:46.044 --> 02:17:51.088]  Why have the globalists decided that it's the end of the American century in all these CFR articles I read?
[02:17:51.088 --> 02:17:52.069]  Why are they so obsessed with that?
[02:17:54.670 --> 02:18:02.715]  Well, I think they want to appear like they have an interest in saving America's interests, but clearly they don't.
[02:18:02.715 --> 02:18:06.817]  It's not, it's a, you know, it's the globalists, right?
[02:18:06.817 --> 02:18:09.539]  I mean, this is a phrase that can sound...
[02:18:10.976 --> 02:18:13.439]  You know, as a fringe idea.
[02:18:13.439 --> 02:18:22.750]  But nevertheless, you've got a cadre of powerful people in different countries who have access to central banks and their 0% money.
[02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:24.512]  Well, they call themselves globalists, Max.
[02:18:24.512 --> 02:18:25.853]  The New York Times says it's anti-Semitic.
[02:18:25.853 --> 02:18:26.875]  What does that have to do with anything?
[02:18:26.875 --> 02:18:28.256]  They just throw that out there.
[02:18:28.256 --> 02:18:30.559]  I mean, the globalists call themselves globalists.
[02:18:31.930 --> 02:18:32.971]  Right.
[02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:38.234]  So, like a Davos, for example, you know, a World Economic Forum.
[02:18:38.234 --> 02:18:39.134]  What is that all about?
[02:18:39.134 --> 02:18:41.015]  It's like a convention of globalists.
[02:18:41.015 --> 02:18:46.378]  It's a convention of predatory buyers of private equity.
[02:18:46.378 --> 02:18:49.880]  You know, it's another phrase that describes this group of folks.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:50.901]  Private equity.
[02:18:50.901 --> 02:18:51.801]  Private equity.
[02:18:51.801 --> 02:18:58.865]  Back when I was on Wall Street in the 80s, it was called corporate raiding or greenmail with people like Carl Icahn of that day.
[02:18:59.489 --> 02:19:08.373]  And Ted Turner and others were the raiders, corporate raiders, and then they became activist investors, and now they're private equity.
[02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:12.055]  Mitt Romney, by the way, has made his bones in private equity.
[02:19:12.055 --> 02:19:15.076]  But they're able to buy companies, strip the assets,
[02:19:15.737 --> 02:19:20.603]  Take huge profits for themselves, fire a lot of people, destroy the pension accounts.
[02:19:20.603 --> 02:19:26.371]  It's kind of a funny example, but some of the funny things stick in my head.
[02:19:26.371 --> 02:19:33.420]  The company of Twinkies, the company that makes Twinkies in New York, they were a subject of a billion-dollar leveraged buyout by a private equity group.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:40.563]  They bought the entire Twinkie company, they fired everybody, they destroyed the pensions, and then they relaunched as a stripped-down operation.
[02:19:40.563 --> 02:19:47.145]  And the people who leveraged that, who did the deal, you know, became billionaires, but all the workers were fired and the pensions were destroyed.
[02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:49.986]  So that's just a typical deal.
[02:19:49.986 --> 02:19:57.869]  Then we see billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars with these private equity deals all the time, funded with zero percent money.
[02:19:57.869 --> 02:19:59.029]  That's the key.
[02:19:59.029 --> 02:20:00.730]  And that's what I call interest rate apartheid.
[02:20:01.414 --> 02:20:08.897]  If you're part of the Davos crowd, you get interest rates at, for you, they charge a zero.
[02:20:08.897 --> 02:20:17.441]  If you're on a, you know, American Express card or Visa card, you're being charged, what, 16, 17 percent, which is a huge difference from that and zero.
[02:20:17.441 --> 02:20:19.462]  And here's another very interesting question.
[02:20:19.462 --> 02:20:23.064]  Since the beginning of the Greenspan era,
[02:20:24.175 --> 02:20:30.438]  That is to say, the end of the Volcker era, when interest rates were over 20% on the 10-year Treasury bond.
[02:20:30.438 --> 02:20:35.580]  They've come all the way down to, let's call it 1% or less.
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:38.841]  How come, and if you're a private equity... Stay there.
[02:20:38.841 --> 02:20:39.321]  How come?
[02:20:39.321 --> 02:20:41.122]  We're going to get to the answer on the other side.
[02:20:44.383 --> 02:20:52.849]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:20:52.849 --> 02:21:03.377]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[02:21:03.377 --> 02:21:13.045]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[02:21:13.365 --> 02:21:19.347]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[02:21:19.347 --> 02:21:24.188]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[02:21:24.188 --> 02:21:32.371]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[02:21:32.791 --> 02:21:37.596]  President Trump won a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[02:21:51.929 --> 02:22:01.859]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the United States that had spread across the world from the UK to Brazil.
[02:22:01.859 --> 02:22:02.560]  They were desperate.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.081]  They admitted their own publications.
[02:22:04.081 --> 02:22:06.284]  They didn't know what to do.
[02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:09.307]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law.
[02:22:10.623 --> 02:22:12.784]  And stole it bigger than Dulles.
[02:22:12.784 --> 02:22:16.605]  And now they're coming after the President, they're coming after you, they're coming after me.
[02:22:16.605 --> 02:22:20.666]  They're shutting everybody off the Internet, they're trying to totally censor us.
[02:22:20.666 --> 02:22:24.727]  And that's why InfoWars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[02:22:24.727 --> 02:22:31.349]  We told you this was coming, we were the first main target, and we're still on air at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and BandOnVideo.
[02:22:32.089 --> 02:22:36.073]  Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay on air.
[02:22:36.073 --> 02:22:44.882]  So while you still can, go to mfourastore.com and get storable foods and high-quality products, supplements, you name it, at mfourastore.com.
[02:22:44.882 --> 02:22:48.946]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America Coffee.
[02:22:48.946 --> 02:22:50.247]  I just love it.
[02:22:50.247 --> 02:22:51.248]  I can't get enough of it.
[02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:54.603]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[02:22:54.603 --> 02:22:55.844]  That's what fills my mug.
[02:22:55.844 --> 02:22:56.985]  That's what fills my belly.
[02:22:56.985 --> 02:22:58.487]  That's what fills my soul.
[02:22:58.487 --> 02:23:00.429]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[02:23:00.429 --> 02:23:04.553]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:23:04.553 --> 02:23:05.173]  Years.
[02:23:05.173 --> 02:23:06.875]  Never raised the price.
[02:23:06.875 --> 02:23:07.175]  Never.
[02:23:07.175 --> 02:23:09.697]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[02:23:09.697 --> 02:23:10.879]  The crew here loves it.
[02:23:10.879 --> 02:23:12.080]  We drink it every day.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:16.544]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[02:23:16.704 --> 02:23:19.085]  Everybody drinks coffee, or just about everybody.
[02:23:19.085 --> 02:23:24.668]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend?
[02:23:24.668 --> 02:23:26.229]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[02:23:26.229 --> 02:23:27.489]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[02:23:27.489 --> 02:23:28.550]  4.9 star.
[02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:34.273]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[02:23:34.273 --> 02:23:38.235]  So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a 5 star, except maybe one or two people.
[02:23:38.235 --> 02:23:40.956]  Patriot Blend, 100% organic coffee.
[02:23:40.956 --> 02:23:43.858]  Only available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:23:46.849 --> 02:24:00.154]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:00.154 --> 02:24:03.935]  Some heads are going to roll.
[02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:05.616]  What's gonna happen?
[02:24:05.616 --> 02:24:10.338]  Literally, we wake up homeless from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:24:10.338 --> 02:24:14.299]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:24:14.299 --> 02:24:15.440]  Who was the founding father?
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:15.900]  I forget.
[02:24:18.956 --> 02:24:29.239]  Thomas Jefferson, I forget, said, if we ever let central banks control the issuance of currency credit, our grandchildren will wake up homeless on a continent their forefathers conquered.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:33.242]  And so now, I've been talking to Max Keiser for more than 15 years.
[02:24:33.242 --> 02:24:37.666]  I've watched what he warned of and others warned of come true, just like they said it would.
[02:24:37.666 --> 02:24:49.456]  And now we're here in this la-la land, wonderland, where the banks go, by the way, stay in your house, wear a mask forever, but we don't, because this is how we implode the economy so there's not too much inflation.
[02:24:50.177 --> 02:25:04.361]  Well, we live like kings on giant private estates, 50,000 acres, 20,000 acres, 100,000 acres, 20 bedrooms, helicopter pads, hundreds of, you know, hookers, whatever they want, little kids, you name it.
[02:25:04.361 --> 02:25:08.322]  This is total Marie Antoinette on steroids.
[02:25:08.322 --> 02:25:10.482]  This is just over the top.
[02:25:10.482 --> 02:25:17.044]  And so Max Keiser, getting back to you, a famous stockbroker, Bitcoin leader, all of it.
[02:25:18.815 --> 02:25:22.096]  Not trying to scare people, but how long can this go?
[02:25:22.096 --> 02:25:35.901]  And if you predicted this phase of zero interest rates for the establishment, high interest for us, this gulag casino model, well then give us the next five years, the next ten years, what's coming?
[02:25:35.901 --> 02:25:37.522]  Right, quick, I'm just going to mention
[02:25:38.504 --> 02:25:42.006]  Swampbitcoin.com forward slash orange pill.
[02:25:42.006 --> 02:25:42.346]  No, no, no.
[02:25:42.346 --> 02:25:43.547]  Let's just get into Bitcoin right now.
[02:25:43.547 --> 02:25:44.448]  I promise we'll get into Bitcoin.
[02:25:44.448 --> 02:25:44.828]  Let's talk.
[02:25:44.828 --> 02:25:45.088]  I know.
[02:25:45.088 --> 02:25:47.049]  I just want to mention that and then I'll get into it.
[02:25:47.049 --> 02:25:47.369]  No, no, no.
[02:25:47.369 --> 02:25:47.990]  Let's start over.
[02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:49.831]  We'll get into that big question I was asked later.
[02:25:49.831 --> 02:25:51.612]  Spend some time on Bitcoin.
[02:25:51.612 --> 02:25:52.793]  You predicted the first big run.
[02:25:52.793 --> 02:25:54.093]  You predicted the second big run.
[02:25:54.093 --> 02:25:55.574]  Where's Bitcoin right now?
[02:25:55.574 --> 02:25:57.536]  What do you think is the best areas of it?
[02:25:57.536 --> 02:26:04.820]  What I want to do, Alex, is to pick up where we left off and talk about interest rates for a second and how the game is played.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:06.701]  If that's okay.
[02:26:06.701 --> 02:26:10.443]  So in other words... We will, but let's get into Bitcoin first, because I said we'd talk about Bitcoin.
[02:26:10.443 --> 02:26:12.324]  Get into Bitcoin now, then we'll talk about interest rates.
[02:26:12.324 --> 02:26:13.365]  I'm in midstream.
[02:26:13.365 --> 02:26:16.968]  You know, during the break, it all came like a crystal vision in my brain.
[02:26:16.968 --> 02:26:18.048]  Fine, then go back to what you wanted.
[02:26:18.048 --> 02:26:19.249]  I just wanted you to get to Bitcoin.
[02:26:19.249 --> 02:26:19.449]  Start.
[02:26:19.449 --> 02:26:20.570]  Go ahead.
[02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.930]  Right.
[02:26:20.930 --> 02:26:27.314]  So the 2025 years, you've seen interest rates come down and they're being forced down.
[02:26:27.314 --> 02:26:29.036]  Central banks are buying bonds.
[02:26:29.036 --> 02:26:30.637]  It forces interest rates down.
[02:26:30.637 --> 02:26:35.160]  Now think about the dynamic here, because this is a way to
[02:26:36.221 --> 02:26:43.387]  Redistribute wealth in America and to put a lot of it into the hands of the top one-tenth of one percent.
[02:26:43.387 --> 02:26:45.509]  And it goes like this.
[02:26:45.509 --> 02:26:50.994]  If interest rates are coming down for 20-25 years, and we know that's true in the mortgage market, right?
[02:26:50.994 --> 02:26:54.297]  Your mortgages have come down sharply over the last 15 years.
[02:26:54.297 --> 02:26:55.198]  True or false?
[02:26:55.198 --> 02:26:56.299]  That's true.
[02:26:56.299 --> 02:26:57.320]  And they keep coming down.
[02:26:58.109 --> 02:27:00.990]  But how come credit card rates have not come down?
[02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:02.610]  They've been around 16, 17, 18 percent.
[02:27:02.610 --> 02:27:04.491]  It's been that way for 10 years.
[02:27:04.491 --> 02:27:07.092]  Credit card interest rates have never come down.
[02:27:07.092 --> 02:27:09.592]  And let's let's examine that a little bit.
[02:27:09.592 --> 02:27:27.838]  It's because the housing market as an asset on a bank's balance sheet with low mortgage rates, the value of the asset, the house and the balance sheet goes up by almost exponential degree as you find that people are panic buying real assets.
[02:27:28.246 --> 02:27:31.688]  Like houses and that's on the bank's balance sheet.
[02:27:31.688 --> 02:27:44.113]  And so people with assets and the people with assets to that to that nature are getting a lot richer because now let's look at the people who are consumers who might not have a house.
[02:27:44.113 --> 02:27:45.053]  They can't afford a house.
[02:27:45.053 --> 02:27:49.916]  It's too expensive because the prices have been jacked up in this way, but they pay 16 17% interest on their credit card.
[02:27:51.644 --> 02:28:05.514]  So, you see, what happens is that if you're forced into a consumer model without owning any assets, and probably 80% of Americans have no assets whatsoever, it's just hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, they're just surviving.
[02:28:05.514 --> 02:28:07.795]  And they're paying 18% of that credit card.
[02:28:07.795 --> 02:28:18.623]  If the economy was being run in a way that there would be some equilibrium in all facets of it, and it wasn't being run by a few bankers for their benefit,
[02:28:19.457 --> 02:28:22.098]  Credit card interest rates would be similar to mortgage rates.
[02:28:22.098 --> 02:28:25.458]  You'd be paying 2 or 3 percent interest on your credit card.
[02:28:25.458 --> 02:28:38.922]  But because they control the financial markets, they control the Visa and MasterCard as a duopoly, there's no competition, and they're allowed to operate as a duopoly or an oligopoly in this economy.
[02:28:38.922 --> 02:28:45.043]  It's a way to constantly bleed money in the form of interest, what I call interest rate apartheid.
[02:28:45.043 --> 02:28:48.344]  You're bleeding money from 80 to 90 percent of the population,
[02:28:49.246 --> 02:28:59.992]  Well, at the same time, offering your friends who are buying assets and buying houses for $100 million a pop and watching them go to $150 million out in the Hamptons, right?
[02:28:59.992 --> 02:29:07.837]  Because you're using that as a rising asset value because of the low interest rates and then using that house as collateral to go buy another house.
[02:29:07.837 --> 02:29:11.700]  And by the way, the financing of that second home is also near 0%.
[02:29:13.024 --> 02:29:18.769]  So this is how interest rates are used in a very subtle way to create this huge wedge.
[02:29:18.769 --> 02:29:38.324]  If somebody in Washington wanted to actually do something about the way the economy is currently corrupted to favor bankers and their corrupt practices, they would immediately lobby to drop interest rates down to 2%, where they should be, relative to where interest rates have been for the past 20 years, categorically, undeniably.
[02:29:39.301 --> 02:29:40.962]  It's like 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:29:40.962 --> 02:29:42.484]  You can't argue that.
[02:29:42.484 --> 02:29:47.149]  But there's no greater lobbyist in Washington than Visa and Mastercard.
[02:29:47.149 --> 02:29:49.592]  Those are probably the two biggest lobbyists there are.
[02:29:49.592 --> 02:29:53.015]  And they just drain that capital out.
[02:29:53.015 --> 02:29:53.876]  So that's my point about
[02:29:56.408 --> 02:29:56.508]  The
[02:30:26.768 --> 02:30:27.948]  In the past two weeks.
[02:30:27.948 --> 02:30:37.231]  That's just an excuse to raise taxes, to raise interest rates on consumer debt, to drain the people that way, and etc.
[02:30:37.231 --> 02:30:42.132]  Now when you look at the United States and you say, well where in the States is there any pocket of hope?
[02:30:42.132 --> 02:30:44.433]  And the answer is Wyoming.
[02:30:44.433 --> 02:30:49.994]  Wyoming is to Bitcoin what Colorado was to marijuana.
[02:30:50.314 --> 02:30:55.736]  You know, marijuana was started off in the states' rights, and now it's going to go to the federal level.
[02:30:55.736 --> 02:30:59.517]  Wyoming is now lobbying for Bitcoin rights.
[02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:01.018]  It's become a Bitcoin state.
[02:31:01.018 --> 02:31:06.159]  We've got the Senator from Wyoming is on the Finance Committee in Washington, D.C.
[02:31:06.159 --> 02:31:08.420]  She's fully Bitcoinized.
[02:31:09.221 --> 02:31:11.743]  And that's where the revolution is going to start in Wyoming.
[02:31:11.743 --> 02:31:15.487]  Then it'll spread to other states because Wyoming's economy will start to thrive.
[02:31:15.487 --> 02:31:21.514]  It's already attracting these incredibly powerful, profitable Bitcoin companies to the state of Wyoming.
[02:31:21.514 --> 02:31:23.516]  Everyone's flocking there now.
[02:31:23.516 --> 02:31:25.498]  And then that will spread out.
[02:31:25.498 --> 02:31:28.562]  So that's the ray of hope in all this, is Wyoming.
[02:31:29.402 --> 02:31:33.484]  Senator Loomis or Lummis, I believe she pronounces it Lummis.
[02:31:33.484 --> 02:31:44.470]  She is a Bitcoin brilliant and she's on the Senate Finance Committee right now as of this week fighting for Bitcoin rights and that's the bright spot in America right now.
[02:31:44.470 --> 02:31:52.153]  Certainly, what do people find at swanbitcoin.com forward slash orange pill or orangepilldailydose.com?
[02:31:52.153 --> 02:31:53.514]  It's forward slash orange pill
[02:31:54.346 --> 02:32:02.534]  Or swanbitcoin.com forward slash max or swanbitcoin.com forward slash Stacy.
[02:32:02.534 --> 02:32:06.758]  You can use all of those URLs.
[02:32:06.758 --> 02:32:11.482]  They give you, if you sign up, you get 10 bucks worth of free Bitcoin.
[02:32:11.482 --> 02:32:14.205]  Okay, well Bitcoin, you predicted both these rises.
[02:32:14.205 --> 02:32:16.447]  How high is it going to go next time or what do you predict for Bitcoin?
[02:32:17.031 --> 02:32:21.855]  For 2021, I'm predicting Bitcoin will go to $220,000 a coin.
[02:32:21.855 --> 02:32:23.477]  It's currently approximately $38,000.
[02:32:23.477 --> 02:32:24.097]  All right.
[02:32:24.097 --> 02:32:27.881]  Stay there, Max.
[02:32:27.881 --> 02:32:29.943]  We'll come right back to you in the final segment.
[02:32:29.943 --> 02:32:31.864]  Then I have a special report we've shot.
[02:32:31.864 --> 02:32:35.287]  And then my good friend, Dr. Nick Begich, is going to take over the last 45 minutes.

[02:34:42.935 --> 02:34:44.156]  We told you it was coming.
[02:34:44.156 --> 02:34:55.622]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them social distance and report them back to cell towers to track their every movement.
[02:34:55.622 --> 02:34:56.743]  This is for everybody.
[02:34:56.743 --> 02:34:58.284]  The way that it's better.
[02:34:58.284 --> 02:35:08.830]  Now France has programs in their factories, government-pushed and sponsored, to make everyone wear actual dog collars that make you social distance and report back to single computers.
[02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:10.491]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[02:35:11.031 --> 02:35:13.532]  Human-animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[02:35:13.532 --> 02:35:14.692]  It's all being announced.
[02:35:14.692 --> 02:35:19.153]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[02:35:19.153 --> 02:35:24.654]  And big corporations now claim that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[02:35:24.654 --> 02:35:25.714]  Do you understand?
[02:35:25.714 --> 02:35:33.516]  It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level, and now they're coming with dog collars, and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S.
[02:35:33.516 --> 02:35:35.356]  starting next year it will begin.
[02:35:35.356 --> 02:35:36.236]  Did you hear me?
[02:35:36.236 --> 02:35:39.857]  Dog collars for your children, all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[02:35:40.198 --> 02:35:42.296]  The Emporial Wars will continue to spread the word to fight back.
[02:35:44.969 --> 02:35:52.294]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[02:35:52.294 --> 02:35:53.735]  You built InfoWars.
[02:35:53.735 --> 02:35:55.236]  You spread the word.
[02:35:55.236 --> 02:35:56.457]  You prayed for us.
[02:35:56.457 --> 02:35:57.818]  You bought the products.
[02:35:57.818 --> 02:35:58.978]  You called in.
[02:35:58.978 --> 02:36:00.179]  You made recommendations.
[02:36:00.179 --> 02:36:03.021]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[02:36:03.021 --> 02:36:11.187]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[02:36:11.187 --> 02:36:14.669]  With Band.Video, the redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[02:36:15.149 --> 02:36:16.149]  We're good to go.
[02:36:44.605 --> 02:36:45.805]  I've got some bad news.
[02:36:45.805 --> 02:36:54.088]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[02:36:54.088 --> 02:36:55.549]  But here's the good news.
[02:36:55.549 --> 02:37:03.812]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[02:37:04.532 --> 02:37:10.194]  One is Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:37:10.194 --> 02:37:10.895]  People love it.
[02:37:10.895 --> 02:37:12.215]  That's selling out.
[02:37:12.215 --> 02:37:15.557]  Despite that, it's still discounted at infowarrestore.com.
[02:37:15.557 --> 02:37:19.618]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:37:19.618 --> 02:37:21.879]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:37:21.879 --> 02:37:22.660]  People really love it.
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:24.480]  It's extremely strong as well.
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:25.601]  It's selling out.
[02:37:25.601 --> 02:37:28.642]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[02:37:28.642 --> 02:37:32.564]  It also funds the InfoWar and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[02:37:32.984 --> 02:37:34.786]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:37:34.786 --> 02:37:42.592]  Please visit Infowarstore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the InfoWar.

[02:37:47.856 --> 02:37:50.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:38:07.691 --> 02:38:10.353]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:10.353 --> 02:38:11.673]  Final segment with Max Keiser.
[02:38:11.673 --> 02:38:15.356]  Then we've got a special report coming up at the start of the next hour.
[02:38:15.356 --> 02:38:20.959]  And then, Dr. Nick Begich takes over ahead of Owen Schroer in the war room here at the InfoWars.
[02:38:20.959 --> 02:38:25.462]  A beleaguered, besieged, but still more effective than ever operation.
[02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:28.191]  I want to be clear.
[02:38:28.191 --> 02:38:29.412]  I believe in capitalism.
[02:38:29.412 --> 02:38:30.232]  I believe in free markets.
[02:38:30.232 --> 02:38:31.813]  But we've never had a perfect one.
[02:38:31.813 --> 02:38:32.574]  Humans aren't perfect.
[02:38:32.574 --> 02:38:33.695]  We're not God.
[02:38:33.695 --> 02:38:40.840]  But we have private central banks and private banks that control regulators above the markets.
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:46.204]  And they've always had an evil hand, an inside job, an insider trading leg up.
[02:38:49.468 --> 02:38:59.251]  But now, it's completely rigged, and when you see some small traders get together and go and have a little bit of victory, oh my God, it's the end of the world.
[02:38:59.251 --> 02:39:03.232]  And they're just going to feed the whole economy into this thing.
[02:39:03.232 --> 02:39:13.356]  And then now you've got these billionaires and these people who control trillion dollar companies running death camps in China, but they're liberals, so it's okay, and they're like, oh, we don't need wealth anymore, everyone should be poor!
[02:39:14.807 --> 02:39:27.657]  You need to learn to be poor and they're like literally worth hundreds of billions of dollars running everything with 20 yachts and 30 airplanes and 20 mansions and all these wives and they're lecturing us we got to eat bugs.
[02:39:27.657 --> 02:39:33.381]  I just don't see it going well but they think oh we'll have robots and they'll be our security force.
[02:39:33.381 --> 02:39:35.963]  I mean these guys are really delusional Max.
[02:39:35.963 --> 02:39:44.230]  Let's talk about the mindset of the Eric Schmitz and the Jeff Bezos's and the Jeff Zuckerberg's and
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:49.162]  All of them are Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Zuckers over at CNN.
[02:39:49.162 --> 02:39:54.084]  I mean, these guys are like whistling past the political graveyard in my view.
[02:39:54.084 --> 02:39:54.824]  I don't even hate them.
[02:39:54.824 --> 02:39:56.585]  I'm not out to get them.
[02:39:56.585 --> 02:39:59.107]  They just seem crazy funding Black Lives Matter.
[02:39:59.107 --> 02:40:00.847]  Oh, hey, we fund the black people.
[02:40:00.847 --> 02:40:02.528]  You mean the movement that says break up their families?
[02:40:05.182 --> 02:40:10.366]  Well, yeah, to follow up on what we were saying a second ago, because I tend to think in terms of banking, central banking.
[02:40:35.390 --> 02:40:37.070]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:47.953]  So, according to the Federal Reserve Bank and the folks in Washington, there's deflation and interest rates are near zero percent and they need to stay at zero.
[02:40:47.953 --> 02:40:50.973]  As a matter of fact, they need to go to negative rates.
[02:40:50.973 --> 02:41:02.636]  Okay, if that's true, then Alex Jones, why can't you decide to open a bank and your bank is going to not have any overdraw penalties
[02:41:04.759 --> 02:41:11.502]  It's going to offer our savers 4% on their money, not one-tenth of 1%.
[02:41:11.502 --> 02:41:20.587]  And the bank has a credit card, and the credit card doesn't have 16 or 17% interest, it charges 3% interest.
[02:41:20.587 --> 02:41:28.751]  Okay, now that bank, if that bank opened today, it would be very quickly the most profitable and biggest bank in America.
[02:41:29.992 --> 02:41:43.034]  And so if this is free market capitalism, and we really do have the ability to start businesses here in America, why can't Alex Jones open that bank tomorrow and have the most profitable bank in America?
[02:41:43.034 --> 02:41:48.695]  Which would be the reason it's profitable is because he acknowledges the fact that interest rates are at these historic lows.
[02:41:48.695 --> 02:41:52.976]  The reason is that, as we described, there is no competition.
[02:41:52.976 --> 02:41:54.536]  The competition's been squeezed out.
[02:41:54.536 --> 02:41:58.037]  We have an oligarchy of a few banks.
[02:41:58.533 --> 02:42:13.801]  And they keep rates artificially high for the peasants and they keep them low for their real estate speculating and corporate speculating clientele as who are doing their bidding in Washington.
[02:42:13.801 --> 02:42:16.482]  So we have two Americas.
[02:42:16.482 --> 02:42:19.884]  We have the peasant class and we have the oligarchs.
[02:42:19.884 --> 02:42:26.527]  And America, by the way, their foreign policy, according to the current administration, is to defend democracy all over the world.
[02:42:27.199 --> 02:42:31.680]  Which is, excuse the fresh, my expression, but that's complete horse shit.
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:46.143]  Because they need to look at America and decide whether or not they want to have an oligarchy in America of Wall Street bankers manipulating the interest rates to an extent of creating a permanent American peasant class.
[02:42:46.143 --> 02:42:48.483]  That's the only really question that needs to be asked right now.
[02:42:48.483 --> 02:42:52.364]  And Max, you just said it, and you know, saying that it's horse shit isn't enough.
[02:42:52.364 --> 02:42:53.684]  It's bull fucking shit.
[02:42:54.364 --> 02:43:00.565]  And you're totally right, and they're creating a class system again, the thing America tried to get away from.
[02:43:00.565 --> 02:43:06.027]  So they use racism as a false class battle, when really it's the ultra-banks against us all.
[02:43:06.027 --> 02:43:14.048]  And so I think we need to unify old, young, black, white, gay, straight, whatever, for a code of a social contract again that operates.
[02:43:14.048 --> 02:43:17.589]  But what in a few minutes would that social contract look like?
[02:43:17.589 --> 02:43:18.889]  When do we start reforming?
[02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:21.390]  How long does this robber baroning go on?
[02:43:23.550 --> 02:43:26.752]  As Christine Lagarde has said, there's only one escape.
[02:43:26.752 --> 02:43:30.253]  There's only one thing they can't control, and that's Bitcoin.
[02:43:30.253 --> 02:43:34.055]  It still has a 40x return available.
[02:43:34.055 --> 02:43:38.538]  People should be accumulating it because it's unconfiscatable.
[02:43:38.538 --> 02:43:42.460]  This is one concept I'll leave you with, Alex, and it's a concept I want you to think hard about.
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:46.982]  It's the only time in history we've seen the separation of state and money.
[02:43:47.887 --> 02:43:49.448]  That's a remarkable statement.
[02:43:49.448 --> 02:43:57.255]  We've had the separation of church and state, and that was part of the Enlightenment and the moves toward creating the United States, etc.
[02:43:57.255 --> 02:44:01.559]  But we've never, ever had separation of state and money.
[02:44:01.559 --> 02:44:07.764]  We can literally, on the Bitcoin network, we've created our own unconfiscatable hard money that's
[02:44:08.419 --> 02:44:10.821]  Better than gold in many ways.
[02:44:10.821 --> 02:44:15.724]  And we don't need to, it will defund the nation state.
[02:44:15.724 --> 02:44:16.725]  It will defund the central bank.
[02:44:39.841 --> 02:44:46.267]  I had, in Los Angeles, created a virtual currency in 1996 that I have a patent on.
[02:44:46.267 --> 02:44:50.071]  And it's patent number 5956170.
[02:44:50.071 --> 02:44:56.237]  And I was already aware of digital currencies and virtual currencies.
[02:44:56.237 --> 02:44:58.780]  And so in Bitcoin, I was introduced to it in 2011 at a dollar.
[02:45:00.316 --> 02:45:07.141]  I immediately recognized that it was a huge advance on this idea of a virtual or digital currency.
[02:45:07.141 --> 02:45:16.127]  Back in the 90s, when I was running the Hollywood Stock Exchange, there were many gaming sites at that time during the dot-com frenzy that used play money.
[02:45:16.127 --> 02:45:18.028]  Let's call it play money or virtual money.
[02:45:18.028 --> 02:45:22.191]  But it's all centralized and you could never really cross it over to the real world.
[02:45:22.191 --> 02:45:24.673]  The genius of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized.
[02:45:25.299 --> 02:45:29.081]  And that the encrypted shield that protects it is impenetrable.
[02:45:29.081 --> 02:45:35.465]  And the SHA-256 hashing algorithm runs at 160 quintillion calculations per second.
[02:45:35.465 --> 02:45:40.948]  Now to give you an idea how strong that is, every single grain of sand, when you add it all up on planet Earth, is seven
[02:45:41.468 --> 02:45:43.069]  Quintillion grains of sand.
[02:45:43.069 --> 02:45:48.333]  The Bitcoin protocol is running at 150 to 160 quintillion calculations per second right now.
[02:45:48.333 --> 02:45:54.077]  That's the unimpenetrable encrypted shield that protects it from all outside forces.
[02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:55.859]  No government can attack it.
[02:45:55.859 --> 02:45:58.421]  No group of governments can attack it.
[02:45:58.421 --> 02:46:00.762]  You are living in the Bitcoin world.
[02:46:00.762 --> 02:46:05.125]  Sir, if it gets big enough, if it gets big enough, they won't be able to stop it.
[02:46:05.125 --> 02:46:07.127]  That moment passed long ago.
[02:46:07.127 --> 02:46:09.749]  It became unstoppable
[02:46:10.746 --> 02:46:13.168]  Almost within two years after it was born.
[02:46:13.168 --> 02:46:16.910]  So by 2011, 2012, it was already on its way to becoming unstoppable.
[02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:20.253]  Okay, so who is the real... I hear about this Japanese guy, but I ask you this many times.
[02:46:20.253 --> 02:46:21.514]  Who is the real inventor of Bitcoin?
[02:46:21.514 --> 02:46:21.774]  Do you know?
[02:46:22.526 --> 02:46:27.549]  Well, Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym of the guy who wrote the white paper, and then he disappeared.
[02:46:27.549 --> 02:46:30.190]  And that's one of the greatest strengths of Bitcoin.
[02:46:30.190 --> 02:46:37.414]  Because we know from every other coin, for example, Ethereum is the second biggest coin, but it's essentially run by Vitalik.
[02:46:37.414 --> 02:46:42.096]  And if Vitalik got hit by a bus, Ethereum would be destroyed.
[02:46:42.096 --> 02:46:47.919]  All these other coins have centralized operations that are vulnerable to the founders ripping people off.
[02:46:47.919 --> 02:46:49.000]  And by the way, Ethereum is
[02:46:49.984 --> 02:46:56.446]  So you're saying a good person knew this was coming and launched a pure system up front to defeat it?
[02:46:56.446 --> 02:46:58.006]  And then disappeared.
[02:46:58.006 --> 02:47:04.268]  Because 20 years before, there had been several attempts, and they came close to something.
[02:47:04.268 --> 02:47:14.870]  But whenever they did, remember there was a project called eGold, which was a precursor of Bitcoin, and the founder ended up getting in huge trouble with the regulators.
[02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:16.090]  Oh, I remember.
[02:47:16.090 --> 02:47:17.991]  I had like Ron Paul's brother trying to get me in it.
[02:47:18.792 --> 02:47:19.192]  Right.
[02:47:19.192 --> 02:47:34.960]  So so the creator of Bitcoin realized that if this was going to really do what it's supposed to do, he needed to become anonymous the second it went live, because otherwise he would be like Julian Assange sitting in a torture cell in London right now or some other persecuted individual.
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:37.361]  So he very wisely became anonymous.
[02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:40.882]  Anonymous, and that's the greatest gift ever.
[02:47:40.882 --> 02:47:47.623]  It's a gift equal to Jesus Christ, in my opinion, who came to this world to give us the gift of love.
[02:47:47.623 --> 02:47:51.784]  Satoshi Nakamoto is Christ 2.0, and he gave us the gift of Bitcoin.
[02:47:51.784 --> 02:47:54.105]  If you don't... Now you're getting John Lennon on us.
[02:47:54.105 --> 02:47:56.645]  Let's just say he's way below Jesus, but I get your allegory.
[02:47:56.645 --> 02:47:59.526]  Hey, I think this is our best interview in 15 years.
[02:47:59.526 --> 02:48:00.366]  Very powerful.
[02:48:00.366 --> 02:48:02.146]  Please come back again soon.
[02:48:02.146 --> 02:48:05.047]  Max Keiser, you always do maxkeiser.com, but what's the best site for people?
[02:48:05.891 --> 02:48:11.656]  swanbitcoin.com forward slash orange pill.
[02:48:11.656 --> 02:48:12.717]  All right.
[02:48:12.717 --> 02:48:13.758]  Max, thank you so much.
[02:48:13.758 --> 02:48:15.459]  Amazing interview.
[02:48:15.459 --> 02:48:16.660]  Bye.
[02:48:16.660 --> 02:48:17.061]  There he goes.
[02:48:17.061 --> 02:48:17.301]  All right.
[02:48:17.301 --> 02:48:18.762]  I'm going to kick off the next hour.
[02:48:18.762 --> 02:48:19.923]  Then Dr. Begich takes over.
[02:48:19.923 --> 02:48:21.625]  And we did this big special report.
[02:48:21.625 --> 02:48:22.766]  I shot it last night.
[02:48:22.766 --> 02:48:25.268]  The computer froze and lost the video.
[02:48:25.268 --> 02:48:26.589]  So I reached out this morning.
[02:48:26.589 --> 02:48:28.250]  So I really want you to see this report.
[02:48:28.250 --> 02:48:30.792]  Because the rebellion against the mask has begun.
[02:48:35.098 --> 02:48:37.300]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:40.382]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[02:48:40.382 --> 02:48:45.987]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at infowarsstore.com.
[02:48:45.987 --> 02:48:48.249]  The subsection is preparewithalex.com.
[02:48:48.249 --> 02:48:49.830]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:51.691]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[02:48:52.492 --> 02:48:55.436]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply.
[02:48:55.436 --> 02:49:00.562]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year's supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[02:49:00.562 --> 02:49:10.555]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our options.
[02:49:11.276 --> 02:49:14.598]  So, preparewithalex.com or infowarsstore.com.
[02:49:14.598 --> 02:49:16.640]  You can find the preparedness section there.
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:18.822]  Water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[02:49:18.822 --> 02:49:21.905]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more.
[02:49:21.905 --> 02:49:23.146]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[02:49:23.146 --> 02:49:24.507]  It starts with self-defense.
[02:49:24.507 --> 02:49:25.848]  It starts with being prepared.
[02:49:25.848 --> 02:49:26.789]  It starts with storable food.
[02:49:26.789 --> 02:49:28.050]  It starts with digging in.
[02:49:28.050 --> 02:49:30.232]  With a long, globalist fight, you'll win in the end.
[02:49:34.528 --> 02:49:38.389]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:40.970]  They are forcing mutations.
[02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:44.571]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[02:49:44.571 --> 02:49:53.114]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or more moral.
[02:49:53.114 --> 02:49:53.494]  No.
[02:49:53.494 --> 02:49:56.235]  It's turning humanity into a commodity.
[02:49:56.235 --> 02:50:03.317]  Now we see some propaganda, like communist China bragging, Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen!
[02:50:03.797 --> 02:50:07.279]  That's the way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[02:50:07.279 --> 02:50:13.864]  Well, the same thing's been happening to our troops, and thousands and thousands have died each time they tried the new experimental vaccine.
[02:50:13.864 --> 02:50:18.787]  And I'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[02:50:18.787 --> 02:50:21.789]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[02:50:21.789 --> 02:50:23.490]  But that's not even true.
[02:50:23.490 --> 02:50:27.933]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[02:50:27.933 --> 02:50:33.337]  This is violence being carried out against us by the military, and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[02:50:37.300 --> 02:50:46.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:46.369 --> 02:50:50.593]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:50:50.593 --> 02:50:55.458]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:50:55.458 --> 02:50:58.801]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:51:12.563 --> 02:51:16.045]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, and we've got breaking news.
[02:51:16.045 --> 02:51:33.335]  The amazing Cassandra Fairbanks at GatewayPundit.com did big articles and tweeted reports of confirmed vans hours and hours after the Detroit voting systems were closed, pulling up and delivering those illegal ballots.
[02:51:33.335 --> 02:51:39.338]  And so she's been blocked on Twitter for daring to put that out because you're supposed to go along with the big lie.
[02:51:39.338 --> 02:51:40.399]  We've got two articles
[02:51:41.431 --> 02:51:56.796]  The great writers at Infowars.com like Kellan McBreen and Kit Daniels and others have written, MSN admits bipartisan quote shadow campaign engaged in conspiracy to prevent Trump victory and they lay it all out.
[02:51:56.796 --> 02:51:59.097]  How they censored and suppressed people ahead of time.
[02:51:59.097 --> 02:52:01.358]  How they blocked Trump shelling the election fraud.
[02:52:01.358 --> 02:52:04.819]  They admit the whole thing.
[02:52:04.819 --> 02:52:06.360]  It is simply insane.
[02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:13.343]  But the good news is we're still on air and other organizations are still on air.
[02:52:13.343 --> 02:52:15.684]  And I want to stay on air.
[02:52:15.684 --> 02:52:19.026]  Part of me has been doing this 27 years and I'm exhausted.
[02:52:19.026 --> 02:52:20.246]  My spirit is stronger than ever.
[02:52:20.246 --> 02:52:21.787]  My body is weak.
[02:52:21.787 --> 02:52:30.051]  And part of me is like, my God, if they just shut us down as they're trying to do, I can then at least count on others and sit out a few years and rest.
[02:52:30.051 --> 02:52:30.792]  But I'm not going to do that.
[02:52:32.068 --> 02:52:33.950]  So I'm never going to give up.
[02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:38.353]  I'm never going to give in, but I could give out like an old horse getting road too far.
[02:52:38.353 --> 02:52:41.256]  We need money to run this operation.
[02:52:41.256 --> 02:52:45.359]  I was getting really excited in the last few months because we went in the black for a little bit.
[02:52:45.359 --> 02:52:47.501]  And then now we're going back into the red.
[02:52:47.501 --> 02:52:49.603]  So I need your support.
[02:52:49.603 --> 02:52:54.247]  And I need you to go to infowarestore.com because we're not like the other talk show hosts.
[02:52:54.247 --> 02:52:56.509]  They're going to stop talking about election fraud.
[02:52:56.509 --> 02:52:57.890]  Donald Trump is our president.
[02:52:57.890 --> 02:52:58.651]  We know what happened.
[02:52:59.462 --> 02:53:00.984]  We're not going to count on Trump to fix it, though.
[02:53:00.984 --> 02:53:01.786]  We're going to move forward.
[02:53:01.786 --> 02:53:03.468]  We elected him.
[02:53:03.468 --> 02:53:04.369]  He didn't elect us.
[02:53:05.936 --> 02:53:14.520]  Trump wrote it on just one wave, and we support him, we appreciate him, we'll fight for him during this fake impeachment trial coming up, but InfoWars needs to stay on the air.
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:16.441]  So don't take it for granted, which I know you don't.
[02:53:16.441 --> 02:53:17.521]  Tell folks about it.
[02:53:17.521 --> 02:53:22.644]  Support the local stations, and buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:53:22.644 --> 02:53:30.608]  Now, a lot of our best-selling products we can't even get anymore, because the supply chain broke down, the factories are shut down, society's breaking down.
[02:53:32.257 --> 02:53:33.517]  We're selling a lot of product.
[02:53:33.517 --> 02:53:36.258]  Problem is we can't get the best-selling product.
[02:53:36.258 --> 02:53:37.999]  So most of our best-selling products have sold out.
[02:53:37.999 --> 02:53:40.619]  We've got these left that have also been great sellers.
[02:53:40.619 --> 02:53:42.080]  DNA Force Plus is selling out.
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:43.440]  We'll have more for months.
[02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:44.500]  It's 25% off.
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:45.581]  So good for your immune system.
[02:53:45.581 --> 02:53:46.741]  So good for your body.
[02:53:46.741 --> 02:53:49.502]  So good to clean out your cells and telomeres.
[02:53:49.502 --> 02:53:50.722]  PQQ CoQ10.
[02:53:50.722 --> 02:53:52.983]  That's the Rolls-Royce DNA Force Plus.
[02:53:52.983 --> 02:53:53.723]  Ultra 12.
[02:53:53.723 --> 02:53:54.383]  Sold out.
[02:53:54.383 --> 02:53:55.323]  Back in stock.
[02:53:55.323 --> 02:53:56.043]  Under the tongue.
[02:53:56.043 --> 02:53:57.144]  Highest quality.
[02:53:57.144 --> 02:53:57.544]  Vitamin B12.
[02:53:59.136 --> 02:54:00.056]  Uploaded to your body.
[02:54:00.056 --> 02:54:05.579]  It's, again, good for your immune system, your metabolic system, your bones, your blood, your brain.
[02:54:05.579 --> 02:54:07.740]  It's one of the essential things you need 50% off.
[02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:11.661]  They're selling out of liquid turmeric, sold out of the powdered.
[02:54:11.661 --> 02:54:13.342]  Both of these are super concentrate.
[02:54:13.342 --> 02:54:14.223]  It's still discounted.
[02:54:14.223 --> 02:54:15.643]  It's sold out for months.
[02:54:15.643 --> 02:54:16.363]  Lung cleanse.
[02:54:16.363 --> 02:54:18.945]  All these essential oils, you spray in your mouth.
[02:54:18.945 --> 02:54:22.026]  After, you know, the way you do it, the way Dr. Rip recommends it is you just go like this.
[02:54:24.764 --> 02:54:28.746]  A little bit of an inhale after you spray, not when you spray or it'll burn your lungs.
[02:54:28.746 --> 02:54:31.948]  Just a little bit of it goes down in there and it's just very soothing.
[02:54:31.948 --> 02:54:35.591]  Especially if your larynx is worn out like mine as you have allergies.
[02:54:35.591 --> 02:54:49.579]  Whether it's lung killins, whether it's DNA Force Plus, whether it's Turbo Force, whether it's X3, whether it is our great Saw Palmetto product, Prostagard, or Supramel Vitality, it's all at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:55:13.132 --> 02:55:17.954]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's it for my section of the transmission.
[02:55:17.954 --> 02:55:18.815]  We're going to come out of break.
[02:55:19.753 --> 02:55:24.057]  We're going to go to this special report that just went live at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:24.057 --> 02:55:28.180]  This is not a spectator sport that I hope you share.
[02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:30.663]  The No Mask Rebellion has begun.
[02:55:30.663 --> 02:55:31.584]  You want to fight?
[02:55:31.584 --> 02:55:32.184]  You want to win?
[02:55:32.184 --> 02:55:33.145]  We've already won together.
[02:55:33.145 --> 02:55:33.705]  We can do it.
[02:55:33.705 --> 02:55:34.946]  It just went live.
[02:55:34.946 --> 02:55:37.269]  The No Mask Rebellion has begun.
[02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:39.370]  Share this video.
[02:55:39.370 --> 02:55:40.231]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:55:42.791 --> 02:55:45.192]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:55:45.192 --> 02:55:47.534]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:55:57.012 --> 02:56:06.021]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Ban.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[02:56:06.021 --> 02:56:11.707]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[02:56:11.707 --> 02:56:15.170]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[02:56:15.931 --> 02:56:20.593]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[02:56:20.593 --> 02:56:22.534]  TheResistance.Video.
[02:56:22.534 --> 02:56:26.977]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[02:56:26.977 --> 02:56:37.582]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information, is at TheResistance.Video.
[02:56:37.582 --> 02:56:38.522]  Share the link.
[02:56:38.522 --> 02:56:40.103]  TheResistance.Video.
[02:56:40.103 --> 02:56:41.244]  TheResistance.Video.
[02:56:43.991 --> 02:56:47.432]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:56:47.432 --> 02:56:52.315]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:01.403 --> 02:57:08.508]  According to Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab that run the Davos Group of the United Nations, COVID response, the masks are never coming off.
[02:57:08.508 --> 02:57:09.429]  Did you hear that?
[02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:17.695]  The masks are never coming off and any business or any sport or any activity that has humans in close proximity is going to be ended.
[02:57:17.695 --> 02:57:23.019]  This is the end of civilization and life as we know it and it's called living in a giant prison.
[02:57:23.786 --> 02:57:32.770]  But we know that many industries which rely particularly on physical interaction will have difficulties to survive.
[02:57:32.770 --> 02:57:40.413]  Normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[02:57:40.413 --> 02:57:43.534]  And so what policies should we have?
[02:57:43.534 --> 02:57:51.338]  Because until we get almost everybody vaccinated globally, we still won't be fully back to normal.
[02:57:51.338 --> 02:57:51.938]  We want to go
[02:57:52.678 --> 02:57:56.240]  You know, and manufacture, and do construction, and go to school.
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:03.185]  But there will be things, like big public events, where the risk will outweigh the risk of a disease rebound.
[02:58:03.185 --> 02:58:07.187]  Even after you get vaccinated, you still gotta keep taking the shots and wear the mask.
[02:58:07.187 --> 02:58:09.889]  Even after you get vaccinated, you now learn it doesn't protect you from COVID.
[02:58:09.889 --> 02:58:14.672]  Because they've never had a vaccine for the common cold, and COVID is based on that.
[02:58:14.952 --> 02:58:20.394]  But even after you're vaccinated, social distancing, wearing masks are going to be essential.
[02:58:20.394 --> 02:58:24.615]  And we'll need to continue communicating about that for health and medical experts.
[02:58:24.615 --> 02:58:26.836]  This is not pre-pandemic video.
[02:58:26.836 --> 02:58:31.277]  Shoppers at this Naples grocery store aren't wearing masks.
[02:58:31.277 --> 02:58:33.378]  And employees aren't either.
[02:58:33.378 --> 02:58:34.698]  So we've never been wearing masks.
[02:58:34.998 --> 02:58:42.805]  Alfie Oaks is making national headlines for not enforcing mask wearing at his Oaks Farms Seat-to-Table Market.
[02:58:42.805 --> 02:58:48.150]  Customers can wear a full bodysuit, and if you're afraid of bumping your head, then put on a football helmet.
[02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:53.155]  Oats Seat-to-Table Market in Naples, Florida has committed an incredible thought crime.
[02:58:53.795 --> 02:59:00.317]  They're looking at the science, the research, and the facts, and saying, if you don't want to wear a mask in our store, you don't have to.
[02:59:00.317 --> 02:59:02.778]  Because after all, there's not a law in Florida.
[02:59:02.778 --> 02:59:08.099]  And most areas that have put laws in place are unconstitutional, and courts have already found that.
[02:59:08.099 --> 02:59:19.523]  Not just here, but in Germany, and in Sweden, and other areas, they have found that the masks do not protect you, they actually give you viral pneumonia in many cases, and that it's nothing but a giant virtue signal.
[02:59:20.023 --> 02:59:26.211]  The sign out front outlines if you have a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a mask, you are exempt.
[02:59:26.211 --> 02:59:28.915]  And we cannot legally ask you about your medical condition.
[02:59:29.973 --> 02:59:32.574]  Oh, all the mainstream media is gaslighting us.
[02:59:32.574 --> 02:59:33.874]  They're so scared.
[02:59:33.874 --> 02:59:36.776]  Look at the horror of these people.
[02:59:36.776 --> 02:59:39.236]  Inside a grocery store, almost no one's wearing masks.
[02:59:39.236 --> 02:59:40.637]  How dare them?
[02:59:40.637 --> 02:59:45.859]  Shepard Smith says, listen, we all dream of the day the masks come off, but that day's not here.
[02:59:45.859 --> 02:59:51.061]  We all fantasize about a time when we won't have to wear the masks anymore.
[02:59:51.061 --> 02:59:51.601]  It's not now.
[02:59:52.441 --> 03:00:02.887]  Yes, Shep, we know it's not here because Biden, the UN, Bill Gates, all of them admit that the masks are permanent and we're being habituated to never take them off.
[03:00:02.887 --> 03:00:10.472]  This is about humans being dirty, humans being bad, humans not even able to have sex without a mask on.
[03:00:10.472 --> 03:00:19.357]  This is about the state literally coming to our lives and setting up a federal and international task force to come into people's houses and demand contact tracing.
[03:00:19.557 --> 03:00:19.957]  We're good to go.
[03:00:45.310 --> 03:00:50.013]  Though the owner, Alfie Oakes, made it clear this is about much more than that.
[03:00:50.013 --> 03:00:52.915]  You don't think masks work and that the virus is not a real thing?
[03:00:52.915 --> 03:00:58.979]  I know that the masks don't work and I know that the virus has not killed 400,000 people in this country.
[03:00:58.979 --> 03:01:00.960]  That's total hogwash.
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:02.081]  In fact, the U.S.
[03:01:02.081 --> 03:01:09.506]  COVID death toll has now exceeded 450,000 and health experts have been adamant that wearing masks would save countless lives.
[03:01:10.270 --> 03:01:17.492]  Probably the most important thing is we've seen mask use up over 85% and that's been a critical part of getting these numbers down.
[03:01:17.492 --> 03:01:23.633]  But inside this supermarket, lines of uncovered faces prompting mostly heavy criticism.
[03:01:23.633 --> 03:01:25.153]  I can't stop watching this.
[03:01:25.153 --> 03:01:27.574]  My jaw is literally on my desk.
[03:01:27.574 --> 03:01:29.054]  This should be a crime.
[03:01:29.054 --> 03:01:32.715]  People across the country are dying because of behavior like this.
[03:01:32.715 --> 03:01:38.076]  And from a woman mourning her father's death from COVID, this makes my stomach turn and my heart sink.
[03:01:38.516 --> 03:01:42.798]  The horse can't be led to water, even though a tsunami is heading its way.
[03:01:42.798 --> 03:01:44.019]  This is not about your health.
[03:01:44.019 --> 03:01:52.463]  It's the Democrats in California that passed a law that you can give people HIV or hepatitis knowingly and not even get in trouble.
[03:01:53.328 --> 03:01:54.768]  And it expands on from there.
[03:01:54.768 --> 03:01:58.189]  In the last decade, millions of people have died in the U.S.
[03:01:58.189 --> 03:01:59.609]  from drug-resistant TB.
[03:01:59.609 --> 03:02:01.830]  Almost all of it coming in from the third world.
[03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:06.171]  And under Obama, they stopped even testing people when they came in.
[03:02:06.171 --> 03:02:07.591]  Trump started again.
[03:02:07.591 --> 03:02:14.312]  Now, Biden is talking about killing that program as well and increasing the number of refugees that come to the United States.
[03:02:14.312 --> 03:02:15.312]  But it's not just TB.
[03:02:15.312 --> 03:02:21.134]  It's bubonic plague and hundreds of other diseases that were cured, that were non-existent in the U.S.
[03:02:21.134 --> 03:02:22.574]  and are now back with a vengeance.
[03:02:23.214 --> 03:02:35.702]  And let's not forget all of the giant hepatitis outbreaks in Democrat-controlled cities in California and other areas where they allow all these drug addict homeless by the thousands to sleep on the street and defecate on the street.
[03:02:35.702 --> 03:02:40.785]  That's now spreading the general public and police officers and trash collectors are catching these diseases.
[03:02:41.553 --> 03:02:44.955]  No, the left doesn't care about the giant rat infestations in New York.
[03:02:44.955 --> 03:02:46.276]  They don't care about the open borders.
[03:02:46.276 --> 03:02:47.397]  They don't care about any of it.
[03:02:47.397 --> 03:02:56.023]  They want you to wear a mask because they said so, and they want federal police, TSA, on checkpoints at bus stations and train stations to enforce it.
[03:02:56.023 --> 03:02:57.123]  It's all happening.
[03:02:57.123 --> 03:03:02.207]  It's a dystopia run out of the United Nations, and America is waking up.
[03:03:02.207 --> 03:03:08.171]  So if I lived in Florida, I'd drive a hundred miles every week to shop at this store instead of other stores.
[03:03:08.171 --> 03:03:11.013]  And I'm looking for stores in Austin, Texas that aren't in this cult.
[03:03:11.833 --> 03:03:14.254]  We have family property out in East Texas.
[03:03:14.254 --> 03:03:21.535]  I'm seriously thinking about moving there because when I went and visited family a few months ago, no one was wearing masks in the East Texas towns.
[03:03:21.535 --> 03:03:25.916]  And on the way back to Austin, almost no one was wearing masks until we got into the town.
[03:03:25.916 --> 03:03:27.576]  This is a leftist sacrament.
[03:03:27.576 --> 03:03:30.017]  It's their new religion of humans are dirty.
[03:03:30.017 --> 03:03:31.257]  We hurt the environment.
[03:03:31.257 --> 03:03:32.837]  We've got to be depopulated.
[03:03:32.837 --> 03:03:37.998]  The post-human future is here, and it's a symbol of our surrender, a symbol of our slavery.
[03:03:37.998 --> 03:03:40.699]  And to watch the horror and the fear and the
[03:03:44.481 --> 03:03:47.282]  When it's all a fraud is incredibly disgusting.
[03:03:47.282 --> 03:03:48.883]  So all of us have to start demonstrating.
[03:03:48.883 --> 03:03:55.526]  We all have to start going into stores and pointing out this is a fraud because this is an oppressive system that's never going away.
[03:03:55.526 --> 03:04:01.029]  Again, they tell you just a little bit longer, 15 days to cut the curve, three months to do this.
[03:04:01.029 --> 03:04:02.649]  Oh, just wear your mask for another month.
[03:04:02.649 --> 03:04:04.910]  And then, oh, you didn't do a good enough job.
[03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:07.312]  Sorry, that mask is never coming off.
[03:04:07.312 --> 03:04:09.533]  Now Communist China is invading Hong Kong.
[03:04:10.393 --> 03:04:15.636]  And using the mask mandate and contact tracers as a pretext to grab and snatch people out of their homes.
[03:04:15.636 --> 03:04:18.899]  And they're setting it up in Canada and Australia and Germany and England.
[03:04:18.899 --> 03:04:24.842]  This is a worldwide UN takeover and a cover for literal martial law and secret arrest.
[03:04:24.842 --> 03:04:26.784]  Our capital is surrounded by troops.
[03:04:26.784 --> 03:04:33.188]  They're announcing there's an enemy within and the CIA is going to act domestically like Trump supporters or Al Qaeda to crush us.
[03:04:33.928 --> 03:04:39.592]  We have to come together with our own communities, our own economies, as Americans, and reject this globalist takeover.
[03:04:39.592 --> 03:04:45.056]  And it starts by having the facts, educating people on the facts, and taking the damn mask off.
[03:04:45.056 --> 03:04:47.238]  Oaks has sparked controversy before.
[03:04:47.238 --> 03:04:53.402]  His Facebook post calling the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement a hoax.
[03:04:53.402 --> 03:04:59.127]  His comments costing him a multi-million dollar kids lunch contract with the Collier County School Board.
[03:04:59.787 --> 03:05:07.615]  And while his no mask policy has generated criticism, it's also been bringing a lot of people.
[03:05:07.615 --> 03:05:13.220]  What do you tell people or health officials who say you might be putting people at risk?
[03:05:13.220 --> 03:05:15.022]  I just say, please do your research.
[03:05:15.022 --> 03:05:18.105]  Please do your critical thinking and research.
[03:05:18.385 --> 03:05:21.906]  Trump really fumbled the ball going along with this whole vaccine hoax.
[03:05:21.906 --> 03:05:23.267]  And he did some other things that were really bad.
[03:05:23.267 --> 03:05:26.608]  He let big tech take over and censor everybody and that was his undoing.
[03:05:26.608 --> 03:05:32.229]  But the greatest thing about Trump in the last year was looking at those giant rallies of 20,000, 30,000, 100,000, 200,000, almost nobody wearing masks.
[03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:36.411]  People sing to the hoax.
[03:05:36.411 --> 03:05:40.932]  And now, that basic understanding is awakening people in a chain reaction.
[03:05:40.932 --> 03:05:43.313]  The PCR test are fake.
[03:05:43.313 --> 03:05:44.374]  96% false positive.
[03:05:44.374 --> 03:05:45.874]  It's like a bad cold.
[03:05:45.874 --> 03:05:47.095]  Most people died of other things.
[03:05:47.095 --> 03:05:48.195]  They put it in a column.
[03:05:48.195 --> 03:05:49.416]  This is all admitted.
[03:05:49.416 --> 03:05:56.779]  But Big Tech is trying to censor this truth so big media, dinosaur media, can gaslight us and tell us to keep our damn mask on.
[03:05:57.390 --> 03:06:02.595]  We all fantasize about a time when we won't have to wear the masks anymore.
[03:06:02.595 --> 03:06:03.756]  It's not now.
[03:06:03.756 --> 03:06:09.361]  But some at a supermarket in Florida appear to have decided that the time is now.
[03:06:09.361 --> 03:06:10.042]  Look at this.
[03:06:10.042 --> 03:06:15.127]  This was the scene at Oaks Farm Seed and To Table Market in Naples today.
[03:06:15.127 --> 03:06:18.029]  NBC's Sam Brock took this video, which went viral.
[03:06:18.029 --> 03:06:20.712]  It looks like it was taken pre-pandemic, right?
[03:06:20.712 --> 03:06:23.034]  Most customers and employees not wearing masks
[03:06:23.494 --> 03:06:24.055]  At all.
[03:06:24.055 --> 03:06:34.987]  The scene inside Oak's Farm's Seed to Table Market, taken less than 24 hours ago, shows employees and customers, young and old, almost entirely without masks.
[03:06:34.987 --> 03:06:38.972]  This store's policy includes mask exemption guidelines.

[03:08:11.138 --> 03:08:13.499]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[03:08:13.499 --> 03:08:16.280]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:17.540]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:25.063]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[03:08:25.063 --> 03:08:28.684]  I said man, I gotta get on that show and give him an update.
[03:08:28.684 --> 03:08:29.144]  I said if I
[03:08:29.424 --> 03:08:37.753]  If I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[03:08:37.753 --> 03:08:43.138]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this Info Wars store products.
[03:08:43.138 --> 03:08:49.644]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night, so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[03:08:49.644 --> 03:08:53.008]  My contention is, why don't we start this new year off right?
[03:08:53.408 --> 03:08:59.571]  With everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense, now you gotta follow that up with the Micro-CS.
[03:08:59.571 --> 03:09:00.632]  I learned that.
[03:09:00.632 --> 03:09:03.213]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[03:09:03.213 --> 03:09:03.874]  We didn't know.
[03:09:03.874 --> 03:09:05.034]  We didn't screen your call.
[03:09:05.034 --> 03:09:05.795]  We had no idea.
[03:09:05.795 --> 03:09:09.537]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[03:09:09.537 --> 03:09:10.197]  Living Defense.
[03:09:10.197 --> 03:09:10.798]  Living Defense.
[03:09:10.798 --> 03:09:14.219]  Living Defense.
[03:09:14.219 --> 03:09:16.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:37.838]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Baggage.
[03:09:43.297 --> 03:09:44.438]  And welcome back.
[03:09:44.438 --> 03:09:53.485]  It's good to be here this Friday morning, just before noon in my part of the world and afternoon, most of the rest in the listening audience today.
[03:09:53.485 --> 03:09:55.766]  I appreciate everyone who's here today.
[03:09:55.766 --> 03:10:09.417]  You know, I was thinking about that last segment before that Alex was doing on the Bitcoin and my eldest son, you know, when that first kicked in, he hit me up and said, Dad, you got to do this.
[03:10:09.417 --> 03:10:10.157]  You got to do this.
[03:10:10.157 --> 03:10:11.038]  And I didn't listen to him.
[03:10:11.673 --> 03:10:17.888]  And he did that and did really well with it when it was about seven bucks.
[03:10:17.888 --> 03:10:18.970]  And he still has it.
[03:10:18.970 --> 03:10:19.932]  So he did really good.
[03:10:21.787 --> 03:10:24.749]  But, you know, it was so abstract to me.
[03:10:24.749 --> 03:10:29.072]  I mean, it's like you got fiat, which is really weird, you know, right?
[03:10:29.072 --> 03:10:36.437]  I mean, and then you have Bitcoin, which was explained really well in the last hour and better than I could ever do.
[03:10:36.437 --> 03:10:42.662]  Anyway, having said all that, you know, we're entering this really unstable time that everyone is seeing.
[03:10:42.662 --> 03:10:44.883]  And I still say the clouds are just gathering.
[03:10:44.883 --> 03:10:45.904]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[03:10:48.899 --> 03:10:52.900]  As bad as that is, you know, I think that's really what we're dealing with.
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:11:00.722]  And, you know, thinking about banking, you know, one of my dear friends has this concept called astral banking, which is kind of weird.
[03:11:00.722 --> 03:11:05.643]  Or I could think about it a little differently, you know, storing treasures in heaven.
[03:11:05.643 --> 03:11:06.583]  What does that mean?
[03:11:06.583 --> 03:11:08.964]  You know, storing up treasures in heaven.
[03:11:08.964 --> 03:11:11.304]  And so I want to talk a little bit about that.
[03:11:11.304 --> 03:11:12.525]  Astral banking.
[03:11:12.525 --> 03:11:13.285]  How does that work?
[03:11:13.285 --> 03:11:17.746]  And it's been what we've been talking about indirectly, indirectly over the last few weeks.
[03:11:18.606 --> 03:11:33.211]  When I've been on and the idea of doing things that you can do rather than this oxymoron people throw around like it's real called doing the impossible which If you stop and think about how do you do the impossible?
[03:11:33.211 --> 03:11:44.015]  Do the possible and that's what I've been saying a lot lately and I think that's where we get our power back feel a little less Helpless, you know and you see it all over, you know, I get a lot of different
[03:11:44.777 --> 03:11:44.897]  Yes.
[03:12:03.672 --> 03:12:09.135]  Fears that don't happen or dreams that never come true, you know?
[03:12:09.135 --> 03:12:12.116]  And rather, or dreaming the impossible dream, right?
[03:12:12.116 --> 03:12:13.717]  Which doesn't happen either, you know?
[03:12:13.717 --> 03:12:18.660]  And so I'm thinking again about this, what gets our power back?
[03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:28.685]  And it's being able to take effective actions on the things that we individually know with certainty, with conviction, what we can do.
[03:12:29.548 --> 03:12:34.009]  And a lot of it doesn't involve anything but our good will and effort.
[03:12:34.009 --> 03:12:36.930]  And other things are material, you know.
[03:12:36.930 --> 03:12:42.311]  And Alex was saying in the last hour and last couple hours, you know, the network takes resources.
[03:12:42.311 --> 03:12:44.032]  Some of us volunteer our time.
[03:12:44.032 --> 03:12:44.412]  I do.
[03:12:44.412 --> 03:12:45.552]  Others do.
[03:12:45.552 --> 03:12:49.753]  And then material resources pay for the team to keep this thing going.
[03:12:49.753 --> 03:12:53.875]  So if you can, buy good products, support the team in that way.
[03:12:53.875 --> 03:12:55.355]  And that's great.
[03:12:55.355 --> 03:12:58.696]  We all appreciate seeing that happen and allows us to continue doing what we do.
[03:12:59.456 --> 03:13:03.520]  But when I think about astral banking, it's a little bit different.
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:07.704]  It's this idea that we can do good works.
[03:13:07.704 --> 03:13:14.971]  We can do things that we feel are just or right or rational or good.
[03:13:14.971 --> 03:13:19.655]  They represent the sense of goodness in us and kindness in us.
[03:13:19.655 --> 03:13:20.716]  And we can express that.
[03:13:21.653 --> 03:13:23.095]  Everywhere we go.
[03:13:23.095 --> 03:13:25.878]  And I've talked about this sort of the magic ingredients.
[03:13:25.878 --> 03:13:30.002]  I hate that word, but I'm trying to think of a better word.
[03:13:30.002 --> 03:13:34.907]  But it's the combination of things that make things happen.
[03:13:34.907 --> 03:13:36.769]  And you have thought and you have emotion.
[03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:38.551]  We've talked about it before.
[03:13:38.551 --> 03:13:41.654]  When these get combined with intention that pushes them out,
[03:13:42.279 --> 03:13:50.589]  Then you have real things being done when you know with conviction what you're going to do, what you know you can do.
[03:13:50.589 --> 03:13:54.773]  So begin to do that, you know, sort of set it up in the morning.
[03:13:54.773 --> 03:14:02.162]  And I talked about this to kind of how do we equip the saints, if you will, or equip this generation of
[03:14:03.974 --> 03:14:08.118]  Of a new kind of revolutionary, perhaps.
[03:14:08.118 --> 03:14:21.609]  Maybe one that goes deep first inside, so when we project outside, we do it with real power, not this nonsense we see played out on CNN and Fox, you know?
[03:14:21.609 --> 03:14:30.277]  But I'm talking about something deeper, something more real, something that represents the spark of divinity that resides in all of us.
[03:14:30.277 --> 03:14:31.538]  And here's the action.
[03:14:32.330 --> 03:14:37.451]  Uh, in this, as we project into the world from this place.
[03:14:37.451 --> 03:14:43.813]  Uh, there's power in that, ladies and gentlemen, that is dwarfs anything you see out there in the world.
[03:14:43.813 --> 03:14:49.315]  It only takes one, the right one, to ignite that spark within.
[03:14:49.315 --> 03:14:57.917]  Um, and then the game changes and there's millions, I believe, arising into the possibility of this right now.
[03:14:58.650 --> 03:15:08.198]  And Alex has said it, you know, and I was saying it over 25 years ago now, that around this time, this is what we would see going on.
[03:15:08.198 --> 03:15:15.765]  A lot of chaos, but at the same time, this big reawakening to the essence of what we are as created human beings.
[03:15:15.765 --> 03:15:18.367]  And I said it a bit differently, you know.
[03:15:20.639 --> 03:15:26.183]  20 years ago, 25 years ago, but if you read it carefully, it's all right there.
[03:15:26.183 --> 03:15:33.449]  And then all of this in the last 25, 30 years now, InfoWars, right?
[03:15:33.449 --> 03:15:34.970]  And what has that been about?
[03:15:34.970 --> 03:15:36.611]  Changing the way we see the world.
[03:15:36.611 --> 03:15:47.880]  That's what we've been about, you know, re-examining what is in all these little slogans like doing the impossible, you know, like the unconscious, which I talked about last week.
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:49.581]  There is no un-in-conscience.
[03:15:50.327 --> 03:15:57.890]  You know, if you take the yin out, it actually comes into your present form, and you're doing that, right?
[03:15:57.890 --> 03:16:14.957]  That's what it means to be created in the likeness and image of a creator, that you are plugged in, and awake, and aware, and you know it, and you behave differently because of it, and the energy comes into you because of it.
[03:16:14.957 --> 03:16:17.238]  But truth is really relevant here.
[03:16:18.217 --> 03:16:22.038]  And I talked a lot about that over the last few weeks.
[03:16:22.038 --> 03:16:23.118]  Your own truth.
[03:16:23.118 --> 03:16:24.839]  Are you lying to yourself?
[03:16:24.839 --> 03:16:26.699]  Are you lying to God?
[03:16:26.699 --> 03:16:29.360]  Are you lying to who you're lying to?
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:31.461]  And if you are, clean that up.
[03:16:31.461 --> 03:16:33.361]  Get that cleaned up.
[03:16:33.361 --> 03:16:35.102]  And admit what you don't know.
[03:16:35.102 --> 03:16:38.603]  And ask for knowledge.
[03:16:38.603 --> 03:16:40.203]  You know, reveal your heart.
[03:16:40.203 --> 03:16:43.184]  That's what I'm saying is a different way to pray.
[03:16:43.184 --> 03:16:46.225]  Don't be the whining victim pleading.
[03:16:47.237 --> 03:16:49.258]  No, don't do that.
[03:16:49.258 --> 03:16:51.678]  You know, you don't need to do that.
[03:16:51.678 --> 03:16:55.560]  You think the universe doesn't know what you need?
[03:16:55.560 --> 03:16:57.460]  Get beyond that.
[03:16:57.460 --> 03:17:05.803]  You know, get beyond that and have a conversation with someone who wants to relate with you.
[03:17:05.803 --> 03:17:07.923]  That's where the universe is at.
[03:17:07.923 --> 03:17:12.425]  Creating the image and likeness, you know, this trip back to the garden.
[03:17:12.425 --> 03:17:13.285]  That's what we're on.
[03:17:14.235 --> 03:17:15.437]  We've fallen out of it.
[03:17:15.437 --> 03:17:18.202]  We're making our trip back to the garden.
[03:17:19.608 --> 03:17:22.089]  That's what I think we're doing here in the earth.
[03:17:22.089 --> 03:17:32.916]  We can do it with respect and dignity and the honor that we were created to be when we look in the eyes of another human soul and we see the honor of what they are as well.
[03:17:32.916 --> 03:17:38.299]  That's what we have in this year of 2021.
[03:17:38.299 --> 03:17:46.243]  As much as the horror shows going on all around us and we see it, we hear it, we've heard it all and we're feeling it.
[03:17:46.243 --> 03:17:49.365]  I mean, there's no denying what we're feeling either.
[03:17:50.029 --> 03:17:58.379]  But let's pay attention to those feelings, and as we do, we gain control of them, and they no longer jerk us around the room by our shirt collars.
[03:17:58.379 --> 03:18:01.723]  We're the InfoWars, and you're the InfoWarrior.
[03:18:01.723 --> 03:18:03.185]  And what does that mean?
[03:18:03.185 --> 03:18:05.708]  That means we have real power in what we are.
[03:18:05.708 --> 03:18:06.890]  This is Dr. Nick Feggage.
[03:18:06.890 --> 03:18:08.632]  We'll be right back after these messages.
[03:18:10.700 --> 03:18:18.026]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, we're technocrats.
[03:18:18.026 --> 03:18:26.173]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying,
[03:18:26.873 --> 03:18:30.177]  But they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[03:18:30.177 --> 03:18:33.000]  But they want businessmen, technocrats over them.
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:34.121]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[03:18:34.121 --> 03:18:39.488]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[03:18:39.488 --> 03:18:42.331]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[03:18:43.442 --> 03:18:48.586]  He believes, because he's hidden it from you, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[03:18:48.586 --> 03:18:50.728]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[03:18:50.728 --> 03:18:52.810]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[03:18:52.810 --> 03:18:56.673]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[03:18:56.673 --> 03:18:58.975]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[03:18:58.975 --> 03:19:00.216]  In his own words.
[03:19:00.216 --> 03:19:05.640]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:08.162]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[03:19:10.708 --> 03:19:13.610]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[03:19:13.610 --> 03:19:15.611]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[03:19:15.611 --> 03:19:18.533]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:19:18.533 --> 03:19:21.855]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:19:21.855 --> 03:19:24.956]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:19:24.956 --> 03:19:26.497]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:19:26.497 --> 03:19:33.081]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:19:33.081 --> 03:19:35.863]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[03:19:36.926 --> 03:19:40.269]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:43.192]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:19:43.192 --> 03:19:44.894]  That sends chills up my spine.
[03:19:44.894 --> 03:19:58.448]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:19:58.448 --> 03:20:00.389]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:06.285]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[03:20:06.285 --> 03:20:08.732]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[03:20:10.888 --> 03:20:13.269]  The post-industrial world.
[03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:22.531]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[03:20:22.531 --> 03:20:27.032]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[03:20:27.032 --> 03:20:32.913]  Klaus Schwab, the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[03:20:35.774 --> 03:20:38.777]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[03:20:38.777 --> 03:20:41.920]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[03:20:41.920 --> 03:20:43.882]  It is making the population poor.
[03:20:43.882 --> 03:20:49.787]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[03:20:49.787 --> 03:20:53.110]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it, and they're dystopic.
[03:20:54.191 --> 03:20:57.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:25.302 --> 03:21:32.188]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:21:32.188 --> 03:21:35.751]  And now, your host, Nick Vagich.
[03:21:39.386 --> 03:21:40.667]  So glad to be back.
[03:21:40.667 --> 03:21:53.397]  You know, just before the break, I was talking a little bit about this relationship with the creation and how so many people come at it sort of as a victim, whining, groveling, you know.
[03:21:53.397 --> 03:21:57.460]  And this is really not the relationship I believe the creator really wants with us.
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:22:02.444]  It's a conversation revealing your heart, if you will, in that conversation.
[03:22:04.585 --> 03:22:06.607]  Acknowledging the limits of what you know.
[03:22:06.607 --> 03:22:11.131]  You know, being honest for that self-examination that I was talking about before the break.
[03:22:11.131 --> 03:22:17.016]  You know, this idea of going internally and sort of re-examining the base questions, you know.
[03:22:17.016 --> 03:22:19.678]  Do you still have doubt?
[03:22:19.678 --> 03:22:21.119]  You know, and I mentioned that last week.
[03:22:21.119 --> 03:22:26.944]  You know, the doubt that the size of a mustard seed does much damage is the faith.
[03:22:26.944 --> 03:22:30.227]  And everyone seems to muster the doubt pretty easy.
[03:22:31.459 --> 03:22:33.420]  In terms of how we approach life.
[03:22:33.420 --> 03:22:36.780]  So acknowledging what we don't know is not a sin.
[03:22:36.780 --> 03:22:38.101]  It's a reality.
[03:22:38.101 --> 03:22:40.201]  Okay?
[03:22:40.201 --> 03:22:42.882]  And that's what we got to start with is what we know.
[03:22:42.882 --> 03:22:45.763]  Don't do the impossible because you can't.
[03:22:45.763 --> 03:22:47.443]  Do the possible because you can.
[03:22:47.443 --> 03:22:50.024]  That's faith and conviction that rolls up with that.
[03:22:50.024 --> 03:22:51.564]  Makes it possible to get it done.
[03:22:51.564 --> 03:22:54.845]  And the next steps reveal themselves.
[03:22:54.845 --> 03:22:59.266]  The other piece that I was talking about before the break was this idea of how we view each other.
[03:22:59.964 --> 03:23:06.770]  Divinely, you know, it makes it hard to punch someone in the nose, you know, when you're viewing them that way.
[03:23:06.770 --> 03:23:14.577]  And I mean that sincerely because, and I'm not saying you don't block the punch and, you know, kind of step back, get ready to do what you got to do.
[03:23:14.577 --> 03:23:18.580]  But, you know, there's a balancing act in all of this.
[03:23:18.580 --> 03:23:19.601]  And when you turn it to
[03:23:21.272 --> 03:23:26.233]  Defense, and that might have to do with a lot of force, too.
[03:23:26.233 --> 03:23:38.817]  But before you turn all that on, there's a lot of other steps in the game, and that's where I think we have an opportunity on a one-on-one with each other, meeting people where they are, which I say often, but seeing what's possible.
[03:23:38.817 --> 03:23:47.359]  That's the mark of true leadership, to look in a human being's eyes and see the creative human soul in there and the potential that exists within them.
[03:23:47.859 --> 03:23:47.959]  Yeah.
[03:24:18.380 --> 03:24:22.326]  Recognizing the potential in people is truly a gift.
[03:24:22.326 --> 03:24:29.155]  It's something we should all try and do, but also meeting people where they are and not being heard in the process.
[03:24:29.155 --> 03:24:30.937]  And that's not about judging others.
[03:24:30.937 --> 03:24:32.860]  That's about judging your own perimeters.
[03:24:33.599 --> 03:24:37.465]  against the evidence in front of you, the facts that present themselves.
[03:24:37.465 --> 03:24:42.774]  And those facts may lead you to moderate your relationships quite a lot, you know?
[03:24:42.774 --> 03:24:44.336]  And they do, right?
[03:24:44.336 --> 03:24:48.383]  I mean, those are how we make judgments about who we let in our lives and who we don't.
[03:24:49.524 --> 03:24:56.831]  And here's the thing I see is, if it's all complaint and victimhood and whining, we need to re-examine all that.
[03:24:56.831 --> 03:25:00.855]  Or if it's all talking about people, we need to re-examine all that.
[03:25:00.855 --> 03:25:04.639]  Let's talk about ideas and principles and things that change things.
[03:25:04.639 --> 03:25:09.564]  Let's talk about the facts that we all need to be informed on, which is what we get from so much of the week.
[03:25:10.104 --> 03:25:19.028]  From the various hosts, they bring us lots of data and information that we get to index and use to push our political agendas forward.
[03:25:19.028 --> 03:25:20.128]  And we need to do that.
[03:25:20.128 --> 03:25:20.908]  I mean, I mean it.
[03:25:20.908 --> 03:25:23.590]  We need to do it more than now, than ever.
[03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:26.331]  Last week, I talked about note cards.
[03:25:26.331 --> 03:25:32.113]  You know, get a box of note cards at your local store and start writing handwritten notes to each other.
[03:25:32.113 --> 03:25:33.814]  But write them to your congressman.
[03:25:33.814 --> 03:25:35.914]  Handwritten notes.
[03:25:35.914 --> 03:25:36.675]  And your U.S.
[03:25:36.675 --> 03:25:37.115]  Senator.
[03:25:37.742 --> 03:25:39.964]  If you don't think it matters, I can tell you.
[03:25:39.964 --> 03:25:41.364]  My brother was in the U.S.
[03:25:41.364 --> 03:25:42.145]  Senate.
[03:25:42.145 --> 03:25:44.907]  My father was in the United States House of Representatives.
[03:25:44.907 --> 03:25:49.490]  My brother, other brother, is in the state legislature here.
[03:25:49.490 --> 03:25:51.151]  My uncle was in Minnesota.
[03:25:51.151 --> 03:25:54.373]  I mean, it goes on and on, and let me tell you something.
[03:25:54.373 --> 03:25:56.695]  And I'm a second-generation American.
[03:25:56.695 --> 03:26:00.317]  My father was a first-generation, and his father was an immigrant.
[03:26:00.317 --> 03:26:02.999]  So things can happen in this country still.
[03:26:04.355 --> 03:26:15.998]  You know, if you work hard and do things, and my grandfather, when he came, he's digging holes underground before they went open pit and iron mining, you know, for a buck a day or whatever it was back then.
[03:26:15.998 --> 03:26:16.698]  It wasn't much.
[03:26:16.698 --> 03:26:18.718]  It was like a buck a day.
[03:26:18.718 --> 03:26:30.141]  And, you know, when you look at all of what we've done in this country and what we see going down the toilet right now, on a platform of bad values that we see being projected into our lives by
[03:26:30.993 --> 03:26:36.101]  This insane liberal left at this moment.
[03:26:36.101 --> 03:26:44.254]  And I got to say this too, my son, my son, one of my, my smart son, you know, you brought up this, you know, hey, you want to piss off the left.
[03:26:44.967 --> 03:26:48.309]  Live for a hundred years.
[03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:49.290]  You know, I love that.
[03:26:49.290 --> 03:26:51.311]  You know, really live for a hundred years.
[03:26:51.311 --> 03:26:52.671]  That means take care of yourself.
[03:26:52.671 --> 03:26:54.993]  Get stress levels under control.
[03:26:54.993 --> 03:26:57.494]  Take a look at the supplements on InfoWars.
[03:26:57.494 --> 03:27:02.997]  They're the best, the best ingredients, best quality, best, best.
[03:27:02.997 --> 03:27:05.058]  And it is the two for right.
[03:27:05.058 --> 03:27:06.439]  And so do that.
[03:27:06.439 --> 03:27:08.981]  And live to be a hundred years old.
[03:27:11.964 --> 03:27:13.825]  You know, and make your family happy.
[03:27:13.825 --> 03:27:17.588]  Stick around and do something meaningful with our lives.
[03:27:17.588 --> 03:27:19.809]  And this is our opportunity.
[03:27:19.809 --> 03:27:31.157]  This world right now should be a world of true abundance, and it's not because of a few that are manipulating our life, liberty, and our pursuit of happiness in every way.
[03:27:32.617 --> 03:27:36.140]  You know, and now in a digital way, you know, think about it.
[03:27:36.140 --> 03:27:38.822]  Most of our life is intruded upon digitally.
[03:27:38.822 --> 03:27:42.225]  This network has been intruded upon digitally.
[03:27:42.225 --> 03:27:55.055]  The right to say what we feel and know and believe has been limited by a few who want to take everything and control everyone in every way.
[03:27:55.055 --> 03:27:59.058]  I've been talking about it for over 30 years.
[03:27:59.058 --> 03:28:02.061]  We have all of our books and videos are still
[03:28:02.805 --> 03:28:10.687]  The best sources of the detail and how this all got built, you know, and it's here on InfoWars, the InfoWars store.
[03:28:10.687 --> 03:28:16.329]  But when we get into these issues about real empowerment, it's back to individuals once again.
[03:28:16.329 --> 03:28:22.671]  And so I use this last hour to kind of remind all of us of what we might be able to do.
[03:28:22.671 --> 03:28:27.132]  We plug into the universal and dial it up a bit.
[03:28:27.794 --> 03:28:36.298]  In terms of how we individually choose to project ourselves into this nasty, filthy world that we're stuck in for a while.
[03:28:36.298 --> 03:28:37.939]  And here's the thing.
[03:28:37.939 --> 03:28:41.881]  The faith of a mustard seed, remember, can move mountains.
[03:28:41.881 --> 03:28:47.484]  And the equal and unequal is doubt, which also moves mountains.
[03:28:47.484 --> 03:28:49.025]  Okay?
[03:28:49.025 --> 03:28:50.086]  Where are they coming from?
[03:28:50.086 --> 03:28:52.707]  Who's creating the doubt and who's creating the faith?
[03:28:53.465 --> 03:29:07.233]  This is another of the big lies that everyone's bought into incrementally, and how they master the doubt mechanism to keep you in the earth, in your flesh, lost in fear.
[03:29:07.233 --> 03:29:09.614]  Because that's what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:09.614 --> 03:29:13.016]  You can look at the science of what happens between your ears.
[03:29:14.514 --> 03:29:24.201]  And what happens is you get incoherent brain patterns, the kind that are related to the reptilian brain, that you just run from the lion.
[03:29:24.201 --> 03:29:28.164]  Hey, not a lion in the 21st century.
[03:29:28.164 --> 03:29:38.571]  It requires heart and head to come together to make sure we're dialed into the universal in the way that we were created to be.
[03:29:38.571 --> 03:29:43.074]  Left brain, right brain in balance, listening to the heart,
[03:29:44.178 --> 03:29:51.699]  How we feel about what we think and not falling into the addiction of thinking and feeling.
[03:29:51.699 --> 03:29:56.880]  I'm going to get into that too in the next segment, the last segment of the day, because this addiction is never talked about.
[03:29:56.880 --> 03:30:05.542]  You talk about sex and drugs and alcohol and food, but nobody talks about the emotional addictions, right?
[03:30:05.542 --> 03:30:06.482]  The thought addictions.
[03:30:06.482 --> 03:30:07.762]  What do they charge up?
[03:30:07.762 --> 03:30:10.943]  You know, they release the same kind of endorphins in the brain.
[03:30:11.747 --> 03:30:13.548]  And they become addictive behaviors.
[03:30:13.548 --> 03:30:14.989]  Fear is one of them.
[03:30:14.989 --> 03:30:16.069]  Boy, that's a charge.
[03:30:16.069 --> 03:30:29.117]  People like that big adrenaline rush, you know, jump off a cliff with a parachute, you know, out of a plane with another kind of parachute, you know, jump on a ski slope and make a jump 100 feet into the air or more.
[03:30:29.117 --> 03:30:38.742]  You know, there's a lot of addictions that we don't really talk much about, but we should because they drive too many outcomes.
[03:30:39.657 --> 03:30:40.377]  In the world.
[03:30:40.377 --> 03:30:42.178]  When we're a bit out of balance.
[03:30:42.178 --> 03:30:43.719]  And there's ways to balance all this.
[03:30:43.719 --> 03:30:50.742]  Ways to be more powerful vehicles of the creative force of the universe that we are.
[03:30:50.742 --> 03:30:54.804]  That's what I want to talk about in this last segment, going into the last segment.
[03:30:54.804 --> 03:30:55.984]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:30:55.984 --> 03:30:56.844]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:56.844 --> 03:30:58.765]  Remember, you're the tip of the sphere.
[03:30:58.765 --> 03:31:00.266]  You are the InfoWard.
[03:31:08.320 --> 03:31:12.642]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:31:12.642 --> 03:31:23.268]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[03:31:23.268 --> 03:31:29.451]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:31:29.451 --> 03:31:37.555]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[03:31:37.975 --> 03:31:48.083]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[03:31:48.083 --> 03:31:55.889]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[03:31:55.889 --> 03:32:00.613]  Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.
[03:32:00.613 --> 03:32:04.656]  So get the new Rocket Rest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at
[03:32:08.595 --> 03:32:10.797]  You must guard your humanity.
[03:32:10.797 --> 03:32:13.639]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[03:32:13.639 --> 03:32:16.421]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[03:32:16.421 --> 03:32:20.564]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[03:32:20.564 --> 03:32:23.787]  But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[03:32:24.929 --> 03:32:32.332]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth through the GMO crops.
[03:32:32.332 --> 03:32:39.316]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[03:32:39.316 --> 03:32:43.558]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses.
[03:32:44.825 --> 03:32:50.369]  We're then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[03:32:50.369 --> 03:32:57.434]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[03:32:57.434 --> 03:33:00.317]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[03:33:00.317 --> 03:33:06.501]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globals are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[03:33:06.501 --> 03:33:07.402]  It's all the same in the end.
[03:33:09.898 --> 03:33:16.423]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[03:33:16.423 --> 03:33:22.448]  Infowars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks and hundreds of stations picking us up.
[03:33:22.448 --> 03:33:32.896]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[03:33:33.676 --> 03:33:37.897]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[03:33:37.897 --> 03:33:42.358]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[03:33:42.358 --> 03:33:50.760]  That's why it's so precious, because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:57.681]  It's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[03:33:58.101 --> 03:34:06.119]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[03:34:06.119 --> 03:34:07.602]  They're coming after everyone.
[03:34:07.602 --> 03:34:08.544]  So spread the word now.
[03:34:09.864 --> 03:34:11.046]  I've got some bad news.
[03:34:11.046 --> 03:34:19.336]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[03:34:19.336 --> 03:34:20.817]  But here's the good news.
[03:34:20.817 --> 03:34:29.067]  Tumeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great tumeric formulas.
[03:34:29.768 --> 03:34:35.434]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[03:34:35.434 --> 03:34:36.155]  People love it.
[03:34:36.155 --> 03:34:37.476]  That's selling out.
[03:34:37.476 --> 03:34:40.819]  Despite that, it's still discounted at themfullworthstore.com.
[03:34:40.819 --> 03:34:44.863]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[03:34:44.863 --> 03:34:47.126]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[03:34:47.126 --> 03:34:47.946]  People really love it.
[03:34:47.946 --> 03:34:49.728]  It's extremely strong as well.
[03:34:49.728 --> 03:34:50.349]  It's selling out.
[03:34:50.829 --> 03:34:58.215]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body, it also funds the Infowar and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[03:34:58.215 --> 03:35:00.037]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:35:00.037 --> 03:35:07.843]  Please visit Infowarstore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the Infowar.

[03:35:11.907 --> 03:35:14.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:35:29.884 --> 03:35:32.006]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:32.006 --> 03:35:33.928]  Because there is a war on.
[03:35:33.928 --> 03:35:35.549]  For your mind.
[03:35:35.549 --> 03:35:42.875]  With Nick Begich.
[03:35:42.875 --> 03:35:44.637]  Yeah, what a day today.
[03:35:44.637 --> 03:35:50.642]  You know, I want to get back into this issue of addictions.
[03:35:50.642 --> 03:35:54.766]  And I want to cover three really quick, because I've covered them before.
[03:35:54.766 --> 03:35:56.027]  But this idea of
[03:35:58.635 --> 03:36:00.936]  Food energy, right, is about balancing.
[03:36:00.936 --> 03:36:16.523]  All of addictions are really about energy regulation within our system, but we live so much in the flesh that is projected in that way, so we use these physical forms and we kind of attack it from the body in, which is really a
[03:36:17.552 --> 03:36:19.053]  Kind of the upside-down way.
[03:36:19.053 --> 03:36:27.476]  It should be energetically, spiritually driven in to what we do to project our body out, because that's actually how it actually works.
[03:36:27.476 --> 03:36:33.238]  The physics of it actually says that we're the outward projection of our internal arrangement of energy.
[03:36:33.238 --> 03:36:39.401]  That's what, in fact, we are, according to the best quantum physicists that ever lived on the face of the Earth.
[03:36:39.401 --> 03:36:42.962]  And the underlying of that is consciousness.
[03:36:42.962 --> 03:36:46.364]  Not unconsciousness, like people lie about, but consciousness.
[03:36:47.044 --> 03:36:48.606]  That is what it is.
[03:36:48.606 --> 03:36:59.858]  And so even the best of the best in science recognize that God exists as a universal consciousness, for lack of a better way of, you know, phrasing what God is.
[03:36:59.858 --> 03:37:04.723]  Even God doesn't name himself because he can't get a name around it, you know.
[03:37:04.723 --> 03:37:06.866]  So that's there.
[03:37:06.866 --> 03:37:08.668]  That's the concrete of science.
[03:37:09.364 --> 03:37:14.246]  Now, how does that translate into the material in terms of addictions?
[03:37:14.246 --> 03:37:15.267]  Food energy.
[03:37:15.267 --> 03:37:16.447]  You know, how do you balance it?
[03:37:16.447 --> 03:37:18.468]  Well, the quickest charge is sugars.
[03:37:18.468 --> 03:37:24.031]  The most white sugar, in fact, or corn syrup.
[03:37:24.031 --> 03:37:24.811]  Right.
[03:37:24.811 --> 03:37:26.732]  These are pure poison.
[03:37:26.732 --> 03:37:27.173]  All right.
[03:37:27.173 --> 03:37:31.955]  I mean, they are white sugar, maybe a little bit better, honey, a lot better for a lot of other reasons.
[03:37:33.002 --> 03:37:37.444]  Natural sugars need to be considered as the best replacement.
[03:37:37.444 --> 03:37:42.026]  The other is an addiction to moderate energy, and it also fires the adrenals.
[03:37:42.026 --> 03:37:45.348]  It does things to you in the long range.
[03:37:45.348 --> 03:37:46.468]  It does damage.
[03:37:46.468 --> 03:37:47.629]  Okay.
[03:37:47.629 --> 03:37:51.871]  Food addictions, carbohydrates, sugars, simple sugars, all of it.
[03:37:52.603 --> 03:37:55.485]  You know, it's where does that addiction go and what does it do?
[03:37:55.485 --> 03:37:58.187]  It reduces in the brain endorphins and things.
[03:37:58.187 --> 03:37:59.929]  Oh, yeah, that feels great.
[03:37:59.929 --> 03:38:02.091]  You know, so you're addicted.
[03:38:02.091 --> 03:38:03.311]  You get the little charge.
[03:38:03.311 --> 03:38:04.913]  Boom, boom, boom.
[03:38:04.913 --> 03:38:05.934]  All day long.
[03:38:05.934 --> 03:38:09.496]  Drugs, medications, legal and illegal.
[03:38:09.496 --> 03:38:10.257]  Same deal.
[03:38:10.257 --> 03:38:11.398]  Alcohol.
[03:38:11.398 --> 03:38:12.319]  Same deal.
[03:38:12.319 --> 03:38:12.519]  Right.
[03:38:12.519 --> 03:38:14.540]  It's about moderating energy.
[03:38:14.540 --> 03:38:18.924]  Some to bring you up, some to knock you down, some to do this, some to do that.
[03:38:18.924 --> 03:38:21.666]  Most of it's energy management problems, you know.
[03:38:22.429 --> 03:38:25.852]  That manifest in the body in various ways.
[03:38:25.852 --> 03:38:32.797]  You think about sexual energy, the big one, you know, that one's like totally abused anyways.
[03:38:32.797 --> 03:38:36.059]  Or, you know, and again, it's about the body, right?
[03:38:36.059 --> 03:38:40.082]  Flesh, moderating energy and so on.
[03:38:40.082 --> 03:38:45.726]  And creative energy is what it is behind all those chemical reactions.
[03:38:45.726 --> 03:38:49.949]  C is the energetic activity that also is in play.
[03:38:49.949 --> 03:38:51.370]  Now, thought and emotion.
[03:38:52.151 --> 03:38:58.496]  As an addiction, because they release the same chemicals you see in the body, depending on how they're managed, right?
[03:38:58.496 --> 03:39:06.221]  And we tend to habituate to the negative ones, fear, anxiety, and others, because they release things.
[03:39:06.221 --> 03:39:07.983]  You know, we get a charge out of that.
[03:39:07.983 --> 03:39:09.804]  It's an adrenal charge.
[03:39:09.804 --> 03:39:12.746]  It's not a good way to balance our system at all.
[03:39:12.746 --> 03:39:15.468]  It's the wrong way.
[03:39:15.468 --> 03:39:18.230]  The other emotions, love, faith,
[03:39:20.226 --> 03:39:38.959]  Empathy, compassion, they charge up a whole different system within the body and within the mind and emotions that drive us a different way, that move from fear to faith, that move from doubt to knowing, to faith, to knowing, with conviction, knowing.
[03:39:39.645 --> 03:39:41.466]  That's a deeper level than belief.
[03:39:41.466 --> 03:39:43.347]  I've talked about belief a lot in the past.
[03:39:43.347 --> 03:39:50.150]  You know, I've talked about it in the analogy of the woman in Saudi Arabia wearing the black garb and feeling happy and good about herself.
[03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:56.673]  And the woman in France walking down the beach without her top on, naked from the waist up, feeling good about herself.
[03:39:56.673 --> 03:40:02.435]  And the woman in Iowa looking at both these guys and going, boy, I feel really good here in Iowa, how I'm doing.
[03:40:02.435 --> 03:40:04.236]  Are they wrong?
[03:40:04.236 --> 03:40:06.117]  Well, within their belief structures.
[03:40:06.900 --> 03:40:11.902]  They're absolutely correct within their neighborhood, so to speak.
[03:40:11.902 --> 03:40:13.242]  But again, is it a knowing?
[03:40:13.242 --> 03:40:16.884]  Do they have some universal knowing, some great truth in any of it?
[03:40:16.884 --> 03:40:18.104]  No.
[03:40:18.104 --> 03:40:19.384]  None.
[03:40:19.384 --> 03:40:20.585]  Zero.
[03:40:20.585 --> 03:40:22.245]  The knowing is something else.
[03:40:22.245 --> 03:40:25.827]  It's the higher level that we would all agree on as human created souls.
[03:40:25.827 --> 03:40:31.069]  These other things are beliefs that we hang an awful lot on that aren't truths.
[03:40:31.069 --> 03:40:35.110]  And they're reflections of the flesh, usually fear and anxiety or something.
[03:40:36.484 --> 03:40:44.570]  But they draw us down into the earth in a way that wasn't intended, I don't believe.
[03:40:44.570 --> 03:40:52.976]  We're supposed to rise out of this into a level of knowing which comes from what we know to be right and true and taking actions against that.
[03:40:52.976 --> 03:40:53.597]  That's fate.
[03:40:54.190 --> 03:41:06.642]  That's doing the possible, that's doing the conscious thing, that's listening to your heart and head, bringing the left and right back in balance that I've talked about, the way we were created to be.
[03:41:06.642 --> 03:41:11.406]  And there's ways to do this, techniques to do this, simple ways to do this.
[03:41:11.406 --> 03:41:13.388]  Let me give a few of them real quickly, you know.
[03:41:15.097 --> 03:41:18.240]  A way to increase thinking, a simple way.
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:21.283]  Hold your breath as long as you can and here's what happens.
[03:41:21.283 --> 03:41:25.007]  The body goes, oh no, I'm running out of oxygen.
[03:41:25.007 --> 03:41:31.394]  And what it does is it dilates the vessels and veins going in and out of the head because it wants to keep the brain alive.
[03:41:31.394 --> 03:41:32.955]  It's the last organ living.
[03:41:32.955 --> 03:41:34.857]  And they stay dilated for about 30 minutes.
[03:41:35.859 --> 03:41:39.362]  You can do this with little kids as a game, you know, before they're five.
[03:41:39.362 --> 03:41:40.303]  Do it every once in a while.
[03:41:40.303 --> 03:41:48.830]  Just throw it out there if you're a grandparent, you know, and you have little kids around or your parents have little kids around and you're not out working somewhere else.
[03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:51.953]  But this is something you can do when they're young and it'll stay.
[03:41:51.953 --> 03:42:00.881]  Then what happens is blood flow stays a bit dilated, you know, and so they get a little more blood flow, a little more oxygen, a little more garbage, you know, that needs to get out of them.
[03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:04.055]  The brain, you know?
[03:42:04.055 --> 03:42:08.284]  So, in terms of the blood-brain barrier and moving toxins out, that may be there.
[03:42:08.284 --> 03:42:09.908]  And so, there's things you can do.
[03:42:09.908 --> 03:42:10.349]  Breathing!
[03:42:11.150 --> 03:42:12.391]  Simple technique.
[03:42:12.391 --> 03:42:19.855]  Breathing through the nose to a 5 count and then slow to a 10 count out the mouth.
[03:42:19.855 --> 03:42:20.895]  Do that 10 times.
[03:42:20.895 --> 03:42:24.977]  Your brain activity slows, goes back into rhythm, stress dissipates.
[03:42:24.977 --> 03:42:27.178]  You just have to do it 3 times.
[03:42:27.178 --> 03:42:31.040]  Another thing, simple tool I give people all the time, you know.
[03:42:31.040 --> 03:42:33.722]  You can do this together with your significant other, your spouse.
[03:42:34.847 --> 03:42:35.748]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:42:55.040 --> 03:42:56.881]  How do you manage that one?
[03:42:56.881 --> 03:42:58.642]  It's the easiest one to manage.
[03:42:58.642 --> 03:43:07.427]  All you have to do is when you're experiencing like overactive thinking, overactive emotion of the two of them running together, just pay attention.
[03:43:07.427 --> 03:43:09.288]  Just notice what you're thinking.
[03:43:09.288 --> 03:43:10.889]  Notice what you're feeling.
[03:43:10.889 --> 03:43:13.951]  And then you're in control of it, actually.
[03:43:13.951 --> 03:43:15.972]  And the emotions don't grab you anymore.
[03:43:15.972 --> 03:43:21.495]  And the thoughts don't take you down the rabbit hole of fear and anxiety on stuff that never was and never will.
[03:43:22.394 --> 03:43:36.345]  Or perhaps it takes you into the dreamland of what never will, but come back into what is now in this moment that you can act on against what you know to be right and true and begin moving out of doubt and into faith.
[03:43:36.345 --> 03:43:38.286]  This is how you do it, one step at a time.
[03:43:38.286 --> 03:43:51.536]  It's not that complex, but it requires an internal look again and a real clear view of your own internal honesty as you look at other people and start to assess how you're behaving.
[03:43:51.997 --> 03:43:56.705]  Not how they're behaving, how you're behaving and interacting in the world and projecting in it.
[03:43:56.705 --> 03:44:01.253]  And I can tell you, if you take people's anger, that's projected at you every day and it is.
[03:44:02.360 --> 03:44:04.401]  And yeah, it has to be vented in different ways.
[03:44:04.401 --> 03:44:06.982]  And I know listeners have contacted me.
[03:44:06.982 --> 03:44:25.330]  It's one of the reasons InfoWars serves that purpose, too, because it allows people to release anger in a way that's not going to hurt anybody and is strongly opinionated, because it should be, because we've got a big balancing act to do here against what's coming at us and what's been coming at us for a long time.
[03:44:25.330 --> 03:44:28.591]  And the hosts and Alex and the team, everybody,
[03:44:29.598 --> 03:44:36.621]  It's here to provide not just the information, but the tools for transformation so we can make it through.
[03:44:36.621 --> 03:44:47.625]  Because at the end of the day, it's like, you know, the peacemakers, the humble will inherit this earth, not these bad guys.
[03:44:47.625 --> 03:44:51.587]  And I won't say it again, you know, somebody tapped me on the shoulder on that.
[03:44:51.587 --> 03:44:53.788]  But there is, there's some bad actors out there.
[03:44:53.788 --> 03:44:57.149]  And there's not very many truly evil people, but they do exist.
[03:44:58.024 --> 03:44:59.284]  They do exist.
[03:44:59.284 --> 03:45:05.325]  There's a lot of deception in the world right now, and discernment is needed at a higher level than ever.
[03:45:05.325 --> 03:45:13.247]  And so, as we roll up into the weekend on this Friday afternoon, let's take stock of who we are.
[03:45:13.247 --> 03:45:19.788]  Let's remember to give our families and our friends our touch this weekend.
[03:45:19.788 --> 03:45:21.989]  Physically, if we can.
[03:45:21.989 --> 03:45:23.989]  Reach out by the phone if we can't.
[03:45:24.822 --> 03:45:26.303]  Send a handwritten note.
[03:45:26.303 --> 03:45:30.505]  Do something extraordinary for someone you don't even know.
[03:45:30.505 --> 03:45:37.187]  If you're feeling depressed, go and meet somebody in the street and give them something good.
[03:45:37.187 --> 03:45:37.828]  Lift.
[03:45:37.828 --> 03:45:38.608]  Don't drag.
[03:45:39.298 --> 03:45:53.206]  Lift in the world right now because we can't, because of who we are, because of what we are, and because what we believe is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is still an honorable thing to believe in.
[03:45:53.206 --> 03:45:54.427]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:45:54.427 --> 03:45:55.648]  We'll be back next Friday.
