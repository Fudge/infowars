[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  Good evening or good afternoon fellow comrades, patrons, and cuck-slayers out there everywhere.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  I am your guest host for the next two hours here on InfoWars. I'm happy to be back.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  Thank you to the entire InfoWars team including Alex Jones himself, the great Alex Jones,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  for allowing me to host this most incredible, most legendary, iconic, historic platform.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  You wake up in the morning and you get a text from the great Alex Jones that says,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  hey, can you come and host for the show? It's a great honor. It's a great honor.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  And under normal circumstances and normal times and normal, sane, and logical times,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  a person like Alex Jones would be revered and regarded as a hero, which he is to many of us.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  But ultimately the people who are writing history want to write him down in history as a conspiracy theorist.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  Fortunately for all of us, and one of the reasons I really love hosting this platform
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  and being on with Alex Jones is what used to be a mainstream media that controlled the narrative with headlines
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  is now a mainstream media that tries to casino brainwash all the people who are jacked into social media
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  and they just can't do a good enough job defending the gate.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  And I mean, are we really surprised? They're incompetent people, right?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  They're wicked. They're evil. They're sinister. They have great technology.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  But in the end, they're pretty incompetent. They show that on a daily basis.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  And one of the ways they've shown themselves to be incompetent is that I am starting to see more than ever
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  Alex Jones be credited for the truth that he's been bringing for the last 20 years.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  So every time I'm on the show, not only do I speak to the great, the great, great Infowars audience
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  that has been here for the last two decades fighting against the establishment's narrative,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  I'm also speaking to all the people who may come in to the audience from the outside
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  that always thought that a person like Alex Jones was crazy, that always thought that a person like Royce White was crazy.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  But now we're starting to see that the crazy is swinging in the other direction.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  And today we're going to get into this, the story of stories.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  I mean, in some ways it's the biggest story. In some ways it's a distraction.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  And the establishment loves a good twofer, right?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  They love to be able to get two things, kill two birds with one stone.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  And yeah, this transgender movement is certainly a perverted way or a way for them to, you know,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  to get their pervert rocks off, influence and degrade and decay the American culture,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]  the strong American culture and history.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  But in another way, it serves as a huge distraction.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  No greater example than the news coming out of Anaheim, California, their home to Disneyland.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  And we got trainee fairy godmothers or also known as trainee godmothers, men dressed up as fairy godmothers
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  for the little kids to come and interact with.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  You can't make it up, people. And, you know, listen, this should insult each and every one of us.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  It doesn't matter what your party politics are. It doesn't matter what your race is.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  The simple fact that the mainstream media industrial complex and its corporate overlords, its corporate masters,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  that certain corporations, certain DEI, DEI, Allegiant Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Allegiant Corporations,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  with the influence and impact as big as a Disney, would spend so much time making this a priority.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  It should insult each and every one of you, everybody who can hear this, everybody who's out there.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  The simple fact is nobody really cares. Nobody really cares who you're having sex with at your home.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  Nobody really cares. Nobody really cares how you identify.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  We really just don't care, except for when you make it a point to bring that ideology, that sexuality,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  that identity crisis or whatever else you want to call it,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  that empowerment to the theme parks of our young, impressionable children.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  Then we all seem to care much, much more. So that and much more coming.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  You got me for two hours. I'm happy to be here.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  Thanks for tuning in and stay tuned to the other side.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  We're about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and Environmental Fusion, in the final days of August.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  This is a fundraiser. We'll sell out of this. I can sell it at full price.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried Environmental Fusion,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  to take action and try this product because I know you're going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  This is so critical. Get your X3 Environmental Fusion for 40% off right now at m4store.com.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  Show that dares to speak the truth. Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon. I'm your guest host, Royce White here for two hours.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  You got me for two full hours. I'm hoping you can stay engaged for that long.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  I'm probably going to get a little wild today for two hours. I won't be able to help myself.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  But we're here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  And we call it the belly of the beast because we had the George Floyd incident turned into the justification to have race and identity politics be the complete focus or linchpin,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  let's say, of New World Order. And it has become that. It's been that for a long time.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  But after the George Floyd thing, which I witnessed firsthand, it really started to drive home.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  It really started to walk around with its balls out, as I like to say it.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  And that's what we're doing now where we are saying that tranny godmothers, men dressed up as fairy godmothers in Disneyland is a symbol of progress.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  You know, those words like progress or sustainability or equity or or, you know, diversity, inclusion and tolerance and openness and all these these other catch words that are supposed to make you feel good about them indoctrinating your kid with sexual politics.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  I mean, you can't even go to Disneyland anymore.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  I remember I was growing up and if you could scour together enough shekels or enough enough enough coins as a family, you take you everybody want to take a trip to Disneyland once a year, if you could.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  You know, some people were fortunate enough to be able to do that. Some people weren't.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  You know, some people made it a yearly a yearly visit, an annual trip for the family.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  And, you know, maybe you flew, maybe you took a road trip. There were a couple people in my immediate family that always took a nice road trip all the way from Minnesota down to Orlando, Florida to go to Disney World once a year.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  It's a much easier track down to down to Orlando than it is out west to California and Anaheim for us Minnesotans.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  But the point is, Disney has always been a staple of American culture.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  And, you know, if we want to get technical, and we probably should get technical, Disney has always been suspect around their own little sexual messaging, even in the in the classics.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  You could find that readily yourself on YouTube or Google. It's not really hidden.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  It was certainly hidden as we were coming up and we were watching these things, you know, the cartoons, whether it was Mickey, or even in some of the masterpiece classics. Pinocchio is one of the classic ones where, you know, all these little boys were being taken off to this strange place, this strange mysterious place by this, this master human trafficker is what he was.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  But hey, you know, when you're an eight year old kid, and you're watching a Disney masterpiece classic in the theater or back home on VHS, back when they used to have VHS, you don't really think about the greater politics.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000]  Maybe your parents thought it was odd, but hey, Disney is big enough in the culture where we don't really question it in real time. We just roll with the punches.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  Well, slippery slopes we live on here in human civilization, slippery slopes we live on in society, and now we have found ourselves at the bottom of a mountain and the avalanches.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  It's on. The avalanches come. So let's bring the video up again, you know, if we can. I just want to show you guys, this is where this is what happens.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  And for all you bourgeois Negroes out there, right, who say, oh, no, no, this is just to stop white supremacy, or this is just for us to be able to make sure that black people get a fair shake at work, or this is just to ensure that black women aren't criticized and wrongfully penalized for wearing their natural hair.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  For wearing their natural hair in the workplace, or this is just to make sure that just as many black people are hired as white people. Bring the video back up, please.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  Now this has nothing to do with race at all, and it's a slap in the face to black people everywhere for them to clump us together with these weirdos.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  These people are weirdos. They're freaks. They're freaks. Nobody in their right mind would make the symbol of their rights, their freedoms, their citizenship, their political ideology, their identity.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Nobody in their right mind would make the symbol of all those things the target of young, young, vulnerable children.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  Now, the flip side to that coin or the rebuttal to that coin from all of these Marxist identity politics freaks would be to say, well, you guys teach kids Christianity at a young age, so you're indoctrinating them too.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a fair claim. Absolutely we are. We're trying to evangelize young children. We're trying to save the souls of young children. We're trying to baptize young children.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  And the idea and the mercy and grace of God and Christ our Lord and Savior, absolutely. Yeah, and we'll wear that with a badge of honor.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  But what we're not trying to do, what we're not trying to do is use Christianity to force sexual politics. And don't get me wrong, man, woman, get married, monogamy, these are a form of sexual politics, no doubt, no doubt.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  It's much different to bring a young child in and tell them ancient, ancient stories about the natural way, the natural order, men and women being human beings, being a pair bonding species, and man and woman being the result of that pair bonding way more times than not.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  And a man and a woman choosing to spend their life together and to have a family and to try and build some type of productive, you know, life for themselves and that family.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  And then telling a young boy to chop his penis off if he feels a little bit too feminine on any given day, whatever feminine actually means.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  These are stark differences in what we would agree could be classified as sexual politics.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  Where are the alarms at? I mean, this is out of control. And in my opinion, it's out of control. It's way far and beyond out of control.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  Let's talk about the Republicans for one moment. The Republicans are so afraid to be called racist. They're so afraid to be called bigots. They're so afraid to be called sexist or misogynist or homophobic or transphobic.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  Well, you know, just put all of those on my bingo card. There's a Royce White bingo card out there. Go to your little chip bank right there next to you. Take out a chip and just cover all my bingo card against the Marxist identity politics,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  homosexual, globalist, aristocratic weirdos. Because I'll tell you one thing, I'm openly transphobic. I'm openly transphobic.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  And I'm not transphobic for myself personally, but I think any sane and logical parent out there that has a child that is
[00:13:58.214 --> 00:14:18.634]  middle school age and younger, should by definition be transphobic. If you're not transphobic
[00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:23.774]  and you have a child out there that's middle school age or younger, you're probably just
[00:14:23.774 --> 00:14:28.174]  a negligent parent. And there's no shortage of negligent parents, because if you have
[00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:34.534]  a child that's that age like I do, I fear every day what they may be teaching or doing
[00:14:34.534 --> 00:14:39.814]  to my child when they go to school. And there's been no shortage, even in my own community
[00:14:39.814 --> 00:14:44.234]  here, there's been no shortage of young children coming home.
[00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:49.334]  This is here in Minnesota. This is here in the Hopkins School District, West Metro
[00:14:49.334 --> 00:14:54.894]  suburb, best place to live in the country, best place to raise a family. West Metro and
[00:14:54.894 --> 00:15:00.774]  in the Twin Cities, Eden Prairie, Dinah, Hopkins, St. Louis Park, Minnetonka, Wyzetta, blah,
[00:15:00.774 --> 00:15:06.974]  blah, blah, blah, blah. There's been no shortage of parents who call around, who
[00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:11.914]  sound the alarm, who get on the horn and say, you won't believe what my kid came
[00:15:11.914 --> 00:15:19.834]  home and said was going on at school today when it comes to these LGBTQ curriculums and
[00:15:19.834 --> 00:15:25.954]  ideologies. Yeah, I'm transphobic. Yeah, I'm transphobic. Do I care if people dress
[00:15:25.954 --> 00:15:31.274]  up with like cross-dress? No. No, don't really bother me at all. I'm going to laugh. You're
[00:15:31.274 --> 00:15:34.954]  not going to stop me from laughing. Do I care who you're having sex with at home?
[00:15:34.954 --> 00:15:40.354]  No, absolutely not. Doesn't affect me at all. Do I care if you're going to bring
[00:15:40.354 --> 00:15:45.154]  that way of life, that way of thinking and force it on our kids without our consent?
[00:15:45.154 --> 00:15:50.274]  You bet your ass. I'm very, very concerned and very, very upset and very, very afraid
[00:15:50.274 --> 00:15:55.434]  of that. We're going to talk about this more on the other side. We thank you for
[00:15:55.434 --> 00:15:58.514]  tuning in. I'm your guest host, Royce White here in the belly of the beast.
[00:15:58.514 --> 00:16:04.394]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us and they're
[00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:08.634]  doing it by keeping us undernourished. You can eat all the food you want in the
[00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.794]  world, but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an
[00:16:12.794 --> 00:16:16.874]  organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you
[00:16:16.874 --> 00:16:21.514]  are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:26.514]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale because we're about to sell
[00:16:26.514 --> 00:16:32.954]  out of both of these, of X3 and vitamin fusion in the final days of August.
[00:16:32.954 --> 00:16:38.314]  This is a fundraiser. We'll sell out of this. I can sell it at full price, but I
[00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:42.554]  want those of you that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried
[00:16:42.554 --> 00:16:47.394]  vitamin fusion to take action and try this product because I know you're going
[00:16:47.394 --> 00:16:52.714]  to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido. This is

[00:17:03.114 --> 00:17:08.074]  the foundation of our entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have
[00:17:08.074 --> 00:17:12.634]  stripped the soil of this essential trace element which has caused an iodine
[00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:17.274]  deficiency in about half the population and there are two things we need to do
[00:17:17.274 --> 00:17:22.114]  about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty
[00:17:22.114 --> 00:17:27.154]  of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep
[00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:31.914]  the soil rich with iodine and we need to ensure that we get the
[00:17:31.914 --> 00:17:37.594]  sufficient amount of iodine every day. Derived from ancient sea salts found
[00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:42.714]  thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our Infowars Life Survival

[00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:07.590]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:24.440]  Patriots and Cuck Slayers, it is your guest, Holst Royce White, here in the Belly of the
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.960]  Beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota, with you for the next two hours here on Infowars.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.560]  And I appreciate you tuning in.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.320]  I appreciate all the great feedback from the Infowars audience.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.760]  I appreciate Alex Jones and his continued work to fight back against this evil globalist
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.760]  establishment.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.060]  When we say the word globalist, when we say the word evil, when we say they're corrupt
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:50.800]  and wicked, a lot of people want to look at that and go, no, no, no, no, you're exaggerating.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800]  You're exaggerating.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.280]  It's not that coordinated.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.280]  It's not that evil.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.500]  It's not that wicked.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.720]  You know, you guys are just extremists, you're extreme right wing Christians or white nationalists
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.240]  or Uncle Tom's, as they would call me, or whatever they want to say.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:11.399]  And you know, some of these people know exactly, exactly what's going on in this country and
[00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:12.399]  around the world.
[00:21:12.399 --> 00:21:16.240]  And some people just don't want to have to confront it.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.639]  They just don't want to have to deal with it.
[00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:22.520]  And we want to continue to minister to all those people who would rather not deal with
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.520]  it, those people we can reach.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.240]  But there are people out there who know exactly what's going on, and they've made the conscious
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.760]  decision to participate, none other than our good friends over in Great Britain and the
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:41.639]  rest of the European finocchios who continue to make, who continue to pave the road for
[00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:47.560]  the Fourth Industrial Revolution and all these other technocratic, authoritarian, tyrannical
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.659]  sort of technological advancements, whether it be microchips, which we saw there first
[00:21:52.659 --> 00:21:58.000]  in Scandinavia, now making landfall here in America, or the fingerprint at the Whole
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.639]  Foods and the Panera Bread, you know, fingerprint, biometric e-commerce, it's not e-commerce,
[00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:07.879]  biometric commerce, as we could call it.
[00:22:07.879 --> 00:22:12.060]  All of this stuff, all of this stuff, the European finocchios are masters of, masters
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.260]  of our entire world, the global culture.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.920]  That is what they mean when they say global citizenship.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.159]  What they really mean is that the European finocchios and the intellectual traditions
[00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:30.400]  that come out of Europe are going to guide the entire human civilization into the next
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.520]  beautiful chapter.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.440]  And part of this next chapter, as we can bring up this article here, is the normalization
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]  of pedophilia.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.760]  That's right, I know it sounds crazy.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.500]  These are one of those things like 9-11 that sounded crazy 20 years ago, well this sounded
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.639]  crazy about, I don't know, two years ago, two days ago, two hours ago, two weeks
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.120]  for some people.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.879]  But it's here, full blown, bring up the article, yeah, I'm a pedophile, not a molester.
[00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:02.760]  And you know, I fantasize about children.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:10.520]  Now understand, we live in a culture where Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Royce
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:17.159]  White, you know, Joe Rogan, even at some times, as liberal as he is, all of these
[00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:26.280]  people have been deemed persona non grata, dangerous, a threat to national security
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280]  and democracy.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.600]  To even platform these people is a threat, to even give these people any type of air
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.720]  time is a threat, it's a threat to stability.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:46.960]  Yet the British Public Broadcasting Channel, Channel 4, was willing to give a platform
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:54.040]  to a man saying that you could in fact be a pedophile, but not a molester.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.200]  And then if you go down into scroll, if you go and watch the interview, basically
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:06.260]  what he was saying is, yeah, I have thoughts about abusing children, I've just made the
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.159]  conscious decision not to act on them.
[00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:18.389]  Is that not a threat? Is that not a danger? I mean, why are the kids constantly in the
[00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:27.250]  crosshairs of this agenda? Why are our children, humanity's most vulnerable, why are humanity's
[00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:34.770]  most vulnerable constantly in the crosshairs of this agenda? A virtuous pedophile? There's
[00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:40.010]  such a thing as a virtuous pedophile, and this is the slippery slope. And I don't think people
[00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:47.770]  want to acknowledge that there is a significant correlation, there's a significant connection
[00:24:47.770 --> 00:25:03.010]  between sexual neurodivergence, okay, sexual deviance, sexual divergence, non, you know,
[00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:08.610]  they call it non-binary sexual identity or sexual preference. There is a correlation between those
[00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:16.210]  things and child molestation. And you say, well, what do you mean? Why do you say? Well,
[00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:24.410]  just look at the statistics, look at their own testimony, look at the testimony of the LGBTQ by
[00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:35.690]  their own testimony. Many of them developed their sexual orientation, their sexual preferences,
[00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:46.010]  or their sexual worldview in the darkness and shadow of being molested or abused sexually as
[00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:51.610]  a young person. Whether it was by a family member, which it usually is, a family member
[00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:57.210]  of the same sex, or a family member of the opposite sex. Still, still it had a scarring
[00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:07.010]  effect on their outlook on life. And if you look at the self-reported statistics from pedophiles,
[00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:14.770]  which you can only trust so far, but many pedophiles say that they suffered from child
[00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:22.650]  abuse early on in life. So there's a correlation there. Why, why on earth would anybody out there
[00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:29.010]  who's logical and sane accept this idea that none of this is mental health related?
[00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:34.930]  Now, none of it is mental illness, none of it are mental health disorders, none of them
[00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:41.810]  are psychological disorders. All of it is the way you were born, that you were, and again,
[00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.610]  to imply that you were born that way means that there's a biological baseline,
[00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:51.250]  which they wanna throw biology all the way out at the same time. It doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:58.370]  None of it makes any sense. The question isn't how they've concocted this rubbish story about
[00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:03.970]  sexual identity and sexual orientation. Now we're gonna normalize pedophilia because hey, I mean,
[00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:09.930]  you know, when your government steals, everybody steals, right? So now because the truth has
[00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:16.570]  become so flimsy from the top down or the bottom up, we'll lie ad nauseam, we'll lie about anything,
[00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:22.250]  we'll make up any story we want. The entire essence of reality has become a la carte and
[00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:27.210]  nobody wants to double and triple down more than the Marxist identity politics who claim
[00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.970]  to be progressives, when really they're regressives. They're trying to regress us
[00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:36.889]  back to the primal instinct of dominance and violence and anger and all the things
[00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:42.730]  that we developed and evolved out of our society through intellectual enlightenment.
[00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:50.330]  No, no, no. And then again, this is what the contribution of Abraham was. The contribution
[00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:58.930]  of Abraham was culturally significant. We're done with human sacrifice. We're done with
[00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:05.050]  child sacrifice. God asked Abraham to come up into the hillside and sacrifice his son to show
[00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:09.650]  his loyalty and his obedience to God. And when he gets there, Abraham is gonna do it because
[00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.970]  of his love for God, because of his obedience and faith, he's gonna do it. And God says, no,
[00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:19.530]  no, no, no, we're not doing that anymore. I love you for being faithful and obedient,
[00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:26.050]  but we're not doing that anymore. And the Abrahamic culture changed the entire human
[00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:32.210]  civilization where it touched. It changed the culture and the norm around the protection of
[00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:39.450]  children. And now when the society rejects Christianity, we have full blown pedophiles saying,
[00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.930]  give me a break. Give me a break. I'm just a pedophile. I'm not a molester. And we're gonna
[00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:50.730]  put these people on national television. Are you kidding me? I'm not following them. I
[00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.730]  know all the Patriots and cucks layers out there across the world are fed up and we're
[00:28:54.730 --> 00:29:01.090]  not following either. We're ready to stand up and say enough is enough. I've studied how
[00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.970]  the globalist, how the mad scientist are controlling us and they're doing it by
[00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.370]  keeping us undernourished. You can eat all the food you want in the world,
[00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:14.530]  but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic absorbable form,
[00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:19.450]  if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle
[00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:25.970]  boat without ores, without paddles. Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale,

[00:33:38.879 --> 00:33:44.120]  They want to demonize having a country, they want to demonize freedom, I've seen multiple
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:51.479]  mainstream media industrial complex outlets flat out demonize the word freedom as a dog
[00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:53.000]  whistle for white supremacy.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.120]  Here I am, a black man who loves Alex Jones to death.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.040]  I think Alex Jones has done a great job, he's a hero.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.239]  Actually, words can't describe what Alex Jones has done for everybody out there across
[00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:06.639]  the world.
[00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:10.359]  There's not even words that can describe it, really.
[00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:15.240]  It's divine, to say the least, it's divinely inspired.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:21.480]  Here I am a black man on the show of the great Alex Jones, and I believe in freedom.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.040]  I think that's pretty basic.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.080]  It's not complex, we don't got to get weighed down in the weeds of conspiracy.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:35.600]  We don't have to talk about 9-11, or we don't have to talk about the UAVs that our
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.839]  government, our reverse engineering.
[00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:42.060]  We don't have to talk about the fires in Maui, we don't have to talk about the fires
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.640]  in Sicily, we don't have to talk about gain-of-function research, or the Uighurs
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.140]  in the concentration camps in Xinjiang, China.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.880]  We don't have to talk about what's going on in Africa, the cobalt mines in the Congo.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:02.960]  We don't have to talk about any of those things to understand who we're dealing with.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.839]  We are dealing with people who would actually try and convince Americans, American citizens,
[00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:15.580]  that the word freedom, the word freedom itself, is now a threat.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:26.680]  The word freedom itself is now a negative, is now a dog whistle, a racism.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.520]  When an establishment goes that far out of its way to convince you that freedom itself
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.080]  is the enemy, that the basic concept of freedom itself is the enemy, what do you
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.040]  think they mean to take from you?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:45.960]  Freedom, it's very simple. And this is the fundamental difference between the two political
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:52.920]  platforms. One party wants to expand the federal government to the global scale. I mean, as
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.040]  if the federal government wasn't already incompetent enough, I mean, they can't even stop a fire
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.000]  in Maui.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.520]  They can't stop the fire because they probably had something to do with the fire. I mean,
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.319]  we get it, right? But let's just say they didn't, just for argument's sake. They still
[00:36:08.319 --> 00:36:14.240]  show a radical incompetence in being able to fight fires. They can barely fight fires.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.440]  They want you to go live on Mars. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. They want to expand your
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.720]  citizenship to a global citizenship. They're having trouble governing right here at home.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.279]  You can't even go to the DMV and not spend the entire day to get tabs to be able to
[00:36:29.279 --> 00:36:35.040]  drive on the road. You think that's by accident? That's by design. It's by design that it takes
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.560]  an entire day to get your registration and tabs at the DMV. It's by design that it takes
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.080]  six months in some places across the country to be able to renew your driver's license if you
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.400]  have to take a driver's test again. It's by design that it's hard to go and get your
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.319]  birth certificate or official documentation. All of these things are by design.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:04.560]  They make them seem so organic though, don't they? They make it seem like it's just happening
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.040]  because it's a lot of people that we got. It's a lot to deal with. It's a lot to govern.
[00:37:12.799 --> 00:37:17.600]  And yeah, it is. It's not easy to govern. Don't get me wrong. It's not easy to run a classroom.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.720]  It's not easy to run a police station. It's not easy to run an army. It's not easy
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.440]  to run a business. It's not easy to do any of those things.
[00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:36.490]  But there's a stark difference between it being difficult and them engineering it to
[00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:42.910]  bring a certain result down on you. And the result is clear. The result is clear because
[00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:50.270]  the result is being made public. The result is being said out loud. We wanna reduce the
[00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:54.310]  freedom of movement. We wanna reduce the freedom of representation.
[00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.630]  We wanna reduce the freedom of economy.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:06.400]  We want the economy, we want the representation, we want the movement to be constrained to
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:14.640]  where we have more control over what you do.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.720]  And they'll tell you it's for your own good, they'll tell you, hey, the 15 minute city,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:26.720]  it's gonna reduce crime, it's gonna bring more equity to the distribution of resources,
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.560]  it's gonna even out the standard of living and the cost of living.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.920]  And I mean, yeah, okay, it might do some of those things, right?
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]  I don't know.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.240]  If I live in an eight by eight cell, I guess it probably will cost less energy than if
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:47.080]  I live in a nice 3500 square foot house, none of them had a problem with it.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.240]  None of them had a problem with the mansions or the super mansions when they were all
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.700]  colluding behind the scenes with Wall Street and the bankers and the people in the housing
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.860]  market and all the other people who were involved in that scam, they didn't have a problem
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:09.460]  with it when they were selling people 6,000 square foot houses who didn't have good enough
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.260]  credit, right?
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:20.140]  And they did all of these tranches and these CDOs, these collateralized debt obligations
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:28.740]  and all the whole thing that went down with the crash of the housing market in 2008, which
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:34.280]  led to the eventual financial crisis in 2009, which we really still haven't recovered from
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:42.660]  and nobody, nobody, nobody served a day in prison over that scam.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:49.420]  Nobody had a problem with how much energy it cost to power these homes then.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.380]  Now all of a sudden they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar, fudging the numbers,
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.560]  running a Ponzi scheme, a Ponzi scheme of global proportions, mind you.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:06.860]  Let's be clear, the financial crash of 2008 and the housing market here in America threatened
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.860]  to destabilize the entire global economy.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.060]  Who bailed them out?
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.480]  You did.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.760]  You bailed out the people who are supposed to be the experts and smarter than you and
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:22.600]  know how to make sure you can continue on to live with freedom.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.700]  You bailed them out financially and now they're going to tell you, you need to live
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.480]  in an eight by eight micro house in order to conserve energy and save the planet.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.000]  And oh, by the way, we're going to go to micro houses.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.940]  We're going to go to micro classrooms.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.680]  We're going to go to solar, solar pencils.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.840]  I don't know what these people will think of next.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]  I don't know.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.720]  Oh, by the way, by the way, while we radically reduce your power, your, your energy consumption,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.720]  breathing, I mean, breathing is going to come soon, soon, you won't have to worry
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.080]  about the sexual politics at the elementary school for your kids because many of you
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.160]  are going to stop having kids because you won't be able to afford it.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.120]  Because when the carbon tax comes on you as an adult, you better be damn sure they're
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.320]  going to put a carbon tax on dependents, minors, children, and then people will just
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]  stop having children.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320]  They'll go out.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320]  Well, children are too expensive.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.860]  I can't pay the carbon tax.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:22.760]  That'll be a way that the government incentivizes you not to have children, anti-human, anti-God.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.520]  You're not going to have to worry about the sexual politics at the school, but, but
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.920]  for the time that you do, not only are we going to reduce the consumption of energy,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:37.000]  we're going to put pedophiles, we're going to put resentful, vendetta driven liberal
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.600]  white women.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.920]  We're going to put black bourgeoisie, loud mouth, obnoxious women.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.360]  We're going to put beta male cucks right there at the helm in your elementary school
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.160]  and your kids don't have a choice.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.080]  And if you don't like it, you can homeschool them.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.320]  You can take them to private school and pay triple for the same type of politics, mind
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.920]  you, because a lot of the private schools have the same little diversity, equity, inclusion
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.880]  curriculum springing up.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.400]  Or you can send them to charter school or, you know, take your kid and you know where
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:16.780]  you want your tax money and your district that's going to that public school has nothing
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.100]  to do with how you see fit for your child to be raised because we know better
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.480]  than you.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.180]  We're smarter than you.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.520]  We went to school for four years and jerked off and got high and bar hopped and then
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:33.240]  said we were sexually assaulted by a guy when we, you know, got shit face drunk and
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.440]  went to his dorm room.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.600]  We're that smart.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.500]  We crashed the housing market, a bunch of, a bunch of financial experts, and now they're
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.020]  going to tell you, you have no say in what happens at your kid's school.
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.560]  You can make it up.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.560]  You can make it up.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.560]  People were at a crossroads.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.680]  We're at a tipping point and if I sound pissed off, if I sound obnoxious, because
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.960]  I think this whole thing is obnoxious, to be quite honest with you, stay tuned to
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960]  the other side.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.980]  I've studied how the globalist, how the mad scientists are controlling us and they're
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.980]  doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.860]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:15.140]  vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.740]  like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.740]  paddles.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, because we're about to sell out of

[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.900]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega 3s.

[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.300]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months, up to nine months,
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.140]  you can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.060]  You just click it and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.180]  So please do that as well.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.260]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees that are making 20, 30, 40% like
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.260]  we do on the products.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.980]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.100]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.700]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.820]  The enemy's out in the open.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.820]  We're vindicated.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.140]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.300]  But in this major recession, going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300]  it's hard.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300]  I know times are tough.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.740]  So thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.500]  the articles and the videos that you can do for free.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.860]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.860]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.500]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.180]  God bless you.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:07.359]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:21.190]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, this is your guest host, Royce White, and I'll be
[00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:26.850]  here for another hour on the great info wars. I'm very happy, very thankful to be here on
[00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:31.910]  info wars. I appreciate you all tuning in. I appreciate Alex Jones and his audience.
[00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:37.370]  I'm told that we are streaming live on war rooms getter page and on their rumble
[00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:42.330]  page as well. So we're getting the crossover right now, both audiences and we need it. We
[00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:48.330]  need it now more than ever. We need to put aside petty differences now more than any
[00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:49.770]  time in American history.
[00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:54.750]  I can't say it enough. I can't stress it enough. All of the little idiosyncrasies
[00:47:54.750 --> 00:48:00.009]  and quirks and things that we disagree upon, we need to set aside right now for the greater
[00:48:00.009 --> 00:48:06.770]  cause, and there is a greater cause. And if we don't, we'll continue to slide downhill.
[00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:12.009]  I mean, 2024, as much as people are, well, the machine is gonna be the machine no matter
[00:48:12.009 --> 00:48:17.610]  what we do, or even if we win in 2024, they'll sandbag Donald Trump or they'll
[00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:22.810]  railroad Donald Trump or whatever excuse you could come up with not to get involved.
[00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:27.210]  Whatever excuse you can come up with not to get involved, keep it, right? Put it in
[00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:34.170]  your pocket. Go caucus with the Democrats or just get out of here. Get out of the way,
[00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:35.170]  right?
[00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:40.450]  The people who wanna stick around understand, and I know I'm preaching to the choir, understand
[00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:47.610]  this is the pivotal moment. If we do not take the country back now, we will lose
[00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:54.770]  America. There won't be a country. I mean, in many ways you could already say we
[00:48:54.770 --> 00:49:05.810]  don't have a country. Our country is being ran by pedophiles, by con artists, by liars,
[00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:13.170]  by Satanists. I mean, quite literally, nuclear engineer, whatever his role is there for
[00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:14.970]  the Biden administration.
[00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:23.650]  Open Satanists doing rituals and seances and dildo conventions or whatever they're
[00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:29.330]  up to. I don't really know. I'm from here, I'm from Minnesota. I mean, we often have
[00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:34.529]  to come back to the LGBTQ thing, and it sort of makes our position seem like a caricature.
[00:49:34.529 --> 00:49:39.810]  But to us, it makes it seem like a caricature that we even have to talk about this in
[00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:45.210]  our country today and how prominent it's become, right? And it is prominent. I mean,
[00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:51.250]  we have a full blown war that is broken out with a nuclear superpower, an adversary
[00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.810]  that's a nuclear superpower, the nuclear superpower, have more nukes than we do.
[00:49:54.810 --> 00:50:03.290]  Full blown war is broken out there, skirmish in the Eastern Bloc, in the Ukraine. Full blown war,
[00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:09.450]  where we're at war, full blown. We're in a full blown biological war with China,
[00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:14.170]  and any other would be parties that are involved in the biological war that's going on all around
[00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:19.490]  the world. The race for biological supremacy is what you could think of it as. I don't know
[00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:25.170]  who's involved. There's governments, there's secret intelligence agencies probably, there's
[00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:31.410]  independent contractors, there's private corporations, there's all kinds of matters
[00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:37.170]  of people involved in the race for biological warfare supremacy. But regardless, we are in a
[00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:43.610]  biological war with China right now as we speak. And yeah, COVID's coming back. Yeah,
[00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:48.730]  get ready. They're telling people at different, certain key essential jobs,
[00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:53.690]  prepare themselves cuz the masks are gonna be rolling back around here come the fall.
[00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:02.410]  Be ready because the lockdowns may even be coming back here in the fall, all from some variant
[00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:11.690]  in Canada. Now, two things. One is once the COVID door was open,
[00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:22.730]  the revolving door of variant is obviously a well that will never run dry. There will always be some
[00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:27.690]  new variant. And I'm not saying there's not actually a variant. What I'm saying is that
[00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:34.450]  most of us out there who wake up every morning, take our child to school, go to work, get off
[00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:39.890]  of work, come pick our child up, take them to their activities, go home, feed them, go to bed,
[00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:45.730]  wake up, do it all again. Most of us have no clue what the variant is, what the variant means,
[00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:50.610]  if the variant is real or not. No, most of us have no clue. And this is how we've allowed
[00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:55.570]  our citizenship and our governance to be handed over to people who we should have never trusted
[00:51:55.570 --> 00:52:02.050]  with. So we have a COVID scammedemic, let's call it. I'm calling the scammedemic.
[00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:07.330]  You could call it what you want. And again, let's be clear for all the technocratic,
[00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:17.730]  omnisexual, posh, yuppie, Silicon Valley, big tech social media oligarchs. Am I saying that there's
[00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:22.050]  not a virus? No, I'm not saying that. In fact, I think we should be more worried about the virus
[00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.970]  than most people actually are. And I'll talk about that maybe in the next hour.
[00:52:26.529 --> 00:52:35.970]  But what I am saying is, whether or not the virus is what they say it is, it culturally
[00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:46.529]  has opened Pandora's box for us to be at the behest of the government, in a global government,
[00:52:46.529 --> 00:52:51.410]  in a way that many of us couldn't have possibly imagined before. Many of us,
[00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:56.770]  that many of us doesn't include Alex Jones. He's been warning you for 20 years.
[00:52:56.770 --> 00:53:00.930]  I'm only 30 years old. 20 years ago, Alex Jones has been warning you people
[00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:08.850]  since I was 10. Since I was in elementary school, 10 years old, where we played kickball on the
[00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:13.490]  playground, where the girls double dutched on the playground, where we still worried about
[00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:19.090]  math and reading and science. And the coolest thing that we got to do was go to the Science
[00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:25.490]  Museum. And I remember going to the Minnesota History Center and they got the grain belt
[00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:30.050]  exhibit, where it's kind of like a big chutes and ladders sort of deal.
[00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:36.050]  And we all had a blast going up and down the grain belt at the Minnesota History Center. Now,
[00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:42.529]  they're taking kids to the Science Museum and the Science Museum, or I'm sorry, not the Science
[00:53:42.529 --> 00:53:46.210]  Museum. Don't wanna throw any shade on the Science Museum that they don't deserve here
[00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:54.690]  in Minnesota. The Walker Art Museum is having demonic demon, if we could pull that up there
[00:53:54.690 --> 00:54:03.890]  at the control room. The Walker Art Museum in Minnesota is inviting people to a demon summoning.
[00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:13.290]  What is going on here? What is going on here? We used to be fine. I mean, as children I
[00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:21.770]  can say it was fine just to go to the local park and get on the swings. Maybe there's
[00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:25.850]  a young lady that I liked that I had a crush on in the sixth grade and I just want a little
[00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:32.930]  bit of time to walk on over and have a few casual words with her outside of the ears
[00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:39.330]  of the teacher or the other kids or whatever. Maybe I just wanna tell her, hey, I think you're pretty.
[00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:46.530]  Right. Us young men, us young, rugged individualist American men used to be fine just going to the
[00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:51.730]  park for our field trips. Now we gotta go to a demon summoning at the Walker Art Museum.
[00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:58.130]  Are you people sick in the head? This is getting outrageous. And I say this all to say,
[00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:05.410]  again, if we do not put aside our petty differences, we are going to lose our freedom.
[00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.010]  You have to make a decision right now all across the country.
[00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:14.370]  All across the country, we have to make a decision right now what we're willing to sacrifice,
[00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:24.930]  what pride, what ego, what cultural individual upbringing we had, all of it.
[00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:30.130]  We have to decide what we're willing to put away, what we're willing to leave behind,
[00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:34.290]  what we're willing to lay down in order to come together, unite against these people
[00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:39.250]  because they're unified. They're unified. You think they're not unified?
[00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:46.770]  You think the black bourgeoisie woman who they taught at the Marxist University isn't connected
[00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:51.730]  with the white liberal Gloria Steinem's and the beta male cook Jeffrey Epstein's,
[00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:56.530]  who said the way of the future is for the way women think.
[00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:02.930]  You think they're not connected to a local gang leader in the metropolitan area of a
[00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:08.850]  young black gang who has influence over young black men? You think they're not all unified?
[00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:14.450]  You think the people there in Davos aren't connected with the powers that be there in
[00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:19.730]  Israel, with the powers that be there in Saudi Arabia, with the powers that be there in Beijing,
[00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:23.890]  with the powers that exist here, right here in Washington DC?
[00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:25.490]  You think they're not all coordinated?
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:30.500]  They're coordinated, they're coordinated.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:36.299]  Our inability to realize how coordinated they are stems from our inability to coordinate
[00:56:36.299 --> 00:56:38.419]  ourselves.
[00:56:38.419 --> 00:56:42.660]  We can't put down differences, we struggle to put down differences to come together
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.660]  and unite.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.779]  This is not a problem for them.
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:55.380]  Because at bottom, whatever cultural identities they presume or they proclaim to be living
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:05.260]  underneath the umbrella of, really they're working in the interest of one single effort.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.800]  One single effort.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:13.600]  That's to destroy the idea of freedom so they can enslave people so you won't have
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:20.240]  a choice whether or not to have your spirit damned to hell.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.440]  That's what a Satanist wants.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:26.140]  They want to create, they want to create a circumstance where everywhere you turn, everywhere
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.960]  you turn is your damnation.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:35.080]  Where there is no choice but damnation, where the entire existence of human civilization
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.240]  is contaminated with sin and evil and depravity.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:46.200]  This is the ingenious of the satanic world view and their demonic practice.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.520]  Stay tuned to the other side of the hour.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.160]  I'll be here for another hour.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.800]  The globalist aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.600]  or the GMO crops.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.440]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.980]  industry to use.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.320]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.960]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:14.560]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]  Look it up.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.920]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.160]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.280]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.600]  The Alexa Pure ready to ship to you right now.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.880]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.820]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.840]  It is amazing.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.280]  It's great for your home, your business.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.880]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, whatever, well water.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.140]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:41.180]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.540]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:48.880]  You need this filter.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.140]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:58.500]  insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.820]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality, durable food and water filtration
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:03.820]  and self-defense.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.980]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.780]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:12.940]  I'm preaching the choir on that, but a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.500]  have enough durable food or water filtration.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.600]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.700]  high quality water filtration department.

[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:47.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:49.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:50.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:51.780]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.280]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:58.120]  Don't ask me what I'm doing during the day.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]  What?
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.320]  I can't ask you what you're doing during the day, well, what do you mean?
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.500]  Don't drop by my job unannounced.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.740]  Don't touch my cell phone.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.480]  These kind of things are red flags.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.000]  Let's just talk about personal relationships because the people who run our country are
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.380]  just regular people, right?
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.000]  The human psychology is the same way.
[01:09:22.639 --> 01:09:30.160]  Just no pun intended, the psychology of the liberal white woman is running the show and
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]  the beta male cuck.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:38.120]  I mean, their relationship is a story for another day, but the point, oh, and there is a black
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:44.280]  liberal woman that is trying to emulate the white liberal woman.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.920]  There's the Joy Ann Reeds who wear white woman's wigs and toupees on national television
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.639]  and the relationships that they have with their black men that are cucked, I couldn't even
[01:09:52.639 --> 01:09:53.679]  describe to you.
[01:09:53.679 --> 01:09:55.280]  It's embarrassing to say the very least.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.480]  The point is you got black men and women who are either beta males and cucks or radical
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.280]  feminists running our government.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.920]  And when beta male cucks or radical feminists tell you, don't look over here, you better
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.599]  damn well sure look over there on all things.
[01:10:11.599 --> 01:10:13.839]  I said, investigate Maui on the side of my head.
[01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:18.000]  If you can pull that picture up there in the control room, you know, at the big three
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.320]  game and people were so angry.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.480]  They were so offended that I would even that I would even dare to question that something
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.559]  nefarious took place there in Maui.
[01:10:28.559 --> 01:10:31.639]  I mean, they were so they were they were they were livid.
[01:10:31.639 --> 01:10:38.000]  I mean, you could you could feel the hostility in their Twitter talk or Instagram or whatever
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  it was.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Right.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.200]  And I'm happy.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:47.400]  I'm happy to say or fortunate to say that the majority of the response was, hey, yeah,
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.839]  we should investigate Maui.
[01:10:48.839 --> 01:10:50.019]  Some don't seem right.
[01:10:50.019 --> 01:10:52.960]  Some don't seem right there.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.400]  But but for the people who did did have a problem with it, I mean, they really had
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.400]  a problem with it.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.759]  It's almost as though we should not be able to question anything that comes that anything
[01:11:04.759 --> 01:11:06.019]  that happens.
[01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:09.240]  We should not be able to question whether or not the government had something to do
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.240]  with it.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.040]  And I just want to bring your focus back.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:20.339]  All of you, all of you freedom fighters, all of you people who who who are battling and
[01:11:20.339 --> 01:11:27.400]  systemic injustice and racism and white supremacy and, you know, whatever, whatever you say
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.639]  you're fighting against your cultural icons all were the victim of high level government
[01:11:33.639 --> 01:11:36.559]  conspiracies.
[01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:39.799]  Whether they pulled the trigger at the end or not.
[01:11:39.799 --> 01:11:45.480]  Many of your cultural icons in this freedom fighter movement were the victim of high level
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.839]  government conspiracy.
[01:11:47.839 --> 01:11:49.839]  Do we need to go down the list of names?
[01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:51.940]  OK, we'll give you the big four.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:52.940]  The big four.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.420]  John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King.
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.420]  There you go.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:11:59.759]  Those are the four horsemen.
[01:11:59.759 --> 01:12:00.960]  Those are the four freedom fighters.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.960]  Those are the four martyrs of the modern era.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:12.639]  All of them were victims in some way, shape or form of a high level government conspiracy.
[01:12:12.639 --> 01:12:18.660]  And how dare you claim to carry on their mission while simultaneously rejecting the
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:24.160]  very idea that the government could be corrupt and in fact, involved in many of the things
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.759]  we see happening today.
[01:12:25.759 --> 01:12:34.040]  I don't care if they're running some some some psy opt brainwashed freak out there in
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.139]  some black neighborhood to kill black people.
[01:12:36.139 --> 01:12:37.559]  You think that's beyond this?
[01:12:37.559 --> 01:12:41.259]  You think that's beyond what they would do?
[01:12:41.259 --> 01:12:45.519]  You think you actually people who think that that's beyond what they would do?
[01:12:45.519 --> 01:12:48.120]  They don't understand the Bay of Pigs.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.920]  They they've never read on the Bay of Pigs.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.900]  They don't understand false flags.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.120]  This is why Alex Jones scares you all.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.700]  Doesn't scare me.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.299]  So I have no problems when the Mother Jones is of the world or the the guardians of
[01:13:00.299 --> 01:13:05.019]  the world or the Washington Post of the world or the New York Times or pick another New
[01:13:05.019 --> 01:13:06.740]  World Order publication.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.620]  I have no problem when they call me a darling of the alt-right because I'm friends with
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:11.139]  Alex.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:18.599]  They're doing that for you all. I mean, not those who watch Alex Jones, but those
[01:13:18.599 --> 01:13:22.720]  of you who are tuning in because this black man is on the Alex Jones show. Let's see what
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.840]  this coon is talking about. They're doing it for all of you. They're doing it so all
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.680]  of you never look under the rock. And if we could create a caricature of Royce White
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.400]  or an Alex Jones, just maybe you'll continue on with your simple life where everything
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  is roses and then butterflies.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:49.599]  When really everything is casinos, and when I say casinos, I mean the algorithms or the
[01:13:49.599 --> 01:13:54.280]  psychological science that went into the social media apps.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.639]  Everything is casinos, everything is dopamine and serotonin is what roses and butterflies
[01:13:58.639 --> 01:13:59.639]  really means, right?
[01:13:59.639 --> 01:14:01.599]  And they're not shy about telling you that either.
[01:14:01.599 --> 01:14:03.580]  But you won't look under that rock either.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.019]  You won't look under the rock that big tech has weaponized the fundamental systems
[01:14:08.019 --> 01:14:11.059]  of the human psychology against you.
[01:14:11.059 --> 01:14:14.940]  You won't look under the rock where there are false flags, but you can't claim to be
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:19.019]  fighting for justice and freedom and equality.
[01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:23.139]  And you want to be mad at me for saying that, hey, I completely believe they will
[01:14:23.139 --> 01:14:31.559]  wind up some radical freak in some way to shoot some black folks so they can continue
[01:14:31.559 --> 01:14:35.660]  pushing the narrative that white supremacy is the biggest threat we face.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.120]  Now we're all supposed to look over here in Jacksonville when we still haven't finished
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.780]  pulling the bodies out of the fires in the ash in Maui.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.339]  Let's not investigate that.
[01:14:45.339 --> 01:14:46.980]  We don't want to talk about that.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:49.179]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:14:49.179 --> 01:14:50.900]  We don't want to cross that.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.160]  Everybody except Maui was an accident.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:01.740]  It was a natural disaster, horrible.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.160]  Are any of you familiar with Operation Starfish Prime?
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.120]  Are any of you familiar with Operation Fishbowl?
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:17.400]  Take a second while you get your resent and your emotions all up right here, right
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:26.120]  in your throat, ready to go find Royce's Twitter and comment away that I'm Uncle Tom.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:35.240]  Take that for a moment and just Google Operation Starfish Prime, Operation Fishbowl.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:40.679]  We're going to talk about Operation Starfish Prime and Operation Fishbowl on the other
[01:15:40.679 --> 01:15:50.360]  side of the break so that you can understand just how arrogant, how stupid, how naive,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.719]  how malicious your government can be.
[01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:55.719]  This was in the 60s.
[01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:58.400]  What do you think they do now?
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.780]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:08.000]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullwarstore.com.

[01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:20.360]  label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.

[01:16:30.639 --> 01:16:35.780]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.440]  inductive to pain.

[01:20:00.599 --> 01:20:06.679]  Eating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:20.490]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another segment here in the Cold War. I'm your host
[01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:26.250]  for the hour, Royce White. I'm here from the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:30.910]  And before the break, we started talking about Operation Starfish Prime. Really, we're talking
[01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:37.270]  about why people don't believe that their government is involved in high-level conspiracies.
[01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:41.410]  And I don't even think it's so much that people don't believe the government is involved in
[01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:47.090]  high-level conspiracies because many people, if you ask them, just walking up and down
[01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:54.270]  the street in casual conversation, will all say without equivocation that they don't
[01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:58.790]  trust the government and that the government is, in fact, involved in high-level conspiracies.
[01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:05.370]  Well, of course, most people would admit that in casual conversation because it's on
[01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:10.690]  the record. I mean, it's not really a conspiracy theory when it's written right there on the
[01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:15.370]  official record. And we do like our official authoritative sources, don't we? Well, there's
[01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:20.090]  plenty of official records that shows the government involved in high-level conspiracies
[01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:24.130]  right out there in the open for anybody to go look up to. The interesting part comes
[01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:33.090]  when a certain group of people who vote one way tend to accuse or assert that there's a
[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:37.650]  high-level government conspiracy going on on the opposite end of the political spectrum
[01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:48.970]  with the government. Well, never forget, never forget, never forget that 58 intelligence
[01:21:48.970 --> 01:22:02.810]  officials, 58, 58 intelligence officials signed a letter to say that the entire Hunter Biden
[01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:08.410]  laptop story was the result of Russian disinformation.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:18.320]  These people, these political elites, these intelligence community sellouts, these people
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:25.600]  were willing to blame the Russians, who are a potential nuclear adversary, for Hunter
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.600]  Biden's laptop.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:32.180]  I mean, if we're gonna blame the Russians for something, make it good, okay?
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.800]  And I say that as a potential future statesman.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:41.720]  There's no auspice under which I would agree to blame somebody for something they did falsely.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:50.960]  But even in my corrupt mind, okay, even in my corrupt mind, if I'm going to potentially
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:23:00.100]  stoke a war, a nuclear war with Russia, it's gotta be for something more valuable, something
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.940]  more important than a crackhead's laptop.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.100]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.700]  And I say that, I bring that up to show you who these people are.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:14.060]  I mean, they're willing to lie to you at the highest of levels over the most simple and
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:17.100]  stupid of situations.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:21.660]  Joe, your son is a crackhead, okay?
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:26.700]  He left his crackhead laptop at one of the hotels he was panhandling, okay?
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:31.620]  I mean, what, why do we have to go to war with Russia, cuz your son's a crackhead?
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.620]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:36.260]  This is ridiculous, it's out of control.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.260]  It's out of control.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:41.300]  We don't wanna go to war with Russia over a crackhead and his laptop.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:52.580]  Now the other potential issue with Hunter Biden is that something on that laptop was
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:58.860]  connected to the corruption of Joe Biden, which had implications far beyond the degeneracy
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:04.060]  of Hunter Biden and him being a crackhead or a solicitor or prostitute or whatever it
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.060]  is he's doing.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.060]  Look, I'm not judging.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.440]  I don't smoke crack, I don't use prostitutes.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:14.780]  But hey, all of us here in America could be, many of us, not all of us, but many of
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:21.740]  us here in America who are heterosexual and in the modern sexual marketplace could be categorized
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:28.980]  as exchanging sex for, what do they say, transaction, making our, that our sex and our romance
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:29.980]  is transactional.
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:32.180]  I mean, that's just regular, right?
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:39.300]  If I take you on a date, I pay for the date, we have sex, that's transaction of
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.300]  sorts.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.300]  I mean, it is what it is.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.860]  Now, Hunter, he's a special type of solicitor, right?
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.260]  I mean, he's going to the Yellow Pages for this type of stuff.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:51.620]  So the record reflects, okay?
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.540]  He's a sick puppy, he's a sick puppy.
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:25:00.560]  But nonetheless, yeah, we don't wanna go to war over his laptop.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:07.580]  We certainly don't wanna have our intelligence community conspire with the executive branch
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:15.880]  or anybody else to create a workaround or pass or to save face at the court of public
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.100]  opinion for a crackhead, that's crazy.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:23.160]  So there must be something, I mean, you can almost tell, you can almost infer, and this
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.500]  is one of those situations where no answer is good for the people who we're talking
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.500]  about.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:37.580]  Either A, Joe Biden, his entire administration are so incompetent and so childish, so immature
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:42.500]  with the levers of power, which they have, that they would actually risk us going to
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:46.820]  war with a potential nuclear adversary over a crackhead's laptop.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:52.560]  Or they were stupid enough to let a crackhead have information that was so detrimental that
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.500]  they're willing to go to war over a crackhead's laptop.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:59.660]  Either way, doesn't look good for the Biden administration, it doesn't look good
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:05.380]  for these 58 intelligence officers who thought to sign on to this letter, I mean, you gotta
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:06.380]  be kidding me.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.760]  And it doesn't look good for the rest of us, all of us out there who are willing
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.780]  participants in this style of governance, this level of incompetence.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:21.980]  This is not, what makes it even worse, to add insult to injury as if there's any more
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.120]  room for it.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:30.040]  What makes it even worse is the mainstream media industrial complex that all of us out
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:37.040]  here in the world who believe in it, including Wikipedia, they call it authoritative sources.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:43.120]  That mainstream media industrial complex actually wants to promote that Joe Biden being elected
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.940]  and the Democrats being in control of whatever they're in control of anytime they're in control
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:54.060]  of it, is a huge step up from Donald Trump and his immaturity, quote unquote.
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.200]  I mean, you've got to be kidding me, the grown ups are back in the room.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.240]  These people are grown ups, Joe Biden can't wipe his own ass, that's number one.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.740]  His son's a crackhead, they got a laptop floating around out there that the entire
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:12.780]  intelligence community has to lie in order to try and cover up.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:19.380]  And on top of that, every time a Hunter Biden situation pops up in the news, a day later
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.640]  Donald Trump gets hit with another indictment or another charge.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.240]  I mean, these are the people who are running the country.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.000]  And I said in one of the first segments of the first hour, right, that we had to
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.040]  put away petty differences because this is the pivotal moment.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.760]  Well, the pivotal moment isn't just because they want to take away our freedoms.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:49.440]  The other reason is we are in a full scale war biologically and economically for sure,
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.140]  but potentially a kinetic war as well.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.720]  I mean, we're in a kinetic war with Russia right now.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.740]  Right now we're in a kinetic war with Russia, that's the reality.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:03.660]  We gotta get ourselves out of these situations, we have to navigate these situations.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:08.080]  Do you really think that a crackhead and a senile old man who can barely walk up a
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.260]  flight of stairs can get us out of these situations?
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:12.260]  Do you believe that?
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:17.220]  I mean, if you do, God bless your soul, God bless you, okay?
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.740]  I'm gonna pray for you, cuz you need significant, significant spiritual guidance.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:25.660]  You're not able to see things clearly, and that's sad.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:29.520]  That's horrifying, but it's sad to say the least.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.860]  We don't wanna go to war over a crackhead's laptop.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:36.740]  I know I was supposed to talk about Starfish Prime, but really, do we even have to talk
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.380]  about them sending nukes up to light a fire in the atmosphere?
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.140]  Do we have to even go there?
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.540]  I mean, yeah, they did that.
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:54.260]  But 25, I mean, 58, I'm sorry, 58 intelligence officials signed a letter to hide the contents
[01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.220]  of the crackhead's laptop.
[01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:58.900]  Give me a break.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:05.180]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.300]  the atmosphere.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.100]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:15.460]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers, to convert these gases
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:19.900]  into fluorescence acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:24.300]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.780]  to dispose of it.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.700]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:34.180]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:40.740]  And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.100]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:48.360]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:54.300]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.

[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.580]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:04.300]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.300]  defeated.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.300]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.780]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:17.020]  body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with, and you do it

[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.300]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.

[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.260]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.

[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:51.059]  Don't procrastinate, this is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[01:30:51.059 --> 01:30:54.820]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:58.660]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:04.180]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.860]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil, the incredible

[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:54.500]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, not even a lower price.

[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:12.580]  They can be found in grass-fed beef which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:18.980]  and they can be found in fish which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:23.780]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:31.300]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at m4store.com.

[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:06.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:20.290]  It's me again Patriots and Cuck Slayers here live from the belly of the beast, Morris White
[01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:23.450]  on your desk to host on Infowars for the remainder of the hour.
[01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:29.490]  I want to say thank you again to the entire Infowars team and the great Alex Jones for
[01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:37.530]  allowing me to host this incredible, incredible, historic, iconic, legendary, country saving
[01:33:38.050 --> 01:33:44.770]  platform. I'm reluctant to even say platform because the words become so woke. Let's say show.
[01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:49.890]  Thank you for letting me host the show, Alex. I really appreciate it. Before we hit the break,
[01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:57.570]  I was supposed to talk about Starfish Prime just to let people know the magnitude of what
[01:33:57.570 --> 01:34:06.810]  their government is capable of and what lengths they're willing to go to in this journey
[01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:12.890]  for technological and scientific supremacy. This is really what it was. We were at war with Russia,
[01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:18.570]  basically. We were in a Cold War with Russia in the mid 60s. The Cold War with Russia really
[01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:25.770]  began right after World War II. And by the 60s, we were a full blown Cold War, you could say,
[01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:31.810]  with Russia. And we thought that it was wise to do a nuclear test up in the atmosphere.
[01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:39.010]  They fenced it on. We're trying to learn things. They tried to set the atmosphere on fire. This
[01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:47.650]  is who we're dealing with. This is who we're dealing with. There are so many government
[01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:53.650]  conspiracies or classified information that the government has withheld. It's horrifying.
[01:34:54.690 --> 01:35:00.290]  MK Ultra is the easy one. Everybody talking about Jacksonville and being able to potentially
[01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:08.050]  brainwash people to do certain heinous things or violent things in the interest of some
[01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:13.730]  government agenda. MK Ultra would seem like a great place to start as well, but I'm not even
[01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:18.610]  gonna bring MK Ultra into it cuz we all mostly know about. I mean, many, many common people
[01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:24.210]  know about MK Ultra. If you don't, again, you're not even in the beginner stage of having
[01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:29.890]  a real opinion about what government is or isn't capable of. But we don't even have to talk
[01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:39.810]  about Operation Starfish Prime or MK Ultra or Blue Book or Gain of Function.
[01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:44.690]  Let's not even go there. Let's not even go there cuz we don't have to go there. Please
[01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:49.010]  do the research on your own. I promise it'll be fruitful and you'll start to understand
[01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:54.530]  just who your leaders are and what they're capable of, what their scientific pipe dreams
[01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:59.970]  really look like. But let's just talk about the simple fact that 58 intelligence officials
[01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:06.610]  signed a letter to say that the Hunter Biden laptop story was the result of Russian
[01:36:06.610 --> 01:36:13.250]  disinformation. This is a telltale sign. This is a telltale sign that our leaders,
[01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:18.530]  our current leader, our commander in chief is an absolute moron.
[01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:23.890]  And under normal circumstances, I would refrain from criticizing the President of the United
[01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:29.730]  States while we're at war. But see, I guess the Congress hasn't officially said we're at war.
[01:36:29.730 --> 01:36:34.370]  We're only aiding the Ukraine. I guess I can say that the President's an absolute moron.
[01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:39.730]  We're not officially at war, right? We are officially at war and our President is a moron.
[01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:43.010]  And I have to say it because that's just how dire things have gotten in this country.
[01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:49.730]  We can't hold any punches. I'm sorry. The man can't walk a straight line.
[01:36:50.530 --> 01:36:56.290]  The man walks like he's drunk at all times of the day and maybe he is drunk a lot of the day.
[01:36:56.290 --> 01:37:00.930]  I don't know. I don't know. I'm not there personally. I would hope he's not walking around
[01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:07.570]  drunk. That would be a horrifying revelation. But regardless, the cognitive decline that we've
[01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:12.370]  seen from Joe Biden just over the last 12 months is intense. It's intense to say at least
[01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:18.050]  the man can barely walk around on his own. He has to be directed around on a continual basis.
[01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:24.130]  And what's dangerous about that is, obviously, who's really running the country?
[01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:29.090]  Jill running the country? Is it the Obamas? Are there certain
[01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:36.290]  fingers from the intelligence community or the Joint Chiefs or maybe his intellectual
[01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:41.570]  finocchio buddies over there from the World Economic Forum? Who really has the levels of power
[01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:51.410]  for our great nation? I don't know. I'm having trouble putting a finger on it.
[01:37:52.770 --> 01:37:58.690]  I think it's a combination of people. But all of their sales are pointed in the same direction.
[01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:04.850]  That's the benefit that they have is every pirate is gonna try and take a little extra
[01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:10.210]  for themselves. But ultimately, they always win because most of the pirates have the same
[01:38:10.210 --> 01:38:18.130]  bottom line. And again, drug slavery, piracy, it's a great segue that this entire globalist
[01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:24.690]  business model that stems back to the crown and the sun that never sets on the British Empire.
[01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:30.290]  Drug slavery and piracy was a business model that they perfected.
[01:38:31.730 --> 01:38:39.650]  It's a business model that the founding fathers here in America rejected. They rejected on principle
[01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:46.850]  moral authority, moral claims, independence from that business model.
[01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:54.610]  And yet here we are. We don't wanna believe that pirates will be pirates. We don't wanna believe
[01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:58.050]  that slave takers will be slave takers. We don't wanna believe
[01:38:58.690 --> 01:39:03.890]  that drug dealers will be drug dealers. This is who we're dealing with.
[01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:08.530]  This is who we're dealing with. And I know it's hard for people to comprehend.
[01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:12.770]  It's hard for people to hear an Alex Jones on a daily basis and think, man.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:20.219]  You know, what if everything he's saying is actually true?
[01:39:20.219 --> 01:39:21.940]  What if it's all true?
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:25.900]  And I'm happy that now more than ever, a lot of people are willing to step up and say,
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.900]  hey, Alex Jones was right.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:32.179]  Alex Jones is right is going to end up being one of those iconic phrases that comes
[01:39:32.179 --> 01:39:34.500]  out of this moment in American history.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:41.379]  If we don't become a China-centric tributary state where all of the history is written
[01:39:41.379 --> 01:39:44.139]  by the very people who destroyed the country.
[01:39:44.139 --> 01:39:51.179]  If we save the country and the history is written by fair and honest and truthful patriots, phrases
[01:39:51.179 --> 01:39:58.500]  like Alex Jones was right will be etched in the record books.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.820]  But I know it's hard.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:03.580]  People listen to Alex Jones and they go, oh, it's doom and gloom and, oh, he's just
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.900]  trying to sell people products or whatever.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:10.419]  I mean, just, you know, grow a pair, grow a pair.
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.820]  The man is fighting against an establishment that obviously wants to take him out.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:17.259]  But more importantly, they want to take you out and they're really not shy about saying
[01:40:17.259 --> 01:40:18.259]  it.
[01:40:18.259 --> 01:40:19.700]  I mean, how else do you want?
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:23.700]  How would you like somebody to deliver that message to you?
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.559]  That's the question I ask.
[01:40:25.559 --> 01:40:29.740]  How would you like that message to be delivered?
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:35.820]  What's the ideal way to tell you that the entire government superstructure that presides
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:41.219]  over you is conspiring to undermine your freedoms and rights?
[01:40:41.219 --> 01:40:43.379]  Is there a good way to tell somebody that?
[01:40:43.379 --> 01:40:49.120]  No, no, there's not a fun, safe, comfortable way to tell people that, which is why your
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.460]  local news, your national news and your international news never really do it.
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:57.179]  Because it doesn't sell.
[01:40:57.179 --> 01:41:00.540]  It's not profitable.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:03.139]  And I don't even mean it's not profitable in a monetary sense.
[01:41:03.139 --> 01:41:11.540]  It's not profitable in a controlled sense.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:15.179]  It's hard to control people when you panic them, right?
[01:41:15.179 --> 01:41:19.820]  It's hard to keep people under control when you give them too much panic.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:23.540]  When you give them too much of the truth, you can't handle the truth, right?
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:30.299]  That's part of the justification for classifying documents, classifying information, not just
[01:41:30.299 --> 01:41:31.740]  so our enemies can't see it.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.460]  That's the first excuse they make.
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:40.700]  But the second excuse is on the basis that people wouldn't know how to handle the truth.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.879]  They wouldn't know how to handle it.
[01:41:41.879 --> 01:41:44.099]  They wouldn't know how to go on about their daily lives.
[01:41:44.099 --> 01:41:48.700]  They wouldn't know how to be a cog in the machine or how to be a cog in the wheel
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:51.019]  if they knew the truth.
[01:41:51.019 --> 01:41:53.900]  But what truth are they really trying to hide?
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:59.980]  I mean, when push comes to shove, what truth are they trying to hide from us?
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:11.980]  What's so dark and unreal that we can't know, that our little primitive uneducated minds
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.379]  can't comprehend?
[01:42:13.379 --> 01:42:14.660]  What is it?
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:15.660]  What is it?
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:20.259]  All I see are a bunch of pirates, a bunch of pirates telling you that you can't handle
[01:42:20.259 --> 01:42:27.139]  the truth so they can continue to steal your money, and even more so, steal your energy,
[01:42:27.299 --> 01:42:34.299]  steal your complacence, steal your ability to think for yourself, steal your autonomy.
[01:42:34.919 --> 01:42:36.820]  That's what they're trying to steal from you.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.540]  That's the real scam.
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:43.219]  The scam is we can't tell you the truth because then the whole game would be up.
[01:42:43.219 --> 01:42:45.299]  The jig would be up.
[01:42:45.299 --> 01:42:50.259]  We have to figure out how to take your freedom by force.
[01:42:50.259 --> 01:42:53.940]  It's much easier if you just give it to us, and we're going to talk about that more
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:54.940]  on the other side.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:58.660]  What is the prospect of maintaining freedom versus allowing them to take it?
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:03.900]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us, and they're
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:06.900]  doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:10.780]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:15.059]  vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements
[01:43:15.059 --> 01:43:21.059]  like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:26.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, because we're about to sell out of
[01:43:26.259 --> 01:43:33.259]  both of these, of X3 and vitaminal fusion in the final days of August.
[01:43:33.259 --> 01:43:35.259]  This is a fundraiser.
[01:43:35.259 --> 01:43:36.259]  We'll sell out of this.
[01:43:36.259 --> 01:43:40.099]  I could sell it at full price, but I want those of you that have been on the fence
[01:43:40.099 --> 01:43:45.299]  and never tried X3 or never tried vitaminal fusion to take action and try this product
[01:43:45.299 --> 01:43:50.299]  because I know you're going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the focus,
[01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.540]  the libido.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.540]  This is so critical.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:58.540]  Get your X3 and vitaminal fusion for 40% off right now at mforrestore.com.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.540]  And then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.540]  So please do that as well.
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:25.540]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.540]  That'll make it 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.540]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.540]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:34.540]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.540]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.540]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:42.540]  But in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:43.540]  it's hard.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:44.540]  I know times are tough.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.540]  So thank you for your support.
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:49.540]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:51.780]  That you can do for free.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.780]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.780]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:57.780]  please support us now.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:59.780]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.780]  God bless you.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:03.780]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:05.780]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:07.780]  They have a lot of power.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:09.780]  But they can be defeated.
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.780]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:13.780]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.780]  and your family's body
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:17.780]  by purifying the water that you drink
[01:45:18.019 --> 01:45:20.019]  with the most quality, gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:45:20.019 --> 01:45:22.019]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:45:22.019 --> 01:45:24.019]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:45:24.019 --> 01:45:26.019]  It purifies very quickly
[01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:28.019]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals
[01:45:28.019 --> 01:45:30.019]  to non-detectable levels.
[01:45:30.019 --> 01:45:32.019]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:45:32.019 --> 01:45:34.019]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price
[01:45:34.019 --> 01:45:36.019]  for a limited time.
[01:45:36.019 --> 01:45:38.019]  10% off on top of that.
[01:45:38.019 --> 01:45:40.019]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com
[01:45:40.019 --> 01:45:42.019]  on the Alexa Pure water filtration system
[01:45:42.019 --> 01:45:44.019]  in stock and replacement filters
[01:45:44.019 --> 01:45:46.019]  for folks that need those in stock.
[01:45:46.019 --> 01:45:48.019]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:45:48.019 --> 01:45:50.019]  This is one of the main areas
[01:45:50.019 --> 01:45:52.019]  we can take control of our lives
[01:45:52.019 --> 01:45:54.019]  and stop the globalists from hitting us
[01:45:54.019 --> 01:45:56.019]  with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:45:56.019 --> 01:45:58.019]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:00.019]  With all the craziness in the world,
[01:46:00.019 --> 01:46:02.019]  the collapsing borders,
[01:46:02.019 --> 01:46:04.019]  war with Russia,
[01:46:04.019 --> 01:46:06.019]  the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[01:46:06.019 --> 01:46:08.019]  the economy going crazy,
[01:46:08.019 --> 01:46:10.019]  you are crazy in my view
[01:46:10.019 --> 01:46:12.019]  if you don't get high-quality, storeable food
[01:46:12.019 --> 01:46:14.019]  and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:46:14.019 --> 01:46:16.019]  We're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:46:16.019 --> 01:46:18.019]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[01:46:18.019 --> 01:46:20.019]  and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:46:20.019 --> 01:46:22.019]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that.
[01:46:22.019 --> 01:46:24.019]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[01:46:24.019 --> 01:46:26.019]  but they don't have enough storeable food
[01:46:26.019 --> 01:46:28.019]  or water filtration.
[01:46:28.019 --> 01:46:30.019]  This is something you need now,
[01:46:30.019 --> 01:46:32.019]  and we've got it in the food department
[01:46:32.019 --> 01:46:34.019]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:46:34.019 --> 01:46:36.019]  The highest quality food,
[01:46:36.019 --> 01:46:38.019]  the best water filtration at the lowest prices
[01:46:38.019 --> 01:46:40.019]  you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:42.019]  InfowarStore.com is running a special right now
[01:46:42.019 --> 01:46:44.019]  on food and on water and air filtration.
[01:46:44.019 --> 01:46:46.019]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:46:46.019 --> 01:46:48.019]  you cannot beat this deal.
[01:46:48.019 --> 01:46:50.019]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:46:50.019 --> 01:46:52.019]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:46:52.019 --> 01:46:54.019]  Go to InfowarStore.com
[01:46:54.019 --> 01:46:56.019]  and get prepared while you still can.
[01:46:57.390 --> 01:47:06.150]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:31.580]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen for the final segment of the hour. I'm your guest host, Royce White, here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota. I want to say thank you to the entire Infowars audience and Alex Jones himself, the great Alex Jones, for allowing me to host at the end of the last segment.
[01:47:31.730 --> 01:47:37.849]  Freedom, the prospect of freedom.
[01:47:37.849 --> 01:47:38.849]  How we gotten here?
[01:47:38.849 --> 01:47:40.450]  How do we get to this place?
[01:47:40.450 --> 01:47:46.089]  Well, you know, it's a damning indictment of us all.
[01:47:46.089 --> 01:47:47.089]  It really is.
[01:47:47.089 --> 01:47:50.530]  I hate to say it, it's a damning indictment of us.
[01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:51.809]  We the people.
[01:47:51.809 --> 01:47:55.250]  We the people became comfortable, we became complacent.
[01:47:55.250 --> 01:48:00.530]  We agreed, we signed the dotted line, we allowed the government and all of our corporate
[01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:06.209]  global elites to tell us that all of our lives would get better, that it was a net
[01:48:06.209 --> 01:48:12.570]  positive to surrender certain rights and freedoms to a bigger, broader government and
[01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:13.929]  global corporatocracy.
[01:48:13.929 --> 01:48:15.969]  We all bought into it.
[01:48:15.969 --> 01:48:16.969]  We all bought into it.
[01:48:16.969 --> 01:48:23.650]  Or let's say our level of activism or our ministry didn't match the direness of
[01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:27.330]  the proposal that we were being given.
[01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:30.969]  And that proposal was exactly what I just laid out.
[01:48:30.969 --> 01:48:35.089]  Give us your rights, give us your freedoms, we'll give you security, we'll give you
[01:48:35.089 --> 01:48:40.169]  the endless pursuit of radical materialism.
[01:48:40.169 --> 01:48:42.370]  Have at it, do as thy will.
[01:48:42.370 --> 01:48:50.169]  And some of us wanted to maintain some resemblance of patriotism, of faith and Christianity
[01:48:50.169 --> 01:48:58.530]  or whatever faith you believe in, individual liberty, individual autonomy and sovereignty.
[01:48:58.530 --> 01:49:03.650]  And we all told ourselves all along the way that nothing the government did or could
[01:49:03.650 --> 01:49:10.490]  do would be able to take us or bring us to the place that we are at right now.
[01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:16.969]  And right now, we are at a place, we are at a moment in history where freedom itself,
[01:49:16.969 --> 01:49:22.009]  every ounce, every ounce of American freedom is on the line.
[01:49:22.009 --> 01:49:25.929]  There won't be a resemblance of American freedom if we don't turn this around right
[01:49:25.929 --> 01:49:26.929]  now.
[01:49:26.929 --> 01:49:31.250]  And I'm calling on all the Supreme Court justices, all of the patriots that still
[01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:34.929]  exist in any of these intelligence communities.
[01:49:34.929 --> 01:49:38.849]  Everybody around the world, everybody in the media, anybody who still has a heart, anybody
[01:49:38.849 --> 01:49:45.250]  who still has some sacred honor, everybody across the country, we need all hands on
[01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:46.250]  deck now.
[01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:52.410]  If we don't get all hands on deck now, we won't make it.
[01:49:52.410 --> 01:49:55.929]  We won't make it, that there won't be an America.
[01:49:55.929 --> 01:50:02.969]  There won't be an America and the place that we get in place of America won't be a
[01:50:02.969 --> 01:50:05.009]  place that many of us wanna live.
[01:50:05.009 --> 01:50:07.809]  We think we'll wanna live there.
[01:50:07.809 --> 01:50:13.929]  We think it's fun to walk up at the store at Whole Foods and put our fingerprint on
[01:50:13.929 --> 01:50:31.610]  to scan for a nice, fresh loaf of bread, nice artisan, gluten-free, mystery wheat loaf
[01:50:31.610 --> 01:50:32.610]  of bread.
[01:50:32.610 --> 01:50:35.410]  I'm joking, but you get the point.
[01:50:35.410 --> 01:50:41.169]  But pretty soon when the food runs out and we have food scarcity or they execute the
[01:50:41.169 --> 01:50:49.570]  agenda of taking the food supply away from us literally, or rationing it based on a diversity,
[01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:55.370]  equity, and inclusion, or climate agenda, then you'll be going to put your handprint,
[01:50:55.370 --> 01:51:01.410]  your palm print on the scanner for a little small piece of rotten bread, right?
[01:51:01.410 --> 01:51:07.809]  And many people don't see that time coming, but the Alex Joneses of the world do, and
[01:51:07.809 --> 01:51:10.410]  many others do, I certainly do.
[01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:11.809]  I see the potential for it.
[01:51:11.809 --> 01:51:16.129]  And the question is, when we talk about freedom, when we discuss freedom, do we have to deal
[01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:19.190]  with what is or what could be?
[01:51:19.190 --> 01:51:22.969]  Was the inception of this country and its founding documents to deal with what was
[01:51:22.969 --> 01:51:25.169]  or what could be?
[01:51:25.169 --> 01:51:29.690]  Anybody who understands anything about the constitution of this great nation understands
[01:51:29.690 --> 01:51:34.169]  that it dealt with the potential tyranny of the federal government.
[01:51:34.169 --> 01:51:38.969]  It dealt with the potential of politics in a constitutional republic.
[01:51:38.969 --> 01:51:45.530]  It dealt with hypotheticals, and the hypotheticals right now are way out of control.
[01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:47.629]  We've let them get way out of control.
[01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:53.490]  The reality, the here and now is way out of control, let alone the hypotheticals.
[01:51:53.490 --> 01:52:03.889]  Direct energy weapons, direct energy weapons, gain of function, research, top secret domestic
[01:52:03.889 --> 01:52:14.730]  surveillance on political opponents, false flags, I mean, these are the real hotspots,
[01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:19.889]  tinderboxes for conspiracy to bubble up.
[01:52:19.889 --> 01:52:22.809]  Not to mention the conspiracy that's right out there in the open, and I mentioned the
[01:52:22.809 --> 01:52:23.809]  housing crash.
[01:52:23.809 --> 01:52:29.110]  I was just watching the big short today, earlier today, and it just reminded me how
[01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:37.549]  corrupt the entire housing market collapse was, out of control.
[01:52:37.549 --> 01:52:41.990]  The financial elites in this country and around the world are completely and utterly
[01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.990]  out of control.
[01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:49.269]  And the fact that they do it so arrogantly, so unabashed, should signal how scared you
[01:52:49.269 --> 01:52:55.570]  should be of other things that they claim they're not involved in.
[01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:57.549]  They're all involved together.
[01:52:57.549 --> 01:52:58.750]  They're all in on it together.
[01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:02.830]  I said it when I ran for Congress against Ilhan, I'm gonna continue to say it as I run
[01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:05.950]  for Senate against Amy Klobuchar, they're all in on it together.
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:10.100]  They're all a part of the same agenda.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:15.520]  Now will they try and siphon a little bigger piece of the pot off for themselves as they
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.340]  carry out that agenda?
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.340]  Absolutely.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.340]  Absolutely.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:22.980]  They'll try and do for themselves what they can in that agenda.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:29.740]  But the reality is they're all in on it together, and they are all in on it together.
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:35.180]  If we can, I want to play the clip of the young woman, it's about 19 seconds,
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:41.060]  the young woman who was the grand juror for the Donald Trump case, I believe in Virginia,
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:42.060]  if I'm not mistaken.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.100]  It was either Virginia, I think it's Virginia.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:48.180]  Let's roll that clip if we got it cued up.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.180]  Let's roll that clip.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:53.500]  I just want to show you where the country is actually going and that the spirit of
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:54:00.620]  the country, the spirit of these people is aimed in one direction and it's dragging
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:02.900]  the country in that direction.
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:03.900]  If we can play it.
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:08.020]  We'll wait for them to get the clip up, but it's a young woman who wants to hear.
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:11.940]  I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly, I kind of want to disappear
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:15.900]  the former president because I got to swear everybody in, and so I thought it'd be really
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:20.420]  cool to get 60 seconds with president Trump of me looking at him and being like, do
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.420]  you solemnly swear?
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:25.540]  And me getting to swear him in, I just, I thought that would be an awesome moment.
[01:54:25.570 --> 01:54:35.130]  Run the clip again, please. I don't think people really understand what this means,
[01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:42.730]  what the implications are. We live in a banana republic. These are kangaroo court proceedings.
[01:54:42.730 --> 01:54:47.570]  And when you lose the rule of law, when your courts become politicized and then weaponized
[01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:55.490]  against political opponents or dissidents like Alex Jones, you've already lost your
[01:54:55.490 --> 01:55:04.690]  freedom. I mean, from the perspective of our founding fathers, freedom is already lost
[01:55:04.690 --> 01:55:11.969]  in this country. It's gone. When things like this are allowed to go on, we've already lost
[01:55:11.969 --> 01:55:15.570]  freedom. Roll the clip again, roll it again.
[01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:21.290]  I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly I kind of wanted to subpoena
[01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:25.250]  the former president because I got to swear everybody in. And so I thought it'd be really
[01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:29.849]  cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump of me looking at him and being like, do you
[01:55:29.849 --> 01:55:34.190]  solemnly swear? And me getting to swear him in, I just, I thought that would be an
[01:55:34.190 --> 01:55:34.889]  awesome moment.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:41.360]  This is what we're living in.
[01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:49.350]  This is the degradation of the American justice system, moral hazard, moral hazard from a
[01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:54.750]  justice system that's always played fast and loose with the truth for the agenda, for
[01:55:54.750 --> 01:56:01.390]  the advantage of the highest bidder, right? The hyper financialization of American law
[01:56:01.390 --> 01:56:08.530]  and the American jurisprudence, which stems from the racket that exists between the American
[01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:15.050]  higher education institutions, the universities and the Bar Association, right? I mean, it's
[01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:20.370]  all one racket. That's what I played the clip for to show you. This is one racket.
[01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:25.330]  Or let's go, let's talk about Fannie Pack Willis for the last minute here before we
[01:56:25.330 --> 01:56:31.810]  head out. They're gonna use the black woman as a cudgel against you. Make no mistake
[01:56:31.810 --> 01:56:36.130]  about it. And you better pray for black men like me to rise up because there's something
[01:56:36.130 --> 01:56:41.730]  about suburban white women that just can't resist a great sob story from the American
[01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:43.630]  black woman.
[01:56:43.630 --> 01:56:51.730]  And that sob story is being used to ram a tyrant spike right up the rear end of
[01:56:51.730 --> 01:57:03.770]  America. Let's talk about Fannie Willis, complete political witch hunt, complete Facebook
[01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:13.290]  posts from 2020 talking about the elections. And actually, on the record, on our Facebook
[01:57:13.290 --> 01:57:13.850]  page.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:21.620]  Claiming that the integrity of the election was in danger, but it was only in danger if
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:24.540]  the Democrats weren't going to win.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:28.900]  When Donald Trump says that it's a felony, it's treason, it's conspiracy against rights,
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.620]  it's all these other things.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:32.900]  These are the times we live in, people.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.339]  We better get serious right now.
[01:57:34.339 --> 01:57:36.019]  I mean, this is the moment.
[01:57:36.019 --> 01:57:40.580]  If there ever was a moment, if there ever was a moment for you to pick up, pick up
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:42.980]  your sword and your shield and get ready to fight.
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:44.900]  It's right now.
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:45.900]  Godspeed.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:18.219]  We're about to make a flash sale, because we're about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and
[01:58:18.219 --> 01:58:21.940]  Vibramental Fusion in the final days of August.
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:23.940]  This is a fundraiser.
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:25.500]  We'll sell out of this.
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:27.099]  I can sell it at full price.
[01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:31.139]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never
[01:58:31.139 --> 01:58:35.879]  tried Vibramental Fusion to take action and try this product, because I know you're
[01:58:35.879 --> 01:58:41.339]  going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido.
[01:58:41.339 --> 01:58:42.780]  This is so critical.
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:48.299]  Get your X3 and Vibramental Fusion for 40% off right now at m4store.com.
[01:58:48.299 --> 01:58:52.679]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:58:52.679 --> 01:58:57.900]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at m4store.com.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:03.059]  They are both clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[01:59:03.059 --> 01:59:07.019]  supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label
[01:59:07.019 --> 01:59:10.259]  it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:59:10.259 --> 01:59:14.379]  There's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:59:14.379 --> 01:59:20.339]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make
[01:59:20.339 --> 01:59:25.299]  your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are
[01:59:25.299 --> 01:59:27.339]  more inductive to pain.
[01:59:27.339 --> 01:59:29.620]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:36.740]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:39.839]  at m4store.com right now.
[01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:45.320]  Introducing them both, 25% off, you'll find them exclusively at m4store.com and they find
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:56.559]  their operation.
