[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.920 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:38.120]  Alex Jones well the globalists have destroyed every sovereign nation on
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.560]  earth except for a handful and they're busy trying to complete the enslavement
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.920]  of the United States imagine if there were 30 plus million they keep saying
[00:46.920 --> 00:54.000]  it's 11 or 20 it's well over 20 million illegals in this country and nobody's
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.120]  saying a lot of them don't work hard nobody's saying that these are bad
[00:57.120 --> 01:02.080]  people overall on average the issue is they have been brainwashed and they do
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.040]  vote and I have the poll numbers right here to take people's guns and to vote
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.880]  for more open borders and socialism and the end of private property rights and
[01:11.880 --> 01:17.840]  they vote Democratic and as bad as the Republicans are they will soon be an
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.440]  extinct fringe party and I'm gonna be breaking that down today and then Katie
[01:23.440 --> 01:27.960]  bar the door because if the establishment can bring in unlimited
[01:27.960 --> 01:31.320]  groups of people that are on the government dole basically paying for
[01:31.320 --> 01:35.280]  their votes it's game over they're having illegals vote all over the country
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.960]  already with driver's license that are issued by the states that's on record and
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.560]  then if you're against that you're a racist well I can't go to Mexico and
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.200]  go vote down there as the illegal I can't get free welfare if I show up in a
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.280]  Mexican hospital try to have a baby they're going to take the money out of
[01:53.280 --> 01:56.320]  me and if not they're going to throw the father and this has happened before in
[01:56.320 --> 02:03.080]  jail until the family back in El Norte pays it off like Mexico has some of the
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.400]  most draconian immigration laws in the world even the New York Times admits
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.720]  that so it's totally hypocritical and the goodwill of the American people is
[02:12.720 --> 02:16.240]  being used here just like the goodwill the American people was used to get
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.760]  Obama elected and now if you don't agree with what he's doing you're racist this
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.080]  is the race politics of the Democratic Party the problem is all the big
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.000]  Republican associations association manufacturing the association of small
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.840]  businesses that the different associations the National Chamber of
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.680]  Commerce are all pushing for this because well they push for the bank or
[02:41.680 --> 02:48.200]  bailout they they push for gun control they push for elitism they push for
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.240]  getting rid of basic freedom in this country and so you got the Republican
[02:53.240 --> 02:55.800]  leadership for it the Democratic leadership for it all these foreign
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.520]  banks for it all the big blue blood Republican country club people for it
[03:00.520 --> 03:05.200]  because they want a managed economy and they want to checkmate what's left of
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.840]  the middle class in this country I mean has naftan got helped America did help
[03:09.840 --> 03:15.320]  Mexico for that matter no in fact in the last 25 years you can look at the
[03:15.320 --> 03:23.680]  numbers the top 1% has doubled its wealth and they're the ones lobbying on
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.000]  average and and pushing this whole so-called liberal agenda it is not a
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.400]  liberal agenda and I talked about this yesterday you're a top Nazi collaborator
[03:32.400 --> 03:42.800]  George Soros you get ADL awards if you fight fascism you're called a Nazi if
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.000]  you're the Democratic Party run in the Ku Klux Klan till 1963 publicly then the
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.920]  demographics change whites be overwhelmingly become anti segregation
[03:52.920 --> 03:57.280]  anti-racism and so you flip and become the party the minorities this is a
[03:57.280 --> 04:04.720]  totally sickening joke and it's a total hoax and if Boehner and all the rest
[04:04.720 --> 04:09.040]  these people are able to get what they want this country is done it is done
[04:09.040 --> 04:13.440]  all we can do is have states to seed and try to reconstitute something because
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.120]  folks if they can bring in 25 35 million illegals the numbers more like 35
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.640]  million and then legalize them and then say we're gonna legalize the next group
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.440]  oh how dare you not legalize millions and millions of people that are here
[04:26.440 --> 04:31.920]  illegally this is just outrageous I've never heard of anything like this it's
[04:31.920 --> 04:38.520]  the over-the-top nature of this how dare you not want the TSA to stick your
[04:38.520 --> 04:42.280]  hands down your pants how dare you not want us to have no tries police on
[04:42.280 --> 04:45.720]  every street corner how dare you not want the IRS people take money out of
[04:45.720 --> 04:49.880]  your bank account no judge or jury how dare you not want all this forced
[04:49.880 --> 04:55.840]  inoculation I mean it's just all over the top this is the latest treason to
[04:55.840 --> 05:00.720]  legalize people that are here totally illegal what will that do the facts are
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.160]  in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the

[08:06.920 --> 08:22.880]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network before I had hit refresh on
[08:22.880 --> 08:29.160]  drugsreport.com about 20 minutes ago I was intending to come in here on this
[08:29.160 --> 08:36.800]  live Thursday edition already the 30th day of January 2014 I was intending to
[08:36.800 --> 08:42.480]  come in here and basically say that legalizing more than 30 million illegal
[08:42.480 --> 08:50.400]  aliens it's not 11 million folks is suicide for this country and that the
[08:50.400 --> 08:57.000]  Republican Party is going to commit suicide demographically if they pass
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.280]  this but they probably will and Obama has already legalized the illegals by
[09:02.280 --> 09:07.720]  fiat and it's letting them vote by fiat in race-based politics funded by the
[09:07.720 --> 09:12.040]  Ford Foundation and Carnegie Endowment in the last 60 years to create
[09:12.040 --> 09:17.240]  incredible increased racial animus on folks in Mexico and tell them it's a
[09:17.240 --> 09:25.200]  cultural duty to go to El Norte for la reconquista or the reconquering and then
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.680]  you have the MSNBC crowd who will then continue the radicalization and then
[09:30.680 --> 09:35.480]  tied to that racial animus that is sold and packaged you will then have attached
[09:35.480 --> 09:41.680]  to it the different sacraments of ban the guns fully open the borders get rid
[09:41.680 --> 09:49.320]  of the family the race to the bottom and America will fall like California is
[09:49.320 --> 09:54.840]  already falling that is the game plan that is the program and you have the
[09:54.840 --> 09:58.880]  entire Republican leadership supporting it you have the entire corporate
[09:58.880 --> 10:03.680]  global leadership supporting it because they want desperately poor people and
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.280]  there's no economic study out there I've got a stack of a moment to cover here in
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.720]  a moment that doesn't say this won't drive down wages there isn't a study out
[10:11.720 --> 10:16.000]  there that says this won't lower the standard of living there's not a study
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.800]  out there that says that this will not cause the total complete takeover by the
[10:22.800 --> 10:28.560]  Democratic Party of every institution in America and then they get to have all
[10:28.560 --> 10:34.440]  their social engineering everything else they're up to remember the Democratic
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.360]  Party was able to dominate the South because of Lincoln their enemy until
[10:39.360 --> 10:45.040]  the early 1960s and Eisenhower broke their back people like my grandfather
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.880]  got elected to government in Texas his father been a mayor of a major city he
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.520]  been a Democrat my grandfather bucked it became a Republican and a pro-civil rights
[10:55.520 --> 11:02.360]  Act that was done all across the country in every town and city you saw those
[11:02.360 --> 11:05.640]  actions take place the Democrats and I've read the quotes by LBJ and others
[11:05.640 --> 11:11.320]  here on air said we've got to now act like we like these minorities and co-opt
[11:11.320 --> 11:14.440]  them but we'll just play race politics we've the way we've done with poor
[11:14.440 --> 11:20.880]  whites that's all it is and they are master criminals at doing it and the
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.840]  problem is they're very unpopular and they could be defeated but the
[11:24.840 --> 11:29.440]  Republican leadership is bought and paid for by the same interest there is
[11:29.440 --> 11:33.880]  not a Dwight D Eisenhower in the Republican Party right now those that
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.120]  could be like a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul are under unmitigated attack and
[11:39.120 --> 11:44.760]  demonization and as Pat Buchanan said today we have an audio clip of this he
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.000]  said you know Boehner will be out of speaker if he does this they don't care
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.920]  he'll get his big payoff the guy plays golf with Obama constantly it's all a
[11:52.920 --> 11:57.760]  big sick joke to these people they're going to be rewarded for doing this and
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.680]  they've made it a matter of some type of racial pride within the polls I've got
[12:02.680 --> 12:08.760]  at the La Pew Research Hispanic Center 83% of Hispanics think it's a duty in
[12:08.760 --> 12:15.320]  polls conducted by Hispanic polling center in Spanish to take over quote
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.200]  America racially so see that's the racial angle and that's what's been sold
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.520]  well meanwhile the average white person is completely politically correct hates
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.080]  themselves and would feed their child into a garbage disposal unit if they
[12:29.080 --> 12:33.760]  were told it was something to prove that they're not a bad white person and
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.080]  that's where all this goes that's where all this happens you know the race issue
[12:38.080 --> 12:41.680]  at the end of the day doesn't really mean anything it's just a tribal
[12:41.680 --> 12:50.600]  identification like Jew versus Palestinian or Shiite versus Sunni or black
[12:50.600 --> 12:57.040]  Muslim against black Christian the globalist you just need a dividing line
[12:57.040 --> 13:03.560]  and this is the fact ladies and gentlemen that when I took US history at
[13:03.560 --> 13:09.080]  the you know in high school and then in college all it was was a demonization of
[13:09.080 --> 13:14.360]  gringos by white professors and that America had to be destroyed well the
[13:14.360 --> 13:17.640]  globalists want to destroy it and turn it into North American Union it'll still
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.320]  have the big military you'll still have the American flag it just will be
[13:21.320 --> 13:27.000]  totally conquered politically by a new racial block that will be used by the
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  government to then basically menace the other racial blocks and so we won't have
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.760]  a system based on liberty and freedom and due process and separation of powers
[13:36.760 --> 13:43.720]  and private property it will be a fully big city Chicago New York style area
[13:43.720 --> 13:50.280]  where you'll have regional city council people who who are racial and you'll have
[13:50.280 --> 13:55.760]  the white area the black area the Hispanic areas the Asian areas and there
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.360]  will be wealth transferences from anyone whose middle class by projecting that
[14:01.360 --> 14:07.280]  means white people further socialism and wealth transfer or you're a racist
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.720]  meanwhile all the big rich people like Bloomberg and the rest of them they're
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.120]  going to be exempt the ultimate form of inequality the ultimate form of
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.640]  discrimination but the public hasn't been taught about real forms of
[14:18.640 --> 14:26.640]  discrimination and in any inequality all they know is white is bad white is
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.720]  evil white must be eradicated prove your good don't be white don't marry
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.160]  somebody white if you're white because that's racist doesn't matter if you're
[14:35.160 --> 14:40.000]  attracted to white people that's bad show yourself as good and so whites
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.120]  everywhere are engaged in in suicide and my issue is if you love somebody care
[14:45.120 --> 14:47.680]  about them that's your issue I don't have a problem with it the point is if
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.600]  it's force-fed like trying to teach five-year-olds how to be gay this is an
[14:52.600 --> 14:57.640]  agenda and it doesn't matter how many times whites run up the white flag it
[14:57.640 --> 15:01.720]  doesn't matter how many times we commit suicide culturally and it's never good
[15:01.720 --> 15:07.080]  enough because the globalist want everyone homogenized and no culture
[15:07.080 --> 15:11.880]  there's no black culture in this country their CIA created hip-hop gangster
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.960]  culture declassified on record to destroy those people look at the great
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.560]  society of lbj and what it did to blacks from less than 10% illegitimacy to 90
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.200]  plus percent this isn't my opinion that Margaret Sanger said all this 90 years
[15:28.200 --> 15:34.880]  ago it isn't my opinion lbj said all this my crew just searched lbj talking
[15:34.880 --> 15:40.640]  about co-co-opting the n-words you can pull up all his letters to members of
[15:40.640 --> 15:44.200]  the House and Senate you can pull up the National Archive letters of Margaret
[15:44.200 --> 15:47.960]  Sanger and they've done it there's a reason the Rockefellers and Rothschilds
[15:47.960 --> 15:51.920]  are in charge there's a reason court forward and Carnegie endowments are in
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.480]  charge because they're ruthless folks and so you're going to lose your guns
[15:56.480 --> 16:00.200]  you're going to lose your private property and while we're all busy
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.040]  fighting with each other over what color we are all this is happening the
[16:05.040 --> 16:12.720]  globalists are destroying every future dream we have across the board and
[16:12.720 --> 16:16.520]  you've got Obama openly acting as a dictator and the Republican leadership
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.960]  doing nothing about it you've got Europe being completely overrun with
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.880]  immigrants who were then turned into political groups I've had members of
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.280]  parliament on from England where most the social workers are foreigners
[16:28.280 --> 16:34.000]  literally taking the UK children I mean this is a plan these are like foreign
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.840]  mercenaries and I'm not demonizing immigrants individually the globalist
[16:38.840 --> 16:46.680]  cu is like a German soldier a Hessian mercenary brought here in 1776 on big
[16:46.680 --> 16:52.080]  ships to wage war on the colonies you are a political cultural weapon and
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.920]  hey when the minorities were really the majority of most area and then the
[16:56.920 --> 17:00.440]  whites are on average a completely aging group I mean whites will be like 20
[17:00.440 --> 17:04.040]  percent of the population 30 years and it won't matter they will always be the
[17:04.040 --> 17:09.040]  enemy they will always be attacked because that's how they're going to
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.680]  organize the majority that's quote minority to then follow all the tyranny
[17:13.680 --> 17:17.000]  and live in squalor and have no freedom is because it doesn't matter they'll
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.760]  always be a white pinata to slap around and attack and urinate on so that's
[17:22.760 --> 17:28.960]  where all this is going that's the attempt and it is it's all happening you
[17:28.960 --> 17:32.560]  notice the globalist were doing everything right now because they know
[17:32.560 --> 17:38.120]  that the entire population is waking up to Obamacare being a scam and waking up
[17:38.120 --> 17:41.960]  to the Federal Reserve being private and they know the number show quote
[17:41.960 --> 17:45.480]  minorities are beginning to wake up to things are becoming more libertarian if
[17:45.480 --> 17:49.880]  that continues other 10 20 years they could lose we could actually educate
[17:49.880 --> 17:56.040]  all these folks we can educate all the whites about the left-right paradigm but
[17:56.040 --> 18:01.840]  we don't have that time and so the globalist are racing right now to get
[18:01.840 --> 18:07.640]  their agenda through and I'm just gonna say this calmly imagine any other
[18:07.640 --> 18:12.200]  nation that had conservatively 25 million illegals probably 30 plus they
[18:12.200 --> 18:16.680]  always say 11 to 14 the last eight times they tried to pass this same bill they
[18:16.680 --> 18:22.960]  did it under Bush what five times they've done it under Obama three or four
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.640]  times maybe it's nine times this is the ninth try is it and I want you to think
[18:27.640 --> 18:37.040]  about that because the country is already collapsing economically and if you
[18:37.040 --> 18:41.200]  legalize all these illegals and in the last bill we saw let them then bring
[18:41.200 --> 18:47.760]  their families in we're talking about another 30 million in just a decade and
[18:47.760 --> 18:53.160]  and then it's expected food stamps welfare don't wear American flags on
[18:53.160 --> 18:56.680]  your shirt that's hurtful at the San Francisco school even Hispanic kids
[18:56.680 --> 19:00.440]  can't wear American flags I mean this is all that we're taught we're being
[19:00.440 --> 19:05.240]  overwritten we're being totally conquered and not by Mexico that's totally
[19:05.240 --> 19:10.960]  collapsed into hellhole squalor the worst in Latin America but by the globalist
[19:10.960 --> 19:19.600]  just simply using the the ghost of some type of la reconquista as the cultural
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.200]  football game again people get into football games that don't matter it's
[19:24.200 --> 19:29.560]  the same thing here when that's not even what's happening it is America being
[19:29.560 --> 19:36.480]  turned into the Makila Doris it's America being turned into a giant service
[19:36.480 --> 19:46.880]  land collapsing wage cesspool with hyperinflation with total 24-7 race
[19:46.880 --> 19:50.640]  spading by the Democrats where they're running some multi-racial Cheerios ad
[19:50.640 --> 19:54.160]  and they said the conservatives will hate this because there's black people I
[19:54.160 --> 20:00.880]  mean just constant manipulation these people are the party of the client for

[24:20.440 --> 24:24.600]  doubled just five months into obama care it's set to quadruple
[24:24.600 --> 24:29.240]  by 2014 it cuts the quality of care
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.440]  but it doesn't matter on average though i've got the polls right here i'm going
[24:32.440 --> 24:35.720]  to be going over them the average quote minority
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.240]  who's an immigrant or has become a citizen even recently
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.440]  80 plus percent vote for socialism for communism
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.600]  or literally taking my guns taking your guns
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.280]  and i'm sorry people on average that come from china people that come from
[24:52.280 --> 24:55.320]  mexico people that come from eastern europe
[24:55.320 --> 24:57.960]  folks that come from all over they're not used to owning guns and they're used
[24:57.960 --> 25:00.920]  to government telling them what to do
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.120]  and man a government's going to give them some free welfare and stuff
[25:04.120 --> 25:08.520]  and and and and msnbc tells them the white americans hate you
[25:08.520 --> 25:13.080]  show them get their guns and they go the government's my friend are and i'm
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.560]  with the big government now i'm going to vote to take everything you got
[25:17.560 --> 25:21.960]  i'm going to vote for higher taxes on you and then it's a bunch of offshore
[25:21.960 --> 25:26.120]  criminal banks publicly militarizing the police
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.680]  setting up martial law making the presidency a dictatorship
[25:30.680 --> 25:35.080]  and using outside groups to come in and get free everything
[25:35.080 --> 25:39.160]  and vote to take our guns our children everything the democrats are going to
[25:39.160 --> 25:42.600]  bring in a national draft too we're going to serve them as
[25:42.600 --> 25:47.160]  military slaves we're going to supply our kids to the empire now
[25:47.160 --> 25:50.600]  i mean this is a sick system folks where you can bring people in
[25:50.600 --> 25:55.880]  to vote to make people slaves that's why we have a bill of rights so that people
[25:55.880 --> 25:59.640]  can't vote democracy a pure democracy is two wolves and
[25:59.640 --> 26:04.520]  a sheep voting on what's for dinner if there were two wolves and a sheep
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.200]  one was named bob one was ralph and one was tom
[26:08.200 --> 26:11.880]  okay and tom is the sheep the other two guys
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.120]  the wolves vote and and the sheep says well i'd like to eat some grass and the
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.520]  wolves say you know what we're going to veto that there's two of us
[26:20.520 --> 26:26.360]  muttons on the list here lamb chops
[26:26.680 --> 26:33.080]  lamb chops and we're like hey it's democracy don't be racist sheep
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.200]  against the wolves
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.480]  and this is how the globalists have always operated when the democrats
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.400]  were the majority in the Ku Klux Klan they
[26:45.400 --> 26:49.640]  ran their political systems to oppress whites by saying well at least we protect
[26:49.640 --> 26:52.440]  you from the blacks and then when the whites didn't put up with that they
[26:52.440 --> 26:54.680]  said okay we'll be the racial politics now
[26:54.680 --> 26:58.120]  with the minorities and it's just it's just sick and by the way
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.960]  all those folks on msnbc know exactly what they're doing
[27:01.960 --> 27:04.680]  just like george soros knew what he was doing when he was a teenager
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.120]  running around collaborating ferreting out hidden jews
[27:08.120 --> 27:11.720]  but he's a liberal and gets awards from the jewish groups
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.200]  because if you are a nazi collaborator you're good if you fight a modern fascist
[27:16.200 --> 27:20.520]  takeover you're bad and you've just got to learn this folks
[27:20.520 --> 27:24.600]  you've got to learn how the mafia government works
[27:24.600 --> 27:29.240]  so uh truth is self-evident that's why i was going to come on air today
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.720]  and say the republicans are committing suicide
[27:33.720 --> 27:38.760]  and this is a public execution of the republic and look at all the other
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.640]  stuff that accompanies this what message does it send
[27:43.640 --> 27:47.080]  if you tell tens of millions of illegals here
[27:47.080 --> 27:51.160]  that are already legal they do a few show deportations
[27:51.160 --> 27:55.320]  that are already here illegal what does it do if you say you're legal even if
[27:55.320 --> 28:00.120]  you're a felon you come in and pledge you won't be a felon anymore
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.920]  kind of like john corsi but if you or if you're deaf and walking away from the
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.040]  police they'll kill you that's okay but you know if you're illegal
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.320]  aliens committing felonies that's all right aggravated felons
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.160]  rapists arsonist you name it they get to be legal too read the legislation
[28:15.160 --> 28:18.680]  what's going to happen with 700 million latin americans because that's the
[28:18.680 --> 28:22.520]  group that can get here the easiest what's going to happen with 700 million
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.200]  latin americans hear that well you you already see a
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.280]  record influx of the illegals pouring in and man
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.960]  you know i'm tired of reading in the back of the paper
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.280]  where people are getting mugged and carjacked and killed and on the ranches
[28:38.280 --> 28:42.520]  i know three different people that have been deer hunting the last two years
[28:42.520 --> 28:46.680]  in south texas we're talking 50 100 miles away from the border
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.720]  who have been mugged in the dark walking to their deer stands or attacked at gun
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.400]  point even though they have a gun into their stand and robbed and pistol whipped
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.840]  by illegals i have an article today where university
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.400]  i'm going to cover this is not going to allow
[29:03.400 --> 29:07.880]  when they have crime alerts they're not going to say what color the person is
[29:07.880 --> 29:10.680]  because most of the people in this particular city
[29:10.680 --> 29:13.560]  that are seen mugging and attacking and then they announce
[29:13.560 --> 29:17.400]  the police announced be on the lookout through the university alert system for
[29:17.400 --> 29:21.400]  a black male red jacket you know driving a yellow
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.160]  truck no you can say a man driving a yellow truck
[29:25.160 --> 29:29.720]  there it is you students want crime alerts to avoid using racial descriptions
[29:29.720 --> 29:33.240]  hey the media already does that unless it's a
[29:33.240 --> 29:38.360]  what devil white and folks you know i've never been one of these white this white
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.600]  hat but they're they're forcing it literally
[29:42.600 --> 29:46.520]  literally if you're white you're the devil unless you're john banner
[29:46.520 --> 29:49.560]  and then you're fine we'll be right back stay with us

[33:22.920 --> 33:36.440]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[33:46.280 --> 33:48.600]  all right let me get to a couple clips here and then i'm going to give the
[33:48.600 --> 33:51.160]  number out and i want to talk about immigration
[33:51.160 --> 33:54.440]  i mean i want to talk about 30 million americans going down to mexico and
[33:54.440 --> 33:57.880]  getting given free health care have their babies for free
[33:57.880 --> 34:01.800]  and and and then say that mexico belongs to the united states
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.120]  i want to discuss that i want to ask why american hospitality has been
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.240]  distorted to this point and then we'll hear the argument well
[34:09.240 --> 34:14.440]  from texas to california belong to mexico well yeah and uh california
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.600]  belonged to the russians at one time before that uh and they're not claiming
[34:18.600 --> 34:22.520]  it and texas belong to
[34:22.520 --> 34:26.040]  three other countries before mexico even had it
[34:26.040 --> 34:34.040]  spain trance i mean it just goes on and on and on and on and on
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.400]  the truth is mexico couldn't take over the southwest
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.400]  from the comanche that's the reality of what happened and so they brought in
[34:43.400 --> 34:47.720]  the tennessee settlers to have a war
[34:47.720 --> 34:52.920]  and and and again i i was on both sides of that
[34:52.920 --> 34:56.600]  it's not like the movies sit there and tell you there were battles between the
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.520]  native americans and the settlers in illinois
[35:00.520 --> 35:05.000]  and down into tennessee and all across uh the nation if you go back to the
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.640]  1820s and 30s where tens of thousands would die a week
[35:09.640 --> 35:15.000]  where you'd have a hundred thousand natives come down
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.600]  led by uh they were all intermarried and stuff
[35:18.600 --> 35:22.600]  they called them at the time half breeds i said that because the leader of one
[35:22.600 --> 35:26.760]  of the groups i forget his name was like a six foot five
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.720]  huge uh half breed guy and um they would just wipe out whole cities
[35:33.720 --> 35:36.760]  and so that's the type of stuff that went on and so i don't blame mexico for
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.160]  not being able to conquer the southwest mexico just said all right you guys
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.800]  just wiped out everybody in the uh midwest come on down here
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.560]  and so that's basically what happened and of course all the natives weren't
[35:49.560 --> 35:53.400]  killed even though i had some family uh who was in the
[35:53.400 --> 35:56.840]  trail of tears a lot of them just intermarried and that's
[35:56.840 --> 36:00.920]  basically why most people in texas if they're originally from texas have
[36:00.920 --> 36:03.480]  native american blood in them because most people just ended up
[36:03.480 --> 36:07.880]  intermarrying uh it was the warlike tribes though that
[36:07.880 --> 36:12.120]  that got annihilated like the comanche and the apache
[36:12.120 --> 36:15.400]  uh and folks like that because they wouldn't give up which which i'm not
[36:15.400 --> 36:18.280]  knocking i mean a lot of people are my ancestors
[36:18.280 --> 36:21.400]  the whole point is is that this is the nature
[36:21.400 --> 36:26.600]  of cultural collisions and the globalist
[36:26.600 --> 36:30.840]  are manipulating that right now so just get real everybody
[36:30.840 --> 36:35.560]  about what's really happening what's really going on here uh now again if we
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.400]  had 30 million illegals here who were libertarians
[36:39.400 --> 36:43.240]  and who didn't take welfare we didn't have a socialist globalist government
[36:43.240 --> 36:47.240]  and they were pro-gun uh quite frankly we need 30 million people
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.880]  we've aborted 55 million blacks hispanics whites
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.120]  we've aborted the people that were already here uh and so quite frankly
[36:56.120 --> 36:59.320]  you've got to have 2.1 adults for every uh
[36:59.320 --> 37:03.320]  2.1 birth for every uh family for every man and woman or you do not have
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.480]  replacement rate and society then starts collapsing
[37:07.480 --> 37:11.240]  social security can't be paid for you name it the problem is
[37:11.240 --> 37:15.080]  they're not even bringing the illegals in to ever pay for that they plan to
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.320]  bankrupt everybody and just convert us to a collapsed third world nation
[37:19.320 --> 37:24.600]  like brazil or like paraguay and before a lot of you want us to be
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.680]  latin america uh i suggest you go to latin american
[37:28.680 --> 37:32.760]  cities if you like to see sir at sewage running down the road
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.120]  and uh naked babies running around the streets and disease and death
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.520]  i mean it's scary it's sad it's bad
[37:40.520 --> 37:44.360]  and we're not building up those nations we are deindustrializing them
[37:44.360 --> 37:47.560]  while they build industrial zones and pay people a dollar an hour if they're
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.480]  lucky so make no mistake just like obama care
[37:51.480 --> 37:55.960]  that minorities and polls are wildly still in support of
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.560]  this is a screw job for everybody the globalists are for it just like they
[37:59.560 --> 38:02.840]  were for the iraq war just like they're for backing al-qaeda in
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.920]  syria just everything they're for is bad just
[38:06.920 --> 38:12.120]  just like they're for naftan gatton all these new tpp deals and the rest of it
[38:12.120 --> 38:16.440]  what the globalists stand for is bad period
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.960]  the total free number to join us to talk about the north american union
[38:19.960 --> 38:22.920]  and really the end of america if they pass this
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.720]  they've already been issuing for years this north american id uh and it'll be
[38:27.720 --> 38:30.920]  selectively enforced you you won't have any rights in mexico but
[38:30.920 --> 38:33.800]  they'll have all the rights in the world up here you won't have any rights in
[38:33.800 --> 38:36.360]  canada it's it's only the us that's going to be
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.560]  overrun and uh i want to get your take on this 800
[38:41.560 --> 38:50.680]  259 92 31 800 259 9231 and msnbc and cnn tell the majority minorities over
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.120]  and over again well you're going to win when you
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.000]  get the guns when you take the guns you're going to win when we
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.240]  bring in the socialism you're going to win
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.160]  when you get to bring in your families oh yeah you're going to win all right
[39:03.160 --> 39:06.680]  you're going to have nowhere to run because america
[39:06.680 --> 39:11.080]  is going to look just like any other third world country in eastern europe
[39:11.080 --> 39:15.880]  or in the poorer areas of asia i mean we're done and the globalists will live
[39:15.880 --> 39:19.160]  in their walled off central city areas and their rural
[39:19.160 --> 39:23.240]  you know controlled zones with police everywhere and then all the rest of us
[39:23.240 --> 39:26.120]  are going to live in abject poverty
[39:26.120 --> 39:29.480]  we tell you americans are already working two three jobs eating bad food i mean i
[39:29.480 --> 39:32.520]  drove down to the university of texas area yesterday because i tried to
[39:32.520 --> 39:35.640]  bypass some traffic without doing some paperwork
[39:35.640 --> 39:39.880]  and got stuck in traffic for an hour killing about five miles
[39:39.880 --> 39:44.840]  and i got to look at the people of america and let me tell you people aren't
[39:44.840 --> 39:48.120]  looking too hot people aren't looking too healthy
[39:48.120 --> 39:51.640]  they're not looking too smart either and i don't care they're a black white
[39:51.640 --> 39:54.680]  Hispanic people who have been run over like they've been putting a microwave
[39:54.680 --> 39:57.400]  oven like they've been drinking toxic waste or something
[39:57.400 --> 40:00.520]  and let me tell you they have been
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.200]  and let me tell something about the population out there something
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.440]  they need to know as well the globalists with the singularity and the
[40:08.440 --> 40:13.000]  population reduction el norte is not going to be some
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.000]  hispanic palace and some hispanic kingdom 25 30 years from now
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.160]  the globalists do plan to release bio weapons and reduce population
[40:21.160 --> 40:24.120]  they do plan and bring in martial law and world government
[40:24.120 --> 40:28.520]  and all of us are under attack all of us are being scientifically targeted
[40:28.520 --> 40:31.240]  all of us are having poison fluoride put in our water
[40:31.240 --> 40:37.800]  all of us are having obama care written by offshore ruthless crime syndicates
[40:37.800 --> 40:44.040]  literally hammering us all of us are under new world order conditioning
[40:44.040 --> 40:47.800]  and it doesn't matter because even if we're all under attack
[40:47.800 --> 40:51.320]  even if the reality says it's all part of a globalist game
[40:51.320 --> 40:54.760]  for people put into racial politics and tribal politics
[40:54.760 --> 40:58.280]  which has been real since the beginning of our species
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.520]  we are primitively designed and hardwired to be tribal
[41:02.520 --> 41:06.040]  and because we're not tribal about private property because we're not tribal
[41:06.040 --> 41:09.240]  about sticking up for the underdog because we're not tribal about standing
[41:09.240 --> 41:12.120]  up for the family because we're not tribal about keeping control of
[41:12.120 --> 41:15.080]  government because we're not tribal about buying local
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.000]  because we're not tribal about common sense and being territorial
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.920]  because we don't stick together as humans against the globalist
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.320]  we're going to lose they're going to win
[41:28.520 --> 41:30.920]  and i didn't finish telling this story i'm going to tell this story and then
[41:30.920 --> 41:33.720]  give the number out i'll take i'll give the number out now it's 800
[41:33.720 --> 41:42.200]  25 at 9 9231 800 259 9231 first time callers i've
[41:42.200 --> 41:49.480]  done that in a few weeks first time callers by the way 800 259 9231
[41:49.480 --> 41:52.680]  but let me tell you how we're all under attack one of my good friends
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.800]  daughters basically collapsed about a week and a half ago
[41:57.800 --> 42:03.320]  and they took her to del children's medical center
[42:03.320 --> 42:06.200]  and they went in there
[42:06.200 --> 42:12.760]  and the place was packed with small children
[42:12.760 --> 42:17.640]  and the nurses and doctors told them yes we've never seen something like this
[42:17.640 --> 42:21.960]  we're seeing hundreds of children a week that are hundreds they're even talking
[42:21.960 --> 42:25.960]  about building emergency tents outside they've done that before for the fake
[42:25.960 --> 42:30.280]  flu deal who are coming down with type 1 diabetes and they go well
[42:30.280 --> 42:36.360]  it's genetic but being sick triggers it and
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.920]  whatever virus is going around the hospitals are all full of two and
[42:40.920 --> 42:43.560]  three year olds
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.560]  and when he was telling me this i had a little click and i didn't say it and
[42:51.560 --> 42:55.000]  they said to me he goes you know i think it's the virus that is doing it
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.360]  if they say that it's genetic and nobody in my family or my wife's family he was
[42:58.360 --> 43:01.720]  saying has ever had type 1 diabetes why is it an epidemic
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.160]  i don't buy that and he goes i think it's the virus
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.920]  well the doctors said the virus triggered it but they've been told in
[43:08.920 --> 43:12.600]  policy to not tell people that it's viral
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.800]  pancreatitis so i called my dad who's a smart guy
[43:17.800 --> 43:20.520]  and an oral surgeon and a doctor but also a chemist
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.120]  a dentist and i said dad isn't there some kind of
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.960]  disease and it's temporary usually in the pancreas caused by viruses
[43:29.960 --> 43:33.160]  just like you can get the mumps in the face and have your face swell up
[43:33.160 --> 43:36.840]  because you know i knew this knowledge but you you forget the details he goes
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.360]  yeah that's viral pancreatitis there's hundreds of types of it
[43:40.360 --> 43:44.840]  hundreds of known viral strains most of the time
[43:44.840 --> 43:48.120]  the pancreas comes back in a few weeks to a few months
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.360]  especially if they give them some of the right treatments and the right diet
[43:52.360 --> 43:55.960]  but they don't let any of the doctors say that because
[43:55.960 --> 43:59.640]  big pharma makes too much money off of the
[43:59.640 --> 44:05.080]  diabetes medications and i went thank you so i went online checked it
[44:05.080 --> 44:09.640]  called him back and i said it's viral pancreatitis that could be what it is
[44:09.640 --> 44:13.640]  well undoubtedly it's viral pancreatitis the kids get a virus
[44:13.640 --> 44:17.400]  then suddenly their their their pancreas stops working
[44:17.400 --> 44:22.600]  that's like saying you're you're susceptible to the bubonic plague
[44:22.600 --> 44:26.040]  genetically so one person dies the other doesn't
[44:26.040 --> 44:29.480]  it doesn't matter it's still the bubonic plague bacteria
[44:29.480 --> 44:34.680]  that's killing you just like some people are more susceptible to smallpox
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.200]  than others it doesn't matter if you're genetically not as resistant to it
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.200]  still it's the smallpox that's making you sick
[44:42.200 --> 44:45.480]  that's why they say everything's genetic now so they could ignore the real
[44:45.480 --> 44:49.000]  cause of it sure there are some people you can shoot
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.360]  three or four times in the chest and genetically their heart's so strong
[44:52.360 --> 44:55.800]  it'll coagulate and the muscles so tough it'll keep
[44:55.800 --> 44:59.160]  keep going for a while you might even live other people you shoot them once in
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.120]  the heart they'll die that matter it's the bullets going into your heart that
[45:02.120 --> 45:04.760]  kills you this is how screwed up medicine's gotten where
[45:04.760 --> 45:08.120]  they're saying everything's genetic well of course it's genetic
[45:08.120 --> 45:11.000]  but when you've got a doubling tripling quadrupling
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.520]  four thousand percent increase uh in in in type one type two diabetes depending
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.840]  on which one you look at in hispanics a doubling in whites a tripling in blacks
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.200]  you don't hear any of the black or hispanic grids talking about why are
[45:24.200 --> 45:28.520]  the hispanics all getting diabetes and getting their arms and legs cut off
[45:28.520 --> 45:32.920]  because they are more genetically predisposed to get viral pancreatitis i
[45:32.920 --> 45:35.480]  looked it up
[45:36.200 --> 45:39.880]  and they can't handle as much sugar genetically as well that's true again
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.840]  processed sugar the point is it doesn't matter
[45:44.840 --> 45:48.920]  no one's telling them hey don't they tell hispanics drink diet drinks this is on
[45:48.920 --> 45:51.960]  the news of course we knew 20 years ago that aspartame
[45:51.960 --> 45:55.880]  triggers diabetes it's now admitted it destroys your pancreas and makes you fat
[45:55.880 --> 45:58.600]  and makes you crave food that was in the news again last week
[45:58.600 --> 46:02.200]  we knew that with medical doctor russell blalock here
[46:02.200 --> 46:08.280]  they are giving people drink you see you see oh but the hispanics on average
[46:08.280 --> 46:11.720]  think they're winning la rica on quista going to get the gringo's guns going to
[46:11.720 --> 46:15.320]  run the government going to make the gringo the slave
[46:15.320 --> 46:18.040]  that's what they're putting mean oh really how are you going to do that when
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.520]  both your legs are chopped off and your hands are chopped off and you're dead
[46:22.520 --> 46:25.880]  see when i drive by the bus stop and see 10 hispanics with their legs all cut
[46:25.880 --> 46:28.760]  off i see that all the time now see i want to pull over and warn them because
[46:28.760 --> 46:32.760]  i'm a racist white person just like i want to warn them that the
[46:32.760 --> 46:38.280]  Gardasil shot that they're forcibly giving all girls in mexico will destroy
[46:38.280 --> 46:43.640]  their uterus and their ovaries it targets the ovaries on
[46:43.640 --> 46:47.320]  record about half of them will end up being sterile
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.480]  and they'll end up dying of complications from all the different

[49:02.840 --> 49:06.120]  switch to that takes into account the obama care

[50:04.680 --> 50:08.280]  that's nothing compared to brian christie and judy who have kids
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.840]  they're going to pay twice that for grand this was the best option we could
[50:12.840 --> 50:18.600]  find copays are up to where it used to be your primary care dr copay of 20 bucks

[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.560]  it's going to be great you're not looking forward to that
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.840]  no i said alex what it's going to be is like the study that came up about the
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.360]  robot since we're going to already we've i think we've got at least 60 million
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.280]  illegal already because again every little town that i know of in this state
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.360]  alone look how far we are from mexico is infested it's got to be 60 million
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.480]  now within that 30 years that latest report are they claiming what the
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.600]  robots are going to be 70 percent of the jobs
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.800]  that's going to be the apocalypse right there well all i know is this
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.800]  you go out in the countryside and the average uh white or black person
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.720]  is in a trailer watching watching satellite tv all day eating
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.920]  walmart food with cancer and literally don't know what planet they're on
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.400]  and then you've got the illegals running around uh actually doing a lot of work
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.200]  and building stuff in the country but they've taken over
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.120]  in the cities it's a lot of crime and stuff but my whole deal is then the
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.640]  immigrants have kids and then they turn into the same zombies
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.080]  uh and then uh the the problem is the immigrants
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.560]  vote for the democrats who take the guns i mean i mean i'll be quite i mean
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.040]  this country is just just disease ridden i i i across the board

[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.960]  and uh this is the new world order this is what they do

[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.760]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.040]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.000]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.880]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.280]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.280]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.680]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.560]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.720]  work but you legalize 30 million illegals that sends the message come on up
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.240]  here all the rest of you then you look at the voting demographics of the
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.560]  illegals and i've got those numbers here it's unbelievable

[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.760]  officers warn amnesty would overload the system that's the point
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.360]  senators assesses said we should not cater to the whims of ceo's
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:41.320]  now these global of ceo's look at their short term
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.480]  extremely short term
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.800]  bottom line and the overall globalist agenda they don't they're like grass
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.000]  operas that come eat a crop and fly off like locus to the next
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.600]  they're not looking at the continuity of the political system
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.680]  i mean if population means wealth you would think india would be doing well
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.480]  with a population as big as china's 1.3 billion they've now met china
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:12.040]  no it is the culture of liberty if resources meant wealth you would think
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:16.120]  africa would be wealthy more resources than the other continent in the world
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.560]  mexico has roughly three times the raw resources
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.920]  that the united states has it's an absolute pigpen
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:28.520]  absolute hell pit very beautiful country very nice people in many areas still
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.520]  never had a real revolution never had a culture of promoting liberty
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.120]  again doesn't mean america was perfect but we had private property
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.080]  for the general public
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.440]  what do you think happens to the little poor farmers in mexico they've all been
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.640]  driven off their land except in chiapas because they finally got some guns
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.720]  and started shooting people to try to take their land
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.240]  and they have huge military invasions all the time i've interviewed filmmakers
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.920]  that have been down there very valiant people
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.680]  and you know just showing the incredible tyranny they live under
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.360]  and you know i'd rather empower mexico and build mexico up
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.240]  and 1776 mexico and then i wouldn't have an issue merging with mexico
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.880]  but it's like we have north korea meets freddy kruger meets
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:24.920]  raging bull meets a bad acid trip in mexico what is it like 75 000 killed
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.720]  the last six years now that we know of in the fake drug war and i mean the
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:35.000]  police openly shake people down i've been shaken down by them
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.920]  and my family won't go to mexico now and i won't go and my parents have been
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.600]  there probably a hundred times my parents would go down all over
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.440]  southern mexico both sides of it three four times a
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.920]  year i've been taking other countless times in my life
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.800]  and my parents last few times they went down there it was so scary even and
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:58.600]  traditionally safer areas that they will not go
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:03.640]  and we're told we got to let unlimited people from this country come here
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:06.520]  and do whatever they want let me cover this article
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.520]  and then i'll go to your phone calls sessions warren's house gop immigration
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.680]  bill is bad politics bad policy he then goes over studies in this weekly
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.520]  standard article the show it drives down wages you know
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.120]  how's it do that with a uh with a minimum wage going up
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.960]  the illegals that work in a black market folks and as soon as you legalize
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.040]  the illegals more will come fill up the black market
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.680]  understand that
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.880]  continuing gop crafts plan to wreck the country lose voters and i don't usually
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.320]  agree with inculter but this is the big story linked up on drudge and
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.560]  it's very accurate a house republicans prepare to sell the country on immigration
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.920]  this week phyllis schlafly has produced a stunning report
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.640]  let's get phyllis schlafly on about this now immigration is changing the country
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.720]  the report is still embargoed but someone slipped me a copy and
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.720]  it's too important to wait leave aside the harm cheap labor
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.440]  being doubled the country does the millions of unemployed americans
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.040]  what does it mean for the republican party citing surveys for the pew research
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.240]  center the pew hispanic center gallup nbc news
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.560]  harris poling the annenberg policy center latino decisions the center for
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.640]  immigration studies in the hudson institute
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.480]  chapley's report overwhelmingly demonstrates that merely continuing
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.680]  our current immigration policy spells doom for the republican party
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.120]  and that means guns and private property in the family that's why they're now
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.560]  announcing your kids don't belong to you we're going to forcibly inoculate
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.360]  we're going to teach five-year-olds how to masturbate in school because they've
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.320]  got us folks just like with the violence policy center
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.400]  in 2000 the front page of the austin paper said we don't care if alex caught
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.520]  bribery at the capital and derails this bill this time
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.120]  we've got your kids and we've got the demographics
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.240]  we're going to ban guns in america the head of that group
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.920]  said they were so mad literally they had three bills about to pass
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.200]  i was there with jews a preservation of firearms
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.560]  um jerry peterson when he was a state senator
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.080]  all of them and they go alex get out here with your camera when i was waiting
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.320]  to speak for like two hours they're about to ban the shooting clubs for
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.560]  kids you know ymca all of it
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.520]  ban the you know the gun shows and i ran out and there was the local
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.440]  democratic operative paying out like five hundred dollars a piece to each one
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.360]  of these guys they had black guys that got them said we're black thugs and
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.360]  we're dangerous gangmangers and you better ban guns the people like us
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.080]  will get you using race again like here's
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.200]  the scary black people ban guns i mean it was so insane
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.000]  and i caught that on tape there was a house as this committee they didn't
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.240]  indict the head of the committee and people
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.360]  involved but uh they uh sent him a letter censuring him
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.880]  and they credited that with shooting down the bills that was the turning point
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.440]  and they and they were in the paper and that was 15 years ago 14 years ago
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:06.280]  and they said we don't care jones time is on our side like rolling stone says
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.760]  and it's sick i mean again
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.560]  mexico doesn't let any immigrants in and when water mollins dig across
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.920]  six months to a year hard labor in a slave camp
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.320]  new york times i think the headline was
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:31.000]  mexico's own dark immigration history or or or mexico's own dark pass with
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.680]  immigrants or something you can pull it up it's like yeah we're not good either
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.400]  in america we should have them borders but they're bad too
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:42.520]  they're they we're bad compared to mexico
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.120]  do you know what they do to the stupid party goers that go down there and drink
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.640]  and drive you get a year in jail they run a credit score
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.160]  they run a background on your family and if you're worth millions of dollars it
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.760]  costs millions to get your kid up if you're worth hundreds of thousands it'll
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:01.080]  cost you 40 000 but it's like oh well that's mexico
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.520]  that's okay god help us and of course
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.280]  it doesn't matter if you don't want to go to mexico because mexico's come up here
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.240]  and most of the mexicos i talked to that don't businesses and stuff
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.800]  they're actually like oh no no no don't open the border no you're right it's
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.400]  going to collapse oh i i couldn't even have a restaurant in the bar i know
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.920]  this mexican guy former boxer really nice guy he's like 70 years old
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.360]  he's a really nice fellow gentlemanly fellow real smart guy and he comes over
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.160]  when i go to his restaurant every once in a while he's also got a bar there
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.280]  and i'll drink a beer or something he's like how about how the mexican mafia
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.720]  would shake him down and how great america is well just get ready for it
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.080]  folks because that's where it is all these mexicans that ran up here to be
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.840]  away from the crime it's like running from chicago or something
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.200]  let's go to your phone calls but there's just some of the numbers
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.920]  right there uh where where she breaks down
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.520]  or in all these big polls and studies they break down
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:01.320]  that the illegals 80 plus percent of the time
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:06.280]  vote to take all the guns immigrants all immigrants have always been the
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.560]  bulwark of democratic party for one thing recent arrivals tend to be poor and
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.520]  they need government assistance also they're coming from societies
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.120]  we're far more left-wing than our own history shows that rather than
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.400]  fleeing those policies they bring their cultures with them
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.160]  yeah it's like it's like mainly white californians have moved to austin
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.440]  after collapsing their state they don't know why they couldn't get a job there
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.880]  they don't know why they can only get a job here and live better
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.200]  they think it's heaven but then they want to get rid of families ban guns
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:39.560]  ban cars in the city harass everyone i mean it's just you can't help them
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.440]  this is not a secret for the last centuries there's never been a period
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.480]  when a majority of immigrants weren't democrats
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.360]  that the current accelerated red immigration 1.1 million new immigrants
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.680]  every year that's just current it's legal republicans will be a french
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.280]  party in about a decade this is all major studies they know this
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.200]  thanks to the endless polling we have a pretty good idea of what
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.360]  most immigrants believe according to harris poll 81%
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.400]  of native-born citizens think that schools should teach students
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.880]  be proud of being american only 50% of naturalized u.s citizens think so
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.440]  as they're taught to hate america now all 67% of native-born americans believe
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.360]  the constitution is a higher legal authority
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.240]  international law only 37% of naturalized citizens agree
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.800]  no wonder they vote 2-1 democrat the two largest immigrant groups
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.760]  Hispanics and Asians have little in common economically
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.360]  culturally or historically but they overwhelmingly support big government
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:39.080]  obama care affirmative action and gun control yep gonna kill some babies gonna
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.880]  take your guns according to 2012 national
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.480]  asian-american survey as well as the kaiser foundation poll
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.520]  only 40% of the general public holds a favorable
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.640]  opinion on obama care 42% unfavorable meanwhile 51% of asians have a
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:00.040]  favorable opinion of obama care 18% an unfavorable one
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.040]  that means 82% are for it even koreans support
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:12.600]  obama care about 57% to 17 overall 69% of immigrants like obama care
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.440]  or in 2010 cooperative congressional election study
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.720]  and then it gets into the guns 80 i mean it's just weird it's over
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.600]  it's over i guess my goal has got to be to i guess
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.840]  i've never tried to make a bunch of money i've tried to just put it into
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.480]  fighting the new world order but maybe i need to try to make money and
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.040]  ride my way into switzerland that's the only place they've not let in

[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.000]  i know they're selling such racial hatred of whites i probably can't go to

[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.160]  hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information i want to tell
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.720]  you about matt redhawk and his team of patriots over at my patriot supply
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.320]  several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.680]  the direction this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell us
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.320]  out for a quick buck deciding to take action
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.360]  a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:24.360]  my patriot supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.880]  they now operate two distribution facilities and employ
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:32.040]  over 50 hardworking american men and women it is rare to find companies who
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.240]  practice what they preach and that's why i stock my
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.840]  pantry with high quality storable foods from my patriot supply

[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:50.360]  food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:56.200]  that's 866-229-0927 do business with someone who shares your values
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.680]  by patriotsupply.com slash alex
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:38.680]  look the west has always been of two minds
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:45.800]  very altruistic very open wanting to empower humanity but also very savage
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:50.200]  and so it is western hospitality and the western idea of lifting people up
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.200]  that has had our borders be so wide open
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.480]  not just here but in the original europe the problem is the globalist
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:05.480]  political class are creating division humans are naturally tribal or racist
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.840]  now if people's tribal idea is liberty and freedom
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.560]  and a shared common goal for human empowerment
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:17.560]  then we could be a multiracial cultural system
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.480]  but the democrats and the socialists in europe are cheating
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.920]  they claim with one hand they want this empowerment when they actually want
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.360]  people controlled by the state and then fighting with each other
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.840]  and that's why we should deport most the illegals
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.960]  we should treat the immigrants a third the way
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.800]  mexico treats them and if that happened
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.720]  people would pull their hair out so hey don't worry those of you out there that
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:47.080]  think overrunning the country with people from all of the world
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:54.040]  uh you know uh could be stopped only if we reach into the minds of the people
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.320]  and get them to understand the globalist program but the globalists want to
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.520]  bankrupt everyone anyways so you have to be dependent on government
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.360]  regardless you've got to either have a total shift in
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.440]  awakening or humanity as we know it is done
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.040]  but the third world itself is being targeted and abused and destroyed by the
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:15.400]  globalist mexico has been destroyed by naft and get
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.760]  they're forcing those poor people off their land at gunpoint
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.040]  for 30 years and forcing them up to mexico city
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.000]  to live in conditions worse than the movie soylent green
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.440]  my heart goes out to those people my heart goes out to the 11 year olds by
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.200]  law in mexico totally unconstitutional even under their law
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.880]  giving them the deadly Gardasil shot that was killing people nine years ago in
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.200]  trials and again i'll say this where is mecha
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:48.120]  where is the la raza the race the clan where are all these groups

[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.240]  just like the black leaders are a bunch of pimps over their people
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.800]  and just like the white republican leaders using race politics themselves
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:03.080]  are selling everybody out with open borders right now because they're all
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:08.040]  globalist pawns let's go to ryan then we'll go to dax

[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.240]  when a group of us here locally we've actually got something called the os
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.440]  movement you know like the wizard of os who's
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.080]  really behind the curtain that's a great idea
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.360]  sprinkling literature you know up to everybody
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:53.320]  of you know to just get them to look the right way to quit looking towards
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.320]  lord obama who's really behind the curtain
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.680]  and uh we for example we go up to like some of the hell places around here and
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.400]  we'll put like a little pamphlet there that has info war life on it
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.800]  and it rots them to real good quality products and and maybe that way that
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.240]  provides a little opening for them and by the way i want to plug your super
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.240]  male vitality it works and it works
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:21.160]  very well so if anybody had any doubt about that don't have any
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.720]  it's a wonderful tool in the info wars well listen i used it for four months
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.680]  before the formulation before we even put it out and
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.920]  dr group says boast to me privately that this is
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:36.920]  the most powerful raw liquid herbs not from dry
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.360]  in a special proprietary system of concentrating and out
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.840]  uh so i would say use it responsibly uh believe me
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.040]  believe me uh it it's the real deal and uh it's available in info wars life
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.120]  com thanks for the plug what's your point on the immigration
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.720]  um well actually it's about the north american union
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.480]  for first of all for anybody out there who really honestly believes that
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:06.520]  obama or any of them really honestly care about the average person
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.120]  what i was looking for was he going to fulfill his promise
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.600]  to overturn nafta you can go to youtube you can put in obama and nafta and you
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.560]  can see him promising he was going to overturn it then when he
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.880]  becomes president it's never mentioned again
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:23.240]  overturning nafta would have been a great first step in bringing jobs back
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:28.280]  to our country again he didn't do that and my question is
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.640]  this isn't more regards to we used to be talking about something called the
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.280]  amaro yes and and i'm wondering is the

[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:10.040]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.280]  the world guess what else is in the halogen
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.400]  family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.920]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.120]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:29.960]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.480]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:26.920]  okay responding to last caller's question and trying to hurry on to your other
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:31.560]  calls it's very very simple what's going on
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:35.240]  there's different competing globalist programs
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:40.840]  of economics and they're profiting and consolidating power through all of them
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.920]  you have the imf of the world bank on the top of the planet along with the xm bank
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:49.160]  and the organization of economic cooperative development the oecd
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.720]  that sets global standardization we're already in a corporate global government
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.720]  they're phasing out cash they're trying to get national and regional and state
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.960]  laws passed worldwide through continent continuity of
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.160]  government and continuity of agenda
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:13.400]  to not let people be free and independent and local
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.560]  and to phase out cash and to phase out barter
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.400]  and when you hear about the amaro that was proposed in money magazine
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.280]  back in the 80s 1989 and it's been promoted on cnn and things
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:30.920]  we would then talk about the amaro the planned north american currency
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.200]  and they would say oh you're a conspiracy theorist well we weren't saying
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.280]  even then that the amaro would end up being adopted
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.640]  the point is it was one of the competing ideas
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:47.240]  of regional currencies before a global currency
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:51.640]  but that was discussed in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.560]  and then lewdobbs picked it up in the last decade and things
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.760]  we're already under global currency with this
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:04.600]  special drawing rights derivatives credit default swaps
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:10.600]  and scores of other synthetic financial instruments that are simply
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:17.720]  fancy accepted establishment counterfeit if you
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.120]  go back to the bank of england 300 years ago they would have
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:29.720]  10 pounds of paper money out there for every pound
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:34.280]  of actual british sterling silver in their vault
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:40.440]  and so that became the global standard in fractional reserve banking
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:45.640]  that countries would not allow their banks both government or private
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.520]  to loan out more than 10 times the paper for what they had actual metal
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.280]  that's where checks started going back into
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.440]  egypt going back into rome you would have a piece of paper with the
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.080]  signet of the lord or the caesar saying this is
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:09.160]  redeemable for 500 cows now let us rent your
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.400]  20 ships or whatever to take this grain to
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:19.400]  alexandria hypothetical so it's a system pass barter
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.280]  and then the Rothschilds 500 years ago in germany they began to get really good
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:30.120]  at having gold pawn shops everywhere and then doing a form of payoff of local
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.000]  lords of letting them bring them gold and stuff
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.280]  but checking out 10 times or more actual
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.560]  Rothschild paper than what was actually in the bank
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.920]  and then not making them ever pay it back so it was a form of buying off
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.400]  government form of bribery and then you'd have runs
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.360]  on banks where people would try to bring their paper back
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:54.920]  and there wouldn't be enough gold or silver in there to redeem it
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.720]  but it wouldn't matter because the local lord
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:01.640]  had already been given massive amounts of wealth
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:07.080]  from the fiat system and so he would station his guards
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:11.640]  sometimes it would be brigade level thousands of troops
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:16.600]  outside of the palaces of the banker and outside of his regional
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:24.680]  pawn shops and that's what we see today but they want to transcend completely
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:28.200]  the fractional reserve banking so in the last 30 years
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.000]  worldwide they've they've stopped doing that which let them take over
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.120]  and they've gone to just pure counterfeit derivatives and other systems
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.800]  now out of the crisis that's created they want global cashless society
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:48.680]  backed up with 100 trillion every few years of carbon taxes toben taxes
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:53.480]  money transfer taxes wellhead taxes on all human activity
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:59.880]  paid to them to enshrine value in it they're also debating whether it'll be
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.480]  partially gold backed it's going to be a spectrum
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:07.480]  this is what it's going to be because i've covered debos i follow their writings
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.760]  it's going to be a spectrum of commodities they can manipulate
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:15.480]  oil sweet crude gold silver palladium
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:21.320]  you name it the whole spectrum and then a spectrum of carbon and a spectrum of
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.760]  other other indexes they can play a manipulate as well
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.040]  and then everyone will be tied into this global digital
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:32.760]  anoptagon control system and they'll tax you for every transfer
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.920]  again as the toben tax for every credit under the wellhead tax
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.160]  global regional local it'll because computers can divide it all out
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.000]  so everyone will get behind it at the government level
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.360]  getting their little cut of vat sales taxes
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.800]  it is going to be unbelievable and it's going to transfer
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:55.640]  the wealth to the select corporations that write the laws that will be
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.080]  partially or fully exempt from the taxation aggregate
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.400]  model
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:10.680]  it is the total form of slavery total form of total
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:16.600]  unfair weights and balances inequality there are not really words to describe
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.880]  the magnitude of the global plan so they're going to bypass the north
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:24.520]  american union currency entirely they have a north american travel
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.080]  id i don't know was it five six seven years old
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:30.760]  that people that get signed on to this can travel to canada mexico or the us
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:33.880]  back and forth you'll have regional flavors you'll still

[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:55.240]  15 different regional sports illustrators magazines you can get or
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:00.360]  video subscriptions it's the same deal but it's all sports
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.040]  illustrated so everybody's looking for a chip in the arm
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:08.200]  it'll be your face scan you buy and sell with everyone's looking for
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.320]  uh you know some big brother thing it's already you're already carrying in
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.640]  around and paying 500 300 bucks 200 bucks for a smart phone
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.160]  so it's already here we're already in it it's already going on
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.040]  it's already happening
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:26.200]  you know i told you they'd use this big drone roll out to have a free count
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.840]  about drones then then they would ban citizens
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:33.160]  having remote control airplanes or helicopters and now as a gimmick
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:39.080]  they were delivering beer and ice to ice fisherman
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:44.200]  you know flying flying the beer at at at 100 feet
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.840]  or even lower the video i saw looked like 50 feet
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:51.000]  out to ice fisherman totally legal there's no fa regulation
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.080]  above below 300 feet but they're now imposing it shutting it down
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.760]  and that article is up on info wars dot com with steve watson
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.000]  uh with the video right now beer drone
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.320]  viral prompts slapped down from government
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.280]  company owner finds himself on f a a blacklist see
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.800]  he got ice fisherman out there
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:20.840]  and and i mean i mean look that drone is it like 15 feet totally safe
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:26.920]  bringing a 12 pack of brew with a camera and uh it's a total gimmick
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.040]  just to have a viral video and then the and then the uh blonde comes in to the
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.440]  guys and you know they're all having a great time
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.160]  and they're ice fishing and she drinks a beer and then the government comes and
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:40.920]  slaps it down just like the girl that was baking cupcakes at home and selling
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.600]  and she ended up in the paper so they send basically militarized zoning people
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.240]  there saying you've got to own a bakery you can't do this
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.520]  the idea is you can't have a garden in your backyard and sell fruit now
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.760]  you can't have chickens in areas where you could have chickens
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:57.720]  this is agenda 21 the opposite of sustainability
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.280]  and i told you somebody will try to deliver stuff with the drone they're
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.800]  going to ban it government shuts down 11 year old cupcake business
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:08.120]  but the nfl is tax exempt
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.400]  when they make billions a year i mean well of course they're part of the
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:17.000]  mafia and they put obama in the nfl intro and they say guns
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.440]  are bad they say obama cares good and they're a big
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.520]  gladiatorial diversion there are new culture so of course they're exempt
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:29.960]  google microsoft apple general electric the top fortune 100 are
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.120]  almost completely tax exempt learn the facts jack
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.760]  and they're the ones lobbying for higher taxes on the middle class
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.120]  they're the ones lobbying for open borders g they're the ones lobbying for
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.800]  obama care do you think everything they do is to screw
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:49.320]  everybody but oh now be nice to the immigrants they're so sweet
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.560]  legalize and we already legalize more than any other country
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:57.000]  and as soon as they get here they're indoctrinated to hate america to hate
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.680]  guns to hate the family
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:04.360]  and to love garter cell and to love aspartame
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:08.600]  let's go ahead and talk to dax in utah so i hope i answered the guy's question
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:11.480]  dax in utah you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.760]  hey alex how you doing i'm all right brother thanks for calling
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:19.400]  yeah um i want i just wanted to basically make a comment um
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:22.360]  the basically everything you said about the the illegals there's
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.480]  there's way more than 12 million illegal aliens in the united states there's
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.320]  easily 35 to 40 million but they never want to come out
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.080]  it was confirmed to be 31 million like a decade ago
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.720]  well yeah and i'm here in utah and we're i mean we're just overloaded with them
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.320]  i mean you go out you go at any place and you i hear more people
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.280]  speak in spanish than english i mean look there's nothing but
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.280]  spanish signs everywhere and and my whole issue is again i don't
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.400]  even i shouldn't have to qualify this it's the fact
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:54.600]  that they're literally being turned into democratic party operatives
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.920]  and voting to literally make me their slave and i mean it's incredible
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:02.040]  i mean where in history can they bring in foreigners
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:06.040]  to then use a voting system to enslave everyone
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.240]  they're you know they're the republicans i'm never gonna get
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.200]  they'll never they'll probably never be another republican president
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.120]  because you know there all these red states are gonna turn blue
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.520]  and they'll they'll they'll vote him in another comment i have is um
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:25.400]  uh it's been several years ago i went they had a big rally down in salt lake
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.000]  there was there was a lead easily over 100 000 illegals
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.720]  protest and down there for their um for their citizenship and it was kind of
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.560]  funny uh i listen to you every day on the radio and you had uh
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:42.200]  they had the the mayor of uh of salt lake the rocky anerson
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.560]  yeah he had him on the radio with him and he
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.040]  he was one of the main guys leading the group he
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:53.160]  was 100 in support of it he he led the entire group of 100 000 down
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.480]  uh main street there and you know i was down there protesting against it
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.720]  i just couldn't believe that a current mayor of the city
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:07.560]  would be down there in support of over over easily well i mean i don't think
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.200]  he's a bad guy a lot of people actually believe this is a good thing
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.760]  the problem is is that they use it as a political tool
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.920]  it is a form of subterfuge it is a form of subversion
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:25.080]  and the entire power structure is behind it so it's easy for people to get
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.080]  behind it uh because that's the plan and i'm telling you
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:32.920]  folks they will ban the guns they will jack the taxes up to 90
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.840]  percent just like france this is the plan good to hear from you sir
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.600]  let's talk to derrick in ohio derrick you're on the air
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:47.080]  yes hola muchas gracias hello thank you elix yeah i wanted to share that my
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:50.680]  wife and i have experienced living um and traveling
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.800]  down in south america latin america specifically in
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.960]  argentina paraguay bolivia and a little bit of time in peru
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.680]  and we're volunteering on organic farms and staying with friends and local
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.680]  people and my comment also has to tie in with
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:11.160]  thought with your egg with the topic of the exit plan leaving the country
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:15.240]  that you're talking about on tuesday and what we found was that
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:19.560]  by by running from running from our fears
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:24.440]  they they always have a way of finding you and what we we found a lot of good
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:27.400]  experiences down there we learned a lot
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.560]  and but ultimately what we were running from
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:34.840]  it's already there's a lot of it already in place don't know exactly
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:37.880]  that's what i always try to explain to people the whole world is under this
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:43.400]  corrupt system um yeah from from i mean brought
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.200]  you know you travel on the bottom and we've traveled coast to coast from
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.400]  peru to Buenos aries back we've traveled across
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:52.760]  paraguay through the the grand chaco into bolivia
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.600]  and back across seeing just the corruption bribery
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:03.400]  through the way of life um with police uh it's normal down there for
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.760]  there's no the police in the military they look the same
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.080]  and but they didn't have the attitude the agressiveness i guess
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:15.240]  we're seeing here um but it was very common to see
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.600]  you know military police through the cities you know with rifles outside of
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.440]  banks um everything was was you know peaceful
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  but all the people were used to it down there and that's it i mean for people
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  that don't know america looks like a third world
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.120]  country now in every way the militarized police all of it
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:37.400]  this is what it is to be slaves you have on santo our friends in argentina who
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.520]  a small family they're describing the same things they have a
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.720]  their own little dairy farm just for them and just selling to their friends in
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.120]  the the town the town there outside Buenos aries and
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.240]  they described to us about how many how many farmers and people out in the
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:57.080]  country the camposinos were getting kicked off their land and
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:03.960]  these giants monopolistic agro business of soy genetically modified soy that
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.480]  you know of course is shipped up to europe and the united states and you know
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:11.560]  that's it these global corporations are destroying the cultures down there
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.840]  and so that's why you can't blame these people trying to get up here
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:17.560]  my issue is it doesn't matter because once they get here
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:23.080]  they're being turned into globalist uh and and and so it's a total war and
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.600]  it's just horrible listen i was down in down there 30 years ago
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.680]  i was about 10 years old i appreciate your call brother and we were in cancun
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.920]  and cancun was very small then and my dad was reading the brochures in english
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:38.600]  and spanish that said you can buy land in mexico
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.520]  and he's always like well you if you're not a mexican citizen you can never buy
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.480]  land he said this is strange so he went and talked to the company
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:49.080]  we drove out south of there looked at these uh
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.160]  you know plots of land or ocean front and they said well this is you in land
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.000]  and we made the net you know the natives have been moved off of this
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.240]  they've been there for thousands of years my dad went and did research and
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.080]  found out a decade before under u n they had had huge gun battles down there
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.320]  with the mayans and forced them off their property all over southern mexico
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.080]  i might have said well that's immoral i'm not gonna buy land down here and then
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.920]  you pay to have a beach house put on it and now we've been down there it's all
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.800]  built up and beautiful and there's all these westerners living down there
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.320]  uh but literally wealthy and middle class people
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.640]  moved down there not even knowing the mexicans had already been kicked off
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:32.040]  their land decades before and uh now they won't even let the mexicans
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.040]  fish in places like uh
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.000]  oh what's that island i've been to so many times off the coast there
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.560]  no it's it's off southern mexico that's off yucatan it's uh it'll it'll pop my
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.680]  head in a minute causamo and others uh and i didn't let them fish there now
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.000]  but but the big trawlers can it's all agenda 21
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.760]  and uh it's it's just no one has a lobby
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.960]  the people don't have a lobby it's like we paid 22 billion
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.040]  to move general motors uh to
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:11.160]  china i mean it's it's all over the top outrageous uh we're gonna go to bright

[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.040]  this way we have a very vicious criminal political system
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:57.320]  taking over our country politically in the world
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:00.280]  and they're using poor desperate immigrants worldwide whether it's
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.640]  australia europe the united states to come in as a
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:09.240]  political army and to form the new enforcer class police military
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:12.680]  you name it and that's how the globalist are engaged in a revolution
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.320]  against freedom the answer to this is to try to wake the
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.520]  immigrants that are here up because historically you know they vote
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.280]  anti-freedom uh and at the same time uh to try to
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:26.680]  block as many of them as we can and it just comes down to that i mean
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.800]  look we should want skilled workers not unskilled
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:34.360]  there's none of these countries take unskilled only america to a great extent
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  and look at switzerland they only take extremely skilled
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.840]  and look at how well switzerland's doing i mean people aren't going to want to
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.400]  come here because we're becoming a third world country
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:50.280]  we're really pooping in the pool here folks i mean that's what's going on

[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:59.640]  uh brother you know i'm looking i reread some of the cable leaks
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:06.360]  covering the n a u and tell you what folks need to wake up um as you know

[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:13.960]  and i look at just the collaboration on both sides of the aisle

[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:23.000]  and the last thing on my mind sir is i'm a gun enthusiast
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.080]  smith and lessen in ruger had been driven out of california due to the
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.760]  micro stamping mandate i wanted to get your thoughts on that
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.840]  because there's no proof first off that micro stamping
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:39.960]  cuts down on crime and secondly i see it as really a backdoor mechanism
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:44.200]  to drive out gun sales in california further so if i could get your thoughts on
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.760]  that lastly i do want to plug that coffee it's wonderful and please keep up the
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.160]  fight brother god bless you i appreciate your call
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:56.360]  yeah yeah no we covered that that was like in roiders uh two days ago that uh
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:59.160]  smith and lessen ruger they're leaving california they're not going to sell
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:03.720]  there because they they want to make you micro stamp with the hammer
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:06.440]  the firing pin
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.040]  tell like then tell what gun you know it came from as if thieves won't just
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:13.560]  file that off and then they can make guns that don't have any legal and
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:16.760]  taxes on the ammunition they want to ban guns except for
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.880]  themselves who all have armed bodyguards the politicians
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:23.160]  of course criminals want to take our guns we got to just call it like it is
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:27.640]  americans have been so reasonable so nice that we will put up with anything
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.560]  that nobody else does and we are a laughing stock across the
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:34.840]  world there's the headline smith and lessen to end
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:39.320]  most california sales due to micro stamping resolution
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:44.760]  regulation and now they're trying to shut down the last
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:49.880]  lead smelter in the country you can hardly mine gold or silver here
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.480]  because there's so many regulations and some regulations were reasonable but
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:56.760]  now it's meant to shut things down i mean they're telling cold power plants you
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:00.120]  can't have water vapor and carbon dioxide come out they've listed carbon
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:03.160]  dioxide as toxic waste meanwhile in china there's
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:05.960]  nothing in the smokestack just everything comes out
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:09.720]  it blows around the atmosphere to us they can build three new plants a week
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:12.760]  we're shutting down more than three plants a week
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.480]  this is the shutdown of society and it's just total economic tyranny
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:20.040]  where the politicians are run by foreign interest
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:23.960]  who can instantly double and triple their profits by shutting us down
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:28.120]  because they own the competition sectors it's really elementary
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.920]  just like they can go in and say nobody in this whole area
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:36.440]  can farm on your land anymore in mexico now where's the deed to your property
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.800]  well i've been here for 50 generations we don't know

[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.160]  uh some of the news that i haven't gotten to yet
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:08.760]  here as quickly quickly as we can let's just hit this first because i mentioned
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:12.360]  it but i haven't played it yet uh this is a waserman schultz who's always
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:15.160]  saying tyrannical things democrat from florida
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.680]  says the president is going to have to use his executive authority
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:22.840]  so more dictatorship talk here it is there are urgent
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.560]  challenges that we had that have facing and the president is going to use his
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.160]  executive authority and i agreed that he should use his executive authority
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:33.080]  because look at that the republicans can take you to try to be obstructionist
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.320]  then we've got to make progress i'm sorry that's
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:40.360]  my buddy scottie one time uh when he was in high school
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.960]  rode his bike across the football field during halftime
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:47.560]  and he'll never forget somebody standing up in east texas where you don't call it
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.120]  mcdonald what you call it mcdonald mcdonald
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:56.280]  and they said lay that idiot down there i actually said something else but
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.040]  that's that's one of our favorite sayings around here but uh
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.880]  i mean that woman looks like an absolute moron you know you've got to
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:07.960]  remember that most these democrats are just gutter sludge
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:11.240]  and that you know they they're like well we gotta ban clips because
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:14.920]  you throw the clip or the magazine away every time you shoot it and that'll
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:18.360]  ban the clip soon there'll be no more clips left
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:25.320]  boo and you and you know glom might flip if we put more bases on it it might
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:28.040]  capsize
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.400]  i mean that's who the globalist one in power is absolute
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:38.680]  sniveling morons and you know i'm sorry but when you look in somebody's eyes you
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.000]  can tell that wasserman schultz probably has about a 75
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.400]  iq but she still has the cunning a cunning of a highwayman
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:54.440]  so look out boys and girls wasserman schultz is coming to get you
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:57.720]  here's some other news here at a market watch
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.120]  gold settles higher volatile after fed decision emerging market fears boost
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:06.040]  gold's investment appeal and again the private
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:09.480]  run-for-profit federal reserve has announced they're going to be
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.240]  trimming monthly 10 billion dollars of the unlimited trillions they've been
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.520]  giving themselves markets and emerging currencies
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:21.160]  recover after u.s growth data growth is down and the
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:25.800]  announcement again to trim the program by 10 billion dollars
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:30.280]  the 65 billion per month that they give us select groups
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:34.200]  so that's just some of the news on that front
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.960]  clapper the guy that committed a felony perjury before congress
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:41.960]  saying the nsa doesn't spawn americans calls for snowden and accomplices
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:48.120]  to return nsa documents that's that's a that's a funny one
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.840]  that is a really really really really funny funny little joke
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:56.920]  out of a hair clapper uh and then continuing here
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.920]  uh vulnerable democrats distance themselves from
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:06.120]  obama after state of the union speech well i mean why are they why are they
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:10.520]  distancing themselves i guess this is out of time magazine
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.760]  i mean everything's great i mean i mean isn't open borders popular even though
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:17.640]  it's not i mean isn't obamacare popular even though it isn't
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:21.160]  isn't banning guns popular even though it isn't i mean
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.280]  they're a paper tiger but the republican leadership
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:27.640]  is bought and paid for by the same traitorous
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:32.360]  larcenist interest and that's why they're doing it
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:37.160]  unbelievable that this is all unfolding and happening
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:40.520]  and what we need to see is more of what congressman randy weber said
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:44.360]  saying obama is the common dot in chief of prison america
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:52.440]  and is a lying socialist dictator yes yes yes i like randy weber please try to
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:55.880]  get him on this constituent's calling tell him get on the
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:00.120]  show right now unbelievable here's another one republican
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:04.600]  skeptical of obama enacting agenda alone but saying the Reichstag is
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:09.320]  skeptical of the new furor acting alone
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.520]  meanwhile attorney general eric holder cannot explain constitutional
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.640]  basis for obama's executive order attorney general holder
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:19.480]  couldn't explain the basis of it
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:22.280]  he said i'll be honest to you on television i have not seen i don't
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:26.040]  remember looking at her having seen the analysis in some time so i'm not
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:28.920]  sure where along the spectrum that would come from
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:34.760]  perfect just i know i know nothing i know nothing
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:38.280]  nothing now they won't even debate it they'll just
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:42.280]  say i don't know well it's an imperial
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.280]  presidency and i mean all ted cruz does is tell it like it is
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.840]  and the media acts like it's a oh my gosh he said amnesty push will ruin hopes
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:53.880]  of retaking the senate for republicans
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:57.320]  but how dare you say that well of course it will
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:00.280]  they're giving them driver's license everywhere
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:03.480]  i'll never forget an ap article like seven years ago
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:07.880]  the headline was something like bank heads make it easier for immigrants to
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:10.680]  get houses and they said well we know you don't
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.960]  really have ideas so we're going to give you mortgages and
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:18.840]  stuff without any proof meanwhile folks i've gotten near perfect credit
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.160]  and to get a house i have to almost get a proctology exam
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:26.680]  that's what you know my dad had a little company
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:32.280]  a little holding company but he gave me 18 years ago when i started up 17 years
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.320]  ago when i started my online shopping cart when i had my first film america
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:38.040]  started by design to try to fund my operation
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:41.320]  he helped me set up the computer and upset the online deal and you know helped
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:43.800]  me out and he said here you can have this bank
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:46.440]  account it's got like a thousand dollars and i haven't used it in years
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.000]  it's a bank of america bank account and so i went and put money in that sort of
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.680]  using that and you know since i've gotten rid of
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:57.320]  it obviously
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.080]  but i went in there
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:05.640]  to do something with it years ago i think it was deposit or open another
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:08.680]  account or something and i had like three forms of id it wasn't enough i had
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:11.960]  to get interrogated it was all i was watching illegals

[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:31.320]  we i don't look being a citizen and playing by the rules
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:36.040]  means you're a schmuck in this country ladies and gentlemen

[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:59.480]  you want to talk about the north american union that we're well into go
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:02.680]  ahead hi how are you today alex all right thanks
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.360]  for calling good i just want to touch some
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:09.640]  issues that you've been talking about during today not only the north american
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.120]  union um i am an immigrant and i am a citizen
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:17.880]  and i just want to let you know don't get this courage there is a lot of his
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:21.640]  panics and other immigrants that are trying to fight for our country and that
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.640]  are trying to do the right thing and are waking up and we're organizing
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:29.320]  we're trying to reach to our council man's we're trying to reach to our
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:33.000]  representatives we're we're trying to listen i know i know because i mean not
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.680]  just american citizens that are hispanic but i run into immigrants you name it a
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.160]  huge amount of listeners here in austin uh in fact i'd say the majority of people
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:43.800]  that come up to me that are listeners and really care what's going on
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:48.440]  are hispanic folks the problem is the democratic party gets them immediately
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.720]  and begins the socialist indoctrination in the schools
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:57.080]  so that's my only point is the whole power structure wants unlimited
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:00.040]  immigration to the country what do you think about that
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:03.720]  i i agree with what you're saying and we're trying to intervene we're trying to
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.320]  wake people up we're trying to unionize we're trying to organize
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:11.320]  it's very hard however and i and it's one of the issues that i want to bring up
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:14.920]  and ask you suggestions because for example where i'm here in
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:19.240]  pennsylvania white locations whenever they try to see you they're trying to
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:22.840]  um have this prejudice and this preconceived ideas
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.000]  and they think that you cannot be hand-on-hand with them trying to fight for
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.160]  our country so when you find these organizations and you're trying to
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:35.160]  enrol with them and trying to um be active and
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:40.120]  advocate and be a political activist they they put certain roadblocks for you
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.000]  not to join them just because you're from another race
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.680]  or just because they have this prejudice just because we're immigrants
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.680]  so what we're just a just we can do in terms of that so we can fight for it
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.280]  sure i mean it's very simple just because there's people that don't like
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:57.400]  immigrants because they're immigrants i mean over in england you hear a lot of
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:00.120]  talk about all the slobs that are moving in
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.600]  um i mean what who do you expect to come in and and and replace the fact that
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.520]  brits don't have kids anymore so i don't just like hispanics i don't just
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:11.240]  like slobs anybody it's what's going on in their
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:15.640]  brains so you've got to say hey that's a minority of white people that don't
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:18.360]  like hispanics and i know that for a fact
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:22.840]  i don't care if you're white hispanic who you are we can't have unlimited if
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:26.200]  they put them on welfare the country is going bankrupt
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:29.960]  and they are voting overwhelmingly democratically
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:35.160]  and we will lose our guns so regardless there's racist on both sides
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:38.760]  that's not the issue the issue is the power structure that's bad
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:42.920]  once the open borders and we cannot have that god bless you good to hear that
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:47.400]  you're listening to broadcast uh let's talk to um
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:52.440]  kevin in canada then we'll go to atemo i think's the name and lorraine and
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:56.280]  morgan go ahead you're on the air alex let me give you a little bit of our
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:01.640]  canadian passion ten tours ten tours and you have
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:06.440]  people there standing and clapping they should have been sitting in their seats
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.920]  looking at each other awkwardly speechless
[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:14.280]  i almost see the american society totally
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:18.520]  degenerating to the point where no military in history's made a soldier
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:21.880]  fight ten years that that that is the most abusive
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:26.040]  evil world war two it was one maybe two of you re-opped
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:31.400]  otty murphy tried to re-op and they said no i mean unbelievable
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:35.480]  that they would have people serve ten tours that that is that is so abusive
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.840]  go ahead in the nineteen hundreds your population
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:44.120]  was about seventy six million that is now your welfare class
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:47.640]  you your forefathers fought for a republic
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:52.920]  and you folks have squandered it to a holographic democracy
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:56.840]  and and what really sort of struggled me these days
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:02.200]  is that i've been watching you for about 15 years all the way back to weco
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:06.040]  and the amount of information that you've provided me with
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.760]  has literally given me like a ten thousand dollar education at minimum
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:15.640]  but the problem i have is that i'm not the only person hearing this yet nothing's
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:18.120]  changing it's literally getting worse well that's
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:21.080]  because we're in a war the enemy's pushing we're pushing stuff is changing
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:24.360]  it's just not fast enough but briefly how would you describe how
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:31.720]  how evil it is to say it's great to have somebody serve ten tours
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:35.240]  i think that the simplest way to put it alex is
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.760]  you ought to be ashamed of yourselves
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:42.680]  by the way they call it a volunteer military when you sign up
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:46.760]  they have these automatic re-ups and things and it's actually not true
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:50.120]  he probably did volunteer but that is just crazy that is crazy
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:53.960]  we're on the march the empire's on the run

[02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:41.080]  folks i actually read the article that claud lotson put out and broke walls on
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:46.440]  the air about an hour ago during the break and i am speechless right now
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:51.000]  i had thought that some pro constitution police chief have been fired
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.920]  under federal directives and thought that was bad enough i had no idea the tsa
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:57.720]  was involved and that they used it as a secret
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:02.200]  police checkpoint because we know they're data mining the
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:06.600]  nsa databases now with the tsa and they're going to use it as internal
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.320]  checkpoints but this article i'm going to cover
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:13.080]  after jacari jackson leaves us
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:20.520]  it is simply simply amazing i am i am speechless right now we're going to be
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:23.000]  covering that in about 10 minutes and then your calls
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.040]  jacari jackson joins us from east rutherford
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:31.000]  in new jersey across from new york the site of a super distraction
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.880]  super tyranny 48 and there are now investigations going on
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:43.320]  in the congress with two republican senators looking to try to get rid of
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.160]  the nfl's tax exempt status billions a year
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:51.640]  unbelievable uh as the owners some of them make hundreds of millions a year i
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:53.960]  mean look make your money but i'm tired of paying
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:57.240]  billions for the sport stadiums with bond proposals and then you guys are
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:01.480]  tax exempt the minute we start making rich people pay taxes
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:04.280]  you know the really rich people is the minute they'll cut taxes on the middle
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:07.880]  class and the poor people but then they go with
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:12.040]  class warfare just like race warfare and tell poor people hey
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.720]  rich people aren't paying a lot of taxes and they raise it on
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:19.080]  somebody making a quarter million a year that's the type of person that buys
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.640]  stuff and has employees simply amazing and then the economy basically starts
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:27.640]  shutting down so jacari jackson is there in new jersey right in
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:31.240]  front of the dome where they're going to be
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.600]  having this ridiculous event they're at metlife stadium
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:39.320]  and he is there to cover it we're going to have a lot of man on the street
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.320]  interviews on the show tomorrow we're going to have a man on the street
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:46.600]  interviews for the nightly news he's going to be asking him questions like
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:49.960]  the viper teams are here you ready for a proctology exam
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.480]  he's going to ask him kind of mark dicey in type questions of well should we
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.240]  have a proctology exam or should we wear clear plastic clothing
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.760]  since mayor bloomberg wanted folks to wear you know
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:04.360]  clear plastic coats you know just to make sure we're not bad
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:08.840]  absolute slavery going on there so jacari what are your first observations
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:13.240]  and what are some of the things you're planning in the run-up to sunday's game
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:16.600]  well alex we just got here at metlife stadium in new york you can see the
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:20.520]  the stadium behind me and alex when we got here you know i was very surprised
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:23.720]  that we see a bit of a police presence we know the tsa viper teams are going to
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:26.920]  be out here in the area we got some police over here
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:31.880]  to uh just right off the side of me we also have helicopters flying overhead
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:35.160]  and alex we're going to be out here not to cover the super bowl doesn't matter
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:37.880]  if the Broncos win
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:41.160]  or if it's the seahawks it's the things that you lose
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:43.560]  you're going to be losing your fourth amendment if you come out to these games
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.640]  you're going to be patted down you're going to be searched like you said they
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:48.840]  want you to wear a clear plastic clothing here out here in the state
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:52.520]  also you can only bring a clear plastic bag little ziplock baggie for your
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:56.520]  personal effects so what i'm saying jacari is we should like
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:59.960]  seriously goal shouldn't we wear clear plastic clothing then
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:04.120]  and and you know have a cavity search like they now do at the tsa when they
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:06.840]  say yes i'd love to do that alex i'm sure they
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:10.520]  absolutely would love to do that all in the name of keeping you safe
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:14.600]  although the tsa has yet to catch a single terrorist they will do these things
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:18.440]  in the in the guise of keeping you safe even though they can't even do that
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:21.960]  meanwhile mayor bloomberg komo all these other guys they have their bodyguards
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:25.320]  they have their various people with concealed carry but they don't want you
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:28.600]  disarmed slaves to have that same opportunity but alex we're going to be
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:32.200]  out here we're going to be covering the tsa aspects the violation of your fourth
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:35.320]  amendment we're going to see you know if these people know about the real topics
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:37.320]  in the world or the day i only care about football
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:41.720]  we're going to talk about human trafficking and other things that surround these events
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:46.040]  that's right absolutely decadent sonam and gemora type situation with thousands
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:51.000]  of underage prostitutes uh you name it just just just a lot of degradation
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.440]  going on but also the way they've made it political
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:58.760]  where they can be tax exempt but then they try to take tax exemption away from
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:02.200]  pro life groups so a pro life group can't be tax exempt
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:06.600]  but the billionaire nfl owners can be that's right alex and you know these
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:09.560]  these organizations they pride themselves will be in charity workers
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.000]  and you'll see the commercials they go out and you know coach a local football
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.760]  team but what they give to local charities is peanuts compared to what
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:21.000]  they rake in is really a fraction of a fraction when you get down to it
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.120]  well and again they don't let the average company do this or or everybody
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:26.840]  could be a charity and only have one percent like the nfl
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:30.200]  or bill clinton spending half the millions he gets from the Haitian fund
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:33.480]  on his private jets i mean it's disgusting bottom line
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.800]  don't give to big charities unless it's uh groups that have proven they're good
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.120]  like the salvation army give to local charities or actually give yourself but
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:45.240]  notice they don't want local charities feeding the homeless they don't want
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:47.960]  little girls baking cupcakes or having lemonade stands
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:52.680]  they only want big corporate events that's exactly right because you see uh
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:55.320]  the same behind me i don't know if you can see from here but you got the big
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:58.520]  Pepsi logos and you got kevin bacon on the loudspeaker over here
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:01.800]  it's definitely a big corporate event but like you said if you want to have
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.160]  lemonade stand if you want to feel uh feed the homeless
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.440]  you know heaven forbid you actually feed a homeless person and bring some good
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:11.960]  to work and good cheer to the world you can't do that alex
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:15.720]  now let's let's war game this out a little bit politically
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:19.400]  i want you to go and find a a a crowd of morons
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  that are attending this and again say hey they only want you to have clear
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:27.000]  bags what about clear clothes and then when they joke about that and
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:31.080]  agree with it say yeah uh and then say but uh you know the
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:34.120]  government people aren't going to be wearing clear clothes oh but i guess
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:37.640]  they're better than us they're not servants they're our owners so they
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:41.240]  don't follow the same thing did you know that the tsa
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:44.680]  lets the al-qaeda connected terrorists listed muslim brotherhood in
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:48.120]  without being groped did you know what's about a takeover you're talking
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:51.080]  about the uh the muslim brotherhood coming through the tsa checkpoints when
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:54.360]  we arrived here just a few minutes ago we asked the guy you know where's the
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:56.520]  tailgate party and he looked at it so crazy he's like
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:00.280]  there is no tailgating at the super bowl i like i like sir you're joking people
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:03.640]  can tailgate out here at the super bowl he said no this is for
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:06.760]  this is for your security we're going to have all these big events you can have
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:08.840]  the big peppy dome behind me or whatever else
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:12.440]  but you can't have people to congregate to celebrate the super bowl
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:15.400]  well they already we're not that we're promoting the super bowl but they don't
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.440]  even want you to enjoy the time you have while you're here well listen you're
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:21.000]  supposed to only look at their big screens like watching tv you're not
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.080]  supposed to have a barbecue or play with the neighbors
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.880]  people might actually think you're supposed to go outside and play card
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.080]  games or play horseshoes they might think you're actually supposed to
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:33.320]  talk to other humans look at how in arizona a few months ago
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:38.040]  they had the anti-terrorism squad and anti gang squad out videotaping everyone
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:41.960]  at the college tailgating games this is what it's about
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:46.280]  congregating is criminal you're only allowed to go through big gates have
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:49.640]  your genitals grubbed and then go in and watch a bunch of steroid heads run
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:53.240]  around uh jacari that's exactly right and you know who knows you know we've
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:56.920]  seen a lot of a lot of the shady things going on in the halftime shows not just
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:00.120]  at the super bowl but at the grammy's and all these other big events
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:03.960]  sometimes tell what's going to happen here uh come sunday when the halftime
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:06.280]  show comes about we've seen madonna we've seen
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:09.880]  beyond say other people as well so we'll see what happens this sunday
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:13.000]  now what is east rutherford look like when you drove from the airport i know
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.440]  you just arrived there minutes ago does it look bombed out like the rest of the
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.680]  east coast no i was surprised to see uh when we came
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:23.400]  down here i didn't see as many big buildings as i thought we would at least
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:26.600]  on this side uh this side of the bridge on the other side of your
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:29.640]  big buildings that you would uh associate with
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:32.520]  new york new jersey the iconic structures but coming down here it
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:35.800]  didn't look too bad but granted we only drove a relative short distance from
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:38.200]  the airport hey look there's a whole squad of morons
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:42.040]  right there go talk to them okay go yeah yeah let's
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:46.200]  take your time there'll be more groups of people okay i want to get up here

[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:57.000]  gentlemen uh but uh we're here covering the news
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.360]  while they're getting up there to talk to some people
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:03.080]  we'll see if they act like a total police state and run up and act like it's
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:06.200]  bizarre for free association be happening let me tell you about this
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:11.400]  article they're setting up the tsa as database centers where most
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:15.080]  people will be allowed through in the future without being groped and stuff
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.040]  but a lot of times you'll be pulled off the side interrogated
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:22.840]  or even disappeared well now there's an article on prisonplanet.com
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:26.680]  and info wars.com chief of police harassed by feds
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:30.520]  fired after signing pledge to uphold constitution
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.040]  and that's a great headline by watson but it's even worse than that
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:37.080]  it's even worse than that
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.400]  they knew who he was off the database thing totally illegal that that they
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:44.680]  admit that tsa is using to know that he was going to
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:50.600]  sheriff max event in los vegas it's extremely main line about
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:54.200]  about sheriffs and police following the bill of rights and constitution
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:59.720]  i mean sheriff mac beat oh beat clinton at the supreme court in the brady law
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:04.760]  this would make the police upstanding and boy they get upset about the police
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:08.120]  standing up and saying we're going to follow the american law
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:12.280]  they call that political and had him fired a police chief was detained and
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:15.160]  you guys pop it anytime if there's something newsworthy happening
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:18.280]  a police chief was detained and harassed by federal agents
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:22.440]  while traveling to a constitutional convention
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:26.040]  before returning home to be told he was fired
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:29.000]  and ordered to disband his police department
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.240]  after signing a pledge to uphold the bill of rights
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:36.040]  and i wouldn't even call it a constitutional convention it was a
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:39.640]  law enforcement like i i i guess it was technically a constitutional convention
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:42.600]  but not in the way you'd think it was a convention on the constitution we
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:45.560]  should flip that because it could be misunderstood
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:50.680]  police chief shane harger of the james springs new mexico police department
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:54.200]  was flying out of albuquerque airport last week on his way to the
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.360]  constitutional sheriffs and peace officers association convention
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:03.400]  taking place in vegas and remember we had that police chief on
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:07.640]  or that sheriff from liberty florida he read the the code it said of the guy's
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.320]  law abiding coming from his home or business with a gun
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:15.160]  he's allowed to have it i'm not charging him and i mean i'm not gonna i'm gonna
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.080]  let him go and they uh they went and had a state
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:21.720]  investigation arrested him and he won in court but
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:25.160]  they're going after police that aren't evil folks
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:28.280]  and we've got to stand with people like this guy
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:31.560]  when they do the right thing i don't have to say oh cops you need to
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.760]  you know act like americans and do all this and then when they don't
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:38.600]  the system goes after them and we don't back them
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:43.480]  before passing security harger was approached by tsa agent
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.600]  who asked the police chief to show his credentials moments later a man claiming
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.200]  to be a federal agent also asked to see harger's credentials before telling him
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:53.480]  he was a person of interest the federal agent then demanded to know
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:57.480]  where harger was traveling to and why when harger told the federal agent he
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:59.480]  was attending constitutional sheriffs and peace
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:02.440]  officers association convention they swear enough for that by the way
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:05.560]  in los vegas he was detained for 35 minutes or for finally being allowed to
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:09.480]  board the plane he was in a database folks then when he got
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:13.720]  back off he was fired on tuesday january 28th the day after his return
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:16.760]  harger was placed on administrative leave and ordered
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:19.480]  to the sand dovetail county new mexico sheriffs
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:24.440]  douglas c wood to disband his entire police department
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:27.800]  due to his political affiliations what was political affiliations while
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:31.080]  attending the convention harger along with 38 other police officers
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:34.040]  signed a declaration affirming their pledge to obey and
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:38.040]  observe the u.s constitution this is like the twilight zone folks
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:40.680]  in addition refusing to carry out any unconstitutional order such as gun
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.080]  confiscation without constitutionally completed
[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:48.920]  warrants violation of the fourth amendment without probable cause
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:51.720]  detainment and incarceration of citizens without probable cause are working
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:54.760]  with any military for domestic law enforcement which is all the
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:59.080]  constitution bill of rights and it just goes on i've never seen anything
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:03.720]  this this is secret police and they federal global agents
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:07.400]  jacari you're out there have we located any of the minions going in to be
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:11.720]  grubbed and uh or do they all run away they they ran away from us alex when
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:14.680]  we were getting closer to the state and we lost our connection so we're back to
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:17.720]  where we uh had a stable connection but yes alex many
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:21.960]  people are wondering how aware they are about the the tyranny that goes on here
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:25.240]  if they're aware that they don't have to sacrifice their rights not even for
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:27.880]  security but just to come out here and watch a football game
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:33.320]  this is the tsa acting as a an interrogation unit you go to fly
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:36.600]  they interrogate you and then get you fired from your job
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:39.880]  going while you're gone and intimidating and lying about you this is what the
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:43.480]  secret service does i know two people in austin who are managers of companies
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:46.760]  who just shot their mouths off saying obama's a traitor not calling for
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:51.480]  violence the secret service went to their company heads in one case
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:55.160]  in new york another case at a car dealership
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:58.280]  and said you better fire them if you know what's good for you
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:02.440]  that's torturous interference outside the courts it's siege and that's how the
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:05.880]  nazis did for five years before they started arresting people they would just
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:09.480]  go get them fired i mean this is just this is like the tea party being
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:12.200]  harassed all of it these people are criminals
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.080]  it's definitely harassment you know when i did the man on the street a few
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:17.640]  weeks ago at the airport you know i asked people you know what's the
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:20.920]  probable cause for you to be searched at the airport and i said well you just
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:23.960]  coming to the airport is probable cause i said you know what if you go to an
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:27.320]  event like the super bowl what's the probable cause just showing up is that
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:29.640]  a reason enough for you to be molested to be
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:32.680]  violated to have your rights violated i don't think so
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:36.840]  meanwhile the government publicly runs the terrorist and thanks for so stupid
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:41.400]  the cfr called for obama to publicly endorse al-qaeda this week
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:44.120]  i mean i can't believe i'm even saying this fact i've got two articles here
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:47.720]  that i haven't covered yet dealing with this here's out of roiders bagdad bombs
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:51.400]  and shootings kill at least 19 when i saw the name of the city i knew it was a
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:54.360]  shiai city and at the bottom i knew what it would say
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:58.520]  an al-qaeda affiliated islamic state of iraq carried out the attacks
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:02.040]  the same group that just took over al-jagya again the same group our
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:07.560]  government is funding in syria and in libya and in
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:12.280]  egypt meanwhile here's israel general says al-qaeda
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:16.760]  syrian fighters set up in turkey and threaten europe of course
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:22.920]  i mean literally literally our government runs al-qaeda and then
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:26.520]  uses the al-qaeda threat to take our rights chicari
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:30.040]  you were talking to the guy yesterday about the transhumanism and he said
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:32.920]  he was talking to one of his colleagues and said why do they keep running the
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:35.720]  same schemes over and over and his colleagues said to him
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:39.320]  because people keep falling for it now why not alex if you get if you run
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:42.040]  al-qaeda this location the movement to that location the movement to that
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:45.720]  location and people keep falling for it why would you change your program
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:49.320]  if you if you can catch the hell mary every every time why would you change
[02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:54.440]  your football play well that's right and but then the tsa
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:58.200]  repeatedly knows i'm coming is waiting smiles at me
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:01.400]  says i better not cause problems or ask for my autograph
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:05.240]  or some guy gets all sexually excited i i just can't handle anymore
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:08.360]  i mean it's literally a license to harass everybody
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:12.280]  and we saw that with uh alex baldwin and his daughter you know his uh five
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:16.120]  month old baby girl was uh randomly selected in
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:19.960]  you know screened at the at the airport and they even knew he wasn't

[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:31.560]  we're probably gonna have sheriff mac on or this particular sheriff
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:35.320]  the particular police chief who had his department shut down
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.720]  because he dared go to an event trying to organize police
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:43.640]  the pro-constitution but most police get sent by the feds to the adl or
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:46.760]  southern prairie law center meetings where they literally badmouth george
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:49.480]  washington and the bill of rights and constitution

[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:06.360]  right i mean i knew they were planning to turn the tsa
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:09.720]  into like secret police checkpoints where they kind of disappear people or
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:13.000]  interrogate them for separate stuff and they have a room full of feds waiting
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.840]  for you to use nsa databases to harass patriots
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:20.920]  but now it's it's officially happening it's pretty scary
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:24.840]  yeah it's pretty bizarre that you know jacari jackson is
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:29.400]  out there you know and they're harassing actual people who are
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:34.600]  us citizens and yet we can't even do anything on the borders of our own
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:39.320]  country you know these people come in and what we're going to reward them with
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:43.560]  actual uh citizenship well by the way it's not even a secret but it's not well
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:47.480]  known illegals fly without ids i've seen her all
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:50.920]  the time he's walking with a piece of paper and mumble at the people and i just
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:53.720]  let him through just like the hospitals because it's all
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.240]  selectively enforced you understand that
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:03.160]  well yeah i'm actually an immigrant and i came to this country from england
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:10.200]  and uh actually became a naturalized u.s citizen um my family actually
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:14.440]  left uh england because of the the tyrannical
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:19.000]  type monarchy that's going on over there right and we come over here
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:22.440]  and now we're kind of looking at the same thing you know obama
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:25.720]  uh and his family are like the new royal family
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:31.000]  and everybody's bowing down to him and it's just ridiculous
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.560]  and um i just want to say that um it it really kind of makes me angry when
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:42.600]  people say you know that oh we shouldn't call them illegal people
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:45.720]  you know you know there's no such thing as an illegal person
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:49.640]  well that's what they call us in other countries it's pure bull it's like
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:53.240]  we've got to be wide open and we got to pay for everything
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:55.560]  and they're going to vote to take your guns now
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:59.240]  hey i mean we're committing suicide we've been so gullible
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:04.120]  so long that that's what this is and it's a complete joke i mean the nsa spying
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:07.560]  the groping telling texas they'd have f-16s
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:12.440]  forced down aircraft if they tried to block the tsa i mean exactly the sky
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:18.200]  is the limit of the level of abuse that they meet out uh against us we're
[02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:21.320]  going to go to break you five minutes to overdrive and talk to

[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:31.960]  sir tommy you're close enough all right
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:34.840]  you're on the air go ahead i want to talk about
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:39.480]  how we don't fully understand the psychology
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:45.000]  of these so-called masters that control us because as far as they're concerned
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:49.640]  we're no longer even human we're property now
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:52.840]  because they've implanted us in a system of
[03:00:52.840 --> 03:00:59.560]  usury through interest and through debt our property is no longer ours
[03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:05.560]  our our houses our children nothing is no longer yours
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:09.480]  because now you're indebted to your master so therefore
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:12.440]  all your energy and all your production
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:16.840]  now belongs to us for what to use for what
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:21.480]  we want to do with it and for our game no you're right they see us as animals
[03:01:21.480 --> 03:01:25.400]  as cattle and that's their public plan but they did it by fraud
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:32.600]  so it's illegitimate exactly i think 90 percent of the problems
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:37.480]  we face right now could be solved by eliminating the concept of
[03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:41.240]  interest no i don't know i absolutely agree
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:44.440]  with you because you know once you have the interest instead of a one-time
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:48.200]  payment for money then it expands out into everything else
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:51.880]  and then everything is based on their fraud they get the world for nothing
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:57.560]  we go into debt to the globalist for nothing they get everything for nothing
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:01.480]  exactly and look at what china is doing over there in the east coast china's
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:05.240]  bought nearly half of manhattan for pennies on the dollar
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:09.080]  america is is is literally a joke and we've got to turn around now call back
[03:02:09.080 --> 03:02:11.800]  some other day you're really well spoken a fine point sir
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:16.280]  thank you so much uh clark go ahead in arizona go ahead
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:20.280]  yeah alex uh i'm down here on the mexican border
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:23.720]  not too far from the saguaro national monument
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:27.400]  and what they've done they have now expanded the monument
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:33.080]  and the blm adjoining lands claiming the whole area south of i8 is now
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:37.400]  national monument yeah i know in 60 miles north they put signs up telling
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:40.840]  americans not to go into it because of the drug smuggling so the border is
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:45.480]  already 60 miles up when you go in there like i do
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:49.720]  yeah i guarantee you one thing those park rangers are going to pull you over
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:52.280]  they're going to run your license they're going to sit there and question you
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:57.480]  for at least an hour and then tell you to get out
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:01.880]  well that's right you're an american slave scum
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:05.320]  but the mexicans are coming across this area like you would not believe it i'm
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:09.720]  talking about the illegal ones we had right smack dab in the middle of the
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:14.840]  drug cartel trail here and we have uh well many are just
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:18.040]  looking for work but there's a lot of them just bringing dope in and what they'll
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:21.400]  do is they'll come into this rv park where i'm at
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:25.480]  in hopes that somebody will call ice or border patrol
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.880]  so i can get a free ride back to mexico i know it's all
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:35.240]  it's all a total joke it's an absolute total joke mexico is a collapsing
[03:03:35.240 --> 03:03:40.280]  country south of us and the answer is let mexico collapse into us what a
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:43.480]  what a great idea well yeah they want to break us under
