[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[00:14.680 --> 00:18.400]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:18.400 --> 00:24.720]  Wow, do we have just over the top important information to cover today?
[00:24.720 --> 00:28.080]  It's Sunday, June 6th, the year is 2021.
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.080]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:29.080 --> 00:32.200]  I'll be here for the next two hours live.
[00:32.200 --> 00:37.600]  Then Sunday live with Owen Schreuer, 6 to 8 p.m. central as well.
[00:37.600 --> 00:38.600]  Okay.
[00:38.600 --> 00:39.600]  Wow.
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.960]  You'll definitely want to click below and share the live link of this feed if you're
[00:44.960 --> 00:53.240]  watching at freeworldnews.tv or band.tv or infowars.com, you'll definitely want to
[00:53.240 --> 00:58.340]  tell locals also wherever you live, you're listening on AM or FM radio or watching local
[00:58.340 --> 00:59.340]  TV.
[00:59.340 --> 01:03.520]  It isn't part of the victory, it's all of the victory because the tree falls in the
[01:03.520 --> 01:05.920]  forest and no one's there to hear it fall.
[01:05.920 --> 01:06.920]  Did it make a sound?
[01:06.920 --> 01:07.920]  Same thing.
[01:07.920 --> 01:15.840]  We have the holy water, we have the crosses, we have the garlic, we have the sunshine that
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.840]  will vaporize these psychic vampires, but we've got to get it out there to the people
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.880]  and that's where you come in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24.880 --> 01:25.880]  Wow.
[01:25.880 --> 01:32.400]  President Trump, I would say, has re-emerged and has put out a string of powerful videos
[01:32.400 --> 01:41.680]  over the weekend, one which is extremely cryptic in that soon we will take control of the White
[01:41.680 --> 01:46.360]  House again sooner than you think, meaning obviously as evidence mounts that there was
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.520]  proven election fraud and as evidence mounts that Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent
[01:51.520 --> 01:58.040]  and as evidence mounts that Fauci, working with Obama and others, launched COVID-19 to
[01:58.040 --> 02:02.400]  try to bring down the U.S. and embarrass President Trump and bring in the great reset that they're
[02:02.400 --> 02:04.360]  going to be removed.
[02:04.360 --> 02:10.880]  So this is an incredible statement by Trump and you add that into China, hit us with this
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.640]  virus and a lot of the President's surrogates, he is the real president, that's just a fact,
[02:16.640 --> 02:21.400]  are now coming out and saying it was obviously released on purpose and this was all done
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.080]  by design and mainstream news now saying we bet the deep state launches a cyber attack,
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.680]  we bet the deep state's behind the cyber attacks, which obviously it is, the deep state's just
[02:31.680 --> 02:35.160]  corporate criminals worldwide, James Bond villains, but for real.
[02:35.160 --> 02:40.080]  As all of this comes out, we are in an insane time.
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.080]  This is an incredibly dangerous time, an incredibly amazing time, a lot of good things are happening,
[02:45.080 --> 02:50.480]  a lot of bad things, everybody better be praying, for awakening, for peace, for justice and
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.120]  for protection of our children particularly and that other eyes be opened, other hearts
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.680]  be opened, other minds be opened and that we reject this evil that's being injected
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.800]  into us by the new world order, all this cultural evil, all the propaganda, the human animal
[03:05.800 --> 03:10.200]  cloning that's now being announced everywhere, I mean they're really making their move in
[03:10.200 --> 03:12.680]  their transhumanist revolution to play God.
[03:12.680 --> 03:18.200]  But first let's get to the big clip, here's Trump cryptically, and it looks like a hotel
[03:18.200 --> 03:23.200]  ballroom releasing several cryptic statements, we'll get to some more of them later but here's
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.200]  the big one.
[03:24.200 --> 03:29.040]  I want to thank everybody for the tremendous support you've shown, we're going to take
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.440]  back the Senate, take back the House, we're going to take back the White House and sooner
[03:33.440 --> 03:39.600]  than you think it's going to be really something special, but the love and the affection and
[03:39.600 --> 03:45.200]  the respect that you've given all of us, it's really important, the Republican Party is
[03:45.200 --> 03:50.880]  stronger than it's ever been and it's going to be a lot stronger than it is right now,
[03:50.880 --> 03:54.440]  we're going to turn it around, we're going to turn it around fast, thank you all very
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.360]  much, that support has been so incredible, thank you.
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.640]  That is a big deal, that is a declaration of war against the deep state that has said,
[04:03.640 --> 04:07.120]  they've said it publicly, if he continues to run the Republican Party and goes around
[04:07.120 --> 04:11.120]  the country getting other good members of the House and Senate in gubernatorial positions
[04:11.120 --> 04:18.080]  and legislative positions, in corporate positions, pushing people to those positions, that they're
[04:18.080 --> 04:24.160]  going to indict his son, him, Giuliani, I guess he didn't have a dog but the dog if
[04:24.160 --> 04:28.800]  he had one, they'll indict a ham sandwich that they're going to go after Trump with
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.080]  those indictments if he doesn't back down, well, he's not backing down, so you've got
[04:34.080 --> 04:37.640]  to admire that, Trump's got his problems, God doesn't have him, like going along with
[04:37.640 --> 04:42.560]  that idiot demon Fauci, but other than that, I mean they don't want him in there and boy,
[04:42.560 --> 04:46.400]  don't you wish we had him now, with what Biden and all these criminals are doing, there is
[04:46.400 --> 04:51.600]  so much to cover, there's also more good news, huge federal court ruling, overturning California's
[04:51.600 --> 05:00.760]  ban on AR-15s, so a lot of good things happening.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.320]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.080]  much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those
[05:09.080 --> 05:14.640]  veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S. history.
[05:14.640 --> 05:19.200]  And now more than ever, what our republic stands for and is stood for is under attack.
[05:19.200 --> 05:22.000]  America is under globalist takeover.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.920]  It's an information war, it is an economic war, but most importantly, it is a spiritual
[05:26.920 --> 05:27.920]  war.
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.160]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.360]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan, we were the first to tell
[05:36.360 --> 05:41.040]  you that vaccine passports were coming, we were the first to lay out basically everything
[05:41.040 --> 05:44.320]  because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about, and that's why it's
[05:44.320 --> 05:46.960]  important to keep influenza wars in the air now more than ever.
[05:46.960 --> 05:50.880]  And before Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double-paid trade
[05:50.880 --> 05:51.880]  points.
[05:51.880 --> 05:55.600]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power and Polyblock.
[05:55.600 --> 05:57.960]  So to all the veterans and all the patrons, we salute you.
[05:57.960 --> 06:05.440]  I don't want to ask the listeners, please support him for wars no more than ever.
[06:05.440 --> 06:07.640]  We've got it.
[06:07.640 --> 06:30.840]  Thank you so much for joining us in the middle of this incredible year that is the year 2021.
[06:30.840 --> 06:32.840]  Wow.
[06:32.840 --> 06:39.520]  The globalists stole the election.
[06:39.520 --> 06:45.720]  They're trying to destroy populace all over the world, but the planet, the universe, humanity
[06:45.720 --> 06:48.200]  is a two-way street.
[06:48.200 --> 06:53.160]  And we are discovering our power and we are fighting back in the intellectual war, the
[06:53.160 --> 06:57.600]  economic war and the spiritual war as well.
[06:57.600 --> 07:02.320]  Thank you so much for joining us again here on the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[07:02.320 --> 07:06.960]  We'll be here for the next two hours ahead of Sunday Live, another two hours of live

[07:45.360 --> 07:47.000]  And Big Tech hopes you don't.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  Okay.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.400]  Let me just tell you what's coming up today.
[07:50.400 --> 07:54.880]  First, Trump has re-emerged and I've been very upset the last four months to see him
[07:54.880 --> 08:00.960]  basically in dry dock, but he's 74 years old and he looks a lot better now and he's lost
[08:00.960 --> 08:02.760]  30 pounds and looks 10 years younger.
[08:02.760 --> 08:08.240]  So maybe he's a little smarter than I am, but he has taken a rest and he is now roared
[08:08.240 --> 08:12.320]  back out with three incredible announcements.
[08:12.320 --> 08:17.680]  One that Republicans will be back in the White House a lot sooner than you think, wow, that's
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.180]  a quote, looking right at the camera, meaning we're going to overturn the fraudulent election.
[08:22.180 --> 08:26.800]  That is just huge, huge, huge, huge.
[08:26.800 --> 08:32.120]  Then he comes out and says, China should have to pay reparations for launching the Wuhan
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.720]  bio weapon attack as the understanding of that now becomes mainstream.
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.720]  And he also says, who the hell's running the White House because Biden isn't.
[08:41.720 --> 08:46.720]  And that dovetails with his statement about we'll have him out of there soon because it's
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.240]  not just 25th Amendment.
[08:48.240 --> 08:51.520]  It's the fact that he is a Chaikom agent.
[08:51.520 --> 08:53.160]  He lied to Congress.
[08:53.160 --> 08:54.160]  Others lied to Congress.
[08:54.160 --> 08:59.560]  The point he's lied to Congress, like the Attorney General, who knows damn well and
[08:59.560 --> 09:04.480]  had seen the documents that Biden did meet with Chinese officials for money.
[09:04.480 --> 09:07.720]  I mean, the whole rotten ship is going down.
[09:07.720 --> 09:10.600]  There's no way they're getting away with what they've done.
[09:10.600 --> 09:13.440]  There's no way they're going to be able to reverse all this.
[09:13.440 --> 09:18.360]  So that's coming up.
[09:18.360 --> 09:20.120]  Let me do this, though.
[09:20.120 --> 09:23.560]  Let me tell you what else I'm going to get to and then I'm going to hit the free speech
[09:23.560 --> 09:32.600]  area that's really ripened now to an extremely important level if we act now.
[09:32.600 --> 09:37.400]  And so before I get to that big piece of news, let me just explain this to wonderful listeners
[09:37.400 --> 09:39.360]  and incredible viewers.
[09:39.360 --> 09:43.640]  If you notice everything we talk about a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, five
[09:43.640 --> 09:51.680]  years ago is now word for word mainstream news, that is because almost no one else at
[09:51.680 --> 09:55.080]  this level covers this information.
[09:55.080 --> 09:59.920]  And so we put it out, it percolates others' research, and then when it becomes safe to
[09:59.920 --> 10:06.040]  put it out, folks that are not against humanity and not against God and not against their
[10:06.040 --> 10:09.840]  own self-interest, by the way, they're just common sense, are able to then put the information
[10:09.840 --> 10:10.840]  out.
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.800]  That's why Info Wars, I was thinking about this last night this morning, Info Wars is
[10:15.800 --> 10:18.080]  so incredibly important.
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.440]  And this morning I was thinking about saying this on air and I said, you know, you really
[10:21.440 --> 10:24.880]  shouldn't say this because they'll come after you even more, but they already know.
[10:24.880 --> 10:27.400]  The enemy knows.
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.200]  That's why Trump was forbidden, according to the Chief of Staff at the time, General Kelly
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.920]  and others, to even be able to see Info Wars because it was so accurate it would tell them
[10:38.920 --> 10:42.200]  what was right under his nose, how he was being spied on illegally, how they were really
[10:42.200 --> 10:45.480]  Chinese agents, the rest of it.
[10:45.480 --> 10:50.520]  And so you need to understand that when you support this broadcast and when you share
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.560]  the articles and videos, you have changed the world.
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.880]  You have fought back and it seems like a small thing to promote a radio show, a small thing
[10:57.880 --> 11:01.440]  to share articles, but it's not, it's a big thing, especially when you get attacked or
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.200]  censored yourself for it, but it's a life and death thing.
[11:04.200 --> 11:06.800]  It's because it's being censored that you need to promote it.
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.400]  So I want to just say this at the start of the broadcast here.
[11:10.400 --> 11:13.840]  I do not get the credit for this and this is important.
[11:13.840 --> 11:16.120]  I know you don't want credit, you're just like me.
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.280]  You want freedom and justice for your children and grandchildren of the future.
[11:20.280 --> 11:22.000]  And you hate saying evil take over.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.160]  I understand.
[11:23.160 --> 11:29.760]  But you need to let it soak in that you, the audience of this broadcast is not an audience.
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.440]  You are fighters.
[11:32.440 --> 11:37.080]  You are people that have literally not lived in the bleachers, not sat there in the peanut
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.000]  gallery, but you have been the men and women in the arena.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.580]  And I don't care if you're an old lady living in a trailer park in Indiana or you're a black
[11:45.580 --> 11:50.720]  man living in a tiny apartment in Chicago or your Hispanic person living in Austin,
[11:50.720 --> 11:52.200]  Texas, who lives in a shack.
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.800]  I don't care what kind of car you got or if you don't have a car or any of that.
[11:57.800 --> 12:01.320]  I care about, do you care about freedom and do you want to stand up for what you know
[12:01.320 --> 12:07.560]  is right that your conscience tells you is right because God created you and God gave
[12:07.560 --> 12:09.160]  you a directive.
[12:09.160 --> 12:15.120]  If that's the case and you spread the word and you take action, it changes the world.
[12:15.120 --> 12:18.080]  So I salute you.
[12:18.080 --> 12:19.880]  That is not empty words.
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.340]  That is not something to make you feel good.
[12:24.340 --> 12:27.760]  That is something that's the truth and that you need to recognize because when I see the
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.640]  awesome power of info wars, despite all my problems and all of it, God still rose me
[12:32.640 --> 12:34.880]  up to do this just like he's done you.
[12:34.880 --> 12:42.240]  And I see how we've affected change and how info wars is the dominant countervailing zeitgeist
[12:42.240 --> 12:44.360]  to Satan's zeitgeist.
[12:44.360 --> 12:53.240]  Info wars is the fount, is the progenitor, is the detonation point for the modern resistance
[12:53.240 --> 12:55.360]  now and going into the future.
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.080]  And I want you to understand that you are info wars.
[13:00.080 --> 13:02.440]  You are the resistance.
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.960]  This crew, all of you, the radio stations, the affiliates, the sponsors, the people
[13:07.960 --> 13:12.480]  praying for us, you have done incredible things.
[13:12.480 --> 13:18.120]  And I just wanted to soak in so that when you got made fun of or you lost your job for
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.360]  what you did or any of that stuff, it was worth it because God's watching and because
[13:23.360 --> 13:24.880]  it's actually bearing fruit.
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.960]  Now, stuff's going to get hellish, but it's going to do that anyway.
[13:29.960 --> 13:30.960]  Satan's real.
[13:30.960 --> 13:32.640]  I mean, Satan's making a move.
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.320]  Everything we do is going to lighten how bad what we're going to go through as a civilization
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.560]  is going to be because we're going to live and see the mark of the beast.
[13:41.560 --> 13:43.960]  Those world government, you will see the Antichrist.
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.720]  You will see one fourth of the earth's population killed.
[13:47.720 --> 13:53.240]  You will see giant pillars and mountains of fire that John the Revelator witnessed when
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.840]  God took him to the future to see it.
[13:56.840 --> 13:57.840]  And it's going to be rough.
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.080]  And I don't know if it's a year from now or 20 from now, but I'm telling you this right
[14:01.080 --> 14:02.080]  now.
[14:02.080 --> 14:05.280]  It's all moving fast in that direction.
[14:05.280 --> 14:08.720]  You're like, well, then why do we fight it?
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.680]  Well, it's our job to fight it and it's in that process of struggling with it that it
[14:14.680 --> 14:18.440]  crests and wins for just a very short period of time.
[14:18.440 --> 14:24.480]  Satan gets up there on that pinnacle of power and it's to have his panopticonic counterfeit
[14:24.480 --> 14:33.720]  of God, total surveillance, artificial AI, artificial omnipresence.
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.360]  It's a cheap shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow, but it will be something like
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.360]  that.
[14:39.360 --> 14:40.360]  It predicts the future.
[14:40.360 --> 14:42.760]  People under its control, it can control the future.
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.840]  Once humans act like automatons, it will dominate and control them.
[14:46.840 --> 14:51.600]  This thing is going to build, it's going to work for a while and then it's going to disintegrate.
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.120]  They'll be able to cure cancer, they tell you, and in a couple of years, that person
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.120]  will die a violent death from side effects.
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.280]  They'll be able to do all, oh, promise they can download your soul and do a computer.
[15:04.280 --> 15:06.960]  All of this is a fraud.
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.600]  All of this is a lie and we are going to be here to witness and to see it.
[15:10.600 --> 15:13.640]  It's going to be spectacular.
[15:13.640 --> 15:17.520]  So don't let it get you down, don't let it get you depressed.
[15:17.520 --> 15:25.920]  Don't let it get you into a position of where you absorb all this evil and then you feel
[15:25.920 --> 15:28.640]  bad and you feel depressed and you commit suicide.
[15:28.640 --> 15:29.640]  Don't do that.
[15:29.640 --> 15:33.800]  Commit yourself to fight against the new order, warn others, love others, have justice, bring
[15:33.800 --> 15:37.960]  light to the world and know that it's a process and that we're going to go through this is
[15:37.960 --> 15:41.440]  going to make us much, much stronger and much, much closer to God.
[15:41.440 --> 15:42.600]  Thank you all for your support as well.

[16:20.440 --> 16:23.880]  your family, good for your immune system, good for yourselves, good for your body.
[16:23.880 --> 16:28.280]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is again the flagship.

[16:33.040 --> 16:34.960]  It cleans out your mitochondria.

[16:36.120 --> 16:41.760]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double, Patriot points.
[16:41.760 --> 16:43.440]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.080]  What else is back in stock?
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.880]  People are very excited to hear Holland Block for seasonal discomfort, for allergies.
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.400]  It's back in stock, 40% off as well with a bunch of other items like alpha power and
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.400]  more.

[16:59.760 --> 17:03.240]  I always shoot you straight and when I've told you over the years that if you don't
[17:03.240 --> 17:05.320]  support us, we'll be off the air.
[17:05.320 --> 17:11.960]  It's been true, but Info Wars has never been in a position where your support is more critical
[17:11.960 --> 17:13.040]  and more vital.
[17:13.040 --> 17:16.800]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things, I'm not going to take time up to whine
[17:16.800 --> 17:17.800]  about it.
[17:17.800 --> 17:18.800]  It's okay.
[17:18.800 --> 17:20.480]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.520]  We're having a great effect.
[17:22.520 --> 17:23.720]  We're exposing evil.
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.720]  You're exposing evil.
[17:24.720 --> 17:28.280]  So if you spread the word about the broadcast or when you buy products or when you pray
[17:28.280 --> 17:33.560]  for Info Wars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[17:33.560 --> 17:40.040]  So again, as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.000]  you as being veterans of the Info War and I particularly think our veterans as well
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.920]  that have served the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and
[17:47.920 --> 17:52.800]  they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our Republic to expose the globalist of
[17:52.800 --> 17:55.080]  the foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[17:55.080 --> 17:56.680]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[17:56.680 --> 18:01.160]  I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again.
[18:01.160 --> 18:07.920]  You've got until June 6th to get free shipping, double Patriot points and up to 50% off on

[18:45.120 --> 18:48.040]  is known as a detoxifying system.

[18:53.640 --> 19:00.160]  12 back in stock, 50% off, this is running until Sunday and the deal's over at bulwarshore.com.
[19:00.160 --> 19:05.120]  I've been on there 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks
[19:05.120 --> 19:10.240]  but also a lot of amazing support and so that's why I always take time out to thank you for
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.000]  keeping us on there because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.960]  our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on here and the world would be a different
[19:17.960 --> 19:18.960]  place.
[19:18.960 --> 19:24.520]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had, it's really counting
[19:24.520 --> 19:30.000]  the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't supported us, the whole
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.960]  planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist.
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.280]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening and so many of the corrupt
[19:37.280 --> 19:41.240]  things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open and so info
[19:41.240 --> 19:45.760]  war credibility is higher than it's ever been, but the enemy is trying to shut us down with
[19:45.760 --> 19:49.360]  so many different attacks, we've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air, it's
[19:49.360 --> 19:53.560]  so expensive, so please get great products and keep info wars on the air at the same
[19:53.560 --> 19:54.560]  time at infowarshore.com.
[19:54.560 --> 19:58.920]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have short free shipping and double paid
[19:58.920 --> 20:26.720]  for the points.
[20:28.920 --> 20:44.960]  It's a reliable source of information, 50,000 unstoppable watts, anthrax and radio, anthrax
[20:44.960 --> 20:45.960]  and radio.
[20:45.960 --> 20:53.160]  LRWWCR transmitters 100,000 watts, only one station with 100,000 watts in America, we're
[20:53.160 --> 20:54.160]  on it.
[20:54.160 --> 21:01.160]  All the other big ones are 50,000 watts, we're talking about A.M. or ZFM 100,000.
[21:01.160 --> 21:20.160]  Oh, yeah, what have I told you, they were lying, whoo, anthrax and radio.
[21:20.160 --> 21:37.160]  50,000 unstoppable watts, anthrax, anthrax and radio, all right, I'm going to stop it.
[21:37.160 --> 21:46.480]  Here's some good clutch, I had the clutch center on like 10 years ago, good guys, smart
[21:46.480 --> 21:55.160]  guys, better look out, all right, let me stop talking about that and get serious here because
[21:55.160 --> 21:59.000]  I kind of, I didn't, I didn't get rabbit trail, but just let me tell you what's coming up.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.600]  I'm going to hit the Trump news next segment, where he says Biden's about to be out of office.
[22:03.600 --> 22:09.040]  I mean, that's just like, whoa, I saw that last night.
[22:09.040 --> 22:15.200]  And I just, I fell out of my chair, I mean, the implications of that.
[22:15.200 --> 22:23.040]  What that means, Trump wouldn't just say that if he wasn't going to try it.
[22:23.040 --> 22:30.560]  Trump better have really good secret service coverage because they were scared to kill
[22:30.560 --> 22:33.040]  him when he was in office.
[22:33.040 --> 22:40.120]  And if they kill him, it'll make him a martyr, but I've weighed the, weighed the globalist
[22:40.120 --> 22:50.320]  mindset, I've looked into their, their bean counting, their, their, their abacus and they're,
[22:50.320 --> 22:56.480]  you can say the scales of their arithmetic and the topography of their navigation of
[22:56.480 --> 22:59.520]  their political wilderness.
[22:59.520 --> 23:07.080]  And I just don't see how they don't try to kill him because they're desperate.
[23:07.080 --> 23:11.280]  They want to maintain control, the fact they launched that bioattacks coming out.
[23:11.280 --> 23:18.440]  But let me get this big piece of news first, because this is so important to Congress and
[23:18.440 --> 23:21.840]  to the House and Senate, to America, to the world.
[23:21.840 --> 23:24.000]  And it really is what we face.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.120]  This is what globalism is, is unaccountable corporate governance.
[23:30.120 --> 23:33.680]  I believe in libertarian ideas when it comes to social issues and things.
[23:33.680 --> 23:41.560]  I'm a live and let live person, but when it comes to governance, corporations simply become
[23:41.560 --> 23:46.280]  government when they're left unchecked by government.
[23:46.280 --> 23:53.400]  So we need a limited government, a republic to protect us from the equivalent of the modern
[23:53.400 --> 23:59.800]  East India company, which became more powerful than pretty much the British empire itself
[23:59.800 --> 24:04.960]  and became its own military, its own governance, its own unaccountable system.
[24:04.960 --> 24:07.800]  Reason doesn't really come from government.
[24:07.800 --> 24:10.640]  Government's just raw power, the raw execution.
[24:10.640 --> 24:14.560]  Well, under corporate governance, that's what you really end up with.
[24:14.560 --> 24:27.800]  So people can argue about section in the legislation, in the law where big tech has all these different
[24:27.800 --> 24:35.720]  systems, where they are given immunity, section 230.
[24:35.720 --> 24:42.520]  And we can harp on that all day, and people have been harping on that, instead of going,
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.280]  how does big tech lie to Congress and say they don't spy on anybody or collect any data
[24:47.280 --> 24:50.280]  or sell that data, went on record, that's their business, and they do.
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.720]  It's like saying cows aren't cows, or the sky in blue.
[24:54.720 --> 24:59.080]  I mean, it's next level.
[24:59.080 --> 25:00.800]  It's absolutely next level.
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.400]  And I kind of went off this segment singing along to the clutch song, so I'm a little
[25:06.400 --> 25:14.360]  bit had a false start this segment.
[25:14.360 --> 25:21.880]  So this next piece of news is so big that I'm not going to cover it till the next segment.
[25:21.880 --> 25:26.040]  And then I'm going to cover the huge Trump news, and I'm going to just restart the broadcast
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.320]  when we come back after the break that's coming up in a few minutes.
[25:30.320 --> 25:33.120]  Because this has got to be said just right.
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.200]  Because I've been harping on this, and I've been explaining this to people, and I've been
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.760]  going over this at nauseam, and no one has listened to me in Congress.
[25:42.760 --> 25:45.680]  Trump wouldn't listen to me.
[25:45.680 --> 25:52.720]  I have given this speech to former heads of U.S. intelligence agencies.
[25:52.720 --> 25:56.320]  I've given the speech at dinner with U.S. senators off record.
[25:56.320 --> 25:59.240]  I've given the speech with top talk show host off record.
[25:59.240 --> 26:06.160]  I've given the speech everywhere till I'm blue in the face, and no one seems to understand
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.160]  what I'm saying.
[26:07.160 --> 26:13.800]  And finally, I got up this morning, and I turned on my little devilish iPad, and there
[26:13.800 --> 26:16.600]  was Ted Cruz saying it right out of his mouth.
[26:16.600 --> 26:20.920]  And you know, you can talk about Ted Cruz, and some people don't like him, and he stabbed
[26:20.920 --> 26:22.280]  Trump in the back and all that.
[26:22.280 --> 26:23.280]  It doesn't matter.
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.080]  Ted Cruz is probably the smartest person in government.
[26:28.080 --> 26:29.600]  Rand Paul's really smart as well.
[26:29.600 --> 26:35.880]  I mean, quite frankly, they're both politically and intellectually way smarter than Trump.
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.680]  Trump has really good instincts and some things.
[26:39.680 --> 26:48.720]  But as sneaky as Cruz is, you just can't ignore the fact that he would be an incredible president
[26:48.720 --> 26:50.720]  if he actually worked for us.
[26:50.720 --> 26:53.280]  And I think Cruz wants to work for America.
[26:53.280 --> 26:55.200]  I think he believes in the idea.
[26:55.200 --> 26:58.160]  I think he believes in nothing himself that he doesn't want to try to hold other people
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.440]  back because that's the real mark of a man, is that you don't want to suppress other
[27:01.440 --> 27:03.440]  people because you're insecure.
[27:03.440 --> 27:07.500]  I would like to see Ted Cruz as president one day, even though he's attacked me and
[27:07.500 --> 27:12.920]  all the rest of it, and he's also defended me, I just know that he would run circles
[27:12.920 --> 27:16.320]  around the globalist if we got him in there.
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.320]  But obviously, he also has, he doesn't have some of that destiny like Trump has, like
[27:21.320 --> 27:23.600]  he bet on Glenn Beck.
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.960]  He also has some blind spots.
[27:24.960 --> 27:27.120]  But Ted Cruz has learned a lot.
[27:27.120 --> 27:28.280]  We all learn.
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.080]  I've learned a lot.
[27:30.080 --> 27:37.440]  But Ted Cruz presented the world on Fox News this weekend, the keys to freedom.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.440]  The keys to everything.
[27:38.440 --> 27:42.400]  Because see, now I figured out why when I was saying I was libertarian, because I like
[27:42.400 --> 27:43.400]  the ideas of it.
[27:43.400 --> 27:47.520]  It makes sense at one level to you understand how complex things are and that power always
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.000]  amasses and always, whether it's communism or fascism or corporatism or whatever it is,
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.480]  it always masses together and becomes authoritarian.
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.200]  And so the globalists spend billions and billions pushing libertarian thought.
[28:00.200 --> 28:02.080]  So oh, leave corporations alone.
[28:02.080 --> 28:03.400]  We don't need any regulations on them.
[28:03.400 --> 28:07.880]  And when you see the local socialists agenda 21 coding for a certain, not letting you cut
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.840]  a tree down in your backyard that fell on your house in a storm, you, hey, the tree
[28:12.840 --> 28:16.120]  fell over and Austin says, sorry, you didn't matter.
[28:16.120 --> 28:18.920]  The tree got struck by lightning or there was a tornado.
[28:18.920 --> 28:23.720]  You got to replace it with his with that many inches of tree and you're like a 30 inch
[28:23.720 --> 28:24.720]  oak.
[28:24.720 --> 28:29.280]  I don't have the money to find a 30 inch oak and then you're like, I don't like government
[28:29.280 --> 28:35.840]  sucks, yeah, and the corporations become just like that and behave just the same.
[28:35.840 --> 28:38.120]  So you've got to have some type of balance there.
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.120]  But, but I'm not pressing.
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.400]  I'm going to try to cut right to the heart of the matter because this is a very simple
[28:44.400 --> 28:45.680]  issue.
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.040]  But if the world gets it, it's over for the new world order because I figured out their
[28:50.040 --> 28:55.840]  plan with this libertarian thing because I've said over again, I am not a large L libertarian
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.360]  anymore because I figured this out.

[29:23.960 --> 29:28.400]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is again the flagship.

[29:31.200 --> 29:33.160]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[29:33.160 --> 29:35.080]  It cleans out your mitochondria.

[29:36.080 --> 29:41.880]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double patriot points.
[29:41.880 --> 29:43.520]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[29:43.520 --> 29:45.200]  What else is back in stock?
[29:45.200 --> 29:50.000]  People are very excited to hear pollen block for seasonal discomfort, for allergies, it's
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  back in stock.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.600]  40% off as well with a bunch of other items like alpha power and more at infowarstore.com,
[29:56.600 --> 30:00.440]  free shipping and double patriot points for Memorial Day.
[30:00.440 --> 30:05.200]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars is and it's
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.720]  always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons
[30:09.720 --> 30:11.760]  that make all this possible.
[30:11.760 --> 30:17.040]  So in short, the world's awakening to spiral the censorship, info wars has never been more
[30:17.040 --> 30:22.000]  influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.560]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[30:27.560 --> 30:31.480]  most of the best selling products which you want to buy like DNA Force Plus and others
[30:31.480 --> 30:33.520]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[30:33.520 --> 30:34.520]  Well guess what?
[30:34.520 --> 30:38.120]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[30:38.120 --> 30:42.960]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at infowarstore.com and for the week leading up through Memorial
[30:42.960 --> 30:47.840]  Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double patriot points and alpha powers back
[30:47.840 --> 30:52.560]  in stock and supermilitalies back in stock and pollen block and vasovistar all back in
[30:52.560 --> 30:57.560]  stock as much as 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, infowarstore.com.
[30:57.560 --> 31:00.360]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, info warriors.
[31:00.360 --> 31:04.840]  A lot of virtuous signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and
[31:04.840 --> 31:08.520]  how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what
[31:08.520 --> 31:14.280]  those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S. history.
[31:14.280 --> 31:19.200]  And now more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[31:19.200 --> 31:21.600]  America is under globalist takeover.
[31:21.600 --> 31:22.760]  It's an information war.
[31:22.760 --> 31:27.440]  It is an economic war, but most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[31:27.440 --> 31:32.800]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[31:32.800 --> 31:35.960]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan, we were the first to tell
[31:35.960 --> 31:37.920]  you that vaccine passports were coming.
[31:37.920 --> 31:42.280]  We were the first to lay out basically everything because we actually do our research and know
[31:42.280 --> 31:43.280]  what we're talking about.
[31:43.280 --> 31:46.560]  And that's why it's important to keep info wars on the air now more than ever.
[31:46.560 --> 31:50.600]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double patriot points.
[31:50.600 --> 31:55.200]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA force, alpha power, and pollen block.
[31:55.200 --> 31:58.800]  So to all the veterans and all the patrons we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners,
[31:58.800 --> 32:00.280]  please support info wars now more than ever.
[32:00.280 --> 32:05.520]  Fauci is the first big domino that's just peatering on the edge of collapse.
[32:05.520 --> 32:08.920]  And if he falls, the entire house of guards goes down.
[32:08.920 --> 32:12.040]  There's a viral report we put out a month ago that's the blueprint for bringing these
[32:12.040 --> 32:18.240]  criminals down dealing with Peter Dazik, the project manager of the Wuhan lab under funding
[32:18.240 --> 32:20.080]  from Fauci and Bill Gates.
[32:20.080 --> 32:21.960]  And it's all coming out in the emails.
[32:21.960 --> 32:26.040]  But we don't need the emails, turns out he bragged a year and a half ago how they created
[32:26.040 --> 32:30.240]  a five virus chimera now known as COVID-19.
[32:30.240 --> 32:36.360]  Peter Dazik is the final little domino to knock over the first big one, Fauci, that
[32:36.360 --> 32:37.880]  can bring down the whole new world order.
[32:37.880 --> 32:41.160]  We're covering it all now at band.video and freeworldnews.tv.
[32:41.160 --> 32:45.160]  That's the URL to share, freeworldnews.tv.
[32:45.160 --> 32:49.440]  Get this out to everybody you know, the world's awakening, and now is the time for you to
[32:49.440 --> 32:50.440]  be the Paul Revere's.
[32:50.440 --> 32:55.080]  So I'm firing the bat signal now, get this report that's on screen, and get out to everyone
[32:55.080 --> 32:56.080]  you know.
[32:56.080 --> 32:57.080]  Smokey gun video.
[32:57.080 --> 33:04.080]  The project manager confesses to creating COVID-19.
[33:04.080 --> 33:19.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.480 --> 33:24.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[33:24.400 --> 33:34.400]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:34.400 --> 33:38.160]  Infowars, because there's a war on for your mind.
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.640]  All right, let me just tell you what's coming up next hour.
[33:43.640 --> 33:49.920]  West Point is putting people in solitary confinement that don't take the deadly gene therapy, genetic
[33:49.920 --> 33:57.200]  engineering, Franken shots, and in the towns that refuse the inoculation, because the town
[33:57.200 --> 34:04.240]  elders are, there's video throwing out the U.N. injectors, they're having their power
[34:04.240 --> 34:08.880]  cut off for not taking the voluntary injections.
[34:08.880 --> 34:13.800]  And it's all over the news that they're going to start doing similar things here in the
[34:13.800 --> 34:14.800]  United States.
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.760]  This is a giant exercise in tyranny that they can put something in your body that's experimental
[34:19.760 --> 34:25.080]  and secret on top of it, they can do anything.
[34:25.080 --> 34:33.200]  And now massive new studies have come out from prestigious institutes saying this is
[34:33.200 --> 34:34.200]  a mistake.
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.440]  It's not on purpose, but see, they're good scientists, they're like, this is a mistake.
[34:39.440 --> 34:44.720]  It's causing an autoimmune response in the body of these spike proteins, and these proteins
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.720]  are all in the body, and the body is eating holes in itself, the brain, the lungs, the
[34:48.720 --> 34:49.720]  lungs.
[34:49.720 --> 34:50.720]  This is terrible.
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.760]  Why are you doing it?
[34:52.760 --> 35:00.800]  Fauci did studies at UT in 2012, and the studies said, do not ever create a vaccine that tries
[35:00.800 --> 35:08.000]  to block a cold virus protein because the virus is made out of the same stuff as your
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  body.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  Good God!
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.400]  And that's why so many people I know that are smart are freaking out.
[35:16.400 --> 35:17.400]  I have trouble.
[35:17.400 --> 35:22.600]  I sat there today for like an hour staring out the window, just like, why are they doing
[35:22.600 --> 35:23.600]  this?
[35:23.600 --> 35:25.480]  I mean, the heart attacks, the death, it's depopulation.
[35:25.480 --> 35:26.480]  It's real simple.
[35:26.480 --> 35:28.320]  And it's an IQ test.
[35:28.320 --> 35:33.560]  If you're dumb enough to take this stuff, they think you deserve to die.
[35:33.560 --> 35:39.920]  And again, it killed rats on average in a couple months, and rats, a couple months like
[35:39.920 --> 35:43.920]  a couple years in humans, and it's a dead reckoning thing, but that's why they do it.
[35:43.920 --> 35:45.800]  And telegraphs and studies do that.
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.040]  So, I mean, Dr. Tenpenny says six months to a year.
[35:49.040 --> 35:52.000]  Other scientists, Wolfgang Woodhark says about a year.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.280]  Ye Don, the former head of Pfizer, their chief scientist, he said, yeah, I think about a
[35:57.280 --> 36:01.080]  year if you look at the rat studies, it's a month or two with rats, and about a year
[36:01.080 --> 36:02.080]  or two with humans.
[36:02.080 --> 36:03.960]  I mean, we're going to just see dead people everywhere.
[36:03.960 --> 36:08.120]  I mean, oh, oh, oh, oh, and it's all, it's like, oh, there's mystery illnesses that are
[36:08.120 --> 36:13.440]  causing strokes and heart attacks and people becoming like Alzheimer's patients when they're
[36:13.440 --> 36:15.800]  10 years old, 30 years old.
[36:15.800 --> 36:21.960]  That's mystery neurological disorders in Europe and the U.K. and the U.S. suddenly hospitals
[36:21.960 --> 36:22.960]  are full.
[36:22.960 --> 36:24.160]  There's an R.T. headline.
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.600]  It's happening, and it's probably spreading.
[36:26.600 --> 36:31.520]  Canadian health officials baffled by mystery deadly brain disease.
[36:31.520 --> 36:36.160]  I probably said a hundred times last year they'll call it mystery neurological disorders.
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.160]  It's all happening like a damn slow motion train wreck.
[36:41.160 --> 36:45.160]  See, I'm not one of these guys that says stay with us all.
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.160]  I'm going to cover it next hour.
[36:46.160 --> 36:48.720]  I just got to it right then, but I'm going to show you all the articles next hour.
[36:48.720 --> 36:50.880]  Let's get to this right now.
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.280]  And I wasn't gushing earlier over Ted Cruz, it's just satisfying to see somebody that
[36:55.280 --> 36:56.280]  gets it.
[36:56.280 --> 36:59.200]  And all the time, no one gets what I'm saying, but Ted Cruz.
[36:59.200 --> 37:00.200]  And I'm not kissing his ass.
[37:00.200 --> 37:03.560]  It's just that, my God, you're like thrown overboard into the ocean, you know, you grab
[37:03.560 --> 37:05.600]  on to whatever you can get.
[37:05.600 --> 37:12.200]  And, you know, here it is, Ted Cruz's email show Facebook operating as extension of government
[37:12.200 --> 37:14.280]  now exposed to legal liability.
[37:14.280 --> 37:15.280]  Bingo!
[37:15.280 --> 37:16.280]  Bingo!
[37:16.280 --> 37:17.560]  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[37:17.560 --> 37:19.060]  You win the jackpot.
[37:19.060 --> 37:23.000]  Because I studied international law, I studied our law.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.240]  All these big tech corporations are working and partnered with government, usually whatever
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.200]  parties in power, to suppress their political enemies, to suppress their financial enemies,
[37:32.200 --> 37:38.040]  suppress their technological enemies, which is violation of trust, trust laws, and surveillance
[37:38.040 --> 37:44.520]  laws they're violating. And they've now become government institutions. Facebook has three
[37:44.520 --> 37:52.800]  billion members. It bans speeches in Congress and scientists that speak, and DeSantis has
[37:52.800 --> 37:58.440]  a hearing with a bunch of scientists and Fauci doesn't like it, so they banned that off YouTube.
[37:58.440 --> 38:06.120]  This is incredible governmental meddling. If the FBI ran the post office and wouldn't
[38:06.120 --> 38:11.440]  let you mail letters criticizing Fauci, you'd say, you'd get rid of the FBI, right? The
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.920]  FBI would get in trouble for that, right? Well, this is just digital mail. Oh, but it's
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.680]  a free corporation. You're talking to somebody. They're surveilling you in live time. Facebook
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.600]  admits and then even saying their internal documents, well, we really want to suppress
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.400]  the truth. You know, they're telling their fat checkers and they're really worried about
[38:29.400 --> 38:35.840]  people being truthful. So suppress it, particularly compelling truthful narratives that block people
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.560]  taking their shots. Oh, really? Like, hey, my wife took it and she's dead. Well, don't
[38:40.560 --> 38:49.440]  let them, don't let them show that. So here's Ted Cruz explaining to the Fox News House that
[38:49.440 --> 38:57.520]  do you understand that Facebook is meshed with bureaucracies and government agencies in live
[38:57.520 --> 39:03.840]  time suppressing the people of the country. And what we say, that's Chilchescu's Romania.
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.160]  That's Kim Jong-un's North Korea. That's Yeezy Ping's China. That's Stalin's Russia.
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.080]  That's Hitler's Germany. I mean, this is the Muhammad Ali. You know, he's the greatest
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.640]  boxer. Like, that's the standard. Well, this is the Muhammad Ali of Tehran. I mean, this
[39:19.640 --> 39:25.280]  is, when you're doing that in live time, baby, I mean, there's a ceiling on this. That's
[39:25.280 --> 39:33.080]  like as high as you can get. It's as bad as it is. And Congress just goes, is it true
[39:33.080 --> 39:39.520]  you track us with the phone? And Sundar, the head of Google goes, no, we've never tracked
[39:39.520 --> 39:47.280]  anyone's phone. And they said, thank you for telling me that. I heard you do it. I mean,
[39:47.280 --> 39:53.400]  these people, most of these judges, most of these senators are literally morons. They were
[39:53.400 --> 39:59.160]  put in power because they're idiots and because they'll do whatever the global say. But I'm
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.560]  sorry, the full Ted Cruz interview is like 10 minutes long. It's on M4s. But here's here's
[40:03.560 --> 40:10.320]  part of it. Here it is. First, here's the Fauci flip flop over a two week period. Watch.
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.400]  Dr. Barrett does not doing gain of function research. And if it is, it's according to
[40:16.400 --> 40:23.000]  the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina. And if you look at the grant
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.360]  and you look at the progress reports, it is not gain of function despite the fact that
[40:29.360 --> 40:34.480]  people tweet that. It would have been almost a dereliction of our duty if we didn't study
[40:34.480 --> 40:39.480]  this. And the only way you can study these things is you've got to go where the action
[40:39.480 --> 40:47.000]  is. So we had a modest collaboration with very respectable Chinese scientists to a world
[40:47.000 --> 40:54.040]  experts on coronavirus. And we did that through a sub grant from a larger grant to eco health.
[40:54.040 --> 41:01.520]  Wow. Okay. Joining me right now to discuss this is Senator Ted Cruz. He sits on the Senate
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.800]  judiciary and foreign relations committees. Senator, good morning to you. It is wonderful
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.960]  to see you this morning. I want to get right into the Facebook connection. But first, Senator,
[41:09.960 --> 41:16.920]  tell us, did Fauci commit perjury just there? It sure looks like it. He looked at Rand Paul's
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.760]  eyes and told a flat out falsehood. And unfortunately, this has been a pattern with Dr. Fauci that
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.560]  what he says on Monday somehow isn't the same as what he says on Tuesday. But don't worry,
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.960]  what he says on Wednesday is almost certain to be different. And I got to say this email
[41:31.960 --> 41:38.080]  dump that came out makes clear that this is not just being sloppy. It is systematic and
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.600]  it is systematically an effort to mislead the American people. And as you noted, he
[41:43.600 --> 41:48.320]  wasn't doing it alone, but he was doing it with much of the US government behind him.
[41:48.320 --> 41:54.440]  And with Facebook and Big Tech operating as an extension of the US government in order
[41:54.440 --> 41:59.600]  to silence any views that disagreed, not with the science, because he wasn't looking for
[41:59.600 --> 42:05.080]  the science. He was suppressing the science, but rather trying to silence anything that
[42:05.080 --> 42:11.680]  disagreed with a political narrative that was convenient that he was pushing at that moment.
[42:11.680 --> 42:15.360]  And then Cruz goes on to explain in the law, now that they've done that, they've totally
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.720]  opened themselves up to liability, to FOIA requests, to everything. You can't have the
[42:19.720 --> 42:25.040]  government, imagine if the government teamed up with the Dallas Cowboys to spy on you.
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.840]  You'd be like, arrest Jerry Jones. But if it's Facebook or Twitter, oh, then it's okay.
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.080]  They hired over a million trained fact checkers in the last three years, four years, by the
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.240]  ADL of Southern Property Law Center to now run all the big tech and be in your private
[42:40.240 --> 42:45.040]  accounts reading your private messages. I mean, this is a giant spy scandal. And it's
[42:45.040 --> 42:50.080]  government all linked up with the corporations doing it and then hiding behind that corporate
[42:50.080 --> 42:59.920]  wall saying it's a private company. No, it's not. It's a criminal mafia cabal.
[42:59.920 --> 43:03.400]  I always shoot you straight. And when I've told you over the years that if you don't
[43:03.400 --> 43:09.960]  support us, we'll be off the air. It's been true. But Info Wars has never been in a position
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.560]  where your support is more critical and more vital. The enemy behind the scenes is doing
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.560]  so many things. I'm not going to take time up to whine about it. It's okay. I expect
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.160]  to be attacked because we're over the target. We're having a great effect. We're exposing
[43:23.160 --> 43:26.920]  evil. You're exposing evil. So you spread the word about the broadcaster when you buy
[43:26.920 --> 43:33.160]  products or when you pray for Info Wars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so
[43:33.160 --> 43:39.520]  powerful. So again, as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.640]  I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War. And I particularly think our veterans
[43:43.640 --> 43:47.800]  as well that have served the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice
[43:47.800 --> 43:52.920]  and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our Republic to expose the globalist
[43:52.920 --> 43:56.280]  of the foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now. So it's a very historical
[43:56.280 --> 43:58.880]  time to be alive. I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us
[43:58.880 --> 44:04.040]  again. I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be a knockshot. I'm saying it
[44:04.040 --> 44:09.920]  because it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci
[44:09.920 --> 44:17.080]  admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists,
[44:17.080 --> 44:21.760]  nurses, you name it, have taken the so called COVID-19 franken shot. I'm going to say the
[44:21.760 --> 44:29.920]  second time around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken
[44:29.920 --> 44:35.000]  shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.040]  most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people, the people
[44:39.040 --> 44:44.840]  of the world. This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more
[44:44.840 --> 44:50.280]  times. Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff
[44:50.280 --> 44:54.920]  refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust
[44:54.920 --> 44:58.600]  a so called vaccine and you shouldn't either and you should warn everyone you know about
[44:58.600 --> 45:04.080]  the truth. In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing Pollen Block is, but
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.480]  you should go to infowarstore.com and read the third party review sites that we have
[45:08.480 --> 45:14.280]  links to where it's got five stars and people love it. Pollen Block is a proprietary formula
[45:14.280 --> 45:21.680]  from France where they just learned by happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet produce
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.800]  eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.120]  or what folks call allergies. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for a long time.
[45:31.120 --> 45:35.600]  It's very hard to get. Despite that, it's 40% off. It's throw out free shipping right
[45:35.600 --> 45:41.440]  now for Memorial Day and Double Patriot Points. So Pollen Block is back in stock. So is DNA
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.720]  Force. So are so many other great products. Throw out free shipping and your purchase
[45:44.720 --> 45:52.040]  funds the info war. So that is a true 360 win. Get your Pollen Block today. 40% off free
[45:52.040 --> 45:55.920]  shipping, Double Patriot Points, infowarstore.com. And I know you're going to become a regular
[45:55.920 --> 45:59.440]  customer because everybody else has gotten it basically has. This stuff really, really
[45:59.440 --> 46:04.720]  works. I've been on there 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.040]  attacks, but also a lot of amazing support. And so that's why I always take time out
[46:09.040 --> 46:13.280]  to thank you for keeping us on there because without you, without the crew, without our
[46:13.280 --> 46:17.040]  sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the
[46:17.040 --> 46:20.880]  world would be a different place. So it's not a power trip when I realized the great
[46:20.880 --> 46:27.800]  effect we've had. It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here,
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.320]  if you hadn't supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the
[46:32.320 --> 46:36.640]  globalist instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening. And so many
[46:36.640 --> 46:40.080]  of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.800]  open. And so info wars credibility is higher than it's ever been. But the enemy is trying
[46:44.800 --> 46:48.600]  to shut us down with so many different attacks. We've had to build our own infrastructure
[46:48.600 --> 46:53.040]  to stay on air. It's so expensive. So please get great products and keep info wars on the
[46:53.040 --> 46:57.480]  air at the same time at infowarstore.com. In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have
[46:57.480 --> 47:17.640]  a short free shipping and double patriot points. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.640 --> 47:26.080]  It's Sunday, June 6th, the year is 2021. You're a sentient conscious being that interface
[47:26.080 --> 47:31.920]  with God and God's creation universe. As we spin through space on this beautiful planet,
[47:31.920 --> 47:37.160]  orbiting a standard yellow star, two thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky
[47:37.160 --> 47:51.840]  Way, Alex. The wall goes on forever. And if we go with God's design, you're happy. And
[47:51.840 --> 47:59.080]  it pleases God. It pleases us. If we go against God's code, it's called sin. And it's wages
[47:59.080 --> 48:10.240]  are death. You see that you with the system says you die both physically and spiritually.
[48:10.240 --> 48:15.640]  Thank you so much for joining us. I just played a little bit of that Ted Cruz clip. But you
[48:15.640 --> 48:22.240]  know, I'm going to do something because Cruz and his guest, or he's the guest of the host,
[48:22.240 --> 48:28.720]  really lay it all out in the first five minutes of the interview. How whether it's COVID-19
[48:28.720 --> 48:31.920]  or whether it's election fraud or whether it's the second amendment or whether it's
[48:31.920 --> 48:37.160]  Antifa existing, you know, the gaslight is to go Antifa doesn't exist. These are mostly
[48:37.160 --> 48:43.040]  peaceful protest, second biggest burn down of the cities in US history. And then if you
[48:43.040 --> 48:50.680]  go, oh, look, here's Antifa beating up an old lady. Twitter takes your Twitter account
[48:50.680 --> 48:57.560]  away from Savannah Hernandez. Oh, we can't have her. She's a conservative, smart, good-looking
[48:57.560 --> 49:06.600]  Latina who's out showing these thugs beating up women. Well, we'll just ban her for them.
[49:06.600 --> 49:15.000]  Same thing. They do. Whenever all the footage comes out on the national news, they try to
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.360]  edit it and cut it down and claim Republicans are out burning things down. I mean, the level
[49:19.360 --> 49:25.120]  of lies is insane. And Jack Dorsey and all these people are protecting that. They are
[49:25.120 --> 49:33.600]  protecting Twitter. Congress is and they're protecting Facebook and they're protecting
[49:33.600 --> 49:39.920]  it. And it's doing illegal things. Facebook and Google particularly are light years worse
[49:39.920 --> 49:45.720]  than Twitter with the data mining and the activities they're involved in. So always
[49:45.720 --> 49:50.520]  hit behind. That's fine. I'm going to hit the huge Trump news next hour. The first part
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.200]  of it that I'm going to hit the military news, the global destabilization news, the clear
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.480]  hack attacks. Now even mainline analysts are saying are coming from corporations in the
[49:59.480 --> 50:04.680]  deep state. Why do we keep thinking governments are the ones hacking things or governments
[50:04.680 --> 50:10.200]  are the ones destabilizing things? It's global corporations. They're bigger than governments.
[50:10.200 --> 50:16.360]  Facebook has three billion members. You really think Zuckerberg really runs that? You really
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.040]  think Biden's running anything? Let's start talking about who stands to gain from the
[50:21.040 --> 50:26.520]  lockdowns. The big corporations doubled and tripled their profits. That's how you got
[50:26.520 --> 50:36.280]  to start thinking. Key bono. But look at these headlines. Twitter declares access to its
[50:36.280 --> 50:45.360]  platform a human right amid censorship of conservatives. And when I saw that headline
[50:45.360 --> 50:58.760]  come out Friday night before I even read the headline, I knew what it was going to say.
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.920]  They want to be able to overthrow governments by manipulating who gets political support
[51:02.920 --> 51:07.400]  and who doesn't and letting their operatives run flash mobs. And then Twitter sends that
[51:07.400 --> 51:11.000]  message to everybody that's in the particular country. Just like the Arab Spring, they admit
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.880]  Twitter work with Google and Facebook to throw out moderates, put radical Muslims in, and
[51:15.880 --> 51:26.920]  then blow up hundreds of churches in one week alone in, where was it? Egypt and other areas.
[51:26.920 --> 51:34.080]  So all the tide eyes and all the trendy outfits and all of it is a cover that this is a mechanized
[51:34.080 --> 51:41.720]  army. If space aliens land and we're in tide eyes, as we speak about, we just bow down
[51:41.720 --> 51:45.200]  to them. Or if Hitler wore tide eyes and be like, well, Hitler's going to kill me,
[51:45.200 --> 51:50.400]  but it's okay. He's got a shaved Buddhist head and a big Buddha beard. And you know,
[51:50.400 --> 51:55.920]  he's wearing an electric orange, yellow tide eye. It's okay. He lets the ADL and Southern
[51:55.920 --> 52:03.000]  Primary Law Center. 50,000 of them at Twitter alone. This is the news. A million plus have
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.240]  been trained for big tech across the board. ADL, Southern Primary Law Center trains them
[52:08.240 --> 52:13.120]  in a two month course in the last four years. And then they are in your computer. They are
[52:13.120 --> 52:17.920]  in your private messages. They are in your email. If you use Gmail, and they are watching
[52:17.920 --> 52:23.800]  you and they're admitting they're watching you. And then they get upset if you criticize
[52:23.800 --> 52:29.920]  them and ban you. They're bullies. They're thugs. They're cult leaders. They're capturing
[52:29.920 --> 52:35.120]  us. They're imprisoning us. They're training us to live in a prison, a digital surveillance
[52:35.120 --> 52:41.280]  prison. And now they've got physical 200 square foot coffin apartments ready for us.
[52:41.280 --> 52:49.360]  Oh, but it's trendy. And the people selling it are wearing tide eyes. So it must be okay.
[52:49.360 --> 52:56.560]  They're not hippies living in some VW bus out by the river. They're not anti-war people.
[52:56.560 --> 53:07.560]  They're not non-threatening. They're evil. They're powerful. And they learn to look non-threatening.
[53:07.560 --> 53:14.840]  It's called camouflage. And as soon as you figure that out, the smarter you're going
[53:14.840 --> 53:23.320]  to be and the more you've got a chance at surviving. But I digress. Think about that
[53:23.320 --> 53:28.600]  statement. Twitter declares access to its platform, a human right amid censorship of
[53:28.600 --> 53:33.920]  conservatives. And they say, here it is, Twitter policy. We are deeply concerned by the blocking
[53:33.920 --> 53:39.800]  of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and open Internet is an essential human right
[53:39.800 --> 53:45.560]  in modern society. Hashtag open Internet. We will work to restore access for all those
[53:45.560 --> 53:50.400]  in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. But you know what
[53:50.400 --> 53:57.000]  they found out? Twitter was banning pro-government people with an AI program by the hundreds
[53:57.000 --> 54:04.240]  of thousands in Africa's most populous nation. Just like Twitter and Facebook banned members
[54:04.240 --> 54:10.360]  of the UK parliament and members of our president's band you've got in Australia. They're banning
[54:10.360 --> 54:18.720]  members of parliament that simply say we shouldn't have endless lockdown and masks don't work.
[54:18.720 --> 54:24.280]  Oh, the UN says you're not allowed to say that. Again, the UN says we can say the UN
[54:24.280 --> 54:31.840]  says we can do. Think about that. So you need to go watch the full Ted Cruz video because
[54:31.840 --> 54:38.520]  they get into all of that. But you're probably thinking what I'm thinking. This is pretty
[54:38.520 --> 54:52.640]  oxymoronic. It's hypocritical. It's paradoxical. To sit there and to say to you that, oh my
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.000]  gosh, we're so concerned about free speech. We just, everyone has a right. No one should
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.240]  ever be censored. No one should ever be blocked. It's a sacred code that we follow. We're
[55:02.240 --> 55:06.920]  Google. We're never evil. And then we're Twitter. We're never evil. And then they're just rain
[55:06.920 --> 55:13.360]  of terror. You know, letting Antifa say where people live, letting Antifa say they're going
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.720]  to come kill people at their houses, letting Antifa say we're Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson
[55:17.720 --> 55:23.680]  live and where I live. And Facebook says, oh, you're allowed to even prepare violence
[55:23.680 --> 55:29.120]  against Alec Jones. Because they're the liberals. They're the underdog. They're the guys fighting
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.600]  the fascists. They're Captain America fighting the Nazis, though they're financed by an actual
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.840]  Nazi collaborator, George Soros. I mean, it's their excuse to act like monsters. And then
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.840]  Andy Nego gets beat up again. And then, you know, Twitter blocks his account. Because,
[55:45.840 --> 55:55.000]  you know, you can't show Antifa go to Ashley Babbitt's memorial event and beat people up
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.560]  at the memorial. No, they got Twitter's busy blocking people that show Antifa beating up
[56:00.560 --> 56:07.080]  people at a memorial service for Ashley Babbitt. Because their job is gaslighting you. Their
[56:07.080 --> 56:12.360]  job is controlling you. Their job is dominating you. And you need to understand that. And
[56:12.360 --> 56:15.720]  there's not a bunch of liberals that mean well and, oh, they're not following their
[56:15.720 --> 56:21.760]  own rules and they're confused. They're corporate vicious criminals following a psychological
[56:21.760 --> 56:30.720]  warfare operation. IBM, Facebook, Twitter, Google, they're subsidiaries. Apple. Apple
[56:30.720 --> 56:37.160]  runs the worst camps. They've got major international rights groups that do analysis. And Apple
[56:37.160 --> 56:45.640]  runs the worst subcontractor facilities because they demand lower cost and they demand robots
[56:45.640 --> 56:51.600]  take over. And the Chinese come to them, the communists, and say, you need to just let
[56:51.600 --> 56:58.320]  us have a few dollars more a day for our employees instead of $1, $2, and they can have a place
[56:58.320 --> 57:03.920]  to live. And we wouldn't have them committing suicide. And Tim Cook says, put nets up so
[57:03.920 --> 57:10.480]  they can't kill themselves when they jump off the damn top. It's always mitigate us.
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.640]  Don't respect someone trying to kill themselves. Don't help them. Don't make their job better.
[57:14.640 --> 57:19.800]  Just put nets up so when they try to act out that they won't do it, they'll go somewhere
[57:19.800 --> 57:28.920]  else and kill themselves. And that's a satanic mind. It's how they operate. We're gonna come
[57:28.920 --> 57:34.120]  right back with our number two. I'm sure you heard about it. Twitter suspends organization
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.880]  for announcing they will release more Fauci emails. They get them via foyer. It's totally
[57:37.880 --> 57:42.640]  legal. It shows the criminal, oh, you're blocked. You're not allowed to do that because we were
[57:42.640 --> 57:49.920]  tied eye shirts. I mean, come on. I were tied eye shirt. I'm allowed to help murderers.
[57:49.920 --> 57:55.640]  I am blown away at how effective info wars is. I am humbled by how we're changing the
[57:55.640 --> 58:00.240]  world. And it's important for you to really internalize the fact that you are the info
[58:00.240 --> 58:05.560]  war. When you spread the word, when you financially support us, when you pray for us, you change
[58:05.560 --> 58:13.600]  history, you give my children and your children and our entire species a chance at the future
[58:13.600 --> 58:18.200]  instead of these evil, post humanist, exterminist globalist winning. And we're giving them a
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.960]  run for their money right now. So that's why I want to encourage everyone in the month
[58:21.960 --> 58:27.800]  of June 2021 to spread the word about info wars now more than ever. Don't be ashamed
[58:27.800 --> 58:31.480]  of info wars. Be proud of the fact that we have been in so many fights and that we've
[58:31.480 --> 58:36.000]  been so bruised and so scarred because those are the signs of our victories, the signs
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.400]  of your victory. And also, please financially support us by going to infowarstore.com. It's

[59:53.720 --> 59:58.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.720 --> 1:00:11.400]  All right. Welcome back. I mentioned this. It's a really good report. It's at infowars.com.
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:14.800]  I'm going to play just like four or five minutes over here that I'm going to come back in a
[1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:19.960]  longer segment and start drilling into the really big news of Trump and the announcement
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:27.160]  he's made that Biden will soon be gone from office. Wow. That's a big deal. We'll cover
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:33.040]  that here in just a moment. But here is again what Ted Cruz had to say that is absolutely
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:34.040]  on target.
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:40.320]  At first this morning, the Fauci Facebook censorship, we now know that Dr. Anthony Fauci misled
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:45.560]  or flat out lied under oath to Senator Rand Paul during a Senate committee hearing. But
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:50.960]  today we are learning more about his potential collusion with the social media giant Facebook
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:56.480]  to keep that lie going and censor very serious information about the origins of COVID-19.
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:04.240]  First, here's the Fauci flip flop over a two week period. Watch Dr. Barrett does not doing
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:09.600]  gain of function research. And if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:15.800]  conducted in North Carolina. And if you look at the grant and you look at the progress
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:22.560]  reports, it is not gain of function, despite the fact that people tweet that it would have
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:28.240]  been almost a dereliction of our duty if we didn't study this. And the only way you can
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:33.920]  study these things is you've got to go where the action is. So we had a modest collaboration
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:40.840]  with very respectable Chinese scientists who are world experts on coronavirus. And we did
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:45.680]  that through a sub grant from a larger grant to eco health.
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:52.920]  Wow. Okay. Joining me right now to discuss this is Senator Ted Cruz. He sits on the Senate
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:57.160]  judiciary and foreign relations committees. Senator, good morning to you. It is wonderful
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.280]  to see you this morning. I want to get right into the Facebook connection. But first, Senator
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:08.320]  tell us, did Fauci commit perjury just there? It sure looks like it. He looked at Rand Paul's
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:14.160]  eyes and told a flat out falsehood. And unfortunately, this has been a pattern with Dr. Fauci that
[1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:19.000]  what he says on Monday somehow isn't the same as what he says on Tuesday. But don't worry,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:23.360]  what he says on Wednesday is almost certain to be different. And I got to say this email
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:29.520]  dump that came out makes clear that this is not just being sloppy. It is systematic and
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:35.160]  it is systematically an effort to mislead the American people. And as you noted, he
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:39.760]  wasn't doing it alone, but he was doing it with much of the US government behind him.
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:45.840]  And with Facebook and big tech operating as an extension of the US government in order
[1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:51.000]  to silence any views that disagreed not with the science because he wasn't looking for
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:56.480]  the science. He was suppressing the science, but rather trying to silence anything that
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:00.680]  disagreed with the political narrative that was convenient that he was pushing at that
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:07.800]  moment. Are you going to be able to do anything as a sitting senator on these so important
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:12.760]  committees? I mean, look, Senator, this keeps happening. First, it was the Russia hoax that
[1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:18.840]  the media said was not true and they banned posts about it. Then it was an a fake impeachment
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:25.440]  trial. Then it was the COVID treatment hydroxychloroquine. We couldn't talk about that. Then it was
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:30.480]  the origins of COVID that they have egg on their face. We're also not allowed to talk
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:37.640]  about election 2020. Look at this timeline about the Facebook Fauci censorship. On March
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:43.680]  15th, Zuckerberg emails Fauci suggesting that they partner on COVID-19 information hub.
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:49.320]  And then in April 16th, 2020, Facebook posts steps that it is taking. It changes its policy
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:58.000]  quote to combat COVID-19 related misinformation. It claims February 8th, 2021 Facebook announces
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:05.520]  it will be removing more false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines. May 25th, Fauci admits
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:10.960]  to modest collaboration as we just heard. And then on May 26th, suddenly Facebook has
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:16.320]  to change its policy again, saying it will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:22.440]  mad made. I mean, what's going on here? Will these companies ever be held to account for
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:27.320]  this corporate dominance and misleading of information to the American people?
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:32.760]  Well, they certainly should be. Unfortunately, I don't expect the Biden administration will
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:38.240]  do anything to hold them to account. But these latest breakthroughs have real consequence
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:45.320]  because it now is clear that Facebook was operating at the direction of and in the direct benefit
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:48.960]  of the federal government. And that's completely illegal, folks. That's
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:54.280]  not just uncivilized. That that's a government censorship program through a corporation.
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:58.920]  And they're fencing it. They're laundering the censorship through them.
[1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:03.440]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:07.240]  much they care about veterans. But at the same time, they won't stand up for what those
[1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:12.800]  veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S. history. And
[1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:17.720]  now more than ever, what our republic stands for and is stood for is under attack. America
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:23.880]  is under globalist takeover. It's an information war. It is an economic war. But most importantly,
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:30.520]  it is a spiritual war. And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:34.200]  vaccines. We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan. We were the first
[1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:39.160]  to tell you the vaccine passports were coming. We were the first to lay out basically everything
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:42.440]  because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about. And that's why it's
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:46.720]  important to keep info wars in the air now more than ever. And for Memorial Day week,
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:50.040]  we're having store wide free shipping and double patriot points. A lot of great products
[1:05:50.040 --> 1:05:54.920]  are back in stock by DNA force, alpha power and pollen block. So to all the veterans,
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:58.040]  all the patriots we salute you and I want to ask the listeners, please support info wars
[1:05:58.040 --> 1:06:11.600]  now more than ever. From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. Okay.
[1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.160]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, June 6 transmission. We're into our number two
[1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:21.280]  right now. Let's dig into our top story that I mentioned at the beginning. I want to drill
[1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:25.800]  into right now. President Trump, he won the election landslide. We all know that the evidence
[1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:30.120]  is overwhelming. When they close the polls, he was winning in battleground states that
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:35.720]  he won by just a few thousand votes last time by multiple percentage points, hundreds of
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:41.080]  thousands. Some states millions of more votes. Just incredible. We know that happened. They
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:48.040]  gas lit us. They said, you're not supposed to question us when we say that Trump lost.
[1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:52.240]  Even though Democrats are always saying, Hey, we're going to question, you know, elections
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:56.040]  were allowed to do that, but, but, but you're not. And then big tech came in and censored
[1:06:56.040 --> 1:07:01.840]  and blocked and managed things. And even censored congressmen, even censored the president,
[1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:08.480]  took away his Facebook, his Twitter, silenced him so that he couldn't challenge them. And
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:14.480]  they provocateur the January 6th event to then demonize the idea of protest as some
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:23.800]  type of criminal insurrection. Now, Trump has come out this weekend and put out a statement
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:28.480]  on Friday that he put out videos that were basically from the statement on Saturday.
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:35.600]  We're going to play some of those clips now, but the first big one, he says that the Republicans
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:39.080]  are stronger than ever. And we're going to get more House members and more Senate members.
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:43.360]  And we're going to take back the White House sooner than you would think. Well, there's
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:50.880]  not another election for three and a half years. So what does that mean? It means clearly
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:55.720]  election fraud evidence is coming out. It's been documented. The states are getting together.
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:59.840]  We're organizing it. They're figuring it out. The Democrats are trying to pass HR one that
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:06.840]  legalizes the fraud, that federalizes elections that's unconstitutional. But it's very obvious
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:12.000]  what's going on. So to have him announce this, some people are like, oh, he's all a blowhard.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:17.600]  Oh, really? He never ran for office, ran once and won. They're telling him that if he doesn't
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:21.240]  back down and stop talking about running and stop controlling the Republican Party and
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:25.720]  getting good people elected, which he is doing, all over the country, he's getting great people
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:32.480]  elected. If he does it back now, they're going to indict Giuliani, Trump Jr. and then him.
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:37.400]  And they've got George Soros's minion, Leticia James, the Attorney General of New York, and
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:42.680]  they've got the New York City prosecutor, all of them saying they're going to indict Trump
[1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:51.440]  as a shot against the bow, a shot across the bow. And Trump is coming out and saying, I
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:56.800]  don't care. In fact, you're a fraud and you're going to be out of office soon. Wow, what
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:02.280]  an amazing statement. So I give it to Trump to not back down in the face of attacks. And
[1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:05.280]  it's easy to say he should have done this, he should have done that. You know what it's
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:08.720]  like to be the man in the arena? I've been in the arena. Most of you out there have been
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:12.480]  in the arena your whole life at one time or another. Some people, I guess, have never
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:16.120]  tried to be in the arena. But even if you try to stay out of it, you're still in it.
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:21.720]  So you might as well do the best you can. But I've been very critical of Trump not
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:26.560]  doing more rallies. He's starting them now. I've been very critical of Trump not coming
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.760]  out against the vaccine, but he's committed to it. He believes in it. You know, he took
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:35.320]  it himself. It's this tough guy attitude that, oh, it's not that bad because he likes the
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:40.800]  doctors around him. He believes in science, but this isn't science. This is eugenics.
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:45.960]  And so that's a big blind spot. But I can forgive Trump that because he's getting good
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:52.400]  Republicans elected that are pro-gun, pro-life, pro-family, pro-America existing, pro-border
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:58.840]  security. And that's why the globalists hate his guts. So, hey, he's not in there anymore.
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:03.440]  Don't have him to blame. Don't have him to kick around. It's all about Joe Biden. And
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:08.960]  Trump, despite all the demonization and all the attacks, is now coming out and really
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:14.000]  throwing down the gauntlet in a big, big way. And so he deserves our support now, I think,
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.840]  more than ever because if we don't take control of that Senate and if we don't take control
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:23.640]  of that House and if we let their election fraud be cemented, we're going to live under
[1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:33.480]  a permanent leftist, satanic, pedophile, transhumanist regime. But that's a side issue. Regardless,
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:38.000]  we have to take action and not just hope Trump does the right thing. But this is still a big
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.360]  deal. And I'm going to open the phones up tomorrow. I'm sure Owen, he loves to take
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:45.560]  calls. He'll probably be taking calls tonight, six to eight, right after I'm off on this
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:50.080]  subject. In fact, I've told Owen to do it. I don't tell Owen what to do. But I can make
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:54.520]  a wild guess that he'll open the phones up on this Trump subject because I just thought
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:59.920]  I should have. I should, but I've got too much news to get to. So, let's go ahead and
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:05.560]  go to Trump and his extremely cryptic statement. Here it is.
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:09.800]  I want to thank everybody for the tremendous support you've shown. We're going to take
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:14.240]  back the Senate, take back the House. We're going to take back the White House. And sooner
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:20.360]  than you think, it's going to be really something special. But the love and the affection and
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:25.960]  the respect that you've given all of us, it's really important. The Republican Party is
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.640]  stronger than it's ever been, and it's going to be a lot stronger than it is right now.
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:35.200]  We're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. Thank you all very
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:40.520]  much. That support has been so incredible. Thank you.
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:45.520]  And then he went on another statement this weekend to attack the fact that Biden doesn't
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:50.080]  know who he is and who the hell is running things. So, he's definitely going on the offense
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:56.040]  against the people that control Biden. That's Obama and the globalist and Soros. And so,
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:00.640]  this is a very bold move. I mean, this is, this is death-defying. Believe me, here it
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:01.640]  is.
[1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:06.800]  If you don't have election integrity, and if you don't have strong borders, our country
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:11.600]  can be run like a dictatorship, and that's what they'd like to do. I don't even think
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.080]  Biden is the dictator. If anybody knows who the hell is running that operation, could
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:21.000]  you let us know? Because I don't think it's Joe, but who the hell knows? Maybe it is.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:26.640]  The current president of the U.S. in exile, relegated to right-side broadcasting with
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:31.120]  a huge hum on the feed. And by the way, I'm not putting right-side broadcasting down.
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:36.480]  They're great people. But that's how rag-tag we are. Trump is in blurry videos shot in
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:42.800]  the ballroom about how Biden will be gone soon, and then he's on a humming video giving
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:50.280]  a speech, you know, to, I mean, and I'll tell you why that is. Anyone with any skills and
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:58.880]  any money that tries to support him, the media comes after you, the FBI comes after you,
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:03.160]  they take your bank accounts away. They did all this to us, and thanks to you, and thanks
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:07.160]  to a lot of work we stayed on air and got around it all for now. But I mean, this is
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:13.840]  like nipping talk, folks. This is so dangerous. This is so real. So I can only admire Trump
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:21.560]  when he's up there, rag-tag, swinging for the fences with all the obstacles and all
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:26.720]  the cards stacked against him. But at the end of the day, we're all in that position
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:32.480]  as well. But we have truth, and we have justice, and we have God on our side, and we don't
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:36.800]  have a choice. I mean, these globalists aren't going to stop. They're evil. They're twisted.
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:40.000]  They're mentally ill. They want everything. You want to go home and eat a nice dinner
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.760]  and hang out with your wife or husband and watch a TV show, or maybe go play golf, or
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:47.560]  maybe go for a swim or a hike, or you want to play with your dogs or whatever. You know,
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:55.840]  you want to go so – piece of clothing together. I mean, people have their own – you want
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:00.240]  to build a balsa wood airplane. You want to go see a movie? The globalists want to run
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:07.440]  your life. They like ordering people around. They like dominating people. They like controlling.
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:13.800]  So that's another huge clip. We're going to come back now, and I'm looking at all
[1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:18.600]  these stacks of news. There's so much. And in the last three segments of this hour, I'm
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:27.400]  going to cover it all. And we've got the biggest news yet on how they're going to
[1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:32.200]  strike us, and how the globalists plan to take over, and the next big fake crisis they've
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:37.400]  got up their sleeve. And then we're also going to hit the incredible news. In India,
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:41.400]  they're turning the power off the villages that won't inject everybody with the deadly
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:46.600]  shots. And West, West Point's putting people in solitary confinement that won't do it.
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:51.520]  I mean, it is crazy. That is all coming up next segment.
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:58.800]  Separately, tonight is the last night. Kamara, it's gone. Store-wide free shipping, double
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:09.160]  Patriot points, 40% off DNA Force Plus, 50% off Alpha Power, 50% off Super Mill Vitality.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:15.400]  It's all there. Apollo blocks back in stock, 40% off a natural antihistamine. It's all
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:20.960]  there. Infowarsstore.com. And this stuff works great. It's why people buy it. It's why they
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:28.680]  love it. It's why the globalists want it all banned. We have the double fizzy system as
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:33.960]  well. And if you don't know what that does for you, just go look into what magnesium
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:38.160]  does. Two types of magnesium. The other competitors don't have that. It's even better. And it
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:44.080]  tastes great. That's at infowarsstore.com. 40% off in game. Blue River Global Enslavedment.
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:49.240]  It's all at infowarsstore.com. Free shipping, everything on the site. And it ends tomorrow
[1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:52.880]  morning when the new sale goes up. So thank you all for your support. Take action today.
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:16:02.480]  We'll be right back. I've been on there 27 years. And we've gone through a lot of criticism,
[1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:06.880]  a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support. And so that's why I always take time
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:11.240]  out to thank you for keeping us on there. Because without you, without the crew, without
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:15.080]  our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air. And the
[1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:18.920]  world would be a different place. So it's not a power trip when I realized the great
[1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:25.960]  effect we've had. It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here,
[1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:30.360]  if you hadn't supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the
[1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:34.680]  globalist. Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening. And so many
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:38.080]  of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:42.840]  open. And so Info Wars credibility is higher than it's ever been. But the enemy is trying
[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:46.600]  to shut us down with so many different attacks. We've had to build our own infrastructure
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:51.040]  to stay on air. It's so expensive. So please get great products and keep Info Wars on the
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:55.480]  air at the same time at infowarstore.com. In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have

[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:18.960]  Thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity. Wanted to warn people
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:27.880]  my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years. I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:34.080]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse nine, then they shall
[1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:41.160]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations
[1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:46.640]  for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.200]  shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:54.720]  name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:20:19.840]  enemy hates it because God created this country. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You
[1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:27.200]  want to stop tyranny brother mainstream media government cover up. You want to stop tyranny
[1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:53.800]  will. So does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Welcome to live
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:21:02.000]  Sunday broadcast. This is a simulcast of my radio show via television over the internet
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:10.120]  and on stations across this country. All right, let's get to this for TV viewers. You can
[1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:13.920]  see it. I'm going to find out who this artist is and maybe even put a t shirt out because
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:20.760]  this needs to be seen. And it's the image of a looming devil, a big blue devil with
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:26.760]  the blue fires of hell with a young mother with her little baby toddler hiding behind
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:35.360]  her looking at Satan who wants to inject his Bill Gates juice into them. This is a real
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:44.000]  form of genetic overwrite. When a man rapes a woman and gets her pregnant, he's forcibly
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:52.840]  created a cross clone with her, a splice. And that's what this is. This is rape. Whatever
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:58.000]  happened to my body, my choice. This is their big revolution. This is their big move. They
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.440]  had to do it at some point. They want to depopulate us. They keep telling us that's what they're
[1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:10.560]  doing. And now it's here. Very powerful image. But now let's get to this. Village refuses
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:16.280]  COVID vaccine. Power supply cut off says the Indian telegraph, one of the biggest papers
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:24.760]  in India. And they're just reporting this in a very matter of fact way. So they came
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:29.040]  to the village and they tried to forcibly inject people. So the men got together and
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:37.680]  beat them up and hit them on the head with sticks. And so the government's paid to do
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:48.680]  this. And so they left. So the answer now is to turn their power off. Kind of like Texas
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:52.360]  didn't behave the way it was supposed to. So Biden turned our power off during the ice
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:56.280]  storm. By the way, Texas sent a letter and said, hey, we need to up the power of these
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:01.480]  coal plants. We can be put in jail if we don't get authorization or find. And they said you
[1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:06.400]  may not. Until the power went out, then they allowed the power to be turned up. It's all
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:12.480]  and it's a fact they did that. But it becomes some debate. Like when I say there's human
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:18.800]  animal clones. Humanoids are being grown inside cows across the U.S. I told you that 20 plus
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:24.960]  years ago and it was an MIT headline like three years ago. Humanoids are gestating inside
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:35.760]  cows at facilities across the U.S. They just throw it in your face. See how that works?
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:39.240]  It's just crazy. So they don't want us to form opposition ahead of it. So we say we're
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:43.720]  not for that. They go, hey, we're human animal cloning now. Not a damn thing you can do about
[1:23:43.720 --> 1:23:48.560]  it. And just hope. And by the way, we're going to send convicted pedophiles over to your
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:55.480]  house. The first is your school. You're going to let them have a little talk with your child
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:02.760]  about their sexuality. By the way, USA Today has put out a front page story about human
[1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:11.320]  animal hybrids and then engage in a major Psyop that I'll explain in a moment. But first,
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:18.840]  let's get back to this. The village refuses COVID vaccine power supply cut off. That'll
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:25.600]  teach them. Here's another one. Vaccine scandal. Rocks West Point. Connection being threatened
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:30.080]  with solitary confinement separation from the academy. Essential training is being refused
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:34.840]  and they are facing daily direct pressure from senior officers at the institution that
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:40.040]  you're not take the COVID-19 vaccine that violates the Nuremberg code. It's not even
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:45.920]  mandatory in the military because you can't make them take an experimental shot. Outrageous
[1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:57.080]  criminal activity. India opposes discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine passports at G seven meeting.
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:03.720]  France, the U.K. and the U.S. want it. While telling you on the news that no one will
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:10.240]  ever make you take it, then Bloomberg is like, we need to make everyone take it. No one
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.360]  wants you to take it. Don't listen to them. So we don't form opposition. Like, hey, we
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:19.040]  don't like anti-fuck killing people. They don't exist. Next day, they're heroes, anti-fuck
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:25.120]  heroes. They don't exist. Same TV program. Gaslight. And the same thing here. Oh, we're
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:27.960]  going to make you take it. Well, I don't want to. You're crazy. No one wants to make you
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:36.280]  take it. India opposes discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine passports. No trust. Top Republican
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:46.960]  Kevin McCarthy calls for Fauci's resignation of the COVID-19 email leak, but Raggedy Ann,
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:55.840]  AKA Saki, comes out and says, oh, no, we don't want to do that. He's the most wonderful person
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:02.960]  in the world. Trump says China must pay reparations for unleashing the corona pandemic. Fauci's
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:10.200]  NIH funded Wuhan military scientist who died mysteriously after filing COVID vaccine patent.
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:15.480]  Oh, yes, because they'd already actually created the patent under another name before. And of
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:19.800]  course, so that was such a big deal to have that that the front man that was involved in
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:27.160]  it had to die because dead men tell no tales. There's been a lot of deaths at the lab. A
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:30.800]  lot of people died of COVID before it was even announced to be released, but they didn't
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:39.200]  really die of COVID. They died from being poisoned. But now they're out of the way because
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:49.800]  we belong to Bill Gates now. And here she is, Raggedy Ann, breaking Saki Defends renowned
[1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:56.480]  public servant Anthony Fauci. Says no way Biden will ever fire him because they don't
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:01.920]  want that first domino to fall. Here's another big article from Gateway Pundit. The individual
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:08.600]  behind Obama's 2017 memo, reauthorizing funding for gain of function R&D, were the same individuals
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:14.680]  who lied and claimed COVID wasn't creating the lab. And guess who the main guy is on
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:22.280]  the board of all the groups? Anthony Fauci. And it goes through all of the grants and
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:26.960]  all the funding specifically for gain of function right there. Anthony Fauci's name is on all
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:35.240]  of it. They did it through the Pentagon, the US Defense Department, and then Trump killed
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:41.160]  the program. So that's a good thing for Trump. Surprise even knew about it. And so the answer
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:45.040]  is, oh, the Defense Department wanted to know what might be developed in the future. Oh,
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:49.080]  so you go create the weapon to know what somebody else might magically make. Yeah, right. That's
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:52.280]  for plausible deniability. When you say the Defense Department, it means, you think about
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:55.640]  the military, it's not the military running it, it's the globalist. People like Robert
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:01.080]  McNamara, people like Fauci. Look at this one. Indian Bar Association serves legal notice
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:10.160]  upon Dr. Somia Swamathian, the chief scientist WHO, who tells people that you can't give
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:15.680]  folks rendezvous here, even though it's like 100% effective. And so when they say that,
[1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:19.520]  then the medical systems of the world follow you in orders and won't let you have it and
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:24.480]  kill people. And so they're suing her to get her to stop it. See, that's that's how evil
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:29.800]  these people are. It's like water does not cure thirst. No one, the UN says you do not
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:34.720]  need water in the desert. The UN says humans are longer need oxygen. Humans need oxygen.
[1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:39.840]  Ban Alex Jones, the UN did not say we need oxygen. Well, but we do. You're not the UN,
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:46.280]  are you? I mean, the UN, baby, it's in charge of all information, you know, global government.
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:54.640]  Whoo. Had a lot more on this coming up and some good news. Federal judge overturns California's
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:29:04.240]  unconstitutional ban of salt weapons. What are champions made of? Here's a man who can
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:13.760]  show you. Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two five,
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:15.440]  three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[1:29:45.440 --> 1:30:01.920]  That's infowarstore.com Memorial Day 2021 is here and that means
[1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:08.160]  store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points at infowarstore.com and on top of it,
[1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:12.080]  a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the
[1:30:12.080 --> 1:30:17.520]  COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock and that's a good thing because these are
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:21.280]  products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for
[1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:26.960]  yourselves, good for your body. All of them are amazing but DNA Force Plus is again the flagship.

[1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:39.440]  out your mitochondria. The list goes on and on. It is 40% off with free shipping and double
[1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:44.880]  patriot points. That's an unprecedented deal. What else is back in stock? People are very excited to
[1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:50.960]  hear. Holland Block for seasonal discomfort, for allergies, it's back in stock. 40% off as well
[1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:56.320]  with a bunch of other items like alpha power and more at infowarstore.com, free shipping and double
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:00.960]  patriot points for Memorial Day. When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling
[1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:05.200]  products have been sold out for three months, four months, six months, seven months, it's not a
[1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:10.400]  gimmick to make you buy the products. I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:14.560]  enough of our great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation because
[1:31:14.560 --> 1:31:17.920]  they're great products. We're coming back and getting more and thank you for the support.
[1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:23.360]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's pollen block or whether it's supermobility or
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:29.440]  vasobes, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower the quality of
[1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:34.800]  our products and so we just can't offer them. But thank God it looks like some good things are
[1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:39.040]  starting to happen right now because suddenly a lot of products have been sold out for a long time
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:44.640]  are back in stock and one of them is pollen block. It takes a long time to get into pollen block,
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:49.520]  but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like allergies. It's from France. It's a special
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:55.280]  proprietary system. This is the highest quality back in stock infowarstore.com, store-wide free
[1:31:55.280 --> 1:32:02.080]  shipping and double patriot points. Check it out. This is a breaking Friday news alert. Ladies and
[1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:07.280]  gentlemen, the New World Order is in deep trouble. Their entire program of launching COVID-19 to
[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:12.960]  launch the great reset is coming out. But they are launching massive hack attacks against
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:17.600]  infrastructure around the world to divert us. They're also trying to start a major race war
[1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:22.640]  to divert us. And Joe Biden is running around claiming that he cured COVID-19 because of the
[1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:27.680]  vaccine, the fact we wore masks. No, all they did was lower as soon as he got into office,
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:33.360]  the PCR test from 40 cycles down to 29 or 28. If you lowered it down to 29 or 28,
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:38.560]  almost everyone is false negative. You raise it to 40, almost everyone is false positive.
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:44.800]  This is all a scam that makes Enron look like child's play. Only by exposing these criminals
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:49.920]  will we stop the worldwide lockdowns and stop future lockdowns. That's why it's us or them.
[1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:54.000]  The globalists either get exposed to go to prison or the great reset wins and we're all dead.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:59.680]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:41.120]  We're back. You know, I was just telling the boom operator, John,
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:46.800]  about the time I got invited to the Hellfire Club in England to go to a
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:56.160]  eyes wide shut type ritual. Yep. And I was told this in confidence. And I'm not going to say who
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:03.600]  invited me. That's a well-known person. And they, first I got a letter from Oxford.
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:07.280]  They wanted me to come speak at the Oxford conference. Whoever sent that letter,
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:10.720]  it was a dean's office. They wanted me to speak there. This is like 10 years ago,
[1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:17.520]  eight, nine years ago. Then I got contacted by the big Hollywood guy and he's like, yeah,
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:21.600]  I heard you got out of that. He said, you know what that really is. I said, let me guess.
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:30.320]  And he said, well, you'll have a lot of fun. They've got caves, I guess under Oxford.
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:34.400]  And that's where the original Hellfire Club is. And that's come out. Benjamin Franklin was
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:42.160]  involved as well. And it's basically the introductory level of showing that you don't have a lot of
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:47.840]  inhibition. And it's basically like a strip club in the cave where you have sex with the women.
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:52.160]  And that's kind of the introductory level to Satanism. And that's where all that stuff goes.
[1:34:52.160 --> 1:34:56.640]  And the reason I was telling John about it is Boris Johnson's wife is admittedly a witch.
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:03.360]  So was Tony Blair's wife. And I knew she was a witch, but he was telling me it's in the news
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:08.640]  that they leaked photos of her pentagrams doing satanic rituals. So I mean, folks, you just do
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:15.520]  not. Yeah, there it is. Scroll through it. Boris Beach Blonde X rated. There they are.
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:23.760]  So you don't get in the club. That's her in college doing a satanic ritual.
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:29.840]  You don't get in the club unless you're part of it. So it's not like, ooh, I'm cool. I got invited
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:34.720]  to, you know, the real the the most people would kill to be in the real Hellfire Club. Like,
[1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:40.560]  oh, great. I'll go the same place. Benjamin Franklin bang chicks and I'll have sex there.
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:46.320]  I'll be really cool. And I'll thank you. No, thank you. I mean, I got sucked into that stuff
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:52.800]  without trying repeatedly. Because so I've been like a little subdivisions, you know,
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:56.000]  that was pretty wild. But no, that's that's like, and of course,
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.480]  Helmut Schmidt, it was German Chancellor back when it was still East and West Germany,
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:05.520]  West German Chancellor. He wrote a book Men in Powers of political retrospective.
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:11.680]  And what a weird name to watch out when you search into that name, like gay porn comes up
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.440]  for whatever reason, but the the book's pre internet. So you didn't get a wide circulation.
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:22.320]  But he says I got a copy of it somewhere around the office. It's like four inches thick.
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:28.160]  Tex Mars gave me a copy of it. He admits the satanic rituals in Germany. And he says but
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:33.440]  our favorite place to do them is the Bohemian Grove, which I did infiltrate. So
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:39.280]  it's weird, man. It's weird. And that's all I'm trying to tell people. It's not like I'm just
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:45.120]  up here guessing all this stuff. It's not like I'm just up here like, Oh, I think this is how
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:50.400]  it works. I think this is what's going on. All of you have had experiences in your life that God
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:57.040]  allowed you to have so that you would be part of a larger destiny. And so I'm not saying my life's
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:02.720]  been particularly cool compared to other people's, but it's been insane. And maybe you've had similar
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:06.880]  experiences. I don't think most of you probably have. I mean, there's times in my life, I was like,
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:13.840]  God, why are you doing this to me? This is not fun. And well, it's because there's other free will
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:19.520]  in the universe. And there are some bad guys. I shot the footage. It's here right there,
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:25.840]  hidden camera. So I didn't mean to go off on that jag, but he was just, I was talking about
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:30.400]  how bad Boris Johnson is. And oh, that's why we brought up Boris Johnson. Here's this stuff works
[1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:40.240]  around here. Here's one COVID-19 news, Boris Johnson to set end 2022 target to vaccinate the
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:47.200]  world at the G seven. And you're like, wow, well, since when did the G seven group decide who's
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:54.960]  going to be vaccinated or not? Well, he said that when England took over the G seven for the year
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:02.080]  2021 in the rotating membership, that he would put Bill Gates in charge of the G seven medical
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:06.640]  response. You can pull that article up. So he said that six, seven months ago, now he's the head of
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:11.120]  the G seven. He's in the middle of the term. And there it is. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:16.000]  Bill Gates and discuss COVID-19 vaccine. And he goes on to say, I'm going to follow his orders
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:23.440]  on the G seven. So when Boris Johnson isn't having a druidic wedding, and when he's not sitting there
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:28.480]  with his stupid wife, who thinks she gets power out of pentagrams, and I guess she does, she's
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.840]  like, Oh, my husband's the Prime Minister. And look, I'm because the devil put you in there, you idiot.
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:43.760]  You don't have any real power. You're a puppet like Nancy Pelosi. Have you looked at her? You think
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:50.240]  that's powerful? You think though, you think Hillary Clinton's got power, real power? You think,
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:56.080]  you think any of these devil worshipers have real power? Oh, my gosh, you go in caves and have sex
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:01.840]  with women. That's so shocking, so risky. And then next, it's you strangle a little kid. I get it.
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:06.720]  And then imagine how you feel when you're coming out of the cave, you strangle some toddler you
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:12.640]  raped, must feel real good. No, you feel scared, and you feel empty, and God removes his spirit
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:17.840]  from you. And now you're wide open to Satan. Satan wants you to lower your defenses, do horrible
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:25.280]  things so that you are totally and completely turned over to it. And are like these two disgusting
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:35.760]  jellyfish that you see on screen. Disgusting jellyfish that are just placeholders for Satan.
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:42.480]  You know, Satan's setting up his feast, and he's got all the tables set up and all the chairs set
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:48.640]  up, who's going to sit where? And these people are all just like a card on the table. They just
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:40:00.320]  hold the place. The OSE articles like Boris Johnson's girlfriend, she's the reason he's going to
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.720]  turn out good. Yeah, and so he came in, took over Brexit, and is now wrecking it and heading up the
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:14.240]  G7 to sell us into world government. I mean, with his stupid fop hair. Oh, his hair flies around.
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:19.920]  He's like Einstein. I mean, I could blow dry my hair and have it stick up and look, my hair's
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:26.080]  hanging over my head. Like I'm a 14-year-old meth addict. Sorry, I'm going to Boris Johnson
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:31.840]  rant right now. Does that even really matter? No, look at him. He's like Igor. Yes, Master,
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:37.840]  what can I do for you? Supply us more children. Yes, Master, I will do it immediately.
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:46.560]  I guarantee you that guy's Jimmy Savelle. I don't think that woman is even his wife. Okay,
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:53.120]  I'm just saying it. I'm just saying it. If I was casting a movie and I had to have like two ghouls
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:58.000]  that go kidnapping children for a vampire that drive a weird creepy van and that climb in the
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:03.360]  windows at night and grab kids because you know, that really happens. He isn't a pedophile. He's
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:09.520]  the guy that kidnaps your child and delivers them to a pedophile. That's Boris Johnson. Okay.
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:23.120]  He is a Wrenfield-type operative. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Burn in hell, Boris Johnson. Burn in hell
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:32.480]  in your stupid Hellfire Club. You guys want to hear some Hellfire Club stories?
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:38.560]  Because you know, everybody mimics that. There's like little subgroups. You go to your
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:43.600]  girlfriend at church or whatever, you know. Well, I had girlfriends repeatedly. It's how it works.
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:47.280]  You know, they take you to the club. They take you. Oh, let's go to this party in the woods.
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:51.200]  Let's go there, you know. And you go, wow, I'm really feeling weird. Well, yeah, we just slipped
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:58.080]  four hits of acid in your iced tea and you know, the rest is a big blur. Next, you know,
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:02.880]  I've taken over the whole operation one time. It was ridiculous, but okay, I'm stopping.
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:08.960]  That's fiction, ladies and gentlemen. But seriously, let's just say I've been there and back. Okay.
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:15.600]  And these people are slaves. They don't have any power. They're empty race.
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:21.120]  And people like us that have a connection to God, we show up on the scene. We're in charge.
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:25.760]  Everybody already knows it because God gave us the keys to the planet once Satan's defeated.
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:29.680]  We have the deed and the planet's going to be a joke at the end of the day. We won't even care
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:36.880]  about it. You've got the deed to the universe. You've got the whole plans, the whole nine guards,
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:45.760]  the entire enchilada grandeur. All right, final segment on the next false flag attack.
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:54.400]  Straight ahead. Stay with us, my friends, info wars.com, news wars.com, Kamara's news today.
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:04.160]  I'm shooting this quick news alert on Friday, June 4th, 2021. You see this report from over a month
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:08.800]  ago? It's just now starting to break in the mainstream news as whistleblowers go public.
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:13.360]  But we broke it first and it's a banned video with 1 million plus views. We've reposted it
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:19.520]  at the front page of info wars.com. The project manager for Fauci bragged in an interview a year
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:25.120]  and a half ago how they created COVID-19. And then he secretly wrote the Lancet report claiming
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:29.200]  that it was naturally occurring. And then big tech worked with him to engage in fraud and
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:33.920]  sensitive American people. We're on air right now today and this week in covering it all at
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:39.440]  info wars.com, port slash show and news wars.com. Your word of mouth is critical. So take this
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:44.480]  report from info wars.com and banned out video and share it with everyone you know. And please
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:49.200]  financially support us to keep us on air during this critical time. And a great time to do it is
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:54.160]  right now with store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, up to 50% off on best-selling
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:44:01.200]  products like DNA Force Plus right now at info wars.com. I've been on air 27 years and we've
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:05.760]  gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support. And so that's
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.880]  why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air because without you, without the crew,
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:14.960]  without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and
[1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:19.520]  the world would be a different place. So it's not a power trip when I realized the great effect
[1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:26.320]  we've had. It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:31.600]  supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist. Instead,
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:35.440]  a lot of really, really positive things are happening and so many of the corrupt things
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:40.160]  the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open. And so info wars credibility
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:44.480]  is higher than it's ever been. But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:49.200]  attacks. We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air. It's so expensive. So please get
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:54.160]  great products and keep info wars on the air at the same time at infowarstore.com. In fact,
[1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:57.440]  for the week of Memorial Day, we have for one free shipping and double Patriot points.

[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:22.080]  by happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:27.360]  when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies. It's

[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:04.160]  really works. There are now over a hundred peer review studies in just the last year documenting
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:09.520]  that surgical masks do nothing to stop the transmission and the spread of viruses. It's
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:16.240]  a hoax. It's a fraud. Here's another article on info wars.com, a major German study showing
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:22.160]  exactly the same thing. But Fauci knew that he wrote a study himself. His name's on it in 2008,
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:30.160]  saying not only do masks not work, but most the deaths of the Spanish flu back in 1917, 1918
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:36.480]  were caused by people wearing mask and it breeding bacterial pneumonia in it. They're filthy diapers.
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:41.600]  Many people dying have died of bacterial pneumonia and they call it COVID-19 and the criminal Fauci
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:45.520]  and others knew it all. That's why it's more important than ever to keep info wars on the air.

[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:19.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:44.720]  I didn't mean to go off into the whole brand about the occult,
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:53.120]  but it's going to attract me like mobs to flame. And I'm still here. Thanks to Jesus Christ,
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:59.360]  the Holy Spirit, and I'm so blessed to now be firmly in God's hands. Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:02.880]  The deeper I get, the better. Praise God. Praise Jesus.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.640]  Thank God I'm not the hands of Satan. Oh, that's really all that matters, right?
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:20.560]  All right. Owen Schreuer is taking over and I guessed it right. He wasn't listening earlier,
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:24.320]  but they asked me, so what are you covering? I'm covering Trump saying Biden will soon be gone.
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:28.320]  I'm taking calls. I can kind of guess because that's obviously the big story. I probably just
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:31.760]  should have played that clip. Open the phones up. It would have been incredible two hours.
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:38.160]  Instead, you get me pontificating, but I will open the phones up on that subject tomorrow at 11
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:43.440]  a.m. Central. I would imagine Harrison Smith at 8 a.m. tomorrow will be doing it. Again, I don't
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:47.600]  call them and tell them what to do. Maybe once a month, they go, Hey, you see this, you're gonna
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:51.280]  have this person on, but I don't like because, you know, that's who I hire is folks that just seem
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:54.880]  to get it. You know, it's not like they get what I'm even saying. They already get it. It's like
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:58.400]  they're seeing the same thing, but they're not seeing what I see. They already see the same
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:03.520]  thing separately. They're not carrying my message. They're carrying the message.
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:10.640]  And, you know, like Greg Ries will come out with a video that I don't even totally agree with
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:15.440]  sometimes, but that's okay because sometimes I have different thoughts and different perspectives.
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:21.920]  That's good. Most of the time I totally agree with it, but you don't always want to be totally
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:26.320]  agreeing. You don't always want to just think you know everything you want to learn. And I know
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.480]  that's why you're here. That's why I salute you because I'm learning with you at the same time.
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:35.040]  And it's amazing and I am very thankful for God giving me consciousness so that I can
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:42.480]  commune with you. This is incredible. I can feel your strength and your will and your destiny.
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:52.640]  I love you and I swear to you on the altar of God, eternal resistance over every form of tyranny
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:50:02.160]  over the mind of man to quote Thomas Jefferson, I commit to you that there is good in the
[1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:12.960]  universe, not just evil. There is truth. There is honor. There is will to good, not just evil. I
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:20.400]  know I'm for real. I know I tell the truth. I know I love God. I know God's real. I know I love you.
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:25.680]  I know you're real. They tell you all day there isn't truth. There isn't justice. There isn't the
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:32.720]  real thing for all the counterfeits. There is the real thing and you, my friends, are it.
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:40.720]  And it's that consciousness and that interfacing with God and recognizing God that is completion,
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:46.720]  that ability to recognize God. It doesn't matter you can't pay your bills. It doesn't matter if
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:52.960]  you're starving to death. It doesn't matter if you're on your deathbed. None of that matters.
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:58.720]  It doesn't matter if you've got a Rolex on your arm. It doesn't matter if you're flying on a private
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:03.040]  jet airplane. What matters is your connection to God.
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:11.440]  None of the stuff's bad in of itself, but it's not God. It's not even close.
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:20.960]  It's just the trinkets that this body interfaces with, but it is the seeing a sunset and God's
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:26.080]  art and saying, I love you, God. Thank you for this. That's all God wants. God's lonely.
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:33.360]  God created us to commune with him, to worship him, and worship really doesn't mean bowing down
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:41.120]  in fear. It means worshiping because you are in simpatico. You are the bride. Christ is the groom.
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:46.480]  That's why Aleister Crowley and the Satanists try to make all their satanic rituals are about
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:52.640]  defiling the act of sex because the very act of consciousness and meeting a woman and having
[1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:57.840]  a child and loving her and loving him and loving your children and building a system. All of that
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:05.520]  is procreation. All of that is genesis. All of that is life, art and literature and culture and music.
[1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:13.440]  All of it is generation. It is building. It is life. It is the gift of creation. It is consciousness.
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:24.160]  It is all sex. It is the coming together, the Congress. God gave you sex. God gave you power.
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:28.240]  God gave you that big heart and that red blood and that strength and that vision.
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:36.320]  If you can see beauty, you have been given everything. Do you think the Satanists see
[1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:44.640]  beauty? They see only ugliness because they are turned from God because they are ashamed of their
[1:52:44.640 --> 1:52:51.840]  nakedness because they see something that awesome and they don't decide to join with it in their
[1:52:51.840 --> 1:53:00.000]  free will to be perfected. They decide instead to do whatever doesn't work and to go against it
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:09.600]  and that is sin. That's all. There is God's plan. There is Satan's plan. You can say,
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:17.600]  oh, I am not with Satan either. I am a real Satanist. I make my own world. I am going to kill the
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:24.160]  devil. I am going to go down to hell and I am going to be so evil. They are all going to serve me.
[1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:32.720]  It is a load of crap. You are going to sink to the heart of a black hole with other entities
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:37.520]  just like you and it is going to be a nightmare hell because all there will be is eternal ugliness
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:42.560]  because you won't have the light and the goodness to screw over anymore and to feel like as you
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:50.160]  vandalize God's creation that somehow you are in charge. You will be destroyed because you will be
[1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:59.280]  cut off from the multiverse. So, I felt like preaching tonight and I said I would hit this
[1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:02.640]  big news. Let me just try to hit this and then the other stuff I will hit tomorrow.
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:09.680]  And then Owen Shroyer is taking over for the next two hours. Instead of just running on for 10
[1:54:09.680 --> 1:54:12.880]  hours about it, let me just tell you what is going to happen. How do I know what is going to
[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:17.040]  happen next? Well, there is a lot of ways I do that but the easiest thing is they pre-program before
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:23.440]  they do it. And the globalists then brag and say we are going to bring down the industrialized society
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:28.480]  because we are going to collapse the third world and flood the first world and we are going to
[1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:32.480]  cut off commodities and manipulate things and get people to not have a family and to not be
[1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:37.600]  upwardly mobile and turn their life force off. We are going to chemically attack them and dumb
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:41.520]  them down. We are going to distract them with movies and video games. You know about all that.
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:46.880]  But in their own literature they say and we are going to basically you know society is going to
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.600]  fall. We are going to take over because hackers are going to get worse and worse and they are
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:56.160]  going to start hijacking and shutting major systems down. That is their excuse to start turning
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.400]  your lights out, jacking up your power, training you to not have stuff because they want to take
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:05.600]  it away from you and they are going to say these magic hackers are doing it when it is them who
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:10.640]  are going to charge you more for less resources, keep it for themselves and train you to be
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:15.840]  scrabbling around trying to get your electricity on instead of worrying about politics and what
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:21.280]  is happening. They want to keep you at a subsistence, subservient level. That is what futilism is
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:26.800]  so that you are so busy gribbling around in the dirt and grime trying to not start a death
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:37.760]  so you do not have time to read Greek philosophy. That is all. Period. They do not want you on
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:41.920]  the ball field. They do not want to look at you on the highway. They want you dead. They stole the
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:48.880]  planet. They stole it with fraud and now they want you out of the way. Again, people say why
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:55.040]  do not we just join them then? You cannot join with this. It will destroy you. They are delusional.
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:00.880]  They are idiots. The job is fixing all these people and helping them get to God. Not screwing
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:05.120]  them over because they are falling. You think God is going to lift us up if we screw all these
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:10.800]  fallen people on there? You think God lifted you up so you can piss on these people? You dumb ass
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:15.280]  devil worshipers just because you know more than the person you are feeding on? You think that
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:20.960]  makes you enlightened and empowered because you are keeping people in the dark? God is going to
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:28.880]  smash your ass flatter to pancake and relegate you to the heart of a black hole, you dumb bastards.
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:40.800]  And I take no pleasure in where you are going. Satan is a loser. Satan is a joke. God is everything.
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:47.360]  Period. Get with the program or go be a loser. But realize you have been given consciousness
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:51.600]  for a reason for the choice and the decision you are making right now. I will cover it more
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:56.480]  at the start of the show tomorrow. Cyber polygons finally in the news. Zero Hedgewood a great
[1:56:56.480 --> 1:57:00.480]  article mirroring what we have been saying but showing how they always run drills as the cover
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:03.760]  for what they are actually planning so they don't go to prison when they actually launch it. It is
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:10.480]  all here. It is all here. Cyber polygon. The next globalist war game leads to another convenient
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:19.840]  catastrophe. Crack the code, ladies and gentlemen. See it for itself and realize that little blood
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:27.120]  bat vampire bat Gremlin only has power over you. It is called Schwab when you don't recognize who
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:34.320]  he is. The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist. Evil does exist. Face it
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:40.000]  and deal with it because it is good news because good also exists. All right. That is the one for
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.480]  shipping ends today and the big sale. Appreciate all your support. Owen Schroeder takes over.

[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:17.520]  Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:22.880]  people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
