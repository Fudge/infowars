[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  We're going to sort through this a couple of times, so let's just go ahead and roll it now so that people can hear it, and thank you St. John Hunt for all of that background so far.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  Here you go, the first airing, the first national airing of the testimony of E. Howard Hunt from January of 2004 about the JFK assassination on Coast to Coast Live.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  I heard from Frank that LBJ had designated Corden Myer, Jr. to undertake a larger organization while keeping it totally secret.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  Corden Myer himself was a rather favored member of the Eastern aristocracy. He was a graduate of Yale University and had joined the Marine Corps during the war and lost an eye in the Pacific fighting.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  I think that LBJ settled on Myer as an opportunist parent, like himself a parent, and a man who had very little left to him in life ever since JFK had taken Corden's wife as one of his mistresses.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  I would suggest that Corden Myer welcomed the approach from LBJ, who was after all only the vice president at that time, and of course could not number Corden Myer among JFK's admirers quite the contrary.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  As for Dave Phillips, I knew him pretty well at one time. He worked for me during the Guatemala project.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  He had made himself useful to the agency in Santiago, Chile, where he was an American businessman. In any case, his actions, whatever they were, came to the attention of the Santiago station chief.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  When his resume became known to people in the Western Hemisphere Division, he was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  Spudes and Morales and people of that ilk stayed in apartment houses during preparations for the big event.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  Their addresses were very subject to change, so that where a fellow like Morales had been one day, he was not necessarily associated with that same address the following day.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  It sort of was a very mobile experience. Let me point out at this point that if I had wanted to fictionalize what went on in Miami and elsewhere during the run up for the big event, I would have done so.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  But I don't want any unreality to tinge this particular story or the information, I should say. I was a benchwarmer on it, and I had a reputation for honesty.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  I think it's essential to refocus on what this information that I've been providing you, and you alone, by the way, consists of.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  What is important in the story is that we've backtracked the chain of command up through Kornmeier and laying the doings at the doorstep of LBJ.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  He, in my opinion, had an almost maniacal urge to become president. He regarded JFK as he was, in fact, an obstacle to achieving that.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  He could have waited for JFK to finish out his term and then undoubtedly a second term. So that would have put LBJ at the head of a long list of people who were waiting for some change in the executive branch.
