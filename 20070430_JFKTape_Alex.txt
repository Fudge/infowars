[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:05.172]  We're going to sort through this a couple of times, so let's just go ahead and roll it now so that people can hear it.
[00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.032]  And thank you, St.
[00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:08.234]  John Hunt, for all of that background so far.
[00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:08.854]  Sure.
[00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:22.982]  Here you go, the first airing, the first national airing of the testimony of E. Howard Hunt from January of 2004 about the JFK assassination on Coast to Coast Live.
[00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:28.425]  I heard from Frank that LBJ had designated
[00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:33.638]  He was a graduate of Yale University and had joined the Marine Corps during the war.
[00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.352]  And lost an eye in the Pacific fighting.
[00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:26.253]  I think that LBJ settled on Meyer as an opportunist parent like himself a parent and a man who had very little left to him in life ever since JFK had taken Court's wife as one of his mistresses.
[00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:39.178]  I would suggest that Kord Meier welcomed the approach from LBJ, who was, after all, only the vice president at that time.
[00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:46.624]  Of course, could not number Kord Meier among JFK's admirers.
[00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:48.665]  Quite the contrary.
[00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:53.388]  As for Dave Phillips, I knew him pretty well at one time.
[00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:56.491]  He worked for me during the
[00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:57.972]  We're good to go.
[00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:35.966]  He was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations.
[00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:51.695]  Sperge and Morales and people of that ilk stayed in apartment houses during preparations for the big event.
[00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:56.798]  Their addresses were very subject to change so that
[00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:07.635]  Where a fellow like Morales had been one day, you're not necessarily associated with that same address the following day.
[00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:12.337]  In short, it was a very mobile experience.
[00:03:12.337 --> 00:03:27.442]  Let me point out at this point that if I had wanted to fictionalize what went on in Miami and elsewhere during the run-up for the big event, I would have done so.
[00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:40.177]  But I don't want any unreality to change this particular story or the information I should say.
[00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:46.619]  I was a benchwarmer on it and I had a reputation for honesty.
[00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:53.482]  I think it's essential to refocus on what this information that I've been providing you
[00:03:55.327 --> 00:03:58.529]  And you alone, by the way, consists of.
[00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:18.857]  What is important in the story is that we've backtracked the chain of command up through Kordmeier and laying the doings at the doorstep of LBJ.
[00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:24.239]  He, in my opinion, had an almost maniacal urge
[00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:25.487]  I just...
