[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.080]  major developments as global stock indexes from Asia North America drop on news of slowing
[00:29.080 --> 00:36.880]  U.S. and worldwide GDP former congressman Ron Paul is going to be joining us talk about
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.160]  this and a lot more today remember having Percy Smeiser on one of the famous farmers
[00:42.160 --> 00:48.080]  like 15 years ago that was battling Monsanto contaminating his crops and then suing him
[00:48.080 --> 00:53.920]  for having their plants on his property he and others said the word was they were paying
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.840]  farmers next to them to plant the crops and even sneak into their fields to contaminate them now
[00:59.840 --> 01:08.800]  Monsanto has been caught red-handed doing just that because it's a military operation they've
[01:08.800 --> 01:14.920]  been caught doing this in the third world as well we're going to be going over all of that we've
[01:14.920 --> 01:24.360]  got the latest from the situation in Baltimore we now have mainstream media promoting the summer
[01:24.360 --> 01:30.480]  of rage and asking his martial law what's needed we're going to be going over that and four days
[01:30.480 --> 01:37.480]  or three days after we began to point out that it was a stand down by the mayor and by the police
[01:37.480 --> 01:44.720]  chief and by the sheriff now Fox News has come out and said Baltimore mayor ordered police to
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.800]  stand down and let them loot and police have come out and said they were ordered to do that so
[01:49.800 --> 01:54.960]  there you go the conspiracy theorists were right yet again when we're not conspiracy theorists we
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.600]  saw what happened the stand down it's been done before it's a tactic to get things out of hand
[01:59.600 --> 02:07.080]  this woman works for the Justice Department and Obama basically and Obama's running around saying
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.000]  that we need to basically blame the police generally and pull the police departments must
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  hold officers accountable but now we're learning that the poor gentleman who got beaten to death
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.440]  was basically attacking himself according to people that were in the patty wagon with him and
[02:23.440 --> 02:27.280]  all I'm saying is we don't know what happened with this case the police killing us and people
[02:27.280 --> 02:37.280]  absolutely why is George Soros and Obama and the usual suspects promoting a collision course
[02:37.280 --> 02:44.160]  why are they trying to play the two sides off because the globalist live in Switzerland in
[02:44.160 --> 02:55.120]  Luxembourg and places like that they don't care if we have a civil war in this country that's why
[02:55.120 --> 03:04.080]  this is happening we're also break down a host of other stories like the army is testing handheld
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.960]  ray guns next gov.com currently testing electricity guns for possible use against electronics on the
[03:10.960 --> 03:18.480]  battlefield whistleblower targeted for exposing UN troops raping children new american magazine
[03:18.480 --> 03:28.520]  anti-gay state rep outed by guy he was trying to pick up on grinder it's always like that I mean
[03:28.520 --> 03:33.920]  I don't like the whole liberal socialist gay agenda but on the other side of the coin it's these
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.920]  people that are always bashing folks and are obsessed with sex that you turned out or you know
[03:39.920 --> 03:47.200]  in in all of this just never seems to end we'll be going over that US senator Rand Paul moves to
[03:47.200 --> 03:54.160]  block new net neutrality rules super news that's out of Reuters and I don't like Elizabeth Warren
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.680]  because I don't trust her but she's certainly a lot classier than Hillary Clinton I mean she would
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.400]  be better than Hillary Clinton I have to say that but a lot of big globalist monies behind her so
[04:04.400 --> 04:08.320]  you can tell she's bought and paid for she's done major flip-flopping but she's doing something
[04:08.320 --> 04:15.520]  that's sane that's common sense and then we need to hear more of and she's calling on Obama to
[04:15.520 --> 04:21.200]  declassify the trade deal we've only got one of the 30 plus parts that WikiLeaks released on the
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.400]  internet and it makes sopa and syspa look like pro internet pro freedom of speech pro first

[04:59.280 --> 05:05.120]  wannabe Hillary Clinton blamed the Baltimore riots on income inequality and race but what's
[05:05.120 --> 05:10.320]  really to blame in Baltimore and what Clinton failed to address are the democratic policies
[05:10.320 --> 05:16.080]  that have plagued the city for half a century Democrats run the city of Baltimore the unions
[05:16.080 --> 05:21.600]  the schools and yes the police force the city has been effectively a single party political
[05:21.600 --> 05:26.640]  monopoly for decades that's years of bad government policies that have been particularly
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.840]  destructive to any opportunity for employment and stability that are key to lifting its citizens
[05:31.840 --> 05:37.520]  out of poverty and while lucrative for the ruling party's cronies cradle to grave welfare is
[05:37.520 --> 05:42.880]  crippling to the people it alleges to help cities ruled by democrats have become the hardest places

[12:39.920 --> 12:45.440]  interesting you know when the directive talking points come out of the white house in the pentagon
[12:45.440 --> 12:52.720]  because it's the exact same talking points in 365 articles i just showed the 365 articles
[12:52.720 --> 12:56.800]  on screen of your tv viewer and that's just the ones we can find

[13:13.680 --> 13:18.000]  comments because i'm so ashamed of the redneck scum that live in texas i want to get out of this
[13:18.000 --> 13:28.320]  state and the article says that the governor and alex jones believes that there's going to be troops
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.720]  arresting us and taking our guns this summer i never said it the governor never said it
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.800]  and we're not backtracking here they don't have us on our heels we're on the offense aware of what's
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.240]  going on aware that this is part of a conditioning long-term program of federalization who can
[13:44.240 --> 13:48.960]  deny they're federalizing police who can deny their tsa checkpoints in every major city of texas
[13:48.960 --> 13:54.720]  now illegally we had to have lawsuits get filed in houston and dallas to stop it who can deny
[13:54.720 --> 14:01.040]  there's federally funded knock and talk where the cops come to your door and ask they can inspect
[14:01.040 --> 14:07.760]  your guns in wealthy areas of boston and dallas and in la i mean it's it's nationwide who can
[14:07.760 --> 14:13.680]  deny that hundreds of thousands of veterans every few months get a call or a swat team raid
[14:13.680 --> 14:19.200]  depending and have their guns taken no judge no jury who can deny the nsa is spying illegally
[14:19.200 --> 14:27.440]  against every american now confirmed declassified leaked who can deny the president outside of law
[14:27.440 --> 14:38.640]  didn't even sign an order just did it open the borders up january of last of this year who can
[14:38.640 --> 14:48.880]  deny it that was january last year my god time's flying who can deny i mean it's head spinning
[14:49.680 --> 14:55.760]  what's going on congress six years ago wouldn't pass his carbon tax to shut down over a thousand
[14:55.760 --> 15:02.080]  power plants he just did it and gave his buddies general electric total waivers do you know what
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.240]  general electric did we have clean burning coal here that supplied half our power or more now it
[15:06.240 --> 15:13.840]  supplies like 30 they moved and set up hundreds of new plants in mexico with no scrubbers totally
[15:13.840 --> 15:19.440]  dirty spewing pure mercury out the top and then that's what supplies the four states around texas
[15:19.440 --> 15:26.320]  when texas used to be independent and supplied four states were under economic war outside of law
[15:27.760 --> 15:34.960]  they built over a decade the first new oil refinery in the u.s. since the 1980s three point
[15:34.960 --> 15:45.600]  three billion dollars in corpus christi obama never allowed it to be open so we'd have cheaper gas
[15:45.600 --> 15:54.560]  pipelines that would bring in more oil drive down prices shut down finished pipelines
[15:56.960 --> 16:04.240]  every lead smelting operation has been shut down the last six years the last one closed
[16:04.240 --> 16:13.520]  middle of 2014 eight months ago we are under total shutdown right now we're under economic
[16:13.520 --> 16:20.080]  siege we're under a soft martial law if the stove goes up to to 12 they're at about a six
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.400]  or seven and they're just turning it up real slow and the frog's going man this hot tub's getting a
[16:24.400 --> 16:29.040]  little little painful but boy maybe i'll just pass out maybe i'll just lean back and let my eyes

[16:43.040 --> 16:49.120]  five minutes which is more like five years i might get out of there get out of there he's
[16:49.120 --> 16:54.720]  turning the heat up it's a weasel it's a weasel i'm not a weasel don't listen to that frog listen to me
[16:56.640 --> 17:01.600]  i mean it's ridiculous these are known liars and when we covered jade hill
[17:02.880 --> 17:07.200]  joe biggs ran in here over a month ago during the break he goes look at this jade hill that's
[17:07.200 --> 17:13.520]  army dot mill i called him i called some sources of the military you know they said it's supposed
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.600]  to be restricted blah blah blah can i come on here and talk about it i said yeah that's a major
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.360]  military exercise we always cover big exercises mainstream media covers exercises we go look
[17:23.360 --> 17:27.200]  texas is hostile in it look it says they'll be operating domestically and working with locals
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.240]  and police this is more of the same here's a bunch of other drills where they try to take our guns
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.120]  and here's what they really did it in katrina wow we better look at this now they're gonna show dirty
[17:37.120 --> 17:40.640]  bomb drills and reasonable stuff and say we're discredited and then they're going to say that
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.800]  we're saying it's martial law they're going to take over this summer that's not what we're saying
[17:45.840 --> 17:50.800]  but that'll be the siob and then that's exactly what they did and you can go back to those exact
[17:50.800 --> 17:56.240]  reports over a month ago and see joe in here and then see the follow-up reports because they follow
[17:56.240 --> 18:01.440]  a script when you've got thousands of newspapers the last few months attacking us every basically
[18:01.440 --> 18:06.400]  every tv station in the country there are five tv stations in austin including local telemundo
[18:06.400 --> 18:12.000]  i'm told i was attacked on that this weekend my lawyer called me and he said he basically
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.280]  saw me in the paper every day the last five days i don't even read the local paper and that i've
[18:17.280 --> 18:22.400]  been all over the news i mean they are on there saying jones says obama's coming with troops
[18:22.400 --> 18:26.960]  this summer to take your guns and then when it doesn't happen people who are weak minded will
[18:26.960 --> 18:32.160]  believe i'll just cover jade helm now they'll get all over the news the weak minded will think
[18:32.160 --> 18:36.720]  never saw me say it yeah that's that alex jones he said martial law was coming oh look there's

[18:46.320 --> 18:54.080]  street but i'm not in martial law because they'll never call it that you're already in a level six
[18:54.080 --> 19:02.880]  on a scale to twelve or seven martial law when they take your money out of your bank
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.880]  with no judge no jury no nothing now at the irs the new york times admits it nobody gets in

[19:12.240 --> 19:17.440]  nothing when a hundred million people are on welfare and it's growing when the government's
[19:17.440 --> 19:24.880]  openly announcing they're start raising taxes outside of law that was on abc nightly news like
[19:24.880 --> 19:28.880]  sunday night i would turn on television and it was just the president's doing what he has to
[19:28.880 --> 19:34.720]  help america acting executively because congress won't do its job it's all just phrased like well
[19:34.720 --> 19:41.280]  the furor is acting because the Reichstag won't do its job we're living in the twilight zone here
[19:41.280 --> 19:51.440]  here we're living in crazy town so we're already in a police state we're going deeper into one
[19:51.440 --> 19:55.840]  they've got military drills to take on the people we've got countless videos with the police admitting
[19:55.840 --> 20:02.000]  the m wraps are for the veterans okay period it's time to build your own emergency food stockpile

[24:20.800 --> 24:44.960]  this is in preparation for the financial collapse and and maybe even obama not leaving
[24:44.960 --> 24:50.160]  office i mean i'm telling you this is so huge online there is no shortage of people who think
[24:50.160 --> 24:57.360]  jade helm 15 is masking something insidious one thing is for sure troops will be ready
[24:57.360 --> 25:03.920]  and trained to take over your town when it happens they're preparing to initiate martial law and maybe
[25:03.920 --> 25:12.240]  even roundups this is not um a joke it's it's the real deal the army tells cbs news the operation
[25:12.240 --> 25:16.880]  has nothing to do with martial law and there are no death battles yet the exercises will take place
[25:16.880 --> 25:23.040]  in remote areas away from the public but after this map of the training exercises surfaced
[25:23.040 --> 25:30.320]  which identified texas utah and southern california as hostile territory the conspiracy theories took
[25:30.320 --> 25:36.960]  off my friends this is the declaration of war on united states soil this is in our backyard
[25:36.960 --> 25:44.560]  even plumbing repairs at several walmart stores true suspicion walmart closing stores across the
[25:44.560 --> 25:53.600]  nation most of them if not all are in the jade helm exercise vicinity jade helm truly is just a
[25:53.600 --> 25:57.680]  training exercise to prepare army special operations forces all right let's stop there
[25:57.680 --> 26:03.920]  operations overseas the full report is going up on info wars dot com it's abc news cnn i i can't
[26:03.920 --> 26:11.520]  even track it all and notice they took a little five second clip of not where i say this will be
[26:11.520 --> 26:17.520]  martial law this summer but that it could be preparation for obama to stay in office after a
[26:17.520 --> 26:24.640]  financial collapse which mainline analysts are saying could happen anytime how did roosevelt
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.040]  stay in office i mean i used to tell people six years ago that said obama was planning to stay
[26:29.040 --> 26:35.760]  in office as they were wrong he was just a puppet except now no president even lincoln didn't act
[26:35.760 --> 26:42.080]  this unilaterally on the entire country the borders are wide open the border patrol pays
[26:42.080 --> 26:47.280]  with vouchers to ship the illegals and their families in they're handing out millions of green
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.960]  cards and social security numbers and with those drivers license to vote and ordering the border
[26:52.960 --> 27:00.480]  patrol and federal police to let illegals be above the law my point is that's illegal that's a
[27:00.480 --> 27:06.000]  government that's rogue doing whatever it wants the same government the stage fast and furious
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.320]  the same government using the irs to persecute christians nixon had to step down over stuff
[27:12.960 --> 27:18.560]  literally one one thousandth and i and nixon should have i'm not a tricky dicky promoter here
[27:18.560 --> 27:30.960]  but it's just exponentially worse it's over the top and you've got this whole atmosphere of
[27:30.960 --> 27:38.000]  surveillance and tyranny and executive power grabbing and it's the public that's concerned
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.560]  the public and you know what that's healthy that when obama tries to ban semi-autos everybody
[27:42.560 --> 27:48.800]  goes out and buys them it's healthy uh that people don't believe known liars like bloomberg it's
[27:48.800 --> 27:55.600]  healthy that when the military is going to bring in thousands of special forces and tens of thousands
[27:55.600 --> 28:03.120]  of support forces and spend billions of dollars quote blending in and working with locals and
[28:03.120 --> 28:08.240]  then we have the training going on all over the country by marines by army by national guard do
[28:08.240 --> 28:12.800]  i don't need to play it again what are these m-wraps for therefore the patriots the gun owners
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.840]  and the veterans what do the manuals say patriots gun owners and veterans that let me correct things
[28:18.480 --> 28:25.920]  veterans of the number one enemy gun owners conservatives libertarians christians that's
[28:25.920 --> 28:32.000]  what the document says i mean i've got fort hood commanding general last year
[28:32.000 --> 28:40.880]  saying founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military and then just last week there
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.640]  are two weeks ago there was all these mainstream news articles where it said constitution founders
[28:48.240 --> 28:56.080]  sexist and racist and they teach that in the army i mean they don't train to fight russians or isis
[28:56.080 --> 29:04.240]  they train to fight the patriots the the americans the veterans and they just notice they show all
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.880]  these different alternative news media clips like we're cooks but the background are the documents
[29:08.880 --> 29:13.760]  where it says they're training to take on gun owners where it says they're training to take on
[29:13.760 --> 29:20.000]  the tea party there it is that's out of effect i want to get tucker carlson on about all this
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.520]  then i'm on in a while defense department of the south daily caller that he runs he owns the bible
[29:25.520 --> 29:31.360]  constitution and declaration of independence all perpetuate sexism and then you read the army
[29:31.360 --> 29:37.360]  training manual and it actually says it's racist too yeah but meanwhile that colonel gets up and
[29:37.360 --> 29:43.200]  bass drop and goes you see my uniform it goes back to george washington you trust it the people
[29:43.200 --> 29:50.480]  running our military now say that that is the opposite of our army we're on the march the empires
[29:50.480 --> 30:02.000]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network as protests over police brutality erupt across the
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.960]  nation i'm reminded of this passage from the capitalist conspiracy booklet written by g
[30:06.960 --> 30:14.640]  edward griffin in 1971 if those who seek world dominion can stimulate leftist mobs into violent
[30:14.640 --> 30:21.200]  confrontation with local law enforcement and also provide exhaustive news coverage so that the entire
[30:21.200 --> 30:27.680]  nation can see and tremble then the peaceful and freedom loving majority can be programmed to accept
[30:27.680 --> 30:34.480]  a vast expansion of government powers and even a national police force offered supposedly to end
[30:34.480 --> 30:40.640]  the violence we're witnessing that same old hegelian dialectic today by stimulating unrest and allowing
[30:40.640 --> 30:46.400]  it to spiral out of control the federal government can offer itself up as the solution sacrificing

[34:04.000 --> 34:09.200]  planetary war against individual freedom a planetary war against individual capital
[34:09.200 --> 34:16.400]  not controlled by a global crime syndicate gang combine of robber barron thug bankers
[34:18.240 --> 34:23.440]  and they've all written books basically they're all public about their plan senator berry goldwater
[34:23.440 --> 34:29.040]  exposed them ron paul exposed them ronald reagan exposed them when he was running for president
[34:29.040 --> 34:34.000]  you can pull up those videos of reagan talking about the trilateral commission this was main line
[34:34.000 --> 34:42.720]  republican party politics but the main line media beat the republicans into submission demonized the
[34:42.720 --> 34:49.200]  john burt society in about eight or nine of the 30 or so articles i scanned over attacking governor
[34:49.200 --> 34:53.600]  abbott for saying i'm concerned about jade helm people are concerned i'm going to make sure our
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.920]  liberties are guarded and we're not federalized i'm going to send out the state guard to monitor it
[34:58.960 --> 35:05.680]  they go oh what's he sleep with the john burt society blue book under his pillow if you read
[35:05.680 --> 35:13.440]  the john burt's blue book from the 50s all of it came true if you go listen to the speeches john
[35:13.440 --> 35:19.680]  birch gave back in the john birch was tortured to death but the founder of the john birch society gave
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.160]  it all came true i'm not a member of the john birch society but i know what's going on in the world
[35:26.160 --> 35:31.040]  because when i was a little kid my parents had friends that were in the john birch society
[35:32.880 --> 35:41.120]  guys that worked at the telephone company fbi agents cops uh lawyers that would come by the
[35:41.120 --> 35:46.800]  house they basically have john birch meetings and talk about the new world order and the plans for
[35:46.800 --> 35:52.240]  the country and the three mega regions and how they transfer our liberties into foreign treaties
[35:52.240 --> 36:00.240]  everything that's basically 90 complete and instead of getting a hundred bullet surprises
[36:00.240 --> 36:09.360]  for what they've done they get to have people like salon and the austral american statesman
[36:09.360 --> 36:16.480]  and bloomberg all these anti-american knuckle dragging totalitarians wearing a suit of liberalism
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.800]  attack people that simply tell the truth you know governor abbott has sued more than i don't know
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.960]  it's 20 something times the feds over saying you know what we're just going to take a couple
[36:28.960 --> 36:34.240]  thousand square miles of property on both sides of the red river in oklahoma and texas and just
[36:34.240 --> 36:38.320]  federalized it abbott says no you're not i'm gonna sue you you know what we're just going to shut
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.600]  down about a hundred something texas power plants outside of law he says we're gonna sue you you know
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.080]  what we're gonna shut down a bunch of ranching outside of law we're just gonna have the blm show
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.640]  up in east texas with no jurisdiction and not not even a court ruling and say you can't use your
[36:52.640 --> 36:58.160]  land abbott goes you know what i'm gonna sue you you know what we're going to just open the
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.720]  border up in texas and just floods you to be bankrupted by tens of millions of illegals
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.320]  and abbott says i'm gonna have the state police down there arresting people that have criminal
[37:06.320 --> 37:11.200]  backgrounds and turning them over to you and embarrassing you and i'm gonna have judges come
[37:11.200 --> 37:19.280]  out and rule against you i mean the truth is abbott is quietly doing what a governor would do
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.440]  he's not radical the country is burning down around us politically we're hemorrhaging out
[37:25.440 --> 37:32.560]  being run onto the rocks of debt by design and so they have it in the dallas morning news of
[37:32.560 --> 37:39.760]  and they have it in all these other papers that abbott believes that obama is going to invade
[37:40.320 --> 37:47.280]  and declare martial law of this summer he doesn't need to do that he's already in control he already
[37:47.280 --> 37:54.560]  said two years ago in the legislature said we're not going to let the tsa grope children's genitals
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.160]  and the feds said fine f16s are standing by for a blockade of the state any aircraft will be forced
[38:00.160 --> 38:06.880]  down or shot down that was in the associated press that's how the civil war started with the naval
[38:06.880 --> 38:18.800]  blockades and they've billed obama as this messianic leader linkin too and anyone that opposes total
[38:18.800 --> 38:27.120]  federalization that's really globalization is now a southern uh you know avenger the south is rising
[38:27.120 --> 38:34.160]  again listen i'll take a federal national government any day we don't have that we have a global
[38:34.160 --> 38:42.800]  corporate government we have been taken over i mean look at senator elizabeth warren today
[38:44.640 --> 38:51.840]  is she a conspiracy theorist what do we hammer here every day senator warren calls on obama
[38:51.840 --> 38:58.320]  to declassified trade deal details that's right congress isn't even allowed to see
[38:59.360 --> 39:05.280]  the secret 30 plus part multi-thousand page trade deal written over the last seven years
[39:05.840 --> 39:12.560]  to create the tpp transpacific partnership that makes nafta at least we had a debate about nafta
[39:12.560 --> 39:16.880]  they could see part of it they were always changing it back in the early 90s and now
[39:16.880 --> 39:22.560]  we know that we know these trade deals are one-sided screw jobs for select corporations
[39:22.560 --> 39:27.040]  to shut down their competition we have her at least coming out
[39:30.560 --> 39:38.080]  and saying remember this is an anti-gun probe and border globalist bad news but still
[39:38.080 --> 39:46.480]  it's shocking and and heroic that she would be saying you need to let congress and the people
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.880]  see what's in this oh my gosh like the fcc takeover or like all these secret orders on opening the
[39:52.880 --> 40:05.200]  borders or showing see how far we've come that secret corporate bodies are making our laws and
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.840]  81 percent to 83 percent the british government admits this of their laws are made by the EU
[40:11.840 --> 40:18.240]  that's unelected well a few years ago reporter called me and they go you say the EU is unelected
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.920]  they have a parliament and i went wow you're a fancy journalist you knew they had a parliament
[40:23.920 --> 40:28.080]  i know that had members of the parliament on the EU parliament like Nigel Farage and others
[40:29.600 --> 40:34.720]  but their ceremonial they only make recommendations to the central board
[40:34.720 --> 40:42.480]  and it's run by the IMF in the world bank international bank of settlements just like
[40:43.200 --> 40:55.120]  the tpp and the na u and the tpp and the trans texas corridor and all the rest of it
[40:56.800 --> 41:02.160]  you know the treaty to bring us into the na u is still secret after it was signed in 2005 in
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.600]  waco texas by vicinity fox paul martin and george herbert walker bush's son george w
[41:09.360 --> 41:15.760]  the average reporter out there can't tell you who was president of mexico in 2005 or who was the
[41:15.760 --> 41:21.200]  prime minister of canada see the truth is we're like gods compared to these lazy reporters and
[41:21.200 --> 41:27.520]  i'm not saying i'm like a god i'm a pathetic creature the point is we are light years ahead
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.640]  of them but see we're not like the globalists they're light years ahead too they can name all
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.280]  the people they can name the players because they're running it they they want to name them they
[41:37.280 --> 41:41.040]  want to know it because they run the show we're sitting back reverse engineering everything
[41:41.040 --> 41:51.680]  they've done the takeovers now public and just thank god veterans and patriots back in the 40s
[41:51.680 --> 41:58.320]  and 50s in fact i need to look into this because i i forgot to do it last night and this morning
[41:58.320 --> 42:04.640]  so i'll put the alert out kind of the bat signaled everybody my dad was listening to sergeant
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.600]  sam a retired police officer who does a popular it's the number one morning show here locally with
[42:11.920 --> 42:17.280]  mark caesar and ed clements who is just an unbelievable i mean ed clements sees me in
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.320]  the hallways of 590 and actually kind of bows up i mean he does not like me the other two are pretty
[42:22.320 --> 42:27.200]  good guys and sergeant sam i didn't hear his my dad heard it was on there and he's a smart guy he
[42:27.200 --> 42:37.040]  knows about as much as i do he's older he goes um you know this jade helm was actually a program
[42:37.040 --> 42:43.840]  under state department memorandum 7277 for total disarmament of the american people by the united
[42:43.840 --> 42:48.960]  nations and i didn't have time i forgot to google that and search that because i don't know if that's
[42:48.960 --> 42:55.600]  true i'm sure it's true of he's saying he checks his facts to pretty much a neurotic level uh more
[42:55.600 --> 43:06.000]  so than i do and i know memorandum 7277 is public they tried to pass it as a law i don't have the
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.880]  bill number in front of me but it was state department policy to federalize police under the
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.600]  ran corporation and then disarm the police and the general public and bring in federal global
[43:15.600 --> 43:19.680]  peacekeepers that's part of the demonization of local police that's why they train them to act
[43:19.680 --> 43:28.560]  like crazies so they could set them up so i know 7277 does that and i know they had a bill i don't
[43:28.560 --> 43:32.960]  have the bill number in front of me so we need to search is what was the accompanying public law
[43:32.960 --> 43:43.600]  that they tried to pass but couldn't in 1962 under 7277 and it's got the manuals in the
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.040]  state department packet in fact pull up 7277 complete total disarmament document just google
[43:49.040 --> 43:54.960]  that we've got copies of it around the office from congress originals but it's it's blue and it
[43:54.960 --> 44:01.760]  shows the un force growing in their helmets and tanks and then the us force shrinking and then
[44:01.760 --> 44:08.640]  it talks about disarmament of the american people and then modern july 7 2000 unity or united nations
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.120]  committee on small arms disarmament that's the same group recommending this treaty obama says
[44:13.120 --> 44:15.520]  he's going to implement outside of law and then congress won't ratify
[44:18.080 --> 44:23.600]  and in that it says it will disarm the american people there it is freedom from war yeah but go
[44:23.600 --> 44:27.760]  to scribs i want to show the actual document because it's got graphics of a disarmament
[44:27.760 --> 44:36.400]  and so that's why globally you see this happening but i didn't know that they listed the first
[44:36.400 --> 44:43.840]  exercise is jade helm except for an artifact remnant memory that i got chills
[44:45.280 --> 44:49.040]  barnardine smith who runs a big second amendment group out in california we need to get her back
[44:49.040 --> 44:56.800]  on she sent me a handmade binder about four about 17 years ago that had news clippings going back
[44:56.800 --> 45:02.800]  even the 30s but these were from the 60s and i remember seeing armored vehicles and troops
[45:02.800 --> 45:13.680]  in a newspaper photo like in georgia or something in 1962 and it said operation jade helm i need
[45:13.680 --> 45:17.200]  to call sergeant sam i used to have a cell phone number he gave it to me and i lost it
[45:18.160 --> 45:23.280]  sam cox is his name but the whole point is is that i'm pretty sure he's right because everything
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.440]  else he said was true my dad was writing it down he was talking about it driving in the car
[45:27.440 --> 45:34.320]  sure that was safe but the point is is that that's what's going on and so it's just this long
[45:34.960 --> 45:42.560]  standing program to do this and the other host was attacking him saying he was full of prunes
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.200]  and all the rest of it and then you know we hate the military and that alex jones hates the military
[45:49.200 --> 45:53.360]  and doesn't trust the military they play that game oh you think the men and women in uniform
[45:53.360 --> 45:57.760]  want to take over america we never said that we said criminals of hijack the government
[45:57.760 --> 46:03.520]  and are trying to incrementally create a culture of tyranny and look around you it's here and we're
[46:03.520 --> 46:09.120]  gonna have a debate about it play in your mind games that there are no death panels in obama care
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.960]  you know there's no special deals in nafta or there's no screw jobs in the in the this bill
[46:14.960 --> 46:22.960]  or that bill it doesn't work anymore with the thinking people we know what's going on we understand
[46:22.960 --> 46:32.320]  what's happening but i read this austin america statesman article i i scanned over i spent five
[46:32.320 --> 46:38.320]  minutes on i mean when there's 600 you know articles on average every two days 365 a day
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.480]  you know a thousand some days attacking you by name believe me you can't read them all but here's
[46:42.480 --> 46:50.400]  what's scary you sample 10 or 15 of them and they're all the exact same talking points these people
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.840]  are taking direct conduits from the federal government and this has come out it's been
[46:55.840 --> 47:00.560]  admitted it came out the sony hacks where they're being directed in tv shows and movies by the
[47:00.560 --> 47:07.760]  government right down to who they have and what they say and what they do super creepy but that's
[47:07.760 --> 47:13.760]  why out at the event in bass drop a few days ago we talked to a reporter from local affiliate and
[47:13.760 --> 47:20.480]  we said how many people were for jade helmet she goes it's 50 50 and there was two people out of
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.520]  hundreds and hundreds for it that testified just wasn't true but they just they they know they will
[47:25.520 --> 47:35.040]  ascend if they lie but the truth is you don't ascend everybody already sold out you you get
[47:35.040 --> 47:40.080]  nothing you lose your job you lose your country you lose your pension fund you lose everything my
[47:40.080 --> 47:47.520]  my heavens they put veterans by hundreds of thousands on no treat list when they're treatable
[47:47.520 --> 47:54.960]  they kill them they torture them they don't fix broken kneecaps that they don't fix lung cancer
[47:54.960 --> 48:03.680]  they don't they don't take skin cancer off they they don't fix their teeth it's admitted and we
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.200]  don't do anything for them because they're just like the babies and the old people write them off
[48:07.200 --> 48:12.480]  well you're going to get written off i'm going to get written off that attitude and the government
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.840]  in literally thousands of training manuals that have been made public because they distribute them
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.080]  to every police department and vary them and there's new ones every year thousands say the
[48:22.080 --> 48:26.160]  veterans the enemy we're gonna have a big war with veterans prepare for war prepare for war we go hey

[54:41.840 --> 54:48.080]  of him quite frankly i'm not saying he's bad i just don't 100 trust him yet compared to hillary i do
[54:49.760 --> 54:56.000]  we value being free we value private property and our families we value the right to self defense
[54:56.000 --> 55:03.360]  it's our identity we're not going to give it up not for a billion dollars not for a trillion dollars
[55:03.360 --> 55:09.840]  not for our lives we're committed and that's why they call us cult members in congress that's why
[55:09.840 --> 55:16.960]  they say i'm a cult leader at msnbc with almost no viewers their ratings yesterday it came out
[55:16.960 --> 55:23.440]  went down even more their average show in the u.s has less than 100 000 viewers do you understand
[55:23.440 --> 55:29.760]  how joke level that is but doesn't matter their talking points from media matters to msnbc get
[55:29.760 --> 55:35.680]  picked up by local affiliates and newspapers and that's their real power you wonder why does nbc
[55:35.680 --> 55:41.600]  keep them on the air for hunting 500 600 700 million dollars a year is their budget when they lose that
[55:41.600 --> 55:49.360]  much because they are a talking point for a giant multi trillion dollar global crime syndicate
[55:50.640 --> 55:55.280]  and it's there to direct all of its other subgroups and that's where they've got power
[55:55.280 --> 56:01.680]  your local newscaster is reading a teleprompter written by the white house or the pentagon when
[56:01.680 --> 56:07.600]  i said the pentagon i mean the foreign powers that have taken it over and does that mean
[56:07.600 --> 56:14.560]  texas is perfect no but texas now is almost by itself until saudi arabia did this war this
[56:14.560 --> 56:20.800]  energy war producing as much as saudi arabia the u.s was producing way over saudi arabia the
[56:20.800 --> 56:27.440]  number one producer in the world this is a war to shut down independence america could decide to
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.880]  be america again and throw off the globalist parasites and still be a strong world leader
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.760]  but the globalists don't want us to be a leader they want to use us to build their world government
[56:37.760 --> 56:44.160]  then scuttle the u.s into bankruptcy have a civil war and come in and take us back over later like
[56:44.160 --> 56:51.760]  the boxer rebellion like the opium wars if you study british intel and the opium wars you understand
[56:51.760 --> 56:57.440]  everything and that was stuff they developed in india previously with the british dutch east india
[56:57.440 --> 57:03.120]  company and then i read books by top globalists and they talk about it it's like i've already
[57:03.120 --> 57:07.840]  figured it out by myself studying history then i read their books from their perspective and they're
[57:07.840 --> 57:15.360]  saying what i'm saying because it's the truth but they're saying it from their perspective
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.400]  well here's the deal i'm not selling people out and if we were selling out some global
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.400]  corporate thing that was pro-human and wanted to empower people i'd still be against it because
[57:24.400 --> 57:31.360]  it would be a sellout a free will but man this takeover is hardcore anti-human eugenics based
[57:31.360 --> 57:38.000]  and at the end of the road is human exterminism i'm going to fight to the death against this i mean
[57:38.000 --> 57:44.880]  it's there's not even a decision to make be like a flying saucers landed and aliens got off and
[57:44.880 --> 57:48.720]  said we're going to kill every one of you i'm going to fight to the death there's no point in working
[57:48.720 --> 57:55.120]  with them don't you get it folks they're not going to stop they're not going to give you a quarter
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.280]  they're not going to back off and as soon as you get that it's liberating and then you're not going
[57:59.280 --> 58:05.680]  to back off either i don't care what they do to me what they say how they demonize i'm not stopping
[58:05.680 --> 58:11.920]  because they're stopping is to let them completely take over we're going to expose they're the ones
[58:11.920 --> 58:17.600]  behind all this and as i said we need your support now more than ever i need to get more reporters i

[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.800]  former congressman ron paul is scheduled to be joining us coming up the next segment i am your
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:36.560]  host alex jones there has been just an absolute conniption fit by the establishment testing a
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.240]  psi op on the american people through the pliant lapdog globalist media working with the pentagon
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:51.280]  to convert our country into a type of soft martial law police state playground our listeners and
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:57.760]  other patriots have forced a global debate about militarization of police federalization
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.440]  military drills military training confiscate guns all the videos all the training manuals
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.280]  and then one of the biggest drills ever comes up we find out it has all the hallmarks of other
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.400]  gun confiscation roundup drills they now admit basically that's part of it but then lie to national
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.080]  news and say it's for foreign operations which of course some of it undoubtedly will have dual
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:24.640]  purposes there are 365 articles currently i don't just say 365 because it's a total number that's
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:30.160]  the number google says in the last 24 hours with my name in it saying that basically i'm saying
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:35.440]  martial law is imminent no no it's not imminent it's already here we're not going to be put in
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.400]  the boiling pot of water we're in a pot and it's starting to get hot
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.080]  and now they want to demonize a true enemy of the obama administration somebody who more than
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:54.080]  the entire republican congress and he was attorney general governor abbot of texas
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:02.640]  has come out and said listen i'm concerned about our civil liberties and our freedoms and sovereignty
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.880]  because he understands we're being federally taken over so he says he's going to have the
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.960]  state guard monitor it and so they lie about what he said the americans are coming the americans are
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.480]  coming making fun of paul revere we have back then the red coats were british they were british
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.560]  and they had become the enemy the oppressor so they were saying the red coats the military
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.560]  they were saying the british are coming the british are coming our people are coming we're
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.440]  now breaking with them but this is the americans this is the globalist sympathizers that run our
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.680]  military our military don't want to carry out this mission our military knows what's going on
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.720]  they want to run these drills also to find out who in the military like patrina was a test
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.680]  will go along with gun confiscation and you know a lot of the leaders of jade helm are people that
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.720]  took part we're looking into this right now we have some intel on it in gun confiscation in patrina
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.360]  and see they're just corporate climbers they don't want to be in the military to protect the republic
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:03.040]  to protect our liberties or that oath they swore to they're there to oppress and dominate and go to
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.760]  high and dry houses during an emergency and take guns out of safes and give them to the fbi
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.080]  and the military is begging the public to say no to this and stop this and it was mainly veterans
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.000]  out there and bass dropped by the hundreds saying no to it they see through the scyop and that's why
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.720]  they're listed as the enemy and they'll have mayors order stand downs caught red-handed and
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.640]  baltimore to get riots going this is their plan to destabilize the country i don't know if it's
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.920]  going to be race riots economic collapse a major war or a combination of all of those or part of
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:42.720]  those but preparation under clinton for martial law was about a two or three but it was still shocking
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.680]  under bush it was a different type of martial law just taken over the system but not a preparation
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:56.000]  to take on the patriots so much under obama it's just the preparation is not exaggerate
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.680]  a hundred times what it was under clinton i mean it's
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:11.200]  it's a full-on attempted takeover just not even executive orders to just just power grab
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.040]  it's already happened when the president's ruling by executive fiat and the borders are wide open
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.320]  and he's funding isis and claiming he's fighting isis and they're just doing whatever they want
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.880]  and there's huge military drills everywhere and tsa on the streets and nsa spying on you without
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:37.600]  warrants you're living in a bona fide tyranny and i know you as an audience know that from your own
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.880]  research but we've got to reach out the public and show them the scam and go hey did you know

[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.880]  hey did you know that alex didn't say martial law was coming this summer but this was just
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:01.520]  more conditioning towards ultimate tyranny down the road i'm not concerned with your liking or
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.560]  disliking me all i ask is that you treat me as a human being jackie robinson when people
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:15.120]  don't like what you represent they'll oftentimes attack you personally but if you can endure you
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:23.280]  may just pave the way for those who follow you jesus said i say to you love your enemies bless
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:30.080]  those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you

[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:40.400]  by yours truly our news websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and we'll

[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:59.440]  and others out there across the country first off it's great to have you back dr paul thank you
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.680]  it's good to be with you wow first thing i want to get into you've been talking about a big
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:11.200]  monetary event coming the global devaluation of currencies uh the qe unlimited now we hear that
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:16.480]  really the growth despite all the money printing was zero point two percent that's with cook numbers
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.240]  showing it's probably even two or three percent negative uh we have the headlines us stocks drop
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:29.600]  as gdp comes in week uh on top of that what does this signify and how close are we to the big event
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:35.040]  well you know they give us the numbers they fudge them but the wall streeters still believe it but
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.080]  i think they're getting more reluctant that market is pretty shaky but the other day when they gave
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:47.120]  us the gdp number they said it was what point two increase but if you looked at the inventory increase
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.440]  they use that as a positive all they're building up people are going to buy but sometimes the
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.880]  inventory builds up because nobody's buying and if you remove that which i think is artificial you
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.440]  have and i think you mentioned a negative growth it was probably down a couple percent and there's
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.480]  a limit to how much bad news can be twisted into being good news and i think they're running out of
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.640]  steam i think that the fed has printed so much for so long this is why i'm predicting that the
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.600]  and you've heard me talk about it for years the vulnerability of the dollar and we've had a free
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.400]  ride for a long time we would have the reserve currency of the world and people have been more
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.200]  less forced to it but there are countries now thinking about alternatives and there's other
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.160]  countries that are buying the gold uh so i think uh even even technically look speaking right now
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:40.160]  the dollar's looking uh like it may have already started down you know it's uh it was up like 35
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.960]  percent in the last year or two and and now it's turning around and starting down i think we're
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.720]  still seeing the beginning of the falling dollar the big question is is people only look at the
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.920]  other currencies say oh the dollar's falling does that mean we have to buy euros or something else
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.920]  no it's all a mess and when the dollar crash comes people won't trust any of the currencies
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.480]  they'll go to real money they will buy gold and silver they're going to latch on to anything
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:13.040]  that's real and even real estate and other things like this will serve as a preservation of wealth
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:19.920]  and it won't be in holding dollars unfortunately i don't see how you could economically be
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.880]  incorrect about what you're saying and even mainline analysts admit that no bubble's ever gone this far
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.760]  my concern is historically how you've studied Austrian economics and history dr paul
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.640]  the bigger the bubble the worse the calamity and then you add the record dependency of 100
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.640]  million americans on some form of assistance and you add to that the uh rapacious paramilitary
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:49.600]  nature of western governments that sounds like a recipe for a perfect storm of really hellish
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:56.480]  repercussions uh when the bubble pops yeah and this is why i assume and i'm sure you agree that
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.760]  it's going to be even worse than 08 and 09 you know the crisis hit uh the debt was the problem the
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:09.360]  debt was bought by the taxpayer and it was all transferred to the taxpayer through the fed the
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:16.960]  big guys rebelled out and the amount of debt worldwide that has increased since the uh
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:24.160]  since the crisis of 09 is 35 trillion dollars of more debt so there was no correction whatsoever
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.880]  and no growth now the canyons are real please well we saved your life we saved wall street otherwise
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.760]  the whole thing would have come down on it but it comes down maybe a little slower and a little
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.680]  differently by propping it up with an illusion so the system has been propped up but it's all
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:48.560]  a fallacy it's all a myth that there's wealth growth out there there's uh uh more people dependent
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.760]  on government half the people don't work more people on food stamps real car real labor values
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:02.240]  have not gone up since since the brenton woods broke down in the in the 70s so uh that's why
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:09.280]  there's this fight going on between the rich and the poor and unfortunately the people that we might
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.800]  even agree with when they make these statements are using it as a tool to bash freedom and and
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.320]  free markets and say well the rich are getting rich and they're gouging everybody else but
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:26.080]  they're getting rich because they're part of the government but uh you don't uh but they'd like to end
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:32.080]  this whole idea that that the solution isn't well what we need to do is tax the uh productive
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.240]  people so that we can take care of them but they've been they've been doing it and we're in a mess
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.040]  and i think like i you said the crisis is worse now than ever before well i mean look at the
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.600]  usual suspects warren buffett it was the biggest promoter and lobbyer for the bailout and he was
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.720]  the biggest recipient mclatch he reported 400 something billion dollars this company he himself
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.400]  got like two billion dollars of taxpayer money uh it's just incredible and then he gets up there
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:02.560]  and calls for taxing the rich he means people making 125 000 a year that's not rich that's who
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:09.200]  produces that's who hires people that's who buys things so it's the ultra rich uh trying to create
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.480]  a giant dependent class that's always been their plan and and now they're scapegoating capitalism
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:23.440]  for for for what they've created what would you call this corporates fascist crony would you call
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.120]  it crony capitalism what's the best name for it dr paul the current system a crony capitalism is
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.360]  pretty good but if you want to get closer to what is coming and we might have a bit of it now is
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.760]  pure fascism where it's a combination of a partnership between big business and big banking
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.720]  and government and it's not a partisan thing most people get to think oh yeah all we need is
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.840]  hillary and the democrats and they'll straighten this mess out and but this one thing is neat about
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:57.440]  what we're reading and hearing about hillary is it's so disproving but i just can't imagine people
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:04.800]  still believing that the democrats are less likely to be involved in this scam than the republicans
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:10.160]  and but they're both trained by the same economist they're all kingsians their own revenge and this
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.880]  they're all authoritarians and the principle of liberty doesn't even cross their mind they don't
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:20.320]  have the vaguest notion about it they believe that you have to have the elite who are the
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.720]  authoritarians and they'll pretend they're going to take care of people at the same time all they
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:30.160]  do is build up their power eventually it ends because the currency will end and that's what
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.560]  we're starting to see happening right now dr paul the ron paul institutes fighting it with
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.840]  an incredible intellectual research and documentation your son's fighting it uh the leader of the
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:48.240]  presidential pack right now for republican candidates uh the governor abbott is suing
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.960]  the federal government over its tyranny there's a lot of good news coming out i want to talk to you
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:58.320]  about that but the power structure and all these manuals and documents i'm going to play a clip
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:04.160]  of this in a moment a police being asked in indiana and in washington you know why are you getting
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.800]  m wraps and they say it's for the patriots it's for the veterans it's for the gun owners you remember
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.200]  that first mic report we got six years ago that listed you and at first your office was calling
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.240]  me going alex is this really real i'm like no we got it we got it from the state police it's real
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:24.880]  later they admitted it what are the totalitarians the fascist going to do with the tens of millions
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.920]  of americans of every race color and creed and a large portion of college students and others
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.760]  that understand what's happening and aren't going to go along well they're going to continue with
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.840]  the corruption and expand the corruption in the judicial system and this is this is what really
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.360]  is the problem because uh you know how have a lot of people breaking the law you have a portray us
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.920]  that breaks the law and he gets his hands slapped then you read about the clins they don't get anything
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.080]  you read about it edward snowden who's a who is a patriotic hero and then he loses the uh he's a
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.840]  man without a country so it's turned on his head but what really is uh something that we ought to
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:11.040]  be very resentful of and get changed is the authoritarians use the irs they use all these
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:17.840]  regulations they punish their enemies nobody can understand the regulations but go get into a federal
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.000]  court and they are in charge there's no doubt about it and and we have had this federal takeover
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.520]  already you know a hundred thousand federal bureaucrats who carry guns you know we worry
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.120]  about the future but i'm worried about the present you know uh but where i'm encouraged and i know
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:41.600]  you get some encouragement too is that people are waking up i think nullification is here to stay
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.600]  with us states will eventually say look you've overstepped your bounds and especially when
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.720]  the dollar won't work that's when you're going to see this the uh individual states and individuals
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.000]  tailing upon themselves to protect themselves and that is what i think is coming in this is
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.240]  is maniac draw war on drugs has finally driven a lot of conservatives and liberals to come together
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.960]  and say and hey look the fed shouldn't be involved in this because that's where our prisons are
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:16.480]  overflowing 90 percent of the prisoners are involved with the drug dealing and drug usage and
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.920]  most of them are a large number are nonviolent people so we have a mess there but it's the
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:28.560]  judicial system and i think the drug laws have been unfairly enforced and all kinds of reasons
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:35.040]  for that and as many of us worried about i mean we see our city starting to explode and let's hope
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:40.240]  it can be settled down so we can serve a little bit of improvement but right now it looks like
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:47.040]  uh it could expand well that brings me to my next question obviously the feds of militarized
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.880]  the police hillary comes out and says you know we have to have police accountable uh we can't
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.320]  have militarization went under clinton the war on drugs exploded the militarization that's when it
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:05.040]  really expanded uh it's accelerated now under obama also under bush but it's the war on drugs
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.040]  that militarized police but then separately you have george soros and the left and obama uh
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.520]  and and and biden going out and saying the republicans want to put your chains back on the cops
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.240]  want to kill you because they can't give them jobs black unemployment's doubled under obama
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.200]  so they're going to give them i guess racial identity and and in fighting and then the the
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.480]  mayor orders a stand down so they can get things going i'm really concerned this could be a false
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.960]  flag coming up this summer as the media hypes these tragic deaths to try to get something
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.880]  like the sixties going again can you speak to that sir well that's all that's always possible
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.640]  but you know we had a very bad example of the authoritarians taken over after the bombing
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:53.520]  in boston you know that was a good practice session so i think they're going to continue
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:20:00.320]  to do that it's not like uh you know the principles and the power behind fema that's not brand new
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.360]  but uh i think so much of that has already occurred i think some of the activity goes on
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.080]  it's sort of conditioning the people to say well if you know we'll have this and we'll have some
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:16.000]  training here and the people sort of say well you know uh they didn't take over the whole country uh
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.800]  so they they try to talk themselves out of it the thing that bugs me the most has come up
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:29.840]  since 9 11 is that too many people are complacent and actually encourage it the media is horrible
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.480]  the political politicians are horrible but too many individuals say ronnie you got to realize
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.040]  you got to give up some of your freedoms to be safe and that's why you should have voted for
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.640]  the patriot act you know that stuff still is around you know they're still talking that way
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:54.480]  but people safety and security is is uh valued more than their liberty and of course you know
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.200]  what that ends up with well we know that when you give up liberty you get ultimate insecurity
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:04.400]  you get enslavement uh ron paul is our guest we've got a few minutes left with him doctor i
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.800]  want to get into something you talked a lot about in the last 30 years of your public life
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.080]  and that was the slow militarization of police now it's become a big national issue even the
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.280]  new york time says it's a problem they admit that the irs has taken people's bank accounts for no
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:25.680]  reason i mean the irs is persecuting the tea party and and ribs i mean we're really already living
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.200]  i think under a form of martial law as you said we're being phased into total fascism
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:37.200]  or complete fascism uh the governor abbott came out and put a tweet out two days ago saying i want
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.760]  to make sure our liberties are watched and and the texas sovereignty is watched i'm going to dispatch
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.240]  the texas guard to watch jade helm i never said we broke jade helm a month ago that it would be
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:52.320]  martial law i never said that uh obama was coming to take the state i said it was more conditioning
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:58.960]  but they have had literally thousands of articles the last month 300 plus yesterday every channel
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:04.640]  in austin national news every channel saying i'm saying there's going to be martial law the governor
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:09.920]  is uh and that we're all cooks they're attacking rand's been sucked into it what do you do about
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:16.640]  the straw men where they go oh there is no nsa and there is or oh alex says there's going to be
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.520]  martial law when all we're saying is there's this continued march and they admit in forbes that the
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.160]  army is training to take on the tea party i mean we have clips of them saying the m wraps are for
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:35.200]  the veterans so so basically your take on this this incremental boiling frog and then these these
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:40.960]  i guess you call straw men where they claim we said something that we didn't really say
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:46.960]  and then when total martial law doesn't come they say we're discredited yeah that that's the way
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.680]  that's the way they work i guess we do our best to just get the truth out there and i think more
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:58.080]  people are are looking for the truth and are skeptical of all of all the propaganda uh so
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:05.840]  but i i was sort of i thought that uh this habit uh ruling or sending the national guard there was
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:11.760]  a reflection that there is a sentiment with enough people that he is responding i don't i don't know
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:19.760]  the governor and i don't know personally where his uh his views are but i think he senses that he
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.160]  has to respond to this because there's enough people who are worried about it but both sides
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:30.240]  might be doing some of the grandstanding you know and so often though that that can get get out of
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:36.160]  hand i think what what is happening now is that we have we know about the militarization of the
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:42.960]  police and the overreaction and the difficulty with the drug war but we also notice that uh
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:49.040]  there are some people in that are on the receiving end of excessive police force
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:55.200]  are overreacting too and they become very very violent and and people can get pretty nervous
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:01.920]  about that as well but the big overwhelming thing that drives the problem in the inner city
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:11.280]  is back to economics yes if we had a thriving economy uh the uh the the problems in the inner
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.800]  city wouldn't be there but if you have an entitlement system and if you have case in economics if you
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:23.120]  have a federal reserve uh fixing it up for the rich then the rich getting richer and the remaining
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:27.600]  part of the middle class the upper middle class that might be remaining and producing the rich
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.400]  even go after them and they're going to tax them and try to keep this thing going but one thing for
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.000]  sure we don't know when they'll end but it will end it's being capable of going for a long periods
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.320]  of time there's never been a paper currency uh you know it lasts for uh you know an indefinite
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.600]  period of time they always end and this one is gone on for way too long it's bigger than ever
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.160]  there's never been a fiat currency like the dollar that's right golfing the entire world
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.360]  like it is today and they're clearly enclosing gearing up during a collapse to try to uh
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.600]  accelerate into tyranny i want to play a 10-second clip for you to see if you've heard it from
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.520]  morgan county indiana one of dozens we have with them saying the m-wrap tanks are for the veterans
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:16.160]  here's the clip we really didn't have the the violence that we see today um the weaponry is
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.520]  totally different now than it wasn't in my the beginning of my career um plus you have a lot
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.760]  of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.360]  ied's and and to defeat law enforcement techniques so there they are congressman and then we have
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.920]  clips uh during pre jade helm training where they're training to take on the tea party i'll play
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.880]  that after you leave i'm just documenting this here how can they say jade helms were overseas
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:47.680]  when they admit uh that it's also for domestic snatch and grab operations that i don't i don't
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.360]  have a complete understanding of that i don't have a precise answer for that all i know is it's
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.720]  very difficult to sort out exactly what are they're up to and what they're doing i do know
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.840]  that they're not worried about our liberty and i do know that they take care of the very wealthy
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:08.960]  special interest which is uh system that we have uh takes care of quite well what are you thinking
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.880]  closing of governor abin i think he's been actually doing a pretty good job since he got in here in
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:20.560]  texas i think so and uh you know i was uh i didn't do anything special to help him but i'll tell you
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.960]  what we could have a lot worse so i'm i haven't nothing has struck me as though that makes me
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.120]  displeased i don't happen to watch state issues very closely i guess his recent announcement here
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:39.760]  today about jade jade helm uh he got my attention more than anything else but but i would say that
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.760]  he's doing a decent job it's very refreshing to just see somebody do their job like you did in
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.600]  congress god bless you dr no we really appreciate you good alex talk to you soon thank you so much
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.920]  another powerful interview with former congressman ron paul i tell you i don't get excited when i've
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.960]  gotten a chance to meet some of the most famous rock stars and movie stars unless i'm fans of what
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.520]  they do and then it's exciting just because i like their art uh but it's just nothing compared
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.120]  to someone like ron paul uh and others uh now at the same time i know some celebrities like
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.720]  debaustain and billy corrigan who get attacked when they come on viciously and still come on and
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:26.240]  have courage that i admire and i get butterflies over but i can get around you know a firefighter
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.880]  that goes in a burning house and you know to save a child and gets burned and i just get tears in my
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.080]  eyes thinking about what a good man that is or a good woman because we're supposed to admire
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:43.520]  people that stand up for liberty not a basketball player not a football player not some drugged
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.400]  out rock star just because they got 20 women and i'm not on some moral high horse when i say that
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:58.160]  i'm just saying that's not my god i will not sell out the unborn i will not sell out the second
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.520]  amendment i will not sell out the family i will not compromise on not being hit with soft kill
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.920]  weapons to make us weak and stupid the fluoride and the rest of it and it means nothing under
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:21.920]  their fake peer pressure paradigm to be lectured and attacked by a bunch of nobodies like rachel
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:33.600]  mattow and cbs news and anderson cooper of the cia at cnn but they they live in a world of caring
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.840]  when everybody says about them they live in a world of being empty and and and you know as
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.320]  jacari jackson said in earlier uh little vignette information bulletins that we now have during the
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:52.080]  advertisements christ even when he was rebuking people and not following their orders under
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.560]  death he didn't hate them because he realized these are the people he was there to save
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:07.280]  and we have to understand that i don't even hate a rachel mattow or people like that anymore
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:13.920]  because i realized how pathetic they are and where they've put themselves in this universe
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.760]  i want to say great job to the crew they were scrambling while i was trying to get them to get
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.400]  clips on the fly i should come in earlier and actually uh line up all the clips i want to play
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.960]  but we're going to play some of those clips when we come back because i mean there's just so many
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.880]  of them but the military in every drill that we get on tape i mean we just go to an event
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:36.000]  or our reporters do or our listeners do and just every time the military is trying to take on
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.080]  patriots and then they just want to make this preparation condition the military it's okay
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:47.280]  have the civil war with us as if we were just going to wait here on our butts we're getting ready
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:54.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:04.880]  presidential wannabe hillary clinton blamed the baltimore riots on income inequality and race
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:10.000]  but what's really to blame in baltimore and what clinton failed to address are the democratic
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.680]  policies that have plagued the city for half a century democrats run the city of baltimore the
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:21.360]  unions the schools and yes the police force the city has been effectively a single party
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.800]  political monopoly for decades that's years of bad government policies that have been particularly
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:32.080]  destructive to any opportunity for employment and stability that are key to lifting its citizens
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:37.760]  out of poverty and while lucrative for the ruling party's cronies cradle to grave welfare is
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:43.120]  crippling to the people it alleges to help cities ruled by democrats have become the hardest places

[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:50.880]  but it's very exciting what's happening it's a great time to be alive that i'm honored to be here
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:59.120]  but when i overuse the word epic it's because can we get a saras out
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:12.560]  now archetypal historical seismic ultra massive incredibly important world changing
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:19.120]  over the top what what are other words associated with the word epic
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:31.920]  like legend heroic yeah it's legendary that's a great word to use what we are seeing now is the
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:39.520]  stuff of legends and it will be the fall to the eugenics technocracy the anti-human global
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:52.000]  exterminist rise of the machine human interface takeover in the their own words or it'll be the
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:01.120]  legendary victory of humanity during this key time as we prepare to go to the next level
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.280]  and all these preachers that are small-minded and have been in a war against science
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:13.520]  they've played into the globalist own plan to then set spiritual christianity
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.000]  against science with when it's a religion of transhumanism and it's completely full of
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.080]  errors and frauds and changes all the time but it wants to set itself up as the ultimate power
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:29.840]  when the bible says the eye has not seen ear has not heard the things that god has in store for us
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.240]  and then i sit here and i believe in humanity and believe that after we go through these trials
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.240]  we will then
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:46.080]  our children and their children be able to experience things that the eye has not seen ear has not heard
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.880]  as christ said i have other flocks it truly is amazing
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.240]  what we can do the word amazing the word legend the word epic the word
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:16.800]  transcendent these words do not really even begin to cut the surface of the well that is
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:25.360]  imagination the water of life mystery majesty but we see that sparkle that twinkle in the eyes of a
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:33.200]  child i look at old black and white photos of poor hispanic families black families poor white
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:39.920]  families wealthy families doesn't matter they all had that twinkle in their eye you take black
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.000]  and white photos today even take them old style that twinkles not there
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:54.080]  i have a twinkle in my eye but not like the generations before me
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.520]  and it's the soft kill it's the chemicals it's the
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.440]  drunkenness that we're under the cultural the spiritual the chemical the biological the radiological
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:16.400]  the electromagnetic the scalar through just a blanket a soup of intoxication
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.680]  the eyes of the window to the soul
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:30.080]  i mean look into that window and we see a fog i pray to god almighty the creator of the universe
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.520]  the four corners of the planet
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:41.120]  that if citizens and humans of this world seek your face and repent even if we don't believe
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.880]  in god we should repent for the way we act when we don't appreciate things there's got to be some
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:53.680]  morals and that this trance this spell this fog be lifted that this scanner darkly be lifted
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:01.040]  that the rose color darkly be lifted if with free will people seek your face and pray and repent
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:07.920]  and that humans can really see what they're facing because if you could see what you're
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.920]  facing i'm talking to new listeners there is not a doubt in my mind you do everything it took in
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:21.040]  the god's green earth to stop it and fight it because it's so nasty and every time i start
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:28.800]  thinking about the enemy i get chills not chills of fear just my soul my god-fearing soul feels dirty
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:37.680]  even gazing into that abyss and my soul shakes for fear of god that's what that is it's fear of god
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.360]  it is well i feel so wicked even looking at that because that's the knowledge of good and evil
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:49.200]  to know the enemy i've fallen it isn't that you didn't have free will in the metaphysical garden
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:59.200]  we're all in that garden as children we come out of it
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:07.520]  it's that we're then given the knowledge of the evil technologies of corruption of twisting

[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:29.200]  info wars life dot com but now here is our interview the secrets of the nsa from the
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:37.040]  inside whistleblower who's been persecuted william benney another true hero the whole point is that
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.320]  under a surveillance state you have very few liberties unless they if they don't want you
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.080]  to have certain do certain things that may have ways and means of getting to you like they did
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:52.560]  with us or other people they would find things to use against you to leverage you or influence you
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.040]  to do the what they want you to do you know if you have nothing if you're nothing to hide you have
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:02.080]  nothing to fear well that's a great quote from joseph gerbils first of all and secondly it's
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.120]  totally irrelevant what you think what you think is totally irrelevant it means absolutely nothing
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.200]  the government only considers its view of you and if you're doing something they don't like
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:19.280]  they will come after you no matter what you think of it does the nsa routinely intercept
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:30.400]  american citizens emails no does the nsa intercept americans cell phone conversations no google
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:41.280]  searches no text messages no amazon dot com orders no bank records no i thank you and this for you
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:45.920]  director clapper again on the surveillance front and i hope we can do this and just a yes or no
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:52.560]  answer because i know senator feinstein wants to move on does the nsa collect any type of data at
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:42:02.880]  all on millions or hundreds of millions of americans no sir it does not not wittingly
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:11.440]  there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not winning but to
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:16.720]  conduct that kind of collection in the united states it would have to go through a court order
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:22.560]  and the court would have to authorize it we're not authorized to do it nor do we do it
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.800]  bill benny a legendary nsa mathematician led development of a revolutionary computer system
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.320]  to collect isolate and connect important information like phone calls and financial
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:46.160]  transactions its codename was thin thread my name is bill benny i worked for nsa in the military
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:54.800]  and as a civilian for a little over 36 years and i designed a lot of the the logic and architecture
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.200]  that they're using to spy on everybody in the world and when i started doing this and using
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:04.000]  against us citizens i became a whistleblower i had other people who were with me as a part of that
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.320]  whistleblower for other people including diane work from the house intelligence committee
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.640]  and uh tom drake kirk webeon ed lewis who were also nsa employees so we were all part of that
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.040]  and uh we tried to influence the government internally and they attacked us for it and
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:25.200]  tried to put us in jail fabricated evidence uh we caught them at it so they failed the fbi
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.560]  raided the homes of all the people you've met in this story who filed that confidential complaint
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:36.960]  with the defense department they came busting in uh i was in the shower at the time and uh
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:43.600]  one of them came running up uh and uh was pointed a gun at my eyeballs and pulled me out of the
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:49.440]  shower so he drew a gun on you oh yeah he had it pointed at my head yeah talk about what a hero
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.040]  and how much courage you've got i mean you know how serious people are in this government but they
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.320]  do worldwide how corrupted gotten at that point you had the will to march into congress and to
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:03.520]  tell them what was going on the first guy i mean that's 10 times bigger than snowed internally
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:08.240]  and to really start this whole internal debate and this avalanche of understanding now i mean you
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:13.440]  were really one of the first people to ring the bell to warn folks that that the country as we
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:18.720]  knew it was being dismantled i went to the terrorist analyst shop which we had running there for
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:26.160]  quite some time and i said i asked them in all the work you're doing to analyze the terrorist
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:30.880]  problem around the world which sites are the ones that give you information that you find valuable
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.520]  and so they gave me a list of 18 sites and so i took those 18 sites and said okay these are the
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:42.960]  these are the deployment targets for our process in january of 2001 uh and it was uh we estimated
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.200]  the cost to be about nine and a half million dollars that's all basically it was working
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:56.480]  like a year and a half before 9 11 occurred almost two years before 9 11 and uh if they
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.440]  had deployed it uh we would have uh we would have in my view there would have been no way we
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:07.440]  wouldn't have stopped 9 11 because all the data uh tom drake took the program after they killed it
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:13.120]  because of it didn't cost enough money so so that meant that they they had to create another program
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:17.600]  which they called trailblazer that was the initial cut that that was four billion dollars
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.160]  and after that it only grew and that in terms of money they kept getting more and more so the
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:30.800]  the the the whole point was that they they had a a whole host of contractors that wanted to feed
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.760]  on all that money and if you if you took the program we did and deployed it would already
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:40.480]  solve the problem so the point is that you can't go to congress asking for money for a problem you've
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:46.880]  already solved so they had to kill the solution to say we have a problem so they could justify
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.600]  getting the money and that's exactly what they did they know exactly what they're doing and the
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:56.240]  reason you can tell what they know is because they're keeping it all secret if they weren't if they
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:01.200]  weren't really trying hard to keep it secret then they might then you might think that they
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.880]  they were delusional and they didn't understand what they were doing but when they
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.720]  know that they're doing something wrong they have to keep it secret otherwise
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.440]  they feel that they held accountable for what they do why else would they keep all these things
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.720]  secret do things in secret with a secret court keeping their interpretation secret and making
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:25.040]  secret interpretations and rules for the for a constitution in secret in hiding it away from
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.560]  most of congress and there and certainly all the public so if you do that you're hiding something
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:37.360]  and you know you're doing that i put it down to three factors power money and control that is if
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.360]  you could have an uninformed electorate and an uninformed congress you can manipulate them and
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.560]  control them and especially if you're pulling in a lot of data about them you can do that and use
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:54.480]  it against them to get them to leverage them to do what you want them to do late last night a
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.000]  british newspaper dropped a bombshell that the u.s government has been collecting millions of
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.160]  americans phone records without them knowing about it a lot of people are learning that the
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.840]  scope of these surveillance programs is is immense the government is monitoring private
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.800]  phone calls your children and my children's private phone calls and tracking who their
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.880]  associates are right now the u.s government knows who he is calling where she is calling from
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:25.600]  and how long they are talking when it comes to telephone calls nobody is listening to your
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.600]  telephone calls the nsa is trying to create a database to get ahead of what i think is the
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:39.600]  the rural growing threat homegrown terrorist cells already here it's to ferret this out
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:46.080]  before it happens it's called protecting america it comes to keeping us safe in the war on terror
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.320]  i think the president's program president obama's program is the right one it's a good one his name
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:55.920]  is edward snowden he's an american former cia employee and computer technician today he came out
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:01.920]  as the leaker of classified nsa documents you don't have to have done anything wrong you simply
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:06.880]  have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody even by a wrong call and then they
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.640]  can use the system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made are you confident
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.960]  that you know everything that's going on within that agency and that you can say to the american
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:26.720]  people it's all done the right way yes i made the statement about that the the greatest threat to our
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:31.520]  constitutional form of government since the civil war is what's happening now in terms of spying in
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.720]  the united states and that's the domestic spying program stellar wind that they started in secret
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:41.120]  and have been running in secret so they're violating the constitutional rights of everyone
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.320]  first amendment rights that are violated because they you have the right under the first
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.600]  amendment to have a free free association it doesn't say you have to write the free association as
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.920]  long as the government knows about it that's that's direct violation of that one the fourth
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.400]  amendment is clearly violated when they copy that collect all the content data or they digitally
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:08.480]  record your phone calls and and violate all of your privacy under your affairs that's a violation
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.360]  of the fourth amendment and then using the content of your emails against doing a court of law in
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:19.040]  secret again under the law enforcement use of the nsa data that's a violation of your fifth amendment
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.480]  rights not to testify against yourself and then when they lie in courts and uh don't uh
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.720]  don't tell you that uh give you the right to challenge discovery of the information they
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:34.320]  really use to arrest you that's a violation of due process under the sixth amendment so i mean
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.240]  they're just scrapping the entire constitutional form of government this is the greatest threat to
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:46.400]  our democracy and republic and constitutional form of government since the civil war see unless we
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.800]  unless we stop the industrial accumulation of information on people we're heading to a state
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:58.240]  of society where people will see the surveillance just the fact that people are being surveilled
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.760]  inhibits their their ability or feeling that they had the opportunity to do a new and
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.800]  recreative and innovative things so that kind of reduces their risk taking basically
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:17.040]  which in turn means you get no less and less creativity and innovation uh and more and
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:21.440]  more stagnation of civilization that's what happened in the soviet union that's what happened
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:26.560]  in east germany in the communist block they stagnated because people were being so surveilled
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.960]  that they were afraid to do anything and it made people afraid to take a risk and that's really
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:37.520]  the the that's really the point of capitalism that's why it's been so successful because it's
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:43.680]  it was advocating people taking risks americans aren't supposed to sit back and and let things happen
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.880]  and and uh let uh let government do what it does we're supposed to be out there challenging we have
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.080]  to be participating in our democracy and republic we cannot sit by and let these things happen and
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:59.360]  be quiet and we do we're going to get this totalitarian state that we're sliding toward right now
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:05.040]  now that's right ladies and gentlemen we're going to get this totalitarian state that we've
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.400]  already slid off the edge into but the reason it's so different than nazi germany or soviet
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:18.560]  russia or malice china is malice china had just been through world war two the japanese had killed
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:24.400]  some estimates are as many as 10 million chinese there was mass poverty millions starving to death
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:33.520]  every few months in some of that period uh the country was in literal hell and before that the
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.800]  country been broken in 14 parts by different allied powers for 200 plus years you could be
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.600]  publicly executed in china if you were caught stealing a ball of rice i mean it was barbarous
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:53.680]  barbarous china had not been barbarous previous to that had been quite cultured in many ways uh
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:52:02.080]  but it it was barbarous after colonialism and so when mal came in with western support
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:08.480]  kicking out the nationalist who were pretty corrupt in their own right but nothing compared to mal
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:14.320]  he was seen as a reformer by wall street because he'd work with them they thought he'd get things
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:20.880]  going under communism he was just able to absolutely steamroll everybody hitler same
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:24.960]  deal they've been through world war one of our side treaty the mass of depression that was
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.600]  estimated by many historians to be upwards of five times worse than the u.s. depression
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:38.160]  i mean germany was starvation level for a decade very proud people went through hell
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:42.240]  they were put under reparations where their companies were all turned over to foreign companies
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:48.000]  those foreign companies set hitler up put him in power told him to invade told him what to do
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.160]  that's all been declassified set him up didn't mean hitler wasn't horrible he's terrible they
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.640]  they they picked him to be the messianic leader psychologically of the germans lord millner in
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:02.000]  the 20s talked about we got to find a messianic german wind him up let him tear up europe and
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.120]  then we'll take over the ashes about same the british people are inherently evil i'm you know
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.240]  i'm well sure i've got a lot of blood from england on both sides of the family the point is is that
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:20.400]  that the manipulations developed in england are the model of the world today and they're
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:26.000]  very sophisticated it's very hard to beat them because it's a 50 to 100 year plan it's like
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:31.120]  the big mega banks have been funding liberation theology for about 80 years they've been funding
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:36.160]  socialism and communism as the way to rebel so when the revolution comes to their corrupt system
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:41.360]  it'll be communism that they set offshore and control i mean it's hard to beat these people
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:46.800]  and brzezinski i've read four of his books no five of his books and in three of them he talks about
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:52.960]  how they do 25 50 year plans and everything i'm telling you i mean they they think you're too
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:54:00.160]  stupid to read books they write and he says in the future in his last book he also said it in two
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:06.400]  speeches to the council on farm relations of canada and the u.s. he said it's more expensive now to
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:13.920]  propagandize people we're just going to kill everybody zabina brzezinski's probably a bigger
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:20.000]  advisor right now than kissinger george solz has gotten to senile david rockefeller now is
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.080]  officially senile at 98 or whatever it is he's basically out of the game that's why senator
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.320]  j rockefeller is leaving the senate to actually run things now j rockefeller is one of the most
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:35.520]  powerful people in the world right now the rockefellers don't give you the power until the top dog the
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:41.040]  top sketch he dies and then you get the power a lot of evidence david had nelson killed
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:50.080]  but it's just unspeakable what we face and i sit here with their manuals their books their
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.640]  admissions their just watching them control our world and then sit there and lecture the public
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:04.000]  on how none of this exists like we're five years old coming up in the next hour i want to open the

[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:31.920]  deliberative discussions from high-level national security council meetings but compared patrice's

[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:37.120]  really didn't have the the violence that we see today the weaponry is totally different now than
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:42.000]  it wasn't in the beginning of my career plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.760]  military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build ied's and to defeat law enforcement
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:12:13.600]  techniques
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:23.400]  If somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can do safely
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:28.640]  can, they can pull right up to a front post, they can take enemy fire and still try to
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:31.760]  address the threat without being fear of getting shot.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:35.760]  So I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.400]  U.S. would you see that happening?
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.760]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons,
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.760]  a lot of, a lot of Indian, I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:50.760]  people that stockpile weapons, a lot of, a lot of Indian issues, and they have, and they
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:52.760]  have, you know, weapons here locally.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:55.760]  So what happens if the PLR take over?
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:57.760]  A country run by terrorists ain't good.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:01.760]  Bro, America was founded by terrorists for terrorists.
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:04.760]  What do you think the fucking Revolutionary War was?
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:07.760]  Mystery is determined by the fucking victory.
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:09.760]  How did you even get into the Marines?
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:14.760]  Who was the first service organization in the United States?
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:15.760]  Who?
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:16.760]  Founding Bob.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:17.760]  Founding Bob.
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:19.760]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:21.760]  You mean, uh, George Washington?
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:22.760]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:23.760]  Paul Wider?
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:24.760]  Yeah.
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:27.760]  These guys right here, who do you ask yourself?
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.760]  Did they try to scare people?
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:30.760]  Well, yeah.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:35.760]  They tried to intimidate the British, and they tried to, and they used that to buy them?
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:41.760]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:45.760]  Jade Helm troops who operate undetected amongst civilian population.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  And, of course, the military people and the vets are not buying any of them.
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:49.760]  They're not stupid.
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:53.760]  You can read about how it's to get the hearts and minds and how to get the public used to
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.760]  working, and the local police working with the military.
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:00.760]  I mean, everybody who's been in the military knows about the secret EOD program going on
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:01.760]  for 18 years.
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:06.760]  Their whole ordinance disposal, you know, quote, the army is going to show up to defuse a bomb.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  But then you get the internal agreements.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:13.760]  It's for everything from warrants service to checkpoints with military personnel in
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:19.760]  nondescript blue jumpsuits, just like the Army Ranger called in and said they were wearing
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:21.760]  EPA blue jumpsuits.
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  It's always blue or tan jumpsuits.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:26.760]  And it might say EPA.
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:28.760]  It might say police.
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.760]  It might say Park Circs.
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.760]  Training with the police, training with locals in plain clothes, quote, doing suspicious
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:39.760]  activities, is to train the police to work with the military and covert operations and
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:42.760]  to condition the military to accept it and to condition the public to accept it.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:47.760]  And then when we cover it and talk about it, they practice the PSYOP in real time putting
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.760]  out this information.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:55.760]  I can see the script from Army Times to military.com to Stars and Stripes to Bloomberg to
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:02.760]  Daily Beast to Vice to the Houston Chronicle and no exaggeration today.
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:06.760]  You go search Jade Helm.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:11.760]  There are now hundreds of articles and in almost all of them, yours truly is being demonized.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:12.760]  That was a month ago.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:15.760]  It's warned of an imminent takeover for decades.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.760]  It keeps claiming it's going to happen.
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:18.760]  But of course it never does.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:20.760]  No, it never does.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:27.760]  Checkpoints, TSA, open spine, highway dividers being put up nationwide.
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:31.760]  Open manuals that the number one enemies, veterans and gun owners and Christians.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:33.760]  I mean, come on.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:39.760]  This is the PSYOP.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.760]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.760]  Remember, I'm going to get into economic news and a bunch of other Monsanto news.
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  Monsanto has been caught.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:53.760]  It's on infowars.com, come out in court, paying farmers to bio attack with their weapons,
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:00.760]  with their seeds, what they are, to then be able to charge those farms with stealing Monsanto technology.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:04.760]  And farmers kept saying, you know, it grows up in the ditches by our houses.
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:07.760]  Even when there's not a neighbor growing it, it gets in the middle of our fields.
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:10.760]  And then Monsanto flies over with airplanes, drop.
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:11.760]  This is a national geographic.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.760]  You don't believe me.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:13.760]  It's crazy.
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:20.760]  It drops roundup bombs on your crops without a warrant.
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:21.760]  It's how above the law they are.
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:22.760]  It'll kill a huge area.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:27.760]  And if one plant's still alive, they didn't go pick it and know that that's their plant.
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:38.760]  And they hire former FBI agents mainly to go around and grab the plants and then they sue you just so you'll get intimidated and buy their crops.
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  Infowars.com, Monsanto secretly gave money to farmer caught contaminating organic farms with GMOs.
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:51.760]  Now admits it's paying for GMO farmers legal defense.
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  Gotta get Percy Smeiser if he's still alive when I said he was old and it was like 1999 or something.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:00.760]  I got him on the canola farmer.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:03.760]  This was happening too, but it's just sick.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:04.760]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:07.760]  Jack, thanks for holding on the topic of Jade Helm.
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:09.760]  It was hundreds of articles a day.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:11.760]  Now it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles a day.
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:16.760]  Every nightly news channel, you name it saying that we say martial law is coming.
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:17.760]  Well, it's already here.
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.760]  What do you make of this Psyop?
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.760]  How do you think it's going?
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:22.760]  Oh, it's definitely here, man.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:26.760]  You bet, brother.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  All right, yeah, I have a few things.
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.760]  Okay, Boston bombing.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:33.760]  That was the first test of martial law.
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.760]  Then you go on to Ferguson and then, you know, you got Philly, Baltimore,
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:46.760]  all these protests that are turning into riots probably outside provocateurs.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:48.760]  They're totally foaming about George Soros.
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:49.760]  It's on record.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:50.760]  Right.
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:51.760]  I've seen them.
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:53.760]  Yeah, on TV or on YouTube.
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  But I'm thinking Jade Helm, you know, these soldiers, maybe they're, you know,
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:05.760]  those soldiers that we've seen training are probably the ones that are stationed at all these riots right now.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:07.760]  That's my thought.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:14.760]  A lot of them are, but this is to get special ops ready to take over local government and to identify,
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:16.760]  even the special ops are compartmentalized.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:17.760]  I don't know why they're there.
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:20.760]  This is to identify which cities and counties are going to work with them.
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:25.760]  Just like Katrina was there to see, can we actually order gun confiscation without resistance?
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  It's all laboratory testing.
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.760]  The globalists are scientists first and foremost.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:31.760]  It's the scientific dictatorship.
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.760]  They call themselves technocrats and see if they understand everything is a psych test.
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:39.760]  Everything is a test.
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:46.760]  They look into it 10,000 different ways to truly try to understand what the hell they're thinking.
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:51.760]  You know, but yeah, I just, I just seen, you know, pattern that they're all, it's all together.
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:53.760]  Jade Helm, it's probably the same people.
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:59.760]  And I want to end it on a good note, they got 50% of the fluoride out of the water.
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:00.760]  That's awesome.
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:01.760]  But why not just take it all out?
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:02.760]  Because it's bad, you know.
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:04.760]  Well, they can't admit they're wrong.
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:09.760]  The panels have actually recommended get rid of all of it and to stop using the toxic form.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:16.760]  If they were putting calcium fluoride in the water, I'd be against it because it sets the precedent to put drugs in the water,
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:18.760]  but it would actually be good for you at low levels.
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:23.760]  It's hydrofluorosilic acid that's been electrically charged and is deadly poison.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  I mean, one drop will kill you dead in a hammer.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.760]  It's almost as deadly as cyanide.
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:28.760]  It eats through concrete.
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:29.760]  It eats through steel.
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:33.760]  It's almost as bad as sulfuric acid.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:37.760]  I mean, it is over the top that.
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:42.760]  But yes, they're banning it as a pesticide.
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:46.760]  I mean, because most of these EPA scientists don't like having brain damage kids.
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:48.760]  I mean, they're scientists.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.760]  They know it's bad.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:51.760]  Most people in government actually know it's good.
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.760]  That's the most await groups government.
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:54.760]  But it's the head people.
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:20:23.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:50.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:21:16.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:45.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:22:14.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:40.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:23:06.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:34.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:55.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:30.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:59.760]  They're the enemy.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:01.760]  It's bigger than just Jade Helm, isn't it, Luke?
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  I mean, it's about media scyop.
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:05.760]  It's about deception.
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.760]  We know the military and police are training to fight the American people.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:11.760]  They admit it's their main mission.
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:13.760]  It's treasonous.
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.760]  We have good people in the government warning us about it.
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:22.760]  But they don't want to have a national debate about this or the NSA spying or the open borders or Obamacare.
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:25.760]  They want to just stonewall us, but it's not working.
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:30.760]  And all the armored vehicles in the world aren't going to save the globalists when the economy collapses, Luke.
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:33.760]  What do you think is going on?
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:39.760]  I believe that is a ten-year Navy veteran, and I've been watching this come around for a while now.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.760]  In our local area, we've been watching AH-64, Apache helicopters flying at 300 feet.
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:50.760]  SH-60, Navy equivalent to a Black Hawk flying, Black Hawk flying, B-2 Ospreay.
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:56.760]  There's a ramp-up of military activity that's beyond what is normal and has been normal since ten years now.
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  It's been escalating more and more.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:04.760]  These exercises like Jade, Helman things, yeah, they're there to, you know, familiarize the...
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.760]  make the populace asleep.
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.760]  They can seem like it's normal, and it's not normal.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:09.760]  We shouldn't be here.
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:10.760]  This is against the Constitution.
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:12.760]  It's against policy commentators.
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:17.760]  A lot of the veterans out here also believe, you know, we're not asleep, but we're waiting.
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:24.760]  It's getting to the point where it's requiring you're watching a slow takeover, slow stripping of all of our rights.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:29.760]  It's one of those deals that we're watching the NRAS coming in here to Southern Virginia, and they're coming in,
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:32.760]  and, you know, people don't want to talk about it, and you try to wake some up.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:35.760]  Some are awake to the paradigm, have that paradigm shift.
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:43.760]  Mostly, I'm military or ex-military, but the vast populace is still asleep at the wheel when it comes to this, Alec.
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.760]  Well, that's why they say veterans are the number one enemy, because they know what's happening.
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:49.760]  They know how to read these manuals.
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:53.760]  They know the public's being lied to, but you're absolutely right.
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.760]  The escalation of training, the preparation, it's just...
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:02.760]  When I said a hundred times bigger than what it was 20 years ago, it is.
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:05.760]  I mean, 20 years ago it was very secretive.
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:07.760]  They would tell the public, no, you didn't see troops on the street.
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.760]  You didn't see black helicopters.
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:15.760]  They started it like that very smartly under Clinton to then say,
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:16.760]  Cougs believe it even exists.
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.760]  So, see, first, it was a litmus test to say there are no helicopters.
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:23.760]  There are no men scaling into the park in the middle of the night.
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:26.760]  There are no police checkpoints, not in America.
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:28.760]  There isn't any NSA spying.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:31.760]  Crazy people that wear ten full hats say that.
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:33.760]  We'd be like, no, it's an international record.
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:35.760]  Shut up, schizophrenic.
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.760]  And then now they just roll it all out and go, no, you're crazy if you think it's for you.
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:42.760]  And we're like, here's their manual.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.760]  Here they are admitting it scores of times.
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:48.760]  Why are you so racist?
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:53.760]  So they're just building up so when they launch it, you're going to be a Coug
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:57.760]  if you think gun confiscation is actually happening when it's happening.
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:27:59.760]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:00.760]  There was denial.
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:03.760]  There was denial for weeks about the Katrina gun confiscation.
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:05.760]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.760]  No, I was saying, you know, part of the problem is many of the veterans out here,
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:13.760]  and even active duty military, the Marines, maybe, they primarily know what's going on.
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:16.760]  A lot of them, I've talked to them off the internet and they've been like, no,
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.760]  we're not going to go ahead and we're not going to follow this.
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:22.760]  So a lot of the military, they're not saying anything or when they're asked,
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:30.760]  like myself, you know, I was asked if I had to take a written test and a survey is what they called it
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:34.760]  to see whether or not I'd fire against American citizens if ordered to
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.760]  or if there was a natural disaster, civil unrest, anything of that nature.
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:41.760]  And if we would open fire on this on the public, and it's like, you know,
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  this is unconstitutional, you can serve.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:44.760]  I'm not taking this test.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:45.760]  And that's what I knew.
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:50.760]  I needed to make the decision whether to stay inside or get out of military.
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:55.760]  And it was one of those deals that a lot of us are stepping away from it because we see what's coming.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.760]  And it is a tyranny and it's here. We have these small armed disbandment acts already there.
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.760]  People pushing in, they're coming for the weapons.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:06.760]  They're coming for America. They're coming for all of us.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:08.760]  You don't think they're building FEMA camps?
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:09.760]  They're not going to put us in them?
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:11.760]  They did it from people in World War II, the Japanese.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:12.760]  We've already done it.
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:13.760]  America, wake up.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:16.760]  You think just because we did it one time, we're not going to do it again?
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:19.760]  The system and everything is slowly coming unwound.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.760]  I know the globe was nervous about it,
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:26.760]  but I'm worried that they're going to do something like push ISIS into America, do false flag attacks,
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:30.760]  and then a SNAP exercise like Jay's home is going to go live.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  That is certainly what they're doing.
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:34.760]  And they can have this and have it go live.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  Then if they don't want to, they don't.
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:39.760]  But if we put pressure on it, they may back off.
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:42.760]  Then when we stop it going live, we get blamed for making it up.
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:45.760]  See, it's very sophisticated what they're doing.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:47.760]  God bless you, Luke. Great caller.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:30:18.760]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:23.760]  It's the march that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state.
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:27.760]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:31.760]  It's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:36.760]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:40.760]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:43.760]  And not because they had any interest in women's rights,
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:47.760]  but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:49.760]  The state collects more tax dollars,
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:52.760]  children are indoctrinated at an earlier age,
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:55.760]  and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:58.760]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:30:59.760]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:00.760]  Good, brother.
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:02.760]  I just recently started using your products.
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:04.760]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.760]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:08.760]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:10.760]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:12.760]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:18.760]  But a super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:20.760]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.760]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:25.760]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:28.760]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots,
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.760]  they've got a ton of money there.
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:32.760]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:34.760]  harvested around the planet,
[02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:38.760]  and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:42.760]  You want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:44.760]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:48.760]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:50.760]  So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.

[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:29.760]  Go over a bunch of the other headlines.
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.760]  I haven't broken down yet today, but again, we're not just covering Jade Helm
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:40.760]  because ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, all the last few days
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:44.760]  have done pieces attacking InfoWars.com,
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:47.760]  attacking yours truly Alex Jones,
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:50.760]  attacking Governor Greg Abbott,
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:54.760]  lying about us saying that we say imminent martial law,
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.760]  that the military is going to come kill everybody.
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:33:59.760]  I mean, it's just beyond yellow journalism,
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:03.760]  but it's why the old-time newspapers are collapsing.
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:06.760]  It's why MSNBC and CNN are done,
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.760]  because you are a bunch of arrogant narcissist.
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:15.760]  Notice how it's Cuomo's brother at CNN
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:18.760]  and just all these weird political people
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:21.760]  who want to be rock stars and show off to mommy
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.760]  at the carcass of the dinosaur media,
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:30.760]  like ticks or something climbing around the dead body, maggots.
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:32.760]  That carcass is only going to rot so long,
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:34.760]  so just keep this crediting yourselves.
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:36.760]  Everybody knows we're in a police state.
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.760]  Everybody knows Obama's announced
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:40.760]  executive taxation increases.
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:44.760]  Everybody knows Obama cares a giant screw job.
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:47.760]  Everybody knows.
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:49.760]  And so just keep attacking me.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:51.760]  Just keep doing it.
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:53.760]  You're pathetic.
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.760]  And I read the comments.
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  I even screen-shotted some of them
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:59.760]  when I was looking online on my phone last night in bed.
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  Some of these screenshots,
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:03.760]  and I'm going back to your calls and the other news.
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:06.760]  You go to my photos here.
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:14.760]  Kept intending to do this, but forgot.
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:18.760]  Oh, I messed up. I don't even know how to keep track of these cameras anymore.
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.760]  Here it is. Here's some of the comments.
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.760]  Truly disgusting.
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:29.760]  Now I'm trying to find it.
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:33.760]  See, the show is completely unscripted.
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:35.760]  So I'm having trouble finding it.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:38.760]  I didn't plan to even go to this.
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:40.760]  But there's comments that are like the redneck,
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:43.760]  scum, filth, paranoid, crazy Texans.
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:46.760]  They're so insane. I'm ashamed to even live in this state.
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:47.760]  I want to get out of here.
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:49.760]  And the comments are like, yeah, I'm a Republican,
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:50.760]  but I don't like Abbott now.
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  Obviously, state's comments, most of them.
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:55.760]  Yeah, those evil Texans without a state income tax,
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:56.760]  everybody wants to move here.
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:58.760]  What a source of stupid.
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:01.760]  Yeah, those dumb Texans that want to keep the Second Amendment
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:03.760]  and have a really low crime rate compared to other states.
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:04.760]  Man, they're bad.
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:06.760]  Yeah, those evil Texans,
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:08.760]  why, they don't want to be part of the United Nations,
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:11.760]  and they want to have America be energy-independent.
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:13.760]  How they're just horrible people.
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:15.760]  That's why everybody all over the world says
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:17.760]  Texans are so polite and so nice,
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.760]  except some people moved here and aren't Texans.
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:21.760]  We're not even Texans anymore.
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:24.760]  Oh, that's a shameful.
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.760]  How horrible that out of the whole country
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:29.760]  being overrun by military training
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:32.760]  and checkpoints and unconstitutional garbage.
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  Why, how dare Texas, when Obama opened all the borders,
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.760]  the new governor did what he could to seal the border
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:41.760]  and put state police down there to stop felons.
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:46.760]  I mean, imagine that he would do such a thing
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.760]  and that when they shut down the power plants,
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:51.760]  almost doubling Texas power prices,
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:53.760]  he filed lawsuits and injunctions
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:55.760]  to turn some of the plants back on.
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.760]  Man, that's bad.
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:59.760]  Those filthy redneck scum
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:02.760]  with the fastest growing state in the country
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:05.760]  and the most jobs and some low taxes.
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:08.760]  Man, those Texans are bad.
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:10.760]  Well, I heard they've got hospitality.
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:12.760]  I heard they're polite and open doors for ladies.
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:15.760]  There's nothing worse than those people.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:17.760]  Everybody knows it.
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  What a bunch of traitors.
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:23.760]  But again, they just think ridiculing people.
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:25.760]  Ah, look at you.
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.760]  I want to do a piece where I go back and find all the news articles.
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:29.760]  We've got some hanging up around here
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:31.760]  and we're like, crazy people think
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:34.760]  there's secret military drills and helicopters.
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:36.760]  Crazy people think there's military drills.
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.760]  What do you see crazy?
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.760]  Well, the troops come out of the sky
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:41.760]  and blow up that building and the building's burned down.
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:43.760]  They're like, you really think you saw that?
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:46.760]  I had the Daily Show back when it first started
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:48.760]  in the late 90s attacking me.
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:52.760]  Comedy Central would like to have shows.
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:54.760]  I think it was that show, yeah.
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:55.760]  I mean, they've attacked me a bunch.
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:56.760]  I just can't remember all the times
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:57.760]  and they'd be like,
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:01.760]  he claims there's military drills.
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  I've got another one I'm going to tell you.
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:07.760]  And then now it's like,
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:10.760]  you didn't like the military drills.
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:13.760]  See, we told you it was going on.
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:15.760]  So you denied it.
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:17.760]  And now that it's all admitted, you go, oh,
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:20.760]  we say it's permanent martial law.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:21.760]  They're coming to put us in FEMA camps
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:23.760]  and kill us and take our guns this summer.
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:25.760]  And I didn't say that.
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:27.760]  Though you'll probably take that clip out of context
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:30.760]  and play it on the news saying I just said that.
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:31.760]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:36.760]  I said that's where it leads though.
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.760]  Because the globalists don't ever want to stand up
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:40.760]  fight politically or economically or physically.
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:43.760]  They want to take over with martial law,
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:46.760]  start disappearing citizens as they're already doing,
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.760]  confiscating guns of veterans all over the country
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.760]  and other groups, and just ease us into the cookpot.
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:54.760]  Kind of like Bugs Bunny's sitting there
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:55.760]  while the Pygmies are going around him
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:58.760]  and they're cutting up stuff, putting in the big bowling us.
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:00.760]  Oh, thank you for the bath, Mr.
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:02.760]  I can't do a very good Bugs Bunny imitation
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  of that Brooklyn accent.
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:07.760]  He goes, my, it's getting a little hot in here.
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:18.760]  Then they slap on the top of the cauldron.
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:20.760]  And they're just putting us in the cauldron.
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:22.760]  They're chopping up the carrots.
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:23.760]  We have their recipe.
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:25.760]  You look over and read the recipe.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.760]  It's a rabbit, it's for Patriot.
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:31.760]  And I say, can I see that cookbook, please?
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:34.760]  And the whole cookbook's for Patriots.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.760]  Patriots are the enemy, gun owners, Christians.
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:37.760]  How are you going to round them up?
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:38.760]  The internment camps.
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:40.760]  How to process social security numbers.
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  All this is on army.mil.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:43.760]  How are you going to take our guns?
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:44.760]  How the preachers work for you?
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:46.760]  The infregard, the citizen spies.
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:47.760]  You go talk to the cops.
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:49.760]  Yeah, we're trying to take on gun owners and veterans.
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:51.760]  We're about to have a war with them.
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:53.760]  You're reading the whole cookbook on Patriots.
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  And we're already in the cookpot with carrots
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:57.760]  and potatoes floating around and our butts burning.
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:00.760]  And you're going, let me just put some handcuffs on you
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:02.760]  and put this lid on.
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:04.760]  We're like, you know what?
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:06.760]  I don't want to be rude for dinner,
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:09.760]  but I'm going to get out of the pot.
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:10.760]  They're like, shut up, terrorist.
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:11.760]  Stay in the pot.
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:13.760]  No, I'm going to get my leg out here.
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:14.760]  I die of you.
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:15.760]  They're like, shut up, racist.
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:16.760]  Don't get out of the pot.
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:18.760]  But they don't want to use force check,
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:20.760]  because then they got to admit they're trying to eat us.
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:21.760]  So they're like, I told you to get back in there.
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:26.760]  I'm going to call you a sexist, homophobe, racist, redneck.
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:28.760]  Get back in the pot.
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:29.760]  Get back in the pot.
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:32.760]  Just six months ago, I'd say there's a war about the Saudis
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:36.760]  to drive down oil prices to bankrupt Texas oil production.
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  And when they're done with that,
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:39.760]  they're going to jack the price up the highest levels.
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:41.760]  Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:42.760]  They had news articles.
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  Now he claims a Saudi conspiracy.
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:46.760]  Because a lot of this media works for those guys.
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:48.760]  You know, like they got thousands of princes
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:49.760]  worth billions of piece.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:52.760]  One prince is worth like $200 billion or something.
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:55.760]  You know.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:57.760]  And so that's who they work for.
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:00.760]  And of course, now it's totally admitted the Saudis admit
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:03.760]  they did it to bankrupt us, our allies.
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:06.760]  This is the sick games they play all day.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:09.760]  I'm getting out of the pot.
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:10.760]  I'm done.
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.760]  I don't believe a word comes out of the New World Order.
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:14.760]  I don't trust anything they say.
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:17.760]  And it's so healthy that people don't trust the feds.
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:19.760]  It's so healthy.
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:21.760]  They know they've taken the military over.
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:22.760]  It's so healthy.
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:24.760]  People don't believe a word out of their mouth.
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:25.760]  It's so healthy.
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.760]  People are jumping at shadows and the Walmart stuff.
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:29.760]  Because even if that's not what's happening there,
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:33.760]  overall it is happening and people are getting wise
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:36.760]  and not being a bunch of trusting idiots.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:39.760]  Wild in Wisconsin.
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:40.760]  Go ahead.
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:41.760]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:42.760]  Thanks for holding.
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:44.760]  What's up, doc?
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  You know how the elite globalists like numerology and naming things
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.760]  with Jade Helm, I was looking into it.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:56.760]  And with Jade, there is an interesting Chinese saying,
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:05.760]  which is the Jade maker does not lead his mark.
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:06.760]  Very interesting.
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:08.760]  The military is big on acronyms.
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:10.760]  And if you spell out Jade and Helm,
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  it's all sorts of cryptic things.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  It goes from bad to worse.
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:19.760]  I'm still going to look in at the end of the show
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:23.760]  to memorandum 7277 in public law 109.
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:24.760]  I can't remember from memory.
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:28.760]  But I believe one of the drills back then was called Jade Helm,
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:30.760]  carried out on how to suppress.
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:34.760]  I think it was a city in Georgia.
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:38.760]  So that's why people are so freaked out.
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:41.760]  But they call it joint assistance for development
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:44.760]  and executing an execution along the homeland,
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:47.760]  eradication of local militias.
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  That's what people are saying Jade Helm stands for.
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:53.760]  All I know is everything in the Army manuals
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:56.760]  is now directly written by the Southern Brotherhood Law Center
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:03.760]  and the ADL to purely anti-freedom organizations.
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:07.760]  What do you think it is, sir?
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:11.760]  Just like you said.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:13.760]  Well, give me further breakdown,
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:16.760]  because I've been ranting here and I need to cool down.
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  What do you think, overall, the scythe are running?
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:23.760]  I think when you get to the,
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:28.760]  when you're jack hammering the bedrock of the rabbit hole,
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:30.760]  yes, it is Satanism.
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:34.760]  But humanity as a whole,
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:39.760]  as a creature has unfortunate fondness
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:41.760]  for the gritty and the darkness.
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:43.760]  It's part of it.
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:46.760]  And it's the price that is included
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:50.760]  with the deal we're given in this reality.
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:54.760]  Wow, that's really deep.
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.760]  You're right.
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:57.760]  And then we deny that we're evil.
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:59.760]  Part of us is we deny our human animal-ness.
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:03.760]  We deny our darker selves.
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:04.760]  And we're blind.
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:06.760]  I mean, I love how the media tries to deny
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:08.760]  the dark side of government
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:10.760]  and the dark side of power
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:12.760]  when it's been known throughout history.
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:14.760]  We've been denying our own dark side.
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:16.760]  That's why it's taken over.
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:21.760]  he didn't exist.
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  Yes.
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:28.760]  And, you know, even with how we were saying before,
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:30.760]  the sayings and how things are named,
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:32.760]  we've named a thousand things.
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:36.760]  And calling it light and dark kind of attaches
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:41.760]  a predisposition of meaning where...
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:42.760]  Exactly.
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:44.760]  If something's light, then it must be good.
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.760]  But the Bible says Satan comes
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:47.760]  masquerading as an angel of light.
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:48.760]  Exactly.
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:49.760]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:50.760]  I don't know where you were going,
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:51.760]  but I threw that in.
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:52.760]  Go ahead.
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:53.760]  Go ahead.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:55.760]  Well, what I was going at is that I think,
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:57.760]  and you're a strong proponent of this,
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:00.760]  and some people call it the fifth element
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:02.760]  or quintessence or whatever,
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:05.760]  but we have to rely on our gut and our feelings
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:11.760]  because that transcends all the worldly bravo, Sierra.
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:12.760]  That's right.
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:13.760]  The gut ties into the soul,
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:15.760]  and it'll tell you 100% right every time,
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:17.760]  but we don't want to follow it.
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:18.760]  But it's almost like you have two guts.
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:20.760]  It's like the angel on the devil on your shoulder.
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:22.760]  You've got the gut you know is good
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:24.760]  and cares about you that's always right,
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:25.760]  but then there's that other thing
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:26.760]  where it's like, don't listen to that.
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:27.760]  Don't listen.
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:28.760]  No, no, no.
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:30.760]  Andy gives you all these excuses,
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:31.760]  but you still know what's right.
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:33.760]  What do you call that other thing?
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:37.760]  I would say intelligence and heart.
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:40.760]  The intelligence is giving you the reason and the logic
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:42.760]  while the heart's trying to ground you
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:45.760]  more to the spirituality.
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:47.760]  But once again, these are all just words.
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:49.760]  You know, they really, at the end of the day,
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:50.760]  mean nothing.
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:54.760]  What matters more is the life, the living,
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:57.760]  what we are doing here,
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:00.760]  and just from my point of view,
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:03.760]  and I'm nobody, white nobody,
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:05.760]  and from my point of view,
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:09.760]  it looks like if these globalists are so elitist,
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:12.760]  money makers putting money on the pedestal
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:16.760]  and success as their paragon or their golden idol,
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.760]  it seems to me that this system they built
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:23.760]  is very, very counterproductive to profits.
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:26.760]  Well, that's the, a very high level of it
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:28.760]  with money and temporal power and status,
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:31.760]  but not the very top levels of the pyramid.
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:34.760]  It's all about raw power over humanity playing God.
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:37.760]  And that's why it's so destructive and it's counterproductive.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:40.760]  They get people to sell out believing it's for prosperity
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:41.760]  and it's a fraud in the end.
[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:43.760]  God bless you. Appreciate your point.
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:48.760]  Really good points from Wilde in Wisconsin.
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:56.760]  Go to Adam and Mary and Dean and Daryl here in a moment.
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:01.760]  These are the times that try people's souls.
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:04.760]  And the organized criminal takeover we're witnessing
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:07.760]  that's accelerating gets me hyped up.
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:09.760]  I mean, as I've said a thousand times or more,
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:11.760]  that's a normal animal response.
[02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:14.760]  And we're not animals, but we're in animals' bodies.
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:16.760]  I mean, we have our animals side, but we are men.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:20.760]  We are women. We are humans.
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:24.760]  But just my, even my bestial side
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:26.760]  wants to fight this tyranny.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:29.760]  I mean, it recognizes it as death.
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:31.760]  And we are amongst the living now.
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:33.760]  I am not afraid of death.
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:35.760]  I've seen so many family members and friends
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:37.760]  and people die, the more of them die.
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:40.760]  There's almost this weird thought of nostalgia.
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:42.760]  Someday I'll be with them.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  There's almost a thought of peace and death.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:52.760]  But I fear becoming weak, becoming old, and dying
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:59.760]  because then I can't defend my family, my friends, and others.
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:01.760]  I want to be strong for the tribe.
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:03.760]  I want to be strong for humanity.
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:06.760]  I want to create things and ideas that fight the fraud
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:09.760]  to make our people stronger, all of our people,
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:11.760]  to go forward together.
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:14.760]  And I try to be a good person, and it's hard.
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:17.760]  I can't imagine turning myself over to evil
[02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:20.760]  and using all the knowledge I have against people.
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:23.760]  I mean, just the thought of it makes me want to overturn this desk
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:26.760]  and start just, just breaking things.
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:29.760]  I mean, I just, the fundamental bad will
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:31.760]  of wanting to screw people over
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:33.760]  makes me viciously angry at the control freaks.
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:35.760]  I'm sick of them. I know their tricks.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:37.760]  I know every stinking thing about them.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:39.760]  Look at my hands around their throats.
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:41.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Canada.
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:43.760]  You're on the air.
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:47.760]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:48.760]  Welcome, brother.
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:49.760]  Thank you.
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:51.760]  Thank you for taking my call today.
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:54.760]  It's awfully brave of you to be able to take live
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:56.760]  dissenting calls on the air.
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:58.760]  I didn't even know that you, I see it says disagree.
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:00.760]  I don't even read what's under it most of the time.
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:03.760]  No, that's fine. Just go ahead, brother.
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:05.760]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:09.760]  You know, I agree with 99% of what you say.
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:14.760]  99% of the time, you are very prophetic.
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:17.760]  You've always been ahead of the curve.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:21.760]  And it's simply because you're willing to accept,
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:23.760]  you know, the signs and the symbols that are,
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:25.760]  they're placed right in front of you.
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:26.760]  Yeah, it's not hard. Exactly.
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:29.760]  It's a joke. It's a joke. I've done nothing special.
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:31.760]  Exactly. Exactly.
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:34.760]  I mean, I mean, these people do have a bizarre sense
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:39.760]  of honor in that they insist on telling you
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  what they're going to do right before they do it.
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:44.760]  Well, that's a metaphysical rule.
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:45.760]  The vampire has to get permission.
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:47.760]  I don't know why they do it, but they have to.
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:49.760]  But listen, get to what you disagree on.
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:50.760]  Go ahead.
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:51.760]  Okay.
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:56.760]  So my disagreement is on the basic premise that it's wrong.
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  Look, these people have, have planned this throughout.
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:05.760]  It's multi-generational, this plan.
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:10.760]  You know, they, they've got a plan for humanity
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  that ends up with us in this Star Trek style utopia.
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:19.760]  Unfortunately, we have to go through some growing pains
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:20.760]  before we get there.
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:22.760]  I'm going to, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:26.760]  I'm going to do overdrive so that we have time to talk today.
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:30.760]  And I'll get to Mary and Dean, everybody and Daryl.
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:33.760]  People know that in the job I'm in,
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:34.760]  if I break confidence with people,
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:37.760]  you see former NSA directors of, of intelligence,
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:39.760]  you see movie stars here.
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:40.760]  I mean, I don't break confidence.
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:42.760]  That's why I can get these big guests.
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  I have met with globalists pretty high level and top people,
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:48.760]  and they give me the exact same speech.
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:51.760]  Alex, we're in control for a reason.
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:53.760]  And the fact that you even know how we operate
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:54.760]  shows you should be one of us.
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:56.760]  I've been given the same speech,
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:01.760]  and we're going to break it down when we come back.
[02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:29.760]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric,
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:31.760]  engrave ink, embed strips and fibers
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:34.760]  to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank,
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:35.760]  having it led back at interest,
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:37.760]  forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:39.760]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:41.760]  when stating a central bank issuing to public currency
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:43.760]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:44.760]  than a standing army.
[02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:46.760]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book
[02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:48.760]  that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:51.760]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:52.760]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:54.760]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:57.760]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:51:59.760]  I will not kill you. I will not reveal you.
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:00.760]  Why, why, why?
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:03.760]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:05.760]  to do the research to develop a true
[02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:07.760]  nutraceutical formula that was designed
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:10.760]  to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:12.760]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:16.760]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:19.760]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:22.760]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:25.760]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:27.760]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:30.760]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:32.760]  with the highest quality ingredients
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:34.760]  that children would actually like and take.
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:37.760]  We worked with the lean manufacturer in nutritional supplements
[02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:39.760]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:41.760]  and powerful calming formula out there,
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:45.760]  introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:48.760]  like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients
[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:49.760]  that taste great.

[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:39.760]  You know, I said I could use to work 18 hours a day,
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:40.760]  probably three, four days a week.
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:43.760]  I worked that many hours, 15, 18 hours a day.
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:46.760]  Now, I can only do about 10, sometimes in the coast to coast,
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:50.760]  10, maybe 14 hours a day, but it's not the physical act.
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:54.760]  It's that I've got to go skeet shooting once every few weeks
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:58.760]  or fishing or hiking every few days.
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:02.760]  I've got to do something to just try to get my mind off this stuff.
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:06.760]  And I can't go see movies because that'll be full of propaganda.
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:12.760]  I mean, it's just crazy, but I've got to punch into the matrix to fight it.
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:15.760]  But realize, the globalists are just a bunch of pathetic crooks
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:16.760]  trying to take control of reality.
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:17.760]  They will fail.
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:19.760]  The question is how rough will it be?
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:22.760]  This caller I'm going to go right back to, and then to other callers,
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:26.760]  Mary and others, Adam, is saying what I always hear.
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:30.760]  Hey, listen, the elite took over because they are the elite.
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:32.760]  It's survival of the fittest, social Darwinism.
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:35.760]  The fact that you're into this shows that you're one of us,
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:38.760]  a classic thing, join us, you're part of the elite.
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:42.760]  That's what they told my dad in college because he was like top of his class.
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:45.760]  Same stuff, eugenics, world government.
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:48.760]  I mean, this has been going on a long time, and they just go after it.
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:51.760]  Everybody sticks their head up, and then most people join to be part of the elite
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:53.760]  and don't even become elite.
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:54.760]  And then what's elite?
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:56.760]  You fly on a helicopter?
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:55:58.760]  You eat the best food?
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:02.760]  I mean, you know, there's nothing to sell out to.
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  There's nothing to sell out to, folks.
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:09.760]  I was happier when I didn't have pretty much anything.
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:13.760]  Having things is a hassle.
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.760]  Pass an amount to be secure.
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:19.760]  But go ahead and make your point.
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:22.760]  You say you disagree, go ahead and get to it.
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:23.760]  Okay.
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:27.760]  Well, if you really want to get to the heart of where I disagree,
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:34.760]  your premise is that it's rich people manipulating the world market and the world economy.
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:38.760]  No, it is ultra-rich, crony capitalists waging war on rich people,
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:44.760]  Nuvarish middle class and working class, and then the giant domesticated slob class.
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:46.760]  Exactly, right?
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:52.760]  And your classifications are based on income, based on, you know, what you're worth.
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:54.760]  And I don't think that's really the case.
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:56.760]  Honestly, I think that...
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:00.760]  No, there have been a lot of dead poets that died poor that I think had beautiful minds,
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:03.760]  or Vincent Van Gogh I think was a great painter and only sold one painting.
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:05.760]  I mean, I get what you're saying.
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:08.760]  You're projecting on to me that I quantify everything by wealth.
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:13.760]  I quantify by wealth only at the level of voting rights in the global corporation.
[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:19.760]  I think they want to take money away from us because we might discover the power of using it in their paradigm to defeat them.
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:22.760]  No, no, no, Alex, that's not what I was saying.
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:23.760]  Not at all.
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:32.760]  Look, in the beginning, it was the wealthy plutocrats, the rich aristocracy from old Europe that was in control.
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:36.760]  Now, I believe that it's the smart people.
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:38.760]  It's the eggheads.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:42.760]  The rich people, they knew they weren't smart enough to pull this off on their own.
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:43.760]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:45.760]  The technocrats have taken over.
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:47.760]  The robber barons hired a bunch of scientists.
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:49.760]  They've now taken over.
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:51.760]  Exactly.
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:54.760]  So it's not the rich people trying to get rid of the poor people.
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.760]  It's the smart people trying to get rid of the dumb people.
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:57:59.760]  Yeah, well, let me tell you something.
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:00.760]  A, that's immoral.
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:02.760]  That's using the ring of Mordor.
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:05.760]  And they're targeting everyone with fluoride.
[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:07.760]  They're targeting everyone with GMO.
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:11.760]  And the argument is, well, the word gets out to smart people not to eat it.
[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:13.760]  Okay, well, what are the aluminum dioxide being sprayed?
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:15.760]  No, they like to kill people.
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:21.760]  The argument is, what they are is super smart people that are also sadists.
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:23.760]  They're absolutely correct.
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:25.760]  I'm going to get my hands around their thick.
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:29.760]  They just have a self-preservation instinct, right?
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:30.760]  No, no, no, no.
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:35.760]  You build up humanity, and then if a horde of dumbasses try to kill you, you take them out.
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:39.760]  But you don't play dirty, and it's evil, and what you just articulated is their master plan.
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:45.760]  I'm going to come back, 50% off, free shipping ends today, infowarslife.com, support us.
[02:58:45.760 --> 02:59:13.760]  I need the funding.
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:16.760]  This is a conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:18.760]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:20.760]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:22.760]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:24.760]  They are never going to stop.
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:28.760]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:38.760]  Imperatives destroy the planet TV.
[02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:40.760]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy.
[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:43.760]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:50.760]  Electrally, it's for God you can fail it.
[02:59:50.760 --> 03:00:01.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.760 --> 03:00:07.760]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.760 --> 03:00:11.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:16.760]  Tomorrow, if I get reminded to do it, I'm going to talk more about that last call
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:18.760]  or he can call back in sometime if he can get through.
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:20.760]  That's the whole mindset.
[03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:23.760]  We're putting four out into brain damage people because they're dumb and they deserve it.
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:27.760]  We're teaching them two plus two equals ten or five or eight to screw them up
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:29.760]  because we're the smart people.
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:31.760]  It's like, I'm a 41 year old man.
[03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:35.760]  I could hypothetically trick a two year old toddler to jump off a cliff.
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:37.760]  I'm smart.
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:40.760]  How we treat the least of us, we treat the greatest of us.
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:44.760]  And I just, I won't be part of it.
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  But see, notice the social engineers get good moral people to give all our rights up
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:52.760]  and our money up to take care of the big masses of people and they have a being nice
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:55.760]  while they're busy sawing their legs off and giving them crutches
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:01:01.760]  and then breeding a giant horde so that finally the small group left that's working
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  will join the globalist and exterminate the mass and then we'll all live happily ever after.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.760]  That's not going to happen.
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:10.760]  And that's how they've sold the agenda.
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:12.760]  It's just like they told the general public,
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:16.760]  we're going to reduce world population by half and then more internal documents 80%,
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:18.760]  higher level 90%.
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  And you get up to the very highest level of PhDs and it's like,
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  the human is a disease itself.
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:28.760]  We will merge into the new super sapien technocrat with the machines and become gods.
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:33.760]  There will be a final battle between our intellects to decide who will become the new God of the universe.
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:38.760]  I mean, it's just delusional crazy town and it's not going to happen.
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:41.760]  None of you will inherit the world or the universe.
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:49.760]  Your complete jokes, humanity and creation is like a compound eye to quote my dad.
[03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  And that's how the universe God experiences this level of consciousness.
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:59.760]  We're not God, but we're made in the image.
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:01.760]  We are God experiencing the universe.
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:09.760]  Christ came down the one, the only to as God to be a man.
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:12.760]  Pretty heavy, even if it's fiction, which I don't think it is.
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:15.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mary in California.
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:16.760]  You're on the air.
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:17.760]  Welcome.
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:18.760]  Thank you.
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:19.760]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:23.760]  That is that last color is just still a little lost.
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:25.760]  Pretty scary, pretty scary.
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:29.760]  We just have to keep praying for them.
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:35.760]  Well, I would like to call and let you know I have had four up close and personal.
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:41.760]  I'm now calling them Jade Helm for lack of better reference experiences.
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  And I am nobody, but actually I just had a kind of a revelation.
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:50.760]  And I think that's why I'm talking to you today.
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:55.760]  And I think I know why I'm being personally kind of followed.
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:03.760]  But I'll just say that my youngest son woke me up about five years ago to you and the truth,
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:07.760]  which led me to my full relationship with Jesus Christ.
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:08.760]  Wonderful.
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:10.760]  God bless you.
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:15.760]  My husband and I were walking into Wells Fargo.
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:18.760]  We had just opened up a checking account there.
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:26.760]  And I had on my info wars cap on and I had been buying all your informational.
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:27.760]  Sure.
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:28.760]  What happened, ma'am?
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:29.760]  We're almost out of time.
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:30.760]  Okay.
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:31.760]  Okay.
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:32.760]  Oh, there's so many incidents that have happened to me.
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:36.760]  But Wells Fargo actually, I could read her lips.
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:38.760]  The teller said, Oh, here she comes.
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:40.760]  Now she's coming with an info wars hat on.
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:46.760]  And she had a complete cop come from the back room and take a picture of me and my husband.
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:47.760]  We had closed down our car.
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:48.760]  No, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:54.260]  What they're doing is they've hired infregard millions, several million at least, who believe
[03:03:54.260 --> 03:03:55.260]  their spies.
[03:03:55.260 --> 03:03:58.760]  So they're looking for the terrorist, which is the Patriots.
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:03.760]  And so they're there enjoying their new role for during the collapse to then, you know,
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:05.760]  basically take people away.
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  And so, yes, this stuff is going on.
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:09.760]  I would just laugh at them.
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:15.760]  And again, move your bank account and understand this is their attempt to have humid to intimidate
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:18.760]  everybody and freak everybody out while they deny it on the news.
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:19.760]  Yes.
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:20.760]  This is what it's part of.
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:22.760]  I've had three more up close incidences.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.760]  Well, you're in California, ma'am.
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:25.760]  They've taken that state.
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:26.760]  It's theirs.
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:29.760]  I've had helicopters actually come.
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:32.760]  And I mean, if you have time, I can tell you what's happened.
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:38.460]  But I am going to tell you that the second incident happened when I was going to talk
[03:04:38.460 --> 03:04:41.760]  with my dad because I was just really wanting to inform my dad.
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:44.760]  You know, I'm like, looking up to my dad to save the world.
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:45.760]  Well, ma'am, I got to jump.
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:47.760]  You can call me back sometime, but here's to the all.
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:48.760]  I apologize.
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:49.760]  Some of this stuff's real.
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  And then it's meant to trigger even a normal person to get paranoid.
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:54.760]  Just love it.
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:56.760]  And don't worry about it.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:05:15.760]  They get the helicopter over their house to scan.
