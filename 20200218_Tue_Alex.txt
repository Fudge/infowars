[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Music
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.000]  Moving off turn four for the final time
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.000]  Blading to the outside
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  to the inside
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  Here comes hamlin' up the outside
[00:28.000 --> 00:43.940]  In a shower of sparks on his roof, Ryan Newman comes across the line fourth and comes to
[00:43.940 --> 00:55.880]  rest, scoring unofficial between Hamlin and Blaney as far as who crossed the finish line
[00:55.880 --> 01:08.740]  first.
[01:08.740 --> 01:14.480]  Newman got turned, went up in the air as he came down, was hit by another car and launched
[01:14.480 --> 01:34.320]  Skyward coming down on his roof. The AMR safety team is there quickly to attend Ryan Newman.
[01:34.320 --> 01:47.320]  A fist pump from Denny Hamlin. The man in the arena, it's not the critic who counts,
[01:47.320 --> 01:51.480]  it's not the man who points out all the strongman stumbles or where the doer of deeds could
[01:51.480 --> 01:55.120]  have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, whose
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.800]  face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who urrs, who comes
[01:59.800 --> 02:04.000]  short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.080]  who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasm, the great
[02:08.080 --> 02:12.800]  devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at least knows in the end the triumph
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.880]  of high achievement and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.720]  so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory
[02:22.720 --> 02:29.920]  nor defeat. I wanted to start with that today because predictably after Ryan Newman still
[02:29.920 --> 02:37.440]  fighting for his life after that 190-mile-an-hour crash when he was in the lead, epically coming
[02:37.440 --> 02:41.880]  in fourth on fire across the finish line after rolling repeatedly and shooting him in the
[02:41.880 --> 02:47.440]  air like a rocket, and the left celebrated and said, he likes Trump. He dared shake Trump's
[02:47.440 --> 02:54.320]  hand and say he likes him. He deserves it. It's an omen. No, these are modern gladiators
[02:54.320 --> 03:00.000]  who choose to get in the arena, completely the opposite of the timid souls who could
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.400]  never do one-one-hundredth of what Ryan Newman did. So if he dies, doesn't matter. He's up
[03:07.400 --> 03:14.120]  there as a champion, never amongst the timid cowardly, thumb-sucking slaves that support
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.800]  the Democratic Party, a truly disgusting group of miscreant individuals. Again, I am your
[03:19.800 --> 03:26.160]  host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us on this live February 18th, Tuesday global
[03:26.160 --> 03:32.400]  transmission. I'm going to be here in studio for the next four hours. Mike Adams is in
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.880]  the fourth hour. Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, completely vindicated by the UN admitting that vaccines
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.040]  are causing death and disease and destruction as they've been covering it up. She's going
[03:41.040 --> 03:45.440]  to be joining us in the third hour. We're going to have open phones in the first and
[03:45.440 --> 03:54.080]  second hour, probably into the third hour here today and so much more. So start your
[03:54.080 --> 04:02.240]  engines, ladies and gentlemen, because this is going to be one hell of a transmission
[04:02.240 --> 04:10.000]  today. It is just incredible. The Roger Stone news, the economy news, the Virginia gun grab
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.960]  news, the Boy Scouts of America news, the coronavirus news is spectacularly out of control.
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.720]  And it's all important because knowing is half the battle. It's good to understand what's
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.080]  happening, not hiding from it. We're not here to scare you. We're here to empower you because
[04:26.080 --> 04:31.560]  whether you believe here a man and woman in the arena or not, you really are in the arena.
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.560]  Life is being born to the arena and you can pretend to be a spectator all day, but you're
[04:36.560 --> 04:43.400]  not. You are a man and woman in the arena. I am your host, Alex Jones on this live global
[04:43.400 --> 04:47.400]  Tuesday transmission. So please remember as men and women in the arena, whether you live
[04:47.400 --> 04:53.440]  in Russia or Japan or Mexico or the U.S. or Venezuela or South Africa or Libya, spreading
[04:53.440 --> 05:01.320]  the word about this broadcast is a revolutionary act. Take action across the Western world
[05:01.320 --> 05:08.480]  from high school to college sports to even the Olympics. Men, biological men are winning
[05:08.480 --> 05:15.040]  almost all of the sporting events. This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them
[05:15.040 --> 05:20.200]  and taking their rights away, all in the name of the liberalism and openness. And then every
[05:20.200 --> 05:26.240]  day I have stacks of news articles just like today. UK team find under house arrest for
[05:26.240 --> 05:32.760]  asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings. UK mother spared jail
[05:32.760 --> 05:38.080]  for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have
[05:38.080 --> 05:44.920]  caused anxiety in the new royalty. That's the thought police. If a leftist has their
[05:44.920 --> 05:50.400]  feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail. This is tyranny. These
[05:50.400 --> 05:55.400]  people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti human
[05:55.400 --> 05:59.360]  takeover. Resist it. Speak out against it.
[05:59.360 --> 06:16.280]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[06:16.280 --> 06:45.120]  to Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. We are broadcasting worldwide on this
[06:45.120 --> 06:55.360]  Tuesday broadcast. I am your host, Alex Jones. Okay, let's go ahead and plow into the news
[06:55.360 --> 07:04.800]  and information that we're going to be breaking down here today. Massive new coronavirus developments.
[07:04.800 --> 07:14.560]  The left celebrating the deadly crash of Ryan Newman at the Daytona 500 and those that say
[07:14.560 --> 07:25.080]  it's wrong to celebrate him fighting for his life in 190 mile an hour crash. Twitter is
[07:25.080 --> 07:31.080]  banning or restricting them. I'm not kidding. Also, they're banning photos of Trump with
[07:31.080 --> 07:39.800]  racers at the event shaking hands. Nothing positive of the president is allowed. Continuing,
[07:39.800 --> 07:46.020]  it's the bottom of the hour. Caitlyn Bennett's first response to attack at Ohio University.
[07:46.020 --> 07:51.240]  She went there was interviewing people peacefully about president's day. A mob of 400 surrounded
[07:51.240 --> 07:57.640]  her, attacked her, attacked her vehicle and the police did nothing. Leftist newspapers
[07:57.640 --> 08:03.880]  are celebrating it as a good thing. Just type in Caitlyn Bennett, click news. You'll see
[08:03.880 --> 08:09.320]  the headlines about how, man, this is how you deal with it. You physically attack people
[08:09.320 --> 08:15.840]  in America. That's what the universities have turned into. Meanwhile, survey finds people
[08:15.840 --> 08:22.520]  who identify as left wing more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness. We're
[08:22.520 --> 08:28.680]  going to continue with the good news. Virginia Dims abandoned blackface Ralph Northam, joined
[08:28.680 --> 08:37.560]  Republicans to stop the semi auto ban that had been passed in their house. So the big
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.820]  protest, the demonstrations so far have gotten the Democrats, the few that aren't literally
[08:43.820 --> 08:51.480]  financed by Michael Bloomberg to not vote with Northam. So that is a huge victory there.
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.640]  So great job to everybody that protested in Virginia and around the country and came together.
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.720]  That is really a good thing. Continuing, we're going to get into Michael Bloomberg.
[09:01.720 --> 09:08.960]  Before he bash, this is all just kind of last 24 hours. Farmers is stupid. There's a video
[09:08.960 --> 09:16.080]  of him supporting death panels saying kill old people. He also tells his employees, kill
[09:16.080 --> 09:22.600]  your baby. I make more money when you kill your baby. I'm not kidding. That's all coming
[09:22.600 --> 09:33.360]  up. This is all just the last 24 hours. Young black Latino men don't know how to behave in
[09:33.360 --> 09:39.640]  the workplace says Bloomberg. There's video and audio of that. But don't worry. He's Hollywood's
[09:39.640 --> 09:45.480]  front runner. He's who they want. And as I've been saying for months, Matt Drudge is totally
[09:45.480 --> 09:51.600]  right. I heard that Bloomberg was playing to get in and have her as the VP. In fact, we're
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.760]  on record saying that. Well, Drudge has talked to the Bloomberg people and they admitted it
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.320]  but said, oh, maybe they're not that serious. But Drudge was accurate. They're considering
[09:59.320 --> 10:07.320]  Hillary Clinton as the running mate, Mike Bloomberg Trojan horse for Clintonista revival.
[10:07.320 --> 10:14.720]  We're going to be looking at all of that as well. Meanwhile, WikiLeaks Twitter account
[10:14.720 --> 10:23.640]  locked down days before Julian Assange's extradition hearings. And the Guardian did a whole piece
[10:23.640 --> 10:30.680]  about press freedom. Now that for press freedom didn't mention Julian Assange, it's like talking
[10:30.680 --> 10:36.200]  about the New Testament, not mentioning Jesus, not comparing Assange to Jesus. It's just
[10:36.200 --> 10:40.720]  comparable of like the main central character in press freedom would be Julian Assange,
[10:40.720 --> 10:48.600]  or the main person in the New Testament Jesus. It'd be like World War II and not including
[10:48.600 --> 10:56.280]  Hitler or Tojo or Roosevelt or Churchill. It's just wild. So we'll be breaking that
[10:56.280 --> 11:04.760]  down. And then of course, this very sad situation. I predicted this five years ago when the
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.760]  Boy Scouts of America, just like the Catholic Church got invaded by pedophile rings, when
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.760]  the Boy Scouts of America got taken over by the left and at their major camping events
[11:14.760 --> 11:22.120]  and jamborees, that's what they call it, handing out tens of thousands of condoms to people
[11:22.120 --> 11:30.280]  as young as eight years of age. Here's your condoms now go in the tent with an adult man
[11:30.280 --> 11:37.240]  and it destroyed the Boy Scouts. Another pro America, pro freedom, wholesome outdoors organization
[11:37.240 --> 11:45.880]  hundreds of years old, gone Boy Scouts of America, foul for bankruptcy amid sex scandal lawsuits.
[11:45.880 --> 11:52.200]  I told you about a year ago, I was on board a plane flying back from California. And there
[11:52.200 --> 11:58.440]  was a lawyer sitting caddy corner to me, writing up documents about settlements, and he worked
[11:58.440 --> 12:04.120]  for the Boy Scouts of America. And he said, my God, it's all over. This will end the Scouts.
[12:04.120 --> 12:10.880]  And he was just shaking his head. And so I was eavesdropping off and on, you know, when
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.360]  we're sitting there for 10 minutes for a takeoff, he's on the phone, talking about how it's
[12:14.360 --> 12:21.720]  all over. But you had to virtue signal just like men dominate all women's sports now.
[12:21.720 --> 12:27.440]  And it'll be all biological men in the Olympics now. They're already winning most of the sports,
[12:27.440 --> 12:34.240]  almost all men. But you must virtue signal like, oh, we're not against gays here. Give
[12:34.240 --> 12:42.440]  our seven year olds condoms and get in the tent with them. You see, major universities,
[12:42.440 --> 12:55.600]  the Vatican, the Catholic Church, law enforcement, public education, the Boy Scouts, local churches,
[12:55.600 --> 13:04.720]  it's all falling to the sex cult, to the perverts. Oh, and you can't have something for boys
[13:04.720 --> 13:08.400]  so the girls need to join. You can't have something for girls so the boys need to join.
[13:08.400 --> 13:14.080]  And then the boys need to be able to go in the girls' showers. Remember Chris Cuomo
[13:14.080 --> 13:24.800]  a few months ago? And then again, last year, he said, some adults don't want biological
[13:24.800 --> 13:31.200]  men in showers with their daughters at public schools. Those parents are bad and are bigots
[13:31.200 --> 13:36.480]  and need to get in trouble. He said, so what if your 11 year old daughter sees a woman's
[13:36.480 --> 13:42.280]  penis? That's a quote. Think of the devil speak. Think of the mind control. So what if
[13:42.280 --> 13:57.560]  your daughter sees a woman's penis? But see, I've got a stack of articles here from the
[13:57.560 --> 14:03.280]  UK, that's one of the Tabistock Institute, that is the vanguard of all this, where people
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.800]  are being arrested, you name it, UK teen find under house arrest for asking trans police
[14:07.800 --> 14:18.360]  officers gender, because it hurt their feelings. They felt upset and embarrassed. And it goes
[14:18.360 --> 14:26.320]  on UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman order to pay a 1000 pound fine.
[14:26.320 --> 14:32.920]  And it's all written like it's completely normal and a good thing. Oh, wait a minute,
[14:32.920 --> 14:39.800]  your daughter doesn't want to see a woman's penis. This is the total oppression, the total
[14:39.800 --> 14:47.880]  control of a cult taking over. And they mean business. All right, when we come back, I'm
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.680]  going into the big developments on the coronavirus first. And then Caitlin Bennett's going to
[14:53.680 --> 14:56.960]  join us. And she's got exclusive video. She's got hours of them attacking or them trying
[14:56.960 --> 15:01.880]  to get out of there, like escape from New York or something, but it was escape from Ohio
[15:01.880 --> 15:04.720]  University. That's coming up bottom of the hour. We're going to have exclusive video
[15:04.720 --> 15:12.520]  for you. And so much more here today. I just scratch the very surface of this. Please don't
[15:12.520 --> 15:17.520]  forget vitamin mineral fusion is amazing amino acids, vitamins, minerals, all in one great

[19:28.640 --> 19:32.800]  you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things. People say,
[19:32.800 --> 19:36.080]  why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.240]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennik, let me just ask you what you think
[19:40.240 --> 19:45.920]  because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to
[19:45.920 --> 19:51.760]  repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all
[19:51.760 --> 19:56.160]  silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[19:56.160 --> 20:17.600]  Nice. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.480 --> 20:47.760]  Okay. Let's get into the virus that is
[20:47.760 --> 20:58.720]  clearly with all the evidence being admitted now, way more contagious and way more lethal
[20:59.440 --> 21:04.400]  than had originally been said. And that's why we're seeing just the insane response
[21:05.840 --> 21:12.880]  that is taking place in China and surrounding areas. Here's just some of the headlines.
[21:12.880 --> 21:20.240]  Head of Wuhan Hospital dies of coronavirus. How many prominent activists and doctors
[21:21.600 --> 21:26.560]  and reporters have now died of it? So either the virus is super deadly statistically
[21:27.680 --> 21:31.200]  or they're killing people that haven't served the Chai comms well
[21:36.720 --> 21:38.480]  and are using it as a cover story.
[21:38.480 --> 21:50.480]  Continuing. China shut down to crush India's already crumbling economy.
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.240]  And so again, the engine of the world economy to a great extent has been China.
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.960]  And the fact that this Wuhan virus has grounded to a halt. I'll show you some examples of that in
[22:00.960 --> 22:09.520]  a moment. The fact that that's happened should make us ask, what is this really all about?
[22:09.520 --> 22:14.320]  Will it be used as the excuse for popping the global Ponzi scheme bubble finally?
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.360]  And the globalist believe defeating nationalist and populist with a global crisis,
[22:19.360 --> 22:25.920]  both economic and biological. Coronavirus. China puts 58 million people in lockdown
[22:25.920 --> 22:33.120]  indefinitely as towns and villages sealed shut to stop the epidemic. By the way, that number is
[22:33.120 --> 22:40.400]  way low. It's 700 and something million lockdown twice the US population. So that's some articles
[22:40.400 --> 22:44.640]  behind the times. Senior Wuhan doctor dies, as we just mentioned. There's the Guardian.
[22:48.080 --> 22:53.600]  Armed criminals steal 600 rolls of toilet paper in Hong Kong.
[22:53.600 --> 22:58.480]  You see, during a breakdown, people go after the basic essentials. Here's another one.
[22:58.480 --> 23:09.200]  Bare faced robbery. Thieves steal 6,000 hygiene masks in Japan. Yahoo News is reporting.
[23:10.400 --> 23:16.480]  China destroys 600 million in cash to stop coronavirus spread on infected banknotes.
[23:16.480 --> 23:24.640]  Another demonization of cash. Let's see, drones, they don't get sick from the virus. Robots.
[23:25.680 --> 23:30.720]  Oh, cash is the problem. Digital money is not a problem. China detains activists who accuse Z
[23:31.600 --> 23:38.160]  of coronavirus cover up. Chinese villager, you ought to see the video, is tied to a post and
[23:38.160 --> 23:46.080]  scolded, refusing to wear face mask. American cruise passengers quarantined at US military base,
[23:46.080 --> 23:56.960]  taken off the ship. AP reports. Why did the US Diamond Princess Coronavirus quarantine?
[23:58.880 --> 24:04.720]  Why did the US break Diamond Princess Coronavirus quarantine? Something went awry.
[24:07.360 --> 24:11.920]  So that's just some of the news unfolding. But I want to go back
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.400]  to the toilet paper and back to the face mask being stolen in broad daylight
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.560]  in Japan and in Taiwan and other areas. This is what happens when there's a breakdown of society.
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.480]  People go after the essentials. The essentials run out. And if the essentials aren't there,
[24:32.480 --> 24:38.080]  things will think are essentials. People then begin to panic and crime rates explode.
[24:38.080 --> 24:44.320]  So imagine something like this in the United States or Western Europe that have way higher
[24:44.320 --> 24:54.000]  crime rates in places like Taiwan or China or Japan. Stefan Malinu tweeted out an article
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.720]  from Russian news. We can roll the video of that. Transport collapse in China. Who needs these eggs
[25:00.720 --> 25:10.960]  now? And the video just shows a huge warehouse full of eggs that are just sitting there preparing
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.120]  to rot because they don't have any way to deliver it. That's what the Russian
[25:17.680 --> 25:25.200]  and Chinese news agencies are reporting. And that's why as we go to break, I promote high
[25:25.200 --> 25:31.040]  quality storable foods because the safest place is where you have good clean water,
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.360]  which is good water filtration. You can take an Alexa Pure Breeze or a Pro Pure Breeze.
[25:35.360 --> 25:41.920]  We both sell at the best lowest prices at m4store.com that chip to you in hours after you order them.
[25:41.920 --> 25:48.560]  They have a great supply of those. And you can go to a pond, a lake. You can get contaminated tap
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.560]  water. You don't trust the government. You don't trust the system. You run it right through that
[25:52.560 --> 25:58.800]  and it produces dozens and dozens and dozens of gallons a day. It's their smaller basic unit.
[26:00.160 --> 26:05.760]  And you take storable food. Why do I have firearms? Why do I know how to use firearms?
[26:05.760 --> 26:13.600]  Why do I have communications? Why do I have storable food? Why do I have a small place in
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.960]  the country to be able to run to? Because it's real insurance, not just trusting insurance in
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.720]  some bank or some digital system. I don't have any 401k. I don't have any digital savings.
[26:27.840 --> 26:33.360]  I don't have any pension fund because I don't trust the system. I have friends. I have family.
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.640]  I have some land and I have guns to protect it and I have food to eat. And I know how to skid a
[26:38.640 --> 26:44.880]  buck and run a truck line. But again, for the average person, just having a month's supply
[26:44.880 --> 26:51.200]  of storable sealed high quality food gives you a leg up to protect yourself during a crisis
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.600]  or six months or a year. And if you have money, you better have extra food to take care of your
[26:55.600 --> 27:02.480]  friends and family because when there is a breakdown of civilization, those that have
[27:02.480 --> 27:08.560]  extra food and extra preparedness items are going to be in the best position into the future to
[27:08.560 --> 27:15.920]  barter, to organize, to be seen as leaders in your community. And we hope this giant global
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.960]  industrial Ponzi scheme can continue on because we're all part of it. But if you look at the
[27:20.960 --> 27:25.600]  Great Depression, 17 million people it's estimated starved to death in the United States. And that
[27:25.600 --> 27:30.960]  was with 90% of people being rural and more than half of them being totally self-sufficient. Today
[27:30.960 --> 27:38.160]  we're 90% urban, 10% rural, and only half the rural communities are self-sufficient. We are sitting
[27:38.160 --> 27:44.880]  on top of a time bomb. You've ever seen footage of army ants going through the South American
[27:44.880 --> 27:50.480]  jungle and clearing hundreds of acres in a day or locusts descending in and destroying crops in
[27:50.480 --> 27:58.880]  Africa or the Middle East? Humans are beyond that during a crisis within just a week to 10 days.
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.000]  Most people become homicidal murderers. Within about 15 days, most people become cannibals
[28:04.000 --> 28:16.320]  like giant bipedal, warm-blooded piranhas with a locust-like drive and hunger to eat everything
[28:16.880 --> 28:21.440]  in their path. So they are still available to ship high-quality herbal food to you.
[28:21.440 --> 28:26.560]  It's all dropship right from infowarstore.com. My Patriots in our system ships just as quick as
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.080]  with them. We have the best prices. It funds the info war and it's 10 to 14 days now to get it.
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.320]  They're about to have to increase it again because food orders just continue, continue,
[28:36.320 --> 28:40.480]  continue. They've got enough food now. They think for about a month to keep packaging so you will
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.720]  get your order and lock it in if you order now. But in the future, they may run out even though
[28:44.720 --> 28:48.960]  they were positioned to be there during a real crisis and their mission is really to supply the
[28:48.960 --> 28:54.720]  people. This is so serious, they may run out soon as well. So take action now infowarstore.com.
[28:57.760 --> 29:01.840]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[29:01.840 --> 29:07.600]  without all the speculation. No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.400]  downs of Bitcoin. Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers

[29:17.040 --> 29:21.440]  entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment
[29:21.440 --> 29:26.160]  used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets. Non-security IPO or note,
[29:26.160 --> 29:31.520]  blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27%

[29:52.160 --> 29:55.360]  risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell
[29:55.360 --> 30:02.160]  the security which requires an offering document. All right, folks, here's the bad news. We've
[30:02.160 --> 30:07.280]  already sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's documented
[30:07.280 --> 30:13.200]  to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else. But we do still have it in the 3-ounce and
[30:13.200 --> 30:19.520]  the 1-ounce for limited time. The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super
[30:19.520 --> 30:25.120]  silver toothpaste, both that have the nano silver in them as well. The super blue has tea tree that's
[30:25.120 --> 30:30.720]  also antiviral and antibacterial and high-quality iodine. And then, of course, the whitening has
[30:30.720 --> 30:36.400]  the nano silver, but on top of that, it has the above-secral calcium that remelamorizes the teeth.
[30:36.400 --> 30:40.880]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find. Period. It has the nano silver,
[30:40.880 --> 30:44.720]  and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out at current rates in about two weeks.
[30:44.720 --> 30:50.480]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves
[30:50.480 --> 30:55.520]  with this high-quality product. You've never used it before. Get yours today. Infowarsstore.com.
[30:56.080 --> 31:02.320]  Infowarsstore.com. I wanted to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried
[31:02.320 --> 31:07.120]  it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best
[31:07.120 --> 31:10.480]  toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[31:10.480 --> 31:16.000]  You got to get up there and tell people. And so here I am telling people super silver whitening
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.760]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot
[31:21.760 --> 31:27.120]  of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference, the game changer in this
[31:27.120 --> 31:32.800]  is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[31:32.800 --> 31:37.600]  that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good.
[31:37.600 --> 31:43.360]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[31:43.360 --> 31:48.640]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like
[31:48.640 --> 32:04.560]  the way it feels. At the end of World War Two, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics
[32:04.560 --> 32:10.960]  and world population control organizations. They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley,
[32:10.960 --> 32:18.400]  Aldous Huxley's brother, decided to repackage themselves as transhumanist. Now in the year 2020,
[32:18.400 --> 32:25.280]  to set the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given rights,
[32:25.280 --> 32:32.240]  you name it, they are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender
[32:32.240 --> 32:39.600]  someone. So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell
[32:39.600 --> 32:45.360]  what they are. This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control, and there's several big articles up
[32:45.360 --> 32:51.520]  on infowars.com that break this down. UK teen fine under house arrest for asking trans police
[32:51.520 --> 32:58.160]  officers, gender, UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman, order to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[32:58.160 --> 33:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.160 --> 33:46.160]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[33:47.600 --> 33:54.080]  And thematically, we see the Democrats led by Maxine Waters and others saying,
[33:54.080 --> 33:59.280]  don't let Republicans go to the gas station, don't let them go to a restaurant,
[33:59.280 --> 34:04.240]  don't let them go to the supermarket, go out and confront them everywhere they're Nazis.
[34:05.200 --> 34:08.960]  And we saw Ryan Newman's horrific crash, we're going to play again in a moment,
[34:09.680 --> 34:14.960]  at Daytona 500, he's fighting for his life still right now in critical condition.
[34:16.480 --> 34:18.320]  And I've got the stacks of tweets here
[34:18.320 --> 34:26.640]  where people celebrated it and said he deserved it. And then those that said it was wrong
[34:27.520 --> 34:35.680]  and said that liberalism is a disease of the mind, how dare you be glad he almost died,
[34:35.680 --> 34:48.160]  and Twitter suspends or blocks their accounts. That's the type of garbage
[34:50.080 --> 34:55.760]  that goes on in this country, but it gets worse. Tweets put out of the president
[34:57.360 --> 35:03.920]  with photos of NASCAR drivers are being blocked as inappropriate. Well, of course they are.
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.800]  Anything with Trump and Melania because she's popular is blocked. Facebook won't take ads with
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.440]  her. And then he's with a female driver. That's not allowed. Women don't like Trump.
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.920]  That's pure election meddling, but Trump does nothing.
[35:23.920 --> 35:28.080]  So let's go to that footage that they're celebrating so much right now. And we'll go to
[35:28.080 --> 35:36.080]  Caitlin Bennett and what just happened to her at Ohio University.
[35:58.080 --> 36:04.720]  Newman comes across the line fourth and comes to rest,
[36:04.720 --> 36:28.720]  scoring unofficial between Hamlin and Blaney as far as who crossed the finish line first.
[36:28.720 --> 36:34.880]  Newman got turned, went up in the air as he came down, was hit by another car and launched
[36:34.880 --> 36:41.040]  Skyward. Okay, I'm not going to read you all the leftist tweets as they celebrated. It said,
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.560]  apologize, the Flotson article at news wars dot com and info wars dot com. But the only way
[36:46.560 --> 36:52.960]  you see the leftist doing this is from info wars dot com. Because anybody else criticizes it gets
[36:52.960 --> 37:00.480]  blocked or banned on Twitter. They just let their mob of savage criminals gang up and bully people
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.440]  everywhere on Twitter on Facebook on YouTube. And Trump just sits there and takes it.
[37:08.720 --> 37:13.920]  That's why we're launching operation 2020 that will officially be launched with the website and
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.560]  a video and how to take action this afternoon. It's almost done.
[37:18.560 --> 37:25.840]  We're going to go to Trump rallies, and we're going to wear stickers over our mouths that just
[37:25.840 --> 37:31.600]  say stop the censorship. And the silence will be incredibly powerful. And people will say,
[37:31.600 --> 37:35.440]  why are you wearing that? And you'll explain because Trump has betrayed us on this front.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.920]  You understand he's dealing with the chai comms and the globalist and the fake impeachment.
[37:39.920 --> 37:45.440]  I get it. But this is an American what's going on and it's racketeering and it's
[37:45.440 --> 37:53.760]  got to be dealt with. And speaking of that, yesterday, my phone starts blowing up during
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.000]  the war room saying, did you see just what happened to one of your great correspondents,
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.320]  Caitlin Bennett? And I said no. So I called her. She didn't answer. I went to her Twitter and saw
[38:04.320 --> 38:08.960]  one of the videos. And they got hours of this footage that's going up as we speak.
[38:08.960 --> 38:16.480]  And it was a mob of 400 people chasing her off the campus, screaming at her, spitting at
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.680]  them, grabbing at them, throwing bottles at their vehicles and the police doing nothing.
[38:21.680 --> 38:31.680]  But it's bigger than Caitlin Bennett. It's about the mob psychology and the rest of the story.
[38:32.320 --> 38:35.200]  She's putting a big report together with right now that she just went out to do
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.320]  president's day coverage. They know who she is. She's a woman. She's pro-Trump.
[38:41.200 --> 38:46.960]  She's pro-second amendment. And this is how they respond to her. We're going to go to her in a
[38:46.960 --> 38:51.120]  moment. But let's play this clip. This is what happens when a Trump supporter goes to a college
[38:51.120 --> 38:59.280]  campus, left us at Ohio University, started a riot when Joel Patrick 1776 and I showed up
[38:59.280 --> 39:07.120]  and the police let it happen. I think Donald Trump should start funding, should stop funding,
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.760]  strip funding from universities like this, that harbor terrorists. Yeah, Trump signed executive
[39:11.760 --> 39:15.360]  orders saying if you don't support free speech, you have your funding pulled. But this is what
[39:15.360 --> 39:31.280]  the left has created. This is what they've done. Here it is.
[39:31.280 --> 39:43.200]  Oh. They're still throwing stuff. You need to back up.
[39:43.200 --> 39:55.120]  Why is that cop just letting this off? He told me, Justin, he told me he could not help me.
[39:55.120 --> 40:01.520]  He has nowhere for me to go. I like that horn. These cops are watching this happen. There's
[40:01.520 --> 40:16.720]  another one. They're still throwing stuff. This is what taxpayer money and sending your
[40:16.720 --> 40:21.920]  children to school does. You send them there to become un-Americans. Now we're going to play one
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.160]  more clip and then go to Caitlin Bennett. And again, they've got hours of this footage. They're
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.960]  shell-shocked. They're trying to upload it. There's so much cussing that if you don't bleep
[40:30.960 --> 40:33.920]  it, YouTube will then penalize you. We've got a bunch of raw footage. We're going to play next
[40:33.920 --> 40:40.000]  segment, but with no audio because we're on AM and FM stations and also TV stations, hundreds of
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.800]  them. And of course, we respect that. It's just bleeping it out. It's just beep, beep, beep,
[40:44.800 --> 40:48.640]  because it's just every other word is a cuss word. If you're a radio listener, you've got to go
[40:48.640 --> 40:55.360]  to infowars.com and see the raw footage of this and a band on video. So as we go to break, here's
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.600]  a clip of the police lied and said that no violence happened and that there was just
[41:01.600 --> 41:07.200]  allegations that some unknown person splashed water and were throwing things at her all day
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.000]  and grabbing at her. They dumped hot coffee on her and vandalized the truck right in front of the
[41:12.000 --> 41:22.000]  police. Here's footage.
[41:42.000 --> 42:10.000]  You want no oppressions? If any, you're in the face. You don't understand the oppressions.
[42:10.000 --> 42:18.960]  There's a lot more of this. Let's stop right here. We're going to come back with Caitlin Bennett
[42:18.960 --> 42:21.840]  and then we'll go a little bit at the next hour, whether we're going to open the phones up about
[42:21.840 --> 42:28.320]  this whole issue. But we sponsor her. I want to thank listeners for supporting us because I've
[42:28.320 --> 42:33.520]  been able to double her funding, which wasn't much to get to security people. You see that huge guy
[42:33.520 --> 42:38.480]  that's with her. A lot of courage now in America to go to a university to do polite interviews.
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.680]  And the security people have courage, not just, you know, little Caitlin Bennett has got the
[42:43.680 --> 42:48.480]  heart of a lion here. This is what this country's turned into. This is what we've let it turn into
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.400]  with these out of control hyena like bullies everywhere who've totally abandoned every American
[42:54.400 --> 43:02.880]  value and incredibly dangerous across the western world from high school to college sports to even
[43:02.880 --> 43:10.720]  the Olympics. Men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events. This is men
[43:10.720 --> 43:16.880]  invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in the name of
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.400]  the liberalism and openness. And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today.
[43:22.400 --> 43:29.120]  UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[43:29.120 --> 43:36.560]  UK mother spared jail for misgenerating trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it
[43:36.560 --> 43:43.680]  could have caused anxiety in the new royalty. That's the thought police. If a leftist has
[43:43.680 --> 43:49.760]  their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail. This is tyranny. These people
[43:49.760 --> 43:55.440]  are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[43:55.440 --> 44:01.920]  Resist it. Speak out against it. There can no longer be any doubt. This coronavirus
[44:01.920 --> 44:07.680]  is serious on multiple levels. It's very communicable. It spreads very, very fast.
[44:07.680 --> 44:12.800]  It is killing a lot of people and the Chinese communist government has covered up just how
[44:12.800 --> 44:18.240]  bad it is and the lighthouse is now openly challenging them show our Trump's top scientist
[44:18.240 --> 44:26.160]  and so is Senator Cotton. My friends now is the time to get prepared. 2020 is not a year to play
[44:26.160 --> 44:31.600]  games with the globalist are trying to create economic collapse race riots. We don't know
[44:31.600 --> 44:37.280]  how bad this virus is going to get here. That's why listeners to info wars need to be prepared
[44:37.280 --> 44:44.160]  and infowarstore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier. We have
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.040]  the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak. We have high quality, storeable foods
[44:49.040 --> 44:56.320]  ready to ship and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock along with ultra 12 at infowarstore.com.
[44:59.600 --> 45:03.120]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day long but,
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.960]  man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.400]  and everybody, I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said,
[45:12.400 --> 45:17.440]  about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have a warehouse full of
[45:17.440 --> 45:22.800]  hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second
[45:22.800 --> 45:27.360]  Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowarstore.com and it looks like duct tape but it's just a
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.440]  regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over
[45:31.440 --> 45:35.120]  without even disrupting things. People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? When you go,
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.120]  well, we're being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennick,
[45:39.120 --> 45:42.960]  let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've
[45:42.960 --> 45:49.680]  taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[45:49.680 --> 45:56.320]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.000]  Three weeks ago, we told you that the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.240]  for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.800]  Now we know that that is the case. And we know the federal government and major corporations have
[46:12.800 --> 46:17.840]  been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country. Almost everyone else is sold
[46:17.840 --> 46:24.960]  out. But our supplier, my patriot, infowarstore.com still has their entire line of high quality,
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.600]  fresh food. And it's fresh. That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered,
[46:29.600 --> 46:32.880]  not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it and their factories
[46:32.880 --> 46:38.880]  are going 24 hours a day. High quality, fresh food, the best package systems, tastes great,
[46:38.880 --> 46:43.360]  protects you and your family, and funds the info war. You just got to get the orders in
[46:43.360 --> 46:48.320]  until they extended out even more, which could happen. Lock in your orders now. Ensure you get
[46:48.320 --> 46:54.960]  it at infowarstore.com today. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[46:54.960 --> 47:04.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:04.320 --> 47:19.680]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.400]  Is a freelance independent reporter that info wars puts in the field,
[47:38.960 --> 47:43.840]  that you, the listeners and viewers support. And if you're a radio listener, you hear a bunch
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.160]  of yelling and screaming. If you're a TV viewer, it's making you sick, like it's making me sick.
[47:48.160 --> 47:51.200]  And you see this everywhere. Leftist mobs on their own
[47:52.720 --> 47:57.840]  bubbles of anti free speech, anti America, these, these, these metastasizing cancers.
[47:57.840 --> 48:03.680]  And you go to these universities. I mean, oh, and Troyer can just go to UT or go to Texas state,
[48:03.680 --> 48:09.760]  just south of Austin. And they start screaming and going, right, it's, it's like, start jumping
[48:09.760 --> 48:14.880]  and screaming at him. But he's a man and laughs at him and yells at him. So they kind of back off.
[48:14.880 --> 48:22.720]  But the cowardice of Antifa on the left, when they see a woman, even if she's got looks like a,
[48:22.720 --> 48:26.720]  almost like a seven foot security guy with her. I mean, the guy's up there.
[48:26.720 --> 48:33.280]  I mean, the guy's up there. They don't see him. They see a woman. And there's something about
[48:33.280 --> 48:41.360]  a woman being pro America, pro gun with the left that drives the left insane or a black person
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.440]  that's pro America or pro gun, which is actually most of the black folks I know, the numbers are
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.560]  showing that the Republicans aren't getting 10%. They're getting 30, 40% of black voters now.
[48:50.560 --> 48:54.720]  And that's panicking the left. They're like, you're a woman. You belong to us.
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.480]  Caitlin, why do you think they go so crazy? Cause I know you've got the raw footage. I've talked to
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.440]  you. I know how you report very polite, very nice. You're out there. You were doing a president's
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.600]  day interview and you said very soon they surrounded you. Describe what happened.
[49:08.640 --> 49:15.040]  So one to answer your question, they hate me because Twitter tells them to last month, I went
[49:15.040 --> 49:21.280]  viral with millions of people laughing at me, mocking me, threatening me, threatening terrible,
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.800]  terrible things to me because Twitter has been going to my YouTube. It's like they just now
[49:26.800 --> 49:32.560]  found out that I make YouTube videos and they clip up my videos, lie about the context. They
[49:32.560 --> 49:38.640]  take two minutes out of a 20 minute video, clip it up and then lie about the context to tell people
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.080]  I'm racist and I'm homophobic and I hate trans people, all of this stuff, which isn't true.
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.840]  So they lie about me and no one's coming to, to actually look at the video to see the truth. So
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.960]  that's the first answer to your question. Why do they hate me? Secondly, what happened? I was just
[49:54.960 --> 50:00.880]  there to ask questions. Like you said, president's day trivia questions about who was the first,
[50:00.880 --> 50:06.320]  who were the first three presidents who was president during 9 11, stuff like that. Who was
[50:06.320 --> 50:11.120]  the president that was so fat you got stuck in his bathtub. Those are the questions we were going
[50:11.120 --> 50:17.120]  there to ask to have fun. But within five minutes, there were about 10 people around me. I only got
[50:17.120 --> 50:23.840]  to talk to one person about the trivia questions. And then I'm not kidding. Within 30 minutes,
[50:23.840 --> 50:29.840]  there were at least 300, 400 people around me. And then I just thought, you know, okay, they're
[50:29.840 --> 50:36.320]  going to mob me and scream and put phones in my face and tell lies and try to go viral off of rumors.
[50:36.320 --> 50:41.760]  But they started throwing things at me. And that's when I knew that this was going to be
[50:41.760 --> 50:46.240]  something completely different than I've ever experienced. When they started throwing stuff at
[50:46.240 --> 50:51.680]  me, I was like, okay, maybe we should just go and then we'll regroup and come back at another time
[50:51.680 --> 50:57.520]  when I have more security guards, a security guard, a seven foot three inches. That's all
[50:57.520 --> 51:01.680]  tall. He is in that clip right there. That's being shown. He had exaggerated. He looks like he's
[51:01.680 --> 51:07.440]  seven feet tall. No, you weren't exaggerating. You were, you were not exaggerating at all because
[51:07.440 --> 51:13.200]  he's taller than seven feet tall. He had to pick me up and carry me out three times because they
[51:13.200 --> 51:20.000]  wouldn't let me leave. They were throwing just so much going on in my mind. I want to talk about the
[51:20.000 --> 51:27.600]  police. They lied in their statement. They said that an unknown person may have splashed water.
[51:27.600 --> 51:33.920]  That is not true. I told the supervisor on the phone, I got thrown on my leg hot coffee. It
[51:33.920 --> 51:40.080]  burnt my leg. It was so hot. And then their officers even got splashed with iced coffee.
[51:40.080 --> 51:47.040]  So this is how famous you are. I have people that walk up to me in the grocery store on the
[51:47.040 --> 51:51.040]  side of the street with their children saying, we love Caitlin Bennett. We love Millie Weaver. We
[51:51.040 --> 51:56.000]  love what you're doing, but they really bring you up in particular and million others. People
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.680]  really appreciate you. You get millions of views every day. And you're a nice, sweet lady. Your
[52:01.680 --> 52:06.400]  fiance is a nice gentleman. Your camera guy is a gentleman. I mean, you guys are just like
[52:06.400 --> 52:13.680]  rock ribbed Midwestern heart of America. Nice people. You'd be great neighbors. What is it
[52:13.680 --> 52:19.200]  about you that enrages these people? It's because I don't think men can become women. It's because
[52:19.200 --> 52:24.720]  I don't think we should be allowing people like in facilities like Planned Parenthood to kill our
[52:24.720 --> 52:29.360]  children. I don't think we should be indoctrinating children into taking transgender hormone
[52:29.360 --> 52:34.160]  replacement therapy. I don't believe in that stuff. I believe in free speech. I believe in the
[52:34.160 --> 52:39.360]  second amendment. That's why they hate me because they're teaching on those colleges that you're
[52:39.360 --> 52:44.320]  the enemy. You realize you're incredible success because I know despite that mob attacking you,
[52:44.320 --> 52:48.960]  a lot of those young people are going to learn the truth now and who you really are and are going
[52:48.960 --> 52:55.920]  to learn how shameful they are. Any person watching this footage that has two brain cells can see
[52:55.920 --> 53:01.680]  that this is not how you protest your ideas. If they wanted to come out and protest, that's fine.
[53:01.680 --> 53:07.040]  Protest me. Give me that attention. Whatever. Great content. But that's not what they did.
[53:07.040 --> 53:12.160]  They came out to hurt me that day. I think if I didn't have John, my bodyguard there,
[53:12.160 --> 53:17.520]  I would be in the hospital. I truly believe I would be in the hospital if I didn't have my bodyguard.
[53:17.520 --> 53:24.240]  So all they did was prove to me that next time I'm there, I will be coming back with an army of
[53:24.240 --> 53:29.760]  gun owners to show that that campus needs campus carry. They need to be able to protect themselves.
[53:29.760 --> 53:36.000]  And for any viewer and radio listener watching, this isn't just about me. It's about my ideas
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.880]  because I'm not afraid to boldly stand up and say it is wrong to let men into the women's restroom.
[53:42.880 --> 53:48.400]  It is not normal for men to dress up in dresses and call themselves women. It's not normal for
[53:48.400 --> 53:54.880]  people to stand up on a global academy stage and hold her golden globe and say, I killed my baby
[53:54.880 --> 54:00.800]  for this. This is women empowerment. It's not normal. And I'm not afraid to say it. And I know
[54:00.800 --> 54:06.080]  there's tons of people who think like me out there. And I know if they were to walk onto that same
[54:06.080 --> 54:11.760]  campus and people knew their opinions, they would get treated the exact same. It's not just about
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.960]  me. It's about what I believe in. It's about people trying to attack people who believe in the same
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.800]  things I do. So this isn't just about me. It's about everyone out there who thinks like me.
[54:22.800 --> 54:27.520]  Because if you walked onto that campus with the red MAGA hat, they do the same thing to you.
[54:29.120 --> 54:35.840]  This is authoritarianism. This is dyed in the wool, Nazism, Communism, authoritarianism, fascism,
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.480]  whatever you want to call it. And if you put your name down, Caitlin Bennett into Google and click
[54:40.480 --> 54:47.200]  news, you see the deceptive headlines. USA Today, Kent State Gun Girl, that was two years ago,
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.760]  who walked onto campus with an AR that's actually he wanted to shoot somebody confronted by protesters
[54:53.760 --> 54:59.280]  at Ohio University. And I read the article, they spin it like, Oh, they knew you were a danger.
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.800]  That's why they did this. Oh, you students, protesters hound, gun girl, Caitlin Bennett
[55:04.800 --> 55:08.960]  off campus. Oh, aren't they good? Kent State Gun Girl confronted by protesters at Ohio University,
[55:08.960 --> 55:14.880]  Fox News, Lessington Harold leader, gun girl vows returned Ohio University with army of gun owners
[55:14.880 --> 55:20.160]  after class. Let's be clear. That was true. It is. We're not planning. In fact, I'm going to join you
[55:20.160 --> 55:26.240]  there. We're not planning to be violent. Just like we went and marched, I'd say it's 50,000.
[55:26.240 --> 55:32.560]  The news said 24,000 or whatever. In Virginia, openly exercising our second amendment, nobody
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.880]  got hurt. One person got arrested. And now Virginia has not passed the gun law. Democrats
[55:38.880 --> 55:45.920]  voted against Northam and didn't pass the semi auto gun ban. That's just yesterday. Huge victory. So,
[55:45.920 --> 55:52.160]  yes, we should all I'm going to be on the east coast. Coming up next week, I'm going to CPAC,
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.880]  and I'm going to have other big events in DC. And I think we should just stay a day or two longer.
[55:56.880 --> 56:02.240]  And we should just go to Ohio. And we should call for a demonstration for the first amendment. I
[56:02.240 --> 56:08.560]  know you say bring guns there that are shoulder slung with the barrels aimed down and not loaded
[56:08.560 --> 56:14.240]  and all proper. That one can wait that rally that rally can wait because that takes planning that
[56:14.240 --> 56:21.200]  takes calls that takes that takes a lot more. So we want to agree. We should have the pro
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.920]  second amendment rally later. The open carry later. We should have a first amendment rally
[56:25.920 --> 56:33.920]  very soon. Yeah, I agree. Because I want to go there with you. Yeah, let's make it happen.
[56:33.920 --> 56:40.240]  And listen, listen, listen, as you know, this is un-American evil. This is a bunch of hyena like
[56:40.240 --> 56:47.360]  thugs and the media celebrating driving you off the campus, the supposed center of freedom and
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.400]  justice. So let's war game this. When do you think is a good time for us to come to Ohio?
[56:53.760 --> 57:01.440]  University with you. Let me text the producers. Let me let me regroup with my crew and see what
[57:01.440 --> 57:05.840]  I have going on. And then I will let you know. I don't want to give something right now. And
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.320]  then it be completely not able to understand you got a crew and all that stuff. That's great.
[57:10.320 --> 57:13.280]  And that's why I'm for us loves you. And that's why we finance you. What I'm saying is this is
[57:13.280 --> 57:19.520]  big and hot. This is central. A pack of thugs ran you off campus. We need Americans peacefully
[57:20.160 --> 57:26.240]  to show up and exercise our first amendment in a week. I mean, I guarantee I get 5000 people out
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.480]  there in a week like that. This is just like Virginia. They came for the second amendment
[57:30.480 --> 57:34.800]  in Virginia. America stood up and came together. They're coming after the first amendment now.
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.360]  This is just as important. And this will bring Trump to front and center to take the funding
[57:39.360 --> 57:43.840]  away from that university. If they don't have those police do their job and protect us to
[57:43.840 --> 57:51.360]  exercise our speech. We'll be back. The evidence is overwhelming. Coronavirus is a man made
[57:51.360 --> 57:58.160]  bio weapon designed to destroy nation states economies and free peoples and usher in a
[57:58.160 --> 58:03.280]  planetary government. This is how the globalists are striking back. Here's a fortune headline
[58:03.280 --> 58:10.960]  today. Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[58:10.960 --> 58:18.320]  And that's just in one nation. Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China
[58:18.320 --> 58:25.680]  that reporting it could cut their sales in half this year. That's how major this is.
[58:25.680 --> 58:33.360]  Everyone needs to be prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games. Info wars will continue to report
[58:33.360 --> 58:38.480]  the latest information as it comes out. Regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to
[58:38.480 --> 58:43.360]  punish us for telling the truth. We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word

[1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:08.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:18.320]  Well, the control corporate media loves big tech censoring everybody online.
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:24.320]  And now Caitlin Bennett just two years ago as a senior at Penn State did her open carry. No big
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:30.000]  deal as a woman. Well, the left hates her everywhere because they believe they own women.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:36.160]  And now yesterday she was at Ohio University and a mob of the 400 people surrounded her for just
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:42.000]  doing an interview, drove her off campus and USA Today, you name it, are celebrating this
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:47.760]  as the greatest thing dumping coffee on her, spitting on her, attacking her despite the fact
[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:54.400]  that this audience finances some basic security for. So I'm here telling her, drop what she's doing.
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:57.280]  We need to be there next Saturday or next Sunday. I'm already going to be in DC
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:04.320]  at CPAC. I'm willing to peel off early on Friday or Saturday, but we need to announce this the
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:09.840]  next couple days. So we get a week and a half and then have 1000 show up for a free speech rally.
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:14.640]  We've had our Virginia rally and the governor failed and getting the guns. We need our first
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:18.720]  amendment rally. Caitlin, you tweeted to the president who tweets your stuff, you go meet
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:23.040]  them with them at the White House. Trump has a executive order on the books that if they don't
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:27.200]  have free speech at campuses and this type of Nazi behavior goes on, he'll strip their funding.
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:31.120]  That university needs to know you're coming with the president watching and they better have the
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:35.920]  police do their job this time. So those students learn what America looks like. Damn it. They've
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:41.840]  planted their flag on us. They've pissed on you and pissed on me and pissed on America and all
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:46.960]  our veterans that fought and died and lived 50, 60 years with their arms and legs blown off
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:52.160]  with tube fish down their neck. I will not let these people piss on America anymore. What do you
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:58.320]  say, Caitlin? I say let's do it. Let's organize something. We'll get it figured out today and
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:03.200]  we'll plan a date and then we want people to come there for a first amendment rally. The second
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:08.240]  amendment rally will wait. That takes a long time to plan so don't come with any of your firearms then
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.360]  but we will bring flags. We'll bring Trump flags, free speech signs and we're going to show them.
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:18.640]  This is a public funded university. I pay for those students to go there. I'm paying so much
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:23.040]  in taxes. By the way, you're getting married. You're so cute. I'm lying. You're so, so pure and good.
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:27.840]  That's why that's why they hate you. You're a good Midwestern lady. Let's just say it. You're
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:32.480]  getting married. You're like, well, I can't do that next Sunday after that. Not because I'm
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:38.480]  on marriage counseling for marriage. I'm sure you guys are great. It's good. You can get marriage
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:42.880]  counseling later, okay? For your marriage. It's good to have pre-marriage counseling at your church.
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.840]  That's the right place to do it but you guys love each other. It's great. Or I'll cut CPAC early
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:52.160]  and come on Saturday but you need to tell me the next 24 hours because I'm ready to do this
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:56.640]  and the listeners are ready to do this. I mean, the Paul Revere's are waiting. The men and men are
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:02.640]  waiting. They're saddled up right now. They're ready to go and I just feel gut level. We've had
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:07.600]  our second amendment victory. Let's have our first amendment victory and it's at Ohio University.
[1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:12.960]  So you pick it. That Saturday or that Sunday, you just pick the time. You let me know by this
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:17.680]  afternoon because I want to announce this now, Caitlin. I will do that. It's going to probably
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:22.160]  be Saturday. I'll say it right now. Probably Saturday and I'll double check with my crew
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:27.600]  once I get off and I'll let you know literally within probably 10 minutes. So everybody's watching.
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:30.480]  Don't tune out. Keep watching because that will be announced.
[1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:35.600]  Beautiful. Okay. I'm ranting. We'll do one more segment with you and just you understand why
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:40.240]  this makes me mad. You look energized out there when they were attacking you and spitting on you
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:45.680]  and dumping coffee on you. And again, it's that spirit they hate. That's it. It's beautiful.
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:51.360]  Well, they want me to shut up. What's really good and when we get this full footage out
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:56.960]  over on our YouTube and Bandot video, when you watch the footage, they are chanting at me for
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:04:02.080]  an hour to leave. They said, leave, go home. We don't want you here. So then when I tried to leave,
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:07.120]  they were pushing the door shut on Joe Patrick's truck. They didn't want me to leave. They wanted
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:11.920]  to hurt me. They wanted to make it seem like they wanted me to leave campus, but they didn't.
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:17.120]  They wanted to keep me there so they could mob me. They were like a bunch of wild dogs chasing down
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:21.360]  a child in the street and eating them. You ever seen footage of pit bulls, a little kid gets out
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:25.200]  of the backyard, a little kid runs, the pit bulls all chew them up. That's what it was.
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:31.280]  Oh, it was absolutely that. And the best thing is that I just sat there and let them act. When
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:35.920]  this is happening to you, you just got to let them react. Don't respond back. Just film them,
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:39.920]  because that says more than me trying to make any point by arguing with them.
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:45.120]  All right. Caitlin Bennett, stay there. Let's recap it all. But I'm telling you,
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:50.160]  no more games. I told people 2020, Alex Jones is coming out of his reclusive hole.
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.400]  That's why I'm going to be everywhere. And I'm going there.
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:02.960]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements. Ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both
[1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:09.280]  back in stock after being sold out for months. Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins,
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:14.400]  minerals, amino acids, and other key co-factors that are so good for you and your family,
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:20.320]  especially your children's bodies and your immune systems. Ultra 12 is the highest quality
[1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:25.760]  vitamin B 12 taken sublingually under the tongue. It is back in stock. You can get them both
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:34.800]  individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off. This makes your
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:40.000]  life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:47.920]  tasty fruit punch. And of course, vitamin B 12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina,
[1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:53.680]  libido, just everything. And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when
[1:05:53.680 --> 1:06:11.360]  you get them together at m4store.com.
[1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:30.560]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide. It doesn't get any more real than info wars. It
[1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:35.360]  doesn't get any more grassroots. It doesn't get any more outlaw. When Satan runs the planet,
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:42.160]  I'm an outlaw. When Jesus does, I follow the law and it's on. Well, Caitlyn has talked about it
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:46.720]  with her fiance because they're going to a marriage retreat and stuff on Sunday,
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:50.480]  not this Sunday, the next Sunday. We're going to we're going to go to Ohio State University,
[1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:56.160]  not this Saturday, but next Saturday during CPAC, I'm going to cut it short.
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:00.320]  We got big CPAC stuff coming up. I'm going to be at CPAC. I told you folks I'm going to be in the
[1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:05.280]  field. I'm going to be everywhere. Our crews will be everywhere. Total commitment 2020 with 258
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:09.360]  days left. It's so critical. And everything we do is hitting the zeitgeist thanks to your support
[1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:14.800]  because you are the info war. And so I was just talking to her during the break. Next Saturday,
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:20.400]  we're going to say to make it easy for folks who've got to work Friday and we get that surrounding
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:25.840]  states to get there. We're going to say we're going to have a pro free speech rally from three
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:33.200]  to six PM at Ohio University. We're going to talk to university, give them a chance to
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:37.760]  have her in to apologize, have the police protector, let us just have our free speech
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:42.480]  rally for a couple hours. But if they won't, we're going to be there and we're going to have it
[1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:47.120]  outside and we're going to follow lawsuits and the president is going to take their funding
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:51.120]  as his executive order states he will. And again, Caitlin's been to the White House,
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:54.400]  she works for the White House. I'm going to leave it at that. The Trump is watching what's
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:58.880]  going on right now. And we don't want to see the university have its federal funding stripped.
[1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:03.280]  We just want them to stop being anti free speech command centers. Now if you're just joining us,
[1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:08.880]  there's coronavirus news and there's huge news with Trump. And what are we talking about?
[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:13.360]  Why are we saying some folks are tuning in every segment. They're like, what's he talking about?
[1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:19.360]  Caitlin Bennett, reporter, Ohio University. Caitlin, recap what happened to you yesterday.
[1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:27.600]  It's big national news. CNN saying, great, drive that evil woman off. MSNBC celebrating it.
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:35.520]  USA Today says, good, that woman was thrown off by the students. Just a lynch mob, a riot. 400
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.600]  plus people because you tried to go interview people on president's day. How un-American,
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:46.320]  how dangerous. Recap what happened for folks that just joined us. I went to Ohio University in Athens,
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:52.080]  Ohio to ask people, ask students trivia day questions, trivia questions about president's day,
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:56.480]  basic questions like who were the first three presidents, just to have fun. It's a fun video
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:02.080]  for president's day. Within 30 minutes, I had 400 people surrounding me, 400 leftists who were
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:08.400]  throwing things at me. They poured hot steaming coffee on my legs. They threw iced coffee at me,
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:14.160]  missed me, hit their friends. They were vandalizing cars in the parking lot, trying to break the window
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:21.440]  of the person whose truck I was in. They were mobbing me. They started a riot. Shame on the
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:26.800]  police for trying to say that that wasn't a riot. They started a riot because they don't like my
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:33.040]  opinions because Twitter told them not to. Basically, to recap, leftists acted like the animals that
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:41.040]  they are. And we got it all on footage to show you guys. And now it's a big national news story
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:44.720]  with them trying to imply you deserve. I'm reading these articles. These are insane.
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:50.640]  Well, if you type in my name on Twitter, I'm trending on Twitter in the whole country. And if
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:56.000]  you type in my name, you come across all of these tweets saying that the protesters didn't do enough.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.800]  Next time I show up, they need to do more. They need to go further. They didn't do enough to send
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:06.080]  their message home to me. Next time, to actually punch me, to hit me in the face and to pull my
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:10.880]  hair. That's what they want people to do to me next time. Throwing stuff on me and burning my
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:20.320]  legs wasn't enough. And of course, guys pull up, leftist dumps coffee on Alex Jones or coffee
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:28.640]  dump on Alex Jones. They do this to everybody. This is what they walk up to people, Fox News
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:32.480]  host and dump coffee on their heads. And then they sit there and deny they're doing it. They're
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:38.800]  the violent ones. They're the it's a it's an anti-trumper. Last week ran over six people
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:45.440]  in Florida, almost no coverage, ran them over with a vehicle admitted he did it to stop Trump.
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:52.720]  Can you imagine if a concern one supposedly racist guy ran into a woman in Charlottesville,
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:59.280]  she had a heart attack and died. It's a tragedy. That becomes Trump's fault. All conservatives fault.
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:06.000]  All veterans fault. All gun owners faults. But then he runs over six people on purpose and he's a
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.320]  good guy. Well, they also at at Ohio University, they were chanting Bernie. So they were Bernie
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:16.560]  supporters doing this. Are we going to blame Bernie for their actions? Are we going to blame
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:21.680]  Bernie for their behaviors? Of course not. And I would like to point out that almost a year ago,
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:27.280]  Bernie's campaign called me a white supremacist, and then his supporters go out there and attack me.
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:33.440]  Is Bernie responsible for lying about me and calling me a derogatory name that is totally
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:38.800]  untrue? They were sending their calling me a racist. Did they get that from Bernie's campaign? Is
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:43.680]  that why I was being attacked? These are questions that need answered. Is Bernie responsible for
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:50.720]  these actions today? I think that's a valid question. Well, even Chris Matthews says Bernie
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:55.680]  would probably kill his political opponents because he's a communist. That's what communists do. It's
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:02.960]  a default, like a duck quacks. You know, a fox gets in the henhouse, a wolf howls, a chicken,
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:08.960]  you know, goes back, back, back, back, a rooster crows. I mean, we all know a choo-choo train goes
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:15.120]  and I'm not trying to be cheesy here. How many Bernie operatives are on Project Veritas video
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:21.200]  saying their plan is to take control and start killing conservatives and putting them in FEMA
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.480]  camps? So that's my question for you, Caitlin Bennett. I asked Gavin McGinnis this like four
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:31.200]  years ago. I said, what's peak leftist arrangement syndrome? He said, there is no peak and he's
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:40.960]  right. It just goes up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and there's no end.
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:48.240]  So what happens to them as they fail, as Trump wins, as America comes back, as I mean, what are
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:55.920]  they breeding on universities? I have no clue. All I have to say is if you have to use violence to
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:00.960]  get your points across and make, enforce people to believe what you believe, your opinions probably
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.760]  aren't popular. They aren't right. They aren't moral. They aren't ethical. And these people know
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:11.040]  it. Their ideas are deranged. It doesn't make sense to sit there and tell a six-year-old that
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:16.560]  a little six-year-old boy that he's a girl and give him pills to change his gender. We're
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:22.800]  messing up little kids' bodies by them. It's just, it's insane. And it disgusts me because
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:27.760]  everything they want to do, it's about children. It's about children. They force this on our
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:31.760]  children. It's completely insane. I don't know where it goes. Because authoritarians know once an
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.680]  adult is awake, they won't go along with it. They are picking on our most innocent.
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:42.400]  I agree with what you said about there is no peak. I don't know what's going to happen.
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.440]  Trump wins again in November. It's just going to get worse. It's not going to get better.
[1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:53.120]  I thought I had received the most amount of hatred on a campus. This was shocking. I did
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.640]  not expect this to happen at all. And it just goes to show with people saying that that wasn't
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:05.040]  enough. What is enough to them? Do they want all conservatives dead? Do they want us all in camps?
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:09.360]  And I think the answer is yes. They won't be satisfied until we're all dead.
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:17.680]  Well, that's it. They're protected by big tech. They're allowed to bully and attack online,
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:22.400]  and no opposition is allowed. So when they see someone in the third dimension,
[1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:28.640]  in a physical area, challenging them by just existing, they're like,
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:35.520]  because they believe they're God because they've joined with the technocracy
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:39.600]  and the anti-human agenda. They're not going to have children like CNN says they shouldn't.
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:42.720]  They're not going to be part of the future. They're going to end up committing suicide.
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:48.160]  You look at them, they're pale. They're psychotic. They're deranged. Survey finds people who
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.720]  identify as left-wing, more than likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness.
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:58.800]  And they're authoritarians. They're little basement dwellers who dream of putting people
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:05.520]  in FEMA camps. They are the most immature, disconnected people the planet has ever seen,
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:09.600]  dreaming of power. And it's not going to go the way the establishment thinks.
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:16.160]  Caitlin, you need to come to the war room today, 3 to 6 p.m. How soon?
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:21.600]  Do you have hours of the raw footage? Just how soon? Because I know you want to explain what
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:25.280]  happened and all that, but you just got to get it out. How soon do all that's out at Bandai Video?
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:33.440]  Probably, I would say within the next 45 minutes. I know my my fiance is working on it right now
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:38.800]  in the other room. He's been editing since 9 a.m. this morning. And it's 1 p.m. here. So we are,
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:41.840]  we're working on it. We're trying to get everything right. We're trying to get all the
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:45.760]  information out there. So you got hours of it, multiple cameras. It's really hard to
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:51.120]  condense it down. Great job. Give us an update. Let's just say you're going to be on in the second
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:57.120]  hour of the war room today, okay? Okay, sounds good. Great job. Finally, there's a way for you
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:02.480]  to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation. No, enjoy a

[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:12.640]  on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:17.680]  digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.320]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets,
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:26.960]  not a security IPO or note. Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:33.200]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each

[1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:56.320]  not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document. I'm here with Scott

[1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:07.920]  with the IRS. My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:12.320]  garnishments sometimes in the same day. We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:16.720]  were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise. Can you give us an example
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:25.280]  of somebody you help? Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what?
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:29.680]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:35.200]  with the government. If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay

[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:02.080]  We know that the globalists are in trouble. Humanities waking up to their tyranny,
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:06.960]  how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.520]  But we know they're going to strike back. And the UN has said that they're going to
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.440]  absolutely implode third-world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:22.880]  hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:28.960]  clowered and pivot program. The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:35.600]  to world government inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a critical time
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:41.520]  to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:47.200]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck, so spread the word about band.video
[1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:54.160]  and infowars.com for its last show. That is so important. You are at the center of the resistance.
[1:18:54.160 --> 1:19:02.000]  You are our only hope. At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:08.400]  and world population control organizations. They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley,
[1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:14.800]  Aldous Huxley's brother, decided to repackage themselves as transhumanists. Now in the year
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:22.320]  2020, to set the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:28.320]  rights, you name it, they are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply
[1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:37.120]  misgender someone. So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:42.720]  what they are. This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control and there's several big articles
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:48.240]  up on infowars.com that break this down. UK teen fine under house arrest for asking
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:54.240]  trans police officers, gender, UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman, order to pay
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:20:20.240]  1,000 pound fine. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:31.920]  You know, the thing about telling the truth is, at a certain point you just got to start
[1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:39.760]  telling the truth about everything. And Kalin is so sweet and smart, I love her. But she's
[1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:45.840]  scared after what just happened in Ohio University. So I had her convinced during the breaks,
[1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:52.560]  she's getting married in like three weeks, I had her convinced to go back, not this Saturday,
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:58.720]  but next Saturday to Ohio University and confront that scum and exercise our first amendment. But
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:02.480]  then she's just like, I don't want to ask it in my face, they're death threatening me and I don't
[1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:08.640]  want to do it. So we're not doing it now. We're not going to Ohio University. That's fine because
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:15.200]  I'm already at the CPAC and doing battle there with the neocons and stuff in DC and I'm coming
[1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:23.360]  back here to my children and I get it. I'm not blaming her. In America, a five foot two or whatever
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:27.760]  woman is the vanguard of our resistance against the new world order.
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:34.880]  And she's done a great job. She marched in there on President's Day to ask questions,
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:40.080]  got attacked by a mob. Am I mad at her that now she's like, whoa, they're on Twitter saying they're
[1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:46.320]  going to throw acid in my face and kill me and I just want to get married. And I'm like, absolutely.
[1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:50.960]  You know what, sweetheart? You didn't weigh more than a woman's supposed to do. And that's not
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:55.920]  patronizing a woman like, oh, that's not a woman. Women have got to do what men do when men don't
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:22:04.880]  act like men. And that gets right down to why I'm pissed off. Man, I am so sick of a, yeah,
[1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:10.960]  I got to sit there. I've been pissed off since five AM this morning. I woke up at five AM this
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:15.440]  morning and I went out and I got a cup of coffee and I walked around the backyard and
[1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:22.320]  I'm sitting there and I go to info wars.com
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:32.560]  and I see the Caitlyn Bennett video of a mob of 400 people attacking her physically and chasing
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:38.480]  them into the parking lot. And as a father and as a man, I felt physically threatened for my family
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:41.760]  because letting that type of crap go on is what brings down whole civilizations.
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:48.480]  My instincts are honed. I may not follow them, but they're damn good. They're as good as they get.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.200]  I mean, my radar and spidey senses best model out there.
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:01.840]  And I see that type of stuff and it makes me want to go confront those people and let them know
[1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:04.880]  that they're pathetic and they're scum and they make me want to throw up,
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:12.000]  but fresh off something like that, barely making it to her vehicle, all the rest of it.
[1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:20.160]  She's like, I just can't go back out there right now, which is exactly what they want.
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:28.640]  But see the men of America are watching sports right now and they're too cool
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:36.480]  and they're too powerful to go out to those universities that have been completely taken
[1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:42.640]  over by globalists and communists and fugs and gangs and scum.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:47.200]  So maybe you pull your endowment from a university.
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:54.240]  I mean, Starbucks gives a portion of every purchase of coffee to brainwashing five-year-olds
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:59.280]  to cut their testicles off. It's called the mermaid group. I'm not kidding.
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:04.480]  And you know, I never hardly go to Starbucks, but if I'm really tired on the road and I go,
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:09.440]  Dan, that's some strong coffee. Let me just go ahead and pull in over there. Never again.
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:15.280]  It's one thing where I live is with the only county in Texas where they
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:20.160]  take taxpayer money from property tax and give it for abortion.
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:25.280]  And so I'm already trying to look at counties around us to try to move the facility.
[1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:26.880]  I don't have the money to move the facility.
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:39.440]  So yeah, I'm not like somebody that beats myself on the back,
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:43.280]  flagellates myself. Oh, I want to be good. But you know what? I don't want to live
[1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:48.400]  somewhere where my taxpayer money pays for chopping kids up. Just scares me. I could feel
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:56.000]  God's anger. And it's the same thing with all of this. We have to divorce ourselves from corporate
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:02.560]  systems. The whole globalist system, this whole system here to intimidate us and dominate us and
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:13.600]  tell us how to live and tell us how to breathe. I'm done with them. I said last week on air
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:21.920]  that most people in the government are good and that it's we the people that have allowed
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:26.800]  all this corruption and allow powerful corrupt individuals to get in control of the agencies
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:31.200]  and that that's where the real evil comes from. And I saw some comments on M4s. Oh,
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:38.240]  Jones just said 99% of the government's good. And he endorses what it's doing when that's
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:44.320]  not what I've done. But it's that type of lie that needs to be addressed. I want to take the government
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:52.320]  over. I want to restore the Republic. I don't want to be the underdog outlaw. The systems made me
[1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:59.120]  an outlaw because what I'm promoting will win. I'm promoting justice and freedom and free market
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:05.600]  and transparency and things that succeed at Americana. And I know from my own experience
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:14.800]  that most people in government actually who aren't in academia or leftist areas agree with that. So
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:20.160]  why should I make them an enemy when I can simply point out that I've over the years learned that
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:26.800]  they think just like we do? Because our fight is not with the government. Our fight is with the
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:36.560]  governance. Government is the government. Governance is who does the governing.
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:39.600]  I know for most listeners, you're like, yeah, you're stating the obvious. Well, a lot of people
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:44.560]  don't get that. They think what I'm up to is saying there's a lot of patriots in the Army and the
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:51.120]  Marines and the Navy and the Air Force. Oh, now you endorse whatever the Army and Air Force do
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:56.800]  when they're under command of the people that have hijacked our government. And then Trump is this
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:02.240]  breath of fresh air, this ray of sunshine, and they're all running around crazy scared because
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:12.960]  they're losing their control. So I'm not here to be the underdog. I'm not here to be locked up.
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:17.120]  I'm here to take the government over. And like George Washington, once I've done it,
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:23.280]  the minute I'm done, the minute I think there's good people in, I'm going to the ranch
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:31.520]  literally. I do not want to be engaged with these people. I do not want power. I do not want to be
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:35.920]  in the system because I'm already in God's system. I've already got all the power. I've already got
[1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:40.240]  all I've already got everything. I don't need power. I don't need private jets and big castles
[1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:46.240]  and things to prove I've got it all. I have it. I have the birthright. I have the fire. I have the
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:56.080]  Promethean power. And so do you. But I'm here to tell you, until we get these devil worshipers off
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:02.240]  our back and kick Satan off the planet, we're not going to get our birthright. So get behind Jesus,
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:10.800]  stop kissing globalist ass, take action and rid the planet of Satan and his minions. And everything
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:16.640]  is clear sailing after that. And it really comes down to that. It's that simple. And that's why
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:20.320]  the globalist hate us. That's why they hate you. It's why they hate Caitlin Bennett. It was just
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:25.760]  an average, good, clean woman because we got the birthright folks and they know it. You can be black,
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:29.360]  you can be white, you can be Hispanic, you can be old, you can be young. If you love God and
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:36.640]  justice and you resonate with truth, you are part of the future. But if you resonate with all this
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:41.520]  evil, this anti human systems in it, you get off on it, then you're of your father, the devil.
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:47.120]  So tie that bowling ball around your neck, that big ass chain and just jump into the fires of hell.
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.720]  Just choose which side you're on. That's all I'm saying.

[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:52.880]  the best stuff. There's a lot of patriots. There's not just bad guys coming after us with the flip

[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:39.040]  There's a lot of big news breaking right now. And we're just seeing how evil the left is
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:46.480]  and it makes my head spin. They've gotten away with so much. You know I set out,
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:53.040]  opened the phones up and I haven't done that. We have Dr. Sherry Tenpenny joining us as well.
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:59.920]  She's been a big vaccine reporter. She's not even against vaccines. She's just been against the
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:06.480]  mass of damages. She's seen come from them and the cover-ups of those damages. She's going to be
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:12.000]  joining us in the next hour. But right now, I'd like to go right to your phone calls.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  First-time callers, long-time callers, callers of the degree, callers of the disagree.
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:24.080]  What do you make of the left celebrating pro-Trump Ryan Newsom's horrific crash hoping he dies?
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:29.840]  What do you make of Virginia Dems abandoned blackface Ralph Northam joined Republicans to stop gun
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:36.240]  control and shoot down the bill that would have confiscated all semi-autos? What do you make of
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:43.040]  all the huge coronavirus developments? Ten plagues that are hitting our planet simultaneously.
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.600]  I'll hit that start of the next segment. Michael Bloomberg and all the clips I haven't even gotten
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:35:00.080]  to. Bash's farmers says they're stupid blue-collar workers as primitive idiots in unearthed video.
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:04.960]  Do you have any idea how hard farming is?
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:12.480]  But again, this is just a robot who was just given the technocracy by the establishment
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:19.360]  because he's a soulless ghoul. Bloomberg supports death panels to decrease healthcare costs.
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:27.360]  Says kill all ladies just like Bill Gates. Another soulless creature. New witness corroborates
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:32.400]  accusation that Mike Bloomberg would tell pregnant employees just quote kill it. He says we'll make
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:41.120]  more money if you just kill your baby. What a freak. Bloomberg says young black Latino men
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:48.320]  don't know how to behave in the workplace. Truth is that yes, a high percentage of the crime is blacks
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:53.440]  and Hispanics, but it's mainly men killing each other in a form of old western bravada.
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:02.400]  But it's not the majority or even a large minority doing it. He just says blacks and
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:06.960]  Latino men are bad period. That's what they said Trump said. He never said that. There's a lot of
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:10.400]  great people coming over. We just got to check people. There's a lot of criminals and bad people
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:15.440]  coming across too. Yeah, anybody knows that. Let's see. Bloomberg saying what they actually
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:22.000]  said Trump said but never said. But he's the front runner along with the judge of the booty
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:30.160]  because oh, did you see booty? Kissed that other nerd. Two nerdly dudes, two corporate guys. Look,
[1:36:30.160 --> 1:36:38.880]  we kiss. Oh my gosh, guys kissed. You need to run everything right now, booty judge. I mean I
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:41.600]  judge my booty, booty judge. I
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:48.880]  only are present as you kiss another dude. Just the way it works. Meanwhile,
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:57.120]  Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy amid sex abuse lawsuits. Boy Scouts of America said today it
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:02.960]  had filed chapter 11 bankruptcy following a slew of child sexual abuse lawsuits. Let's see now.
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:10.720]  Now, there'll be proper law firms that will take over and settle if they just let certain LGBT
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:17.200]  prepito manage them. That's how the same groups took over the Catholic Church.
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:25.760]  They were the groups five years ago seeing inhale the Boy Scouts of America handing out condoms
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:30.400]  to seven year olds and saying have fun in your tent.
[1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:38.480]  Wow. How about it's like handing out vibrators and lubrication to seven year old girls.
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.800]  This is what, well, they're boys. We're going to chop their balls off. They're transgender.
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:49.200]  They can take it. Get in there and be tough, son. You're going to get your
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:59.280]  anal scout badge from your 20 year old Boy Scout instructor. I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:04.960]  That's what we do in America now. We chop our son's genitals off. We give them condoms and say
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:11.120]  get in that tent and learn how to give a blow job right now or you're not liberal.
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:13.120]  And the parents about them, they go, well, we better.
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:19.280]  We better capitulate and you drive through churches all over Austin. First Methodist,
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:25.920]  you name it, big giant rainbow flags flying captured. But it doesn't mean they're captured for,
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:30.400]  you know, same sex folks to go there. It means we're going to teach your five year old
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:41.760]  how to suck a mean ding dong. Because that's what the churches are now is pervert command basis.
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:45.840]  Pedophilia centers. You want to go find pedophilia? Go to a church.
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:49.440]  You want to find devil worship? Go to a church.
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:54.480]  You want to get your son molested? Go to the Boy Scouts.
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:57.920]  That doesn't mean there aren't good scout groups all over the country. It was a good group.
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:03.200]  The left came in and said, we're going to take this over and out the condoms,
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:10.480]  sit in our operatives. And then at first, people go, my gosh, this, you just gave a seven year
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:17.360]  old, eight year old, hepatitis will give them condoms. Okay, just don't tell anybody condoms,
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:29.520]  boys. And then once they've got you compromised, the whole operation belongs to them.
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:39.360]  Mission completed. Another organization captured by Cobra by the snake.
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:49.040]  And in the future, if you don't sterilize your sons and daughters, you won't get your digital
[1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:57.680]  credits. But if you do, oh, the credits are your liberal. Brian Stelter will praise you.
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:03.280]  And don't we all want that? Isn't that the fulfillment, the universe like
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:14.240]  Brian Stelter, praise me, I have become someone. They want to make you worship a stunted, ugly,
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:23.200]  demonic demon. They want you to bow to him and learn to serve him well, like Avinati and all
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:29.520]  the rest of them. All right, we're going to come back, toll free number to join us, 877-789, Alex.
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:40.480]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 international line, country code 512-646-1776.
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:44.960]  Who knew that such numbers could be so politically incorrect?
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:50.880]  Separately, it is your funding of this operation makes it all possible,
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:56.720]  plus humanity sitting on top of giant time bomb. We're hoping to fix things peacefully and hoping
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:00.240]  the globalists don't crash the global economy and hoping they don't assassinate Trump and
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:06.080]  hoping they don't trigger giant race wars. But they've got a 30, 40% chance of getting it done,
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:10.080]  in my view, and then we're going to have to go to the mattresses, as they say in the Godfather.
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:17.360]  So people need to get storyable food at m4works.com. We have a great company with high quality food
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:22.160]  that's got food. They're 10 to 14 days behind just packaging it. You order your food, it's locked in,
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:28.320]  you get it. Everybody else has been sold out that I know of for a long time, because institutional
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:32.720]  groups are buying it all up with this coronavirus. Get your storyable food at m4works.com. Get the
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:38.400]  cleanest, the highest quality, the great price, the fastest at m4works.com. And vitamin mineral
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:44.160]  fusion with the amino acids and everything else, that is back in at 40% off. So is Ultra 12, our
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:48.880]  great vitamin B12 that's so high quality. 50% off and you get them both together as a combo.
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:54.000]  And yes, we will just like we sold out of the 16 ounce of the
[1:41:55.200 --> 1:42:00.480]  high quality nano silver immune gargle that's so good. We are very close to selling out of
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:04.960]  the three ounce and the one ounce. We'll sell the one ounce in the next day or two. We will sell
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:09.840]  out of the three ounce probably in a week or so, maybe less. And I've got more orders in, but it'll
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:13.680]  be a month or two until they get in. But it's just good for your gums, good for your teeth,
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:20.560]  knocks out viruses, knocks out bacteria in a healthy, good way. And it funds the M4 War, a 360 win. So
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:27.760]  we're going to take some phone calls when we come back. Then I've got a lot of prepared
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:35.200]  information. A lot of research has gone into Dr. Sherry Tenpenny joining us on huge coronavirus
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:40.480]  developments and the UN admitting that vaccines are indeed causing a lot of problems and that
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:44.640]  there is indeed a cover up. I want to get her on for a month since that broke. Now she's available
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:50.480]  and all these worlds collide right now live. Please don't forget. You are critical. You are
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:54.400]  in charge. You are the masters of your destiny. Spread the links to the live show now.
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:00.800]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food. But I know for a fact from
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:05.680]  sources to telling people, oh, we've got it. Get your order in two weeks for delivery. We follow
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:10.000]  this pattern over and over again. I've been on ready for 25 years. I've had storeable food for a
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:14.800]  long time and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:18.800]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory. They'll still
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:23.520]  take your orders. That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot supply now the biggest, most
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:27.760]  trusted company out there and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it
[1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:31.040]  on hand. They actually give it delivered to you on time. They do what they're going to say they're
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:34.720]  going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people. Now
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:38.480]  they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food but they got a package
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:44.720]  at record level orders. Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus. So
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:48.640]  get your orders at an infowarstore.com. Get the best deals, get it delivered first,
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:52.720]  they're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well. So get prepared
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:44:00.640]  infowarstore.com with storeable foods. Across the western world, from high school to college sports,
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:07.760]  to even the Olympics, men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:14.080]  This is men invading women's faces and bullying them and taking their rights away,
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:19.360]  all in the name of the liberalism and openness. And then every day, I have stacks of news articles
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:26.000]  just like today. UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:32.240]  hurt their feelings. UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:40.240]  1,000 pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty. That's the thought
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:46.000]  police. If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.760]  This is tyranny. These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:58.640]  anti-human takeover. Resist it, speak out against it. There can no longer be any doubt.
[1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:05.600]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels. It's very communicable. It spreads very, very fast.
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:10.560]  It is killing a lot of people and the Chinese communist government has covered up just how
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:16.160]  bad it is and the White House is now openly challenging them. So are Trump's top scientists
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:24.240]  and so is Senator Cotton. My friends, now is the time to get prepared. 2020 is not a year to play
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:29.840]  games with. The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots. We don't know how
[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:35.440]  bad this virus is going to get here. That's why listeners to Info Wars need to be prepared.
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:42.240]  And infowarstore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier. We have
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:47.040]  the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak. We have high quality, storable foods
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:53.040]  ready to ship and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock along with Ultra 12. At Info War
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:46:01.520]  Store dot com. I have confirmed with high level sources that President Trump is intending to
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:07.360]  either pardon Roger Stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying the conviction stands,
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:13.760]  but you now basically don't go to jail. Either way, this is incredibly good news. But let's not
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:18.960]  forget Julian Assange. That's one of the biggest black marks on Trump is that he famously said,
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:23.440]  I don't know who got the emails. I don't know where they came from. The Russians, a fat dude in
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:28.080]  his mom's basement, whoever's got them, release them. It's about Hillary committing a crime,
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:32.960]  not who has the emails. Don't change the subject. Well, Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:38.080]  the top. The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state. The man is a hero. Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:42.880]  Well, Assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and court hearings
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:48.640]  can barely talk. President Trump do the right thing and asked the British to release Julian Assange
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:54.800]  and give him a medal. President Trump, you must release Julian Assange. Free Julian Assange.
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:47:14.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:51.280]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:56.160]  And I am your host, Alex Jones. I really appreciate you joining us. We're taking
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:48:04.160]  your calls. Ryan and Brayden and Sandy and Steve and Johnny and others on the crazy,
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:14.160]  out of control, wild, wild world of the New World War. It is such a crazy time to be alive.
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:26.000]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls right now. But let's just remember that
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:31.280]  doctors raised alarm over Britain's treatment of ailing Julian Assange,
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:35.760]  even though of the European country that tried to set him up with the CIA for,
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:40.560]  no, for a condom bursting with two women that admitted they had sex with him,
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:49.040]  one of them a Middle East CIA. Now, eight years later, whatever solitary confinement,
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:54.960]  they point out he's dying in jail. More than a hundred medical professionals have accused
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:58.880]  Britain of denying proper health care to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:02.080]  But where is President Trump?
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:11.520]  He told Assange, he said, I don't care who has the WikiLeaks. I don't care who has the emails.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:16.560]  It's a fat guy in his mother's basement. The Russians or WikiLeaks release it.
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:22.320]  That makes you an accomplice, Trump. And I'm not the business I hate and Trump,
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:26.800]  everybody knows it. And I love Trump on so many fronts. But
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:32.720]  he's talking about Assange right now. Hell, let's see what he's had to say. I don't even know
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:37.120]  this is just now happening. Let's hear it. This year's ago. I seem like a very nice person.
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:42.400]  Don't know. But he served eight years in jail. There's a long time to go.
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  Many people disagree with talking about the Democrat. He's not the Democrat
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  operative out of Chicago. Okay, I was that was wishful thinking. I saw that popped up on air
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:50:00.240]  because it's like Assange has been basically in solitary confinement eight years. So I was
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:06.400]  thinking, oh, that's that's that. But no, it's it's one of Obama's minions out of Chicago. We're
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:11.200]  talking about the Trump's talking about pardoning. Well, maybe he's going to pardon stone at the
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:15.520]  same time because the judge says she's going ahead with the pardoning of Roger Stone
[1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:22.160]  on the 20th. That's on Thursday.
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:29.600]  We're gonna have a reporters there covering it live. Oh, and Troyer and Savannah Hernandez
[1:50:30.160 --> 1:50:34.400]  from DC. That's only because you support us and keep us in the field.
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:42.080]  I'm having one of those elderly moments at 45 because five years ago, I don't know his name.
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:47.600]  Who's the guy Trump's talking about? I know who he is. The Chicago Legislature guy that got caught
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:53.120]  in the corruption and didn't really do anything with the same as Yale. Blagojevich. That's right.
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:57.600]  I just can't remember his name. No, all about it. No, everything like that. That's not that's not
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:51:05.840]  Julian Assange. That's Blagojevich who I agree didn't do anything wrong except he knew dirt about
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:14.960]  Obama and Axelrod and Roman manual. And now Trump's talking about pardoning him because he didn't do
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:20.480]  anything wrong. I mean, say that again. Just when you talk to me, just
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.360]  Trump is commuting his sentence. All right, print me an article on that. That'd be great.
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:29.200]  We're a news organization. I'd really appreciate it because all I know is they're throwing TV
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.400]  feeds up and I'm just trying to like live on radio. Guess what the hell they are. I'm talking about
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:40.240]  Julian Assange eight years. Boom. I see eight years Trump. I'm like, oh my God, he's he's helping
[1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:45.920]  Assange and it's not it's Blagojevich. And then I've got people always accuse me that I've got
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:49.840]  things feeding through my head. Folks, let me tell you something. I love the crew, but we ought to
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:54.480]  have like a month long seminar here with the microphones they've got. Man, they're nice
[1:51:54.480 --> 1:52:05.280]  microphones. You can't understand a word. When they tell me something, it sounds like wow, that
[1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:09.920]  really sounds wonderful. I'm supposedly getting these directives from Putin and people, but all
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:16.720]  I'm getting is but the committee says you can serve sir. Oh, really great. I'll just leave a
[1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:22.240]  show immediately because I don't know why I paid for all these fancy microphones. I'm not that I'm
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:28.880]  the best talking into one, but you can hear what I'm saying over this microphone. I can't understand
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:36.880]  a word of it most of the time. And it tortures me day after day, the torture. It's karma. He'll
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:43.120]  never stop. Never going to stop. Never going to end. Their argument will be, oh, your microphone's
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:56.960]  turned up too high or your earpiece is turned up too high. I may have to just leave. Not
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.920]  being dramatic. I'm just going to have to go probably. I have outlived my usefulness around here.
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:15.360]  Yeah, I think I'm going to go. I think that's probably the best thing here.
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:20.080]  That'll satisfy everybody. Anyways, they can just go to rebroadcast and have fun.
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:28.480]  Sandy in Minnesota. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:32.160]  Hi, Alex. And don't you dare go anywhere.
[1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:36.640]  I probably am permanently soon. I'm not. I'm not lying. I think I'm going to quit soon. I think
[1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:41.040]  I'm done with the show, actually. No, this one is when he's done. I'm gone. I can't do this anymore.
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:44.880]  I can't be around this anymore. Go ahead. Don't talk about me, ma'am. Just go ahead and say what
[1:53:44.880 --> 1:53:51.840]  you're going to say. All right. All right. You know, I've sat here and I've watched all the video
[1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:59.840]  clips and things of how these kids on buses are being beaten and Caitlin, what she went through.
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:03.680]  And the more I sit there and I watch at the matter, I get at Trump, you know,
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:09.680]  I support him. I do. I voted for him. The alternative is worse than this.
[1:54:09.680 --> 1:54:16.080]  But the thing is, he has to do something. Somebody has to do something about this
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:23.440]  because this is enough. Our right to free speech, he was sworn in that office to defend that
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:32.000]  Constitution. And my heart broke for Caitlin. And I will tell you, like I said, the man,
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:41.040]  okay, he came on your platform and people saw him and he got his message out using his platform.
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:49.600]  And what happened to you? He platformed everywhere. Can't even say your name. Can't even speak your
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:57.120]  name. Look at Laura Loomer. Look at Milo and Unopolis and the hundreds of others that all
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:03.840]  they want to do is say their side of it. And that's the freedom we have that men fought and died for.
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:11.840]  And Trump does nothing. It's crickets. Kids having things splash in their face. Hot coffee
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:21.440]  burning. And they are entitled and they get their free speech. But not us. He has a sworn duty to
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:27.920]  protect our free speech and our gun rights and everything else under that Constitution. And I
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:34.320]  frankly have had enough of it. Like I said, his argument is if he makes a big deal about it,
[1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:39.440]  they'll attack his supporters more. I don't think that's true. He needs to make those universities
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:44.160]  and these institutions not sit by and enable the attacks on innocent people.
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:51.440]  Okay, but what about the general free speech that we're not getting? You go to Facebook. You
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.160]  mentioned your name. You mentioned Laura Loomer's name. You mentioned hundreds of others and you're
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:02.960]  kicked off. Where is that free speech? Well, here's an example. Trump says he's
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:09.280]  to me to the Senate's of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevic. George Soros
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:14.160]  removes Zuckerberg from Facebook. Now he'll get Trump reelected. So that's the pressure
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:20.080]  that Zuckerberg is under even allowing Republican ads. And that's the only holdout allowing any ads.
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:24.720]  So that's just the craziness. Sorry, I was throwing a fit earlier. It's not the crew. It's not anybody.
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:31.360]  It's it's it's watching Caitlyn Bennett. He'll be railroaded. It's just it's just it's watching
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:37.040]  hordes of leftist run around acting like something out of a science fiction dystopia.
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:41.520]  And then nothing happens to him. It just makes you fundamentally mad. But we've got to know
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:48.080]  we're winning overall. And we've just got to understand that. We'll say one final thing.
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:52.480]  And thank you for taking my call. Oh, I appreciate you. We need to we need to
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:59.280]  rally together peacefully. There needs to be, you know, if I could do it, I would be
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:07.200]  be right out of here standing there at that college and all the crooks in Virginia saw all
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:11.440]  those people demonstrate and backed off confiscating the guns. That's what it's about when the
[1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:17.760]  people say no, the system listens. Those police officers need to be held accountable as well.
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:24.160]  It's their job job to serve and protect. Sorry. You're right. I really appreciate you, Sandy.
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:30.960]  And I'm sorry I was running last segment. It's just that this shows real. I'm not up here.
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:34.720]  Nobody's telling me what to say. And I'm pissed off. I know you're pissed off too. But
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:41.040]  it's a complex situation. We'll be back. Take a few more of your phone calls than Dr. Sherry
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:51.040]  Tenpenny joins us on some big developments. This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:57.600]  giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward things that I discovered that I absolutely
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:03.120]  know work that if you will listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:10.800]  it is. And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us. And it's
[1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:16.720]  symbiotic. My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen,
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:21.600]  fluoride's the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen. And I'm
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:29.280]  so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine,
[1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:36.400]  atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com. And I'm telling
[1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:42.960]  you folks, get it. It's amazing. Discover the benefits and it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:49.280]  You can't lose unless you don't take action. I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love
[1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:53.520]  tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love all the other shows we do here. But I'll be honest with you.
[1:58:54.240 --> 1:59:00.400]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think
[1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:05.040]  you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely
[1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:09.040]  paying the bills here. And I want to expand the face of the globalists not contract. I don't want
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:14.720]  them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We sell enough product, we'll have less
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:19.360]  ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their money. But we've
[1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:24.640]  got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2. These will change your life. Go
[1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:28.400]  check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check it all
[1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:32.560]  out. Whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the Second American Revolution. Be part
[1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:37.120]  of crushing the globalist and get great products at the same time. infowarstore.com is the umbrella
[1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:43.040]  site. enforcelife.com is the supplements. Take action now and fund the info war for your own future.
[1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:53.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.040 --> 2:00:12.480]  All right. I got blindsided 10 minutes ago by the former Illinois governor,
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:20.480]  Blagojevich, having a sentence commuted by the president. And now I've had time to think about
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:25.040]  it and I'll tell you what, I think it was started the next segment. Right now we're going to your
[2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:29.200]  phone calls. Thank you for holding. Who has been holding the longest here?
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:35.040]  I guess that would be Rich in Alabama. Rich, thanks for calling.
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:44.160]  Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it. Hey, I wanted to say first thing, I love the turbo force. I drive
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:51.840]  truck for a living and it's amazing. Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end,
[2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:57.280]  but that turbo force is amazing. Describe because I want you to get into your politics,
[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:00.800]  but since you mentioned turbo force, how is turbo force different than coffee?
[2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:08.960]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from eight to ten hours. I don't kill the jitters
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:16.320]  like I do drink and coffee. And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:26.080]  to go to bed. I'll, you know, knock out. Boom, I'm out cold. Well, that's what we went out to a top
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.920]  developer who didn't want his name on it because we're under such attack. And I said, what would
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:37.040]  the ultimate long, say 10 hour energy be? Is that possible? That's good and clean and strong and has
[2:01:37.040 --> 2:01:41.280]  a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time released
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:46.880]  because I'd already been doing research and he took over a year to come up with this and there's
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:53.680]  more money in it than anybody else puts in their product. So that's why turbo force has such a great
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:58.880]  effect. And so I really appreciate you. And I'm glad that you like turbo force. What is your view
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:07.600]  on Rich on the Caitlyn then? I know that's what you called it about. Yeah. You know, should go because
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:16.320]  when I watched and heard all of, all of what was going on, it made me upset. I can find and book
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:25.040]  my own loads. So I can go wherever I need to go. And when she mentioned that, I was automatically
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:31.680]  thinking, okay, what can I do to get over there to be there for that rally and support her?
[2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:38.400]  Whether I got on my truck and trailer, drive the truck over to the freaking campus,
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:46.240]  you know, to help support her. Well, that's it. I mean, I've got a family and I'm already going
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:51.840]  to be out of town some next week to go to CPAC. And I'm not mad at Caitlyn. It just that was all
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:56.400]  real on air. She was okay. We'll have the rally. Well, I don't want to right now. I'm not mad at
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:00.640]  her. I just told the story on air so people get how real it is. Just like you've got things to do.
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:04.880]  You've got to lose money. You've got to be committed. You're ready to go fight. And then
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:10.080]  it's a female reporter leading the fight, which is great. But where are the men?
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:17.040]  That's all I'm saying is that this is a great opportunity to expose the attack on free speech.
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:22.080]  I don't blame her. She went and did the initial contact to show how out of control they are. It's
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:26.000]  just very frustrating that stuff like this is allowed to go on in this country because this is
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:32.160]  un-American. It's abhorrent and that authoritarian university and those police are protecting that.
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:37.840]  They're in the news giving quotes saying he's wrong and defending what happened. That's disgusting.
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:44.640]  You know, and here's another thing is I'll guarantee you probably have, I don't know,
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:49.840]  I don't know how many thousands of drivers out here listen to you, but I got all your,
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:55.120]  you know, shirts and everything and I'll run into, you know, info lawyers out here on the road.
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:04:00.960]  Hey, love Alex, show a thumbs up. You know, I'll have the phone in my shirt pocket or
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:06.960]  I got a prop up on my shoulder with your program going, oh, you're listening to Jones. I'm like,
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:12.240]  that's, you know, that's my hero right there, man. So brother, you're my hero. We're in this
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:16.400]  together. I just want to win this, but it's your word of mouth that kept us on air. We were supposed
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:22.720]  to be shut down a long time ago and it's one of my few pleasures is knowing that our existence
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:28.240]  pisses these scumbags off that just think they have a right to rule us and that we're done. No,
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:33.200]  we're not done. The globalists are done and Caitlin did a great job and I'm not criticizing or not
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:38.800]  wanting to go back into that rat's nest. It just absolutely pisses me off. Thank you so much, Rich.
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:45.520]  We love you in Alabama. All right, Ryan, Brendan, Rebecca, Steve, Johnny, Adam, your calls are
[2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:51.120]  coming up with Dr. Sherry Tedpinning on the other side. Whatever you do, spread that link.
[2:04:54.720 --> 2:05:01.520]  At the end of World War Two, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population
[2:05:01.520 --> 2:05:07.760]  control organizations. They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother,
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:15.920]  decided to repackage themselves as transhumanists. Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent that
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:23.200]  people can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given rights, you name it, they are intimidating
[2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:30.560]  and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone. So the ultimate crime will be
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:38.560]  even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what they are. This is the ultimate Kafka-esque
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:44.640]  mind control and there's several big articles up on infowars.com that break this down. UK teen
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:50.400]  fine under house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother, spare jail for
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:06:02.080]  misgendering trans woman, order to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:17.760]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:28.080]  You had some things to hide. You should have hidden it, shouldn't you? Now you're not satisfied
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:36.400]  with what you've been good at. I believe in humanity. And I believe that if I get up here
[2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:41.440]  on air and expose evil, you're going to respond, we're going to stop it. But I got to tell you,
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:48.240]  it's gotten insane. It was about a month ago that this news broke. And I wanted to get Dr.
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:54.560]  Sherrie Tenpenny of Vaxer.com and courses from Astry.com on the show. But she's a busy and
[2:06:54.560 --> 2:07:02.400]  full-time practicing medical doctor. But we've got her now. And this was, again, January 12th.
[2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:12.640]  Top U.N. scientist admits vaccines killing people during vaccine safety summit. Now, I've played
[2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:20.720]  dozens of these clips here over and over again. And the full two-day hearings are linked up
[2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:26.720]  at Bandai Video and NewsWars.com. But as soon as I saw this, I thought, man, we got to get Dr.
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:32.880]  Sherrie Tenpenny on. Because she's just a medical doctor that's seen the response of her patients
[2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:37.360]  with vaccines. And again, it's not like she's saying vaccines aren't a real technology where you
[2:07:37.360 --> 2:07:42.320]  can learn an immunity by getting a little bit of something bad in you. It's that why do they have
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:47.920]  liability protection? Why are we told we've got to take endless amounts of them no matter what
[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:56.400]  happens? Why is it secret? So I wanted to get her on to talk about this and then now how it
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:01.920]  ties in to forced inoculation when they finally get a vaccine with the coronavirus. And they say
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:06.160]  it's a new flu that's going to be mutating forever. Well, then how do they ever create a vaccine that
[2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:12.320]  actually matches that? There's so many angles with Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny. And I'm not going to go over
[2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:21.280]  her old bio here, but she's a very, very interesting person. Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny is a medical doctor,
[2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:26.720]  board certified, three specialty. She is the founder of Tenpenny Interactive Media Center,
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:32.320]  Interactive Medical Clinic located Cleveland, Ohio, open in 96. Her company provides a natural
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:36.800]  holistic approach to getting well and off prescription medications. The medical clinic's
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:43.840]  primary focus is thyroid conditions, breast health, and resolving problems associated with allergies
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:49.120]  and pain. Her approaches have attracted patients from all 50 states to 17 countries. She has invested
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:54.000]  for the 17 years over 20,000 hours in documenting the problems associated with vaccines.
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:59.760]  And a internationally known speaker and author for many articles have been
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:03.840]  translated into more than 12 languages or books, saying no to vaccines or resource guide
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:09.360]  to all ages. Vaxxer with 2xs.com. We're going to go to her in a few minutes, but here's just a
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:15.200]  four minute report I've got that has the chief scientist of the World Health Organization admits
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:21.200]  that some vaccines are killing people. Then the World Health Organization headquarters says that
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:26.640]  vaccines require adjuvants as creating not just short-term, but long-term effects. Dr. Martin
[2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:32.320]  Howell Freedy, another member of the panel suggests that adjuvants multiply adverse reactions. Dr.
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:39.680]  Martin Gruber of the FDA admits that pre-clinical trials may not be enough. It just goes on.
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:43.600]  Nigeria representatives suggest that there might be cross reactions between the different
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:48.640]  adjuvants and preservatives. Professor Heidi Larson, PhD admits that frontline
[2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:52.960]  medical professionals are questioning the safety of vaccines. And then in medical schools,
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:57.440]  one is lucky if they get half a day on the education of vaccines. So everything Tim
[2:09:57.440 --> 2:10:05.040]  Benny's been saying for 20-something years, now the UN at an official summit back in December
[2:10:05.040 --> 2:10:10.080]  says this, no coverage till our listeners pointed out that it's on the UN website. So here's that
[2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:14.160]  four minutes. We'll go right to Dr. Sherry Tim Benny, but I want to put this on up front. Here it is.
[2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:20.720]  We really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries, and this adds to
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:26.160]  the miscommunication and the misapprehensions, because we're not able to give clear-cut answers
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:30.640]  when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine. And this
[2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:36.880]  always gets blown up in the media. One should be able to give a very factual account of what
[2:10:36.880 --> 2:10:40.800]  exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are. But in most cases, there's some
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:47.920]  obfuscation at that level, and therefore there's less and less trust. The first accusation is
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:52.960]  it is the adjuvant. And yet without adjuvants, we are not going to have the next generation of
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:57.920]  vaccines. And many of the vaccines that we do have, ranging from tetanus through to HPV,
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:04.160]  require adjuvants in order for them to work. When we add an adjuvant, it's because it is essential.
[2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:10.560]  We do not add adjuvants to vaccines because we want to do so. But when we add them, it
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:17.600]  adds to the complexity. And I give courses every year on how do you develop vaccines,
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:23.360]  how do you make vaccines. And the first lesson is while you're making your vaccine, if you can
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:31.520]  avoid using an adjuvant, please do so. It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:41.680]  of the antigens that they are added to. And that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:51.200]  the reactogenicity in many instances. And therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:59.040]  multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen, but may not have
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:05.120]  been detected through lack of statistical power in the original study. The major health concern
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:12.480]  which we are seeing are accusations of long-term effects. It's also the subject population that
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:18.320]  you administer the adjuvant to, because we've seen data presented to us where
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:26.240]  an adjuvant, a particular adjuvant, added to a vaccine and it did really nothing when administered
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:34.080]  to a certain population and it's usually the elderly compared to administering the same formulation
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:40.800]  to younger age strata. So these are things which need to be considered as well and further
[2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:46.640]  complicate safety and effectiveness evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens.
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:53.280]  I cast back my mind to our situation in Nigeria where at six weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks,
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:13:00.160]  a child is being given different antigens from different companies. And these vaccines have
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:06.560]  different adjuvants, different preservatives and so on. Something crosses my mind. Is there
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:12.160]  possibility of these adjuvants, preservatives, cross-reacting amongst themselves? Have they
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:19.360]  ever been a study on the possibility of cross reactions from the panel members that you can
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:26.560]  share the experience with us? We have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:33.440]  starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines. When the frontline professionals are
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:40.160]  starting to question or they don't feel like they have enough confidence about the safety
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:47.200]  to stand up to it, to the person asking them the questions. I mean, most medical school
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:52.080]  curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean, in medical school, you're lucky if you have a
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:57.440]  half day on vaccines. Never mind keeping up to date with all this.
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:04.160]  And that allows big pharma to come in and do whatever they want because the doctors don't
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:07.920]  know anything, but they know people are being hurt. Their front lines are wobbly. They don't
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:11.520]  believe in it. Dr. Sherry Timothy, we're going to break in a minute and a half. Thank you for
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:15.760]  joining us. But wow, how big was this UN summit a few months ago for you?
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:23.440]  It was extraordinary, Alex. It was just extraordinary. When they say a wobbly frontline
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:28.800]  and they say maybe we should start doing studies and we don't really know how aluminum works,
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:33.840]  even though they've used aluminum in vaccines since the 1920s. And there's never been any
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:39.760]  synergistic toxicity studies that have ever been done. And the only thing that they're actually,
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:45.920]  when he said we need an adjuvant for it to work, their definition of working is the development
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:51.040]  of an antibody, which I know you and I have both spoken about for years, that the presence of an
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:56.640]  antibody is nothing more than a marker of contamination because you can have very high
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:01.440]  antibody levels and still contract the infection that they're trying to prevent.
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:05.760]  That is so key. You can have the antibody. That doesn't mean you beat it. You might have a chronic
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:12.800]  infection. That's exactly right. And I think that we have really brought that to the forefront in
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:19.120]  this last year, that if you have a high antibody level, that all it really means is that they
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:25.200]  marker of contamination. Your body is trying to get rid of something. But they define immunity is
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:31.360]  by the presence of an antibody, which is just simply one of the many long list of lies that
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:35.840]  they send out in their propaganda. Exactly because you'll have an antibody to HIV if you've got it,
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:40.960]  but it doesn't mean you've gotten rid of it. Exactly. Exactly. You can have an antibody to
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:46.800]  all of those things because injecting vaccines is nothing more than depositing foreign matter
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:51.680]  into a human being that it's trying to get rid of by developing an antibody. Dr. Tim Penney,
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:57.120]  thank you for joining us. Stay right there. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon

[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:28.400]  you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:32.080]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? Will you go? Well, we're being censored.
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:35.920]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what
[2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:41.040]  you think because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very element
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:46.640]  that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:52.000]  sound of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:00.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:16.880]  Start your engines, ladies and gentlemen. Dr. Sherry Tenpen is our guest. I'll host a little bit
[2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:20.720]  of the next hour. Take your calls. My cat is coming up with big breaking news.
[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:28.080]  There was zero coverage. Normally, I can do anything on the media covers it. But when the
[2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:33.920]  head UN scientist and all the other scientists agreed in a two-day summit, and myself and the
[2:20:33.920 --> 2:20:40.560]  crew watched two days of it, 20 hours. And they were like, we're not allowed to investigate it.
[2:20:40.560 --> 2:20:44.640]  And people think it's hurting folks. We've seen evidence of that. And we tell people these adjuvants
[2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:49.840]  are dangerous. And they're telling the public there's no harm. And the public's getting angry.
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:55.600]  And the doctors are getting angry. And we've got a problem. It shows how the UN is supposedly the
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:21:02.400]  top of this. And they sound like Dr. Sherry Tenpenny 20 years ago, who heads up major clinics here
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:07.600]  and in other countries and very successful medical doctor. So you've got the floor down to just
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:12.800]  talk about how big a deal this is that right when they're trying to say it's forced and New Jersey
[2:21:12.800 --> 2:21:16.720]  did the right thing and didn't get rid of the religious exemption, right as they're trying to
[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:22.960]  force us, we now learn because they're losing the war because people know there's adverse reactions.
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:28.080]  They know there's liability protection. So then what is this? Why is the establishment doing this?
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:30.960]  What do they think is going to end up happening, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny?
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:38.240]  Well, it's interesting, Alex, because it started actually in 2010 when Bill Gates decided to put
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:45.680]  $10 billion on the table and create the decade of vaccines between 2010 and 2020 because many
[2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:51.840]  of their blockbuster drugs were going off patent and becoming generic. And so they made the decision
[2:21:51.840 --> 2:21:58.560]  collectively made the decision to continue to build the entire pharmaceutical industry on the backs
[2:21:58.560 --> 2:22:05.120]  of children and adults being vaccinated, becoming sick and becoming customers for life.
[2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:10.640]  So as you know, I've been fighting this now for 19 years and tens of thousands of hours of research
[2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:15.200]  and we have eliminated the word immunization. We call it vaccination now because that's what
[2:22:15.200 --> 2:22:19.920]  it is. I've been working hard for the last couple of years to stop calling all of these
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:26.400]  infectious illnesses that children get like chickenpox and measles. Stop calling them diseases
[2:22:26.400 --> 2:22:30.640]  but calling them infections because that's what they are. Now, the next level of what we need
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:35.920]  to do is as they are pushing these mandatory vaccines forward on all of these mandates
[2:22:35.920 --> 2:22:41.440]  based on nothing and now we hear from the World Health Organization and the UN that we are the
[2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:47.600]  amongst the 10 top most dangerous organizations to public health. They said that at the beginning
[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:53.440]  of 2019 that the anti-vax people or the people who are educated and form and choose to not be
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:58.960]  injected with foreign matter are some of the most are the most dangerous people to public health.
[2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:02.880]  Well, now we hear it from the horse's mouth. We hear it from the World Health Organization.
[2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:06.960]  We hear it from doctors and scientists from all over the world saying we have no science.
[2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:12.080]  We have no background. We haven't studied this. We haven't had large enough patient populations.
[2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:16.800]  We know that these studies are cut. We only do them for anywhere from five to 19 days
[2:23:16.800 --> 2:23:20.320]  because if they have to go longer the side effects will start to show up and then we have to stop
[2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:27.600]  everything. We have never tested for synergistic toxicity. We have every our entire industry
[2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:32.800]  is on this hook of having this antibody be present after the important matter is injected
[2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:39.600]  and we all know that having an antibody does not protect you. In fact,
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:45.120]  we're getting ready to launch our online bootcamp course, Alex. Open enrollment starts on the 20th.
[2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:48.960]  It's the mastering vaccine info bootcamp course. It's our seventh course.
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:56.080]  We do it twice a year. We go through safety, efficacy, smallpox, polio, herd immunity, package
[2:23:56.080 --> 2:24:00.400]  inserts. And then we give you the language training to teach you how to communicate this
[2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:06.320]  in a way that people will really listen to you and they will really hear you. And so part of
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:10.960]  what we're talking about there is that we are giving people the language to fight back against
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:16.640]  this because we know that the antibody level is nothing more than a marker of contamination.
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:21.680]  We know that they save safe and effective. Safety has never been determined. I talk about it.
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:27.120]  By the way, doc, let me just stop you again. I should have open the whole show up. Just said
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:32.160]  the head of the UN admits there's vaccine damage cover up and the doctors are turning against
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:37.920]  him. And Dr. Sherry Timpinney, the vanguard for decades exposing this totally vindicated
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:44.480]  has a plan to give medical documentation and facts to people so that they can't be bullied
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:49.200]  into submission and will inform the doctors that we know already secretly,
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:52.720]  just like I've had four children, they're like, take your vaccines. No, I'm not. The nurses go,
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:24:56.480]  actually, none of us take it. We see the kids have convulsions and we give it to premies and
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:00.800]  they die and you're right. None of us do it. We know and kids that don't vaccinate are healthier
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:06.640]  and there's stuff. I mean, it's all it's beyond a wobbly frontline. The facade is dropping.
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:11.760]  Please continue because everybody, mothers, fathers, people that have family that's having
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:16.560]  children, grandmothers, grandfathers, reach out to your children, have them go take this course.
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:21.360]  Especially women say, well, I hear it's safe and effective with their husband or vice versa.
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:28.800]  Then if it's is important, go take this course and then absolutely have a medical doctor
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:33.120]  walk you through it. So you're truly informed about such an incredibly important question.
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.320]  Now, one of the things that we talk about first is about lack of safety. There is, you know,
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:44.640]  as you know, there is not a single vaccine that's ever been tested against a true inert placebo.
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:48.480]  We just know it's just not true. We know that there's no long term studies. And now the World
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:52.640]  Health Organization and all of those clips that you just showed us, they talk about, yeah, it's
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.280]  a small, we don't have very large sample sides. We don't follow them for very long because if we
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.160]  start following for a long period of time, side effects will show up. So safety is bunked.
[2:26:02.160 --> 2:26:08.720]  So they're like German soldiers in 42 German officers who started wanting to take out Hitler.
[2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:12.160]  They're like, we might have signed on to the wrong side. We might be the bad guys. I mean,
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:17.680]  that's what this event was like was them kind of covering their ass. Exactly. And then the other
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:23.200]  thing they always say is effective. And we as consumers have learned have come to think of
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:30.000]  effective as being protection, but effect effective and protection are not synonyms. And if somebody
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:33.200]  wants to, you know, you can sign up. Thank you for showing that on your screen there, Alex.
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:38.160]  People can sign up for the get on our list for open enrollment. Open enrollment starts
[2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:44.480]  Thursday morning at 9 a.m. Or you can email me directly. You can email me at courses,
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:52.000]  the number for mastery at gmail.com courses for mastery at gmail.com. And if you can't
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:55.360]  get into the website where you just showed you can send it to there and I'll manually enter
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:59.440]  you into the into the open enrollment. It's only a short open enrollment. The course actually
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:04.320]  starts March the 1st. We only give it twice per year. And I'm happy to say that we've had at least
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:09.920]  25 medical doctors go through our course and the medical doctors. And when they go through the
[2:27:09.920 --> 2:27:14.480]  course, they go, we've never learned this. I had no idea. Well, you just heard the head of the
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:19.280]  head of the World Health Organization say that the average doctor gets half a day. And so you're
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:24.800]  providing the facts to people which will overturn their life. You're hitting right at the root
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:31.040]  as a medical doctor showing them the facts things they've never seen. That's exactly right. And
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:35.600]  what we are actually doing is we are creating an educational force for people to go back. I mean,
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:40.240]  think about it, Alex. I mean, they have pro vaccine training all the time. They teach doctors how to
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:44.960]  deal with vaccine resistant parents. They teach them how to document in their charts, even if they
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:49.040]  don't give a vaccine so they get paid. They have all kinds of educational courses. We have an
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:54.000]  educational course now to train people. And so you will be able to recite all of these different
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:59.520]  things. And to be go back to that UN meeting that you just showed and blow away every single one
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:04.080]  of those nuggets because Alex, I'm telling you, when I first heard all of that and I listened,
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:08.720]  I didn't listen to all 20 hours of it. I certainly listened to the highlights of it. It was jaw
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:14.240]  dropping to me. It should be enough right there to stop this industry. Well, Rob do who's obsessed
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:19.200]  with this because he's seen family hurt by it. He did watch the whole thing and he was crying the
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:24.960]  next day. It's the next thing that we have to do instead of fighting to retain our right to
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:29.520]  refuse our God given right to refuse. We need to band together and go for the jugular and end
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:34.080]  this beast. It's time for this. That's right, because we have the power of science and facts on
[2:28:34.080 --> 2:28:39.520]  our hands. We have the inserts. We have the proof how dare them say we're liars when the head of
[2:28:39.520 --> 2:28:44.240]  the UN says Dr. Sheridan Penny's been right all along. We're going to come back with more and
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:48.720]  ask how they're going to strike back next. I mean, they're calling for arresting anyone that
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:55.760]  questions it. This is big pharma folks who trust them. If you're trying to quit drinking or doing
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:01.760]  too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:08.320]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruin my life.
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:14.640]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:20.320]  your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national

[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:04.640]  bio-weapon designed to destroy nation-states, economies, and free peoples and usher in a
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:10.640]  planetary government. This is how the globalists are striking back. Here's a fortune headline today.
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:17.520]  Fears of global coronavirus can tage in rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home,
[2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:24.800]  and that's just in one nation. Coronavirus deals a major blow to German car factories in China
[2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:32.160]  that reporting it could cut their sales in half this year. That's how major this is.
[2:32:32.960 --> 2:32:40.560]  Everyone needs to be prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games. Info wars will continue to report
[2:32:40.560 --> 2:32:45.600]  the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to
[2:32:45.600 --> 2:32:50.560]  punish us for telling the truth. We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word
[2:32:50.560 --> 2:33:00.160]  about ban.video and infohorsestore.com today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:14.000]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:21.760]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:29.200]  So, you've seen it all over the news. Arrest anti-vaxxers. Arrest people that question it. Arrest
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:33.920]  people that question Big Pharma. You saw Roger Stone, one of Trump s chief advisors,
[2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:39.520]  set up for Russiagate. No Russia found. They claim he lied to Congress, and he didn't even do that.
[2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:45.680]  Well, that's the point we've gotten to, is Caitlyn Bennett, Info Wars reporter, run off of
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:52.960]  Ohio University. We're trying to do interviews about President's Day. Here's what Trump said
[2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:55.520]  just about an hour ago at a press conference about Roger Stone.
[2:33:56.720 --> 2:34:00.880]  Are you planning to pardon Roger Stone? I haven't given it any thought. In the meantime,
[2:34:00.880 --> 2:34:05.520]  he's going through a process, but I think he's been treated very unfairly. Yes.
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:10.880]  And it's warning about China and wanting U.S. companies. So, he hasn't given it any thought.
[2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:18.880]  Trump doesn't lie a lot, but I guarantee he's given that a lot of thought.
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:22.000]  But I guess he hasn't given thought to the pardon yet, he could say, because
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:27.040]  the process isn't over. So, I get what he's saying is he hasn't given thought to what he's going to
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:33.520]  do specifically because the sentencing isn't over. So, from a legal perspective, I get what he's
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:38.320]  saying. But obviously, he's thought about it because Roger Stone advised him on the 2020
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:44.000]  campaign quite a bit and has been punished so that he would lie about Trump. And Stone hasn't done that.
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:51.120]  But if he's going to be giving clemency early president release to Blagojevic,
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:55.440]  the disgraced governor of Illinois, who definitely was involved in
[2:34:56.640 --> 2:35:02.320]  paper play stuff caught on tape doing it, then he better let Roger Stone go. But I wouldn't hold
[2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:08.000]  my breath now with the media acting like it's obstruction of justice if the president
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:13.120]  hardens him. The president has that power and should exorcise his executive power.
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:18.000]  His instinct is vaccines are dangerous. Barron got hurt by one. You know, you want to know
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:23.920]  Roger Stone's story, Roger Stone knows for a fact that Barron was really healthy and doing great,
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:29.520]  had big problems for vaccines, didn't talk for a while, had some problems. They only put a stigma
[2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:35.440]  on their son. But Trump's like, what's wrong with my three year old? He was running around great.
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:41.120]  Now I can barely talk. He bounced back from it. But notice Trump talked to Bill Gates and Bill
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:45.840]  Gates told him it's okay. So now Trump doesn't say a word about vaccines. It's amazing. So don't
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:50.000]  let your lying eyes get to you, Trump. Getting back to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, who's been one of the
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:56.240]  leading voices exposing the dangers of vaccines, their secret protections and the rest of it,
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:01.280]  total vindication with the UN summit, the head of the UN vaccine program, the head scientist of the
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:06.480]  UN, saying that there's damages, it's hurting people, we've covered it up. All the other scientists
[2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:10.800]  saying, yeah, something needs to be done. There's no testing. Basically, we're just told to do this.
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:17.520]  I mean, that is so, that is so massive. Speak to that. And then how do they try to strike back now?
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:20.720]  What do you, what's the latest to this authoritarianism?
[2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:28.240]  The latest is obviously mandates, mandatory vaccination for, because it's all saying two things,
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:35.280]  Alex, one is the measles is going to kill everybody. So we have to stop it. And the second thing is
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:42.560]  setting up these mandatory vaccinations will allow them to vaccinate us with these fast-track
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:49.040]  counter-terror, counter-measures is what they call them. If it's a fast-tracked vaccine,
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:53.920]  they call it a counter-measure. And if it's a counter-measure, you can't sue over it, even in
[2:36:53.920 --> 2:36:59.520]  the crappy vaccine court that we have. And so I believe that they are setting up all these mandates
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:05.280]  and with this coronavirus and then Ebola virus hanging in the backdrop, some biological thing
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:11.440]  in order to be able to ram their vaccines into everybody. I think that that's what's coming.
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:16.080]  I've been working with several groups in Europe. In fact, I'm going to be in Munich the third week
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:21.760]  in March. I'm going to be talking at a big rally there. And then there's a very large invitation
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:28.640]  only strategy meeting for Europe to try to get our point across. And I think that our next move
[2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:35.120]  here, Alex, needs to be, you know, we're looking at trying to put fingers in 50 dykes across our
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:40.640]  country, 50 dykes minus four, minus California, New York, West Virginia, and Mississippi,
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:45.440]  that have already lost their right to refuse. And so we've got all of these other states that
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:50.080]  we're trying to protect our exemptions. It's just going to be a matter of time before Pharma says,
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:53.760]  I'm sick and tired of fighting this in all these states. Let's just ratchet this up and make it
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:59.280]  mandatory at the federal level, which is some of what these sad executive orders that Trump has put
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:04.880]  through makes me very nervous. And they're already trying to pass that in Europe. And so I think
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:10.560]  that the next level of what we need to be advocating for is the complete elimination of the vaccine
[2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:17.760]  industry. It's a 200 year mistake. It was based on based on no science on politics and on money
[2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:24.720]  from its very inception. It's doing the incidence rate of these infections is extraordinarily low.
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:30.400]  We no longer need to vaccinate everyone to cause eradication of these viruses and bacteria that
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:36.640]  even that will continue to propagate irrespective of vaccination rates. You know, science moves on,
[2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:44.480]  technology moves on. Sure, vaccines belong to the age of leeches and tying witches up with rocks
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:52.560]  and throwing them in the local lake. But clearly they know they're losing. That's why they're
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:57.440]  pushing for total capitulation. You're right. Just counter them completely and say eradicate the
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:03.360]  whole industry. Get rid of all of it. They're building a $1.3 trillion industry on the backs
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:08.960]  of damaging children. And if that isn't enough to get people riled up and be really angry about
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:12.880]  what's going on, then they are just they're just brain dead and they're never going to get it.
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:17.680]  But let's pull back from that, Dr. Tim Penny, the transgenderism. No, I don't hate somebody
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:21.440]  because they want to be another sex or whatever. Targeting children, telling them they're another
[2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:26.720]  sex, taking parental rights away, giving them dangerous drugs, supposedly change their sex.
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:33.440]  There is an, like you said, an establishment, medicalization, moonshows and by proxy, targeting
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:38.240]  children. And we know vaccines are damaging them. We know they're covering it up. Where does this
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:43.360]  cult of targeting children come from? Making them sick, as you said early on, to make sure
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:49.680]  they're a client of the system for life. Exactly. It's a customer for life. If we can, if every,
[2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:55.760]  out of every 10, it's my opinion, my opinion that out of every 10 vaccines, every 10 children
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:01.200]  that are vaccinated, all 10 of them are injured at some level. You may not see it. They may not
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:06.160]  have asthma, allergies, seizures, autoimmune disorders. But what if we just shaved off 10
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:11.760]  or 15 IQ points off of that kid? And then the next generation and the next generation.
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:18.560]  And so we are damaging everyone. And I firmly believe that this may be, this very well may be,
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:24.400]  the last generation of children that we see unless we stop this. What if your great grandchildren
[2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:28.880]  look back at you at this point in time and say, you could have stopped this and you didn't and
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:34.560]  now look at us. We can't have children. Everybody has mental mental problems. They have headaches.
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:38.880]  They're they're all sick. They're on all these medications. You could have stood in the gap
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:43.280]  and changed it and you didn't. And what if you can't even get great grandchildren? What if you
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:48.720]  can't even get to that point because of primary primary ovarian failure in girls by the Gardasil
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:54.080]  vaccine and all the aluminum that is that is messing with the sperm counts. You just said it
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:41:00.080]  it's a population reduction operation. Bill Gates on TED Talk 10 years ago said we need to increase
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:05.760]  vaccines to lower the human population and the crowd laugh. They're all in on it. I don't know
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:09.680]  that they laugh because they're in on it or they laughed on it because they thought it was so bizarre.
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:15.920]  But here we are. Here we are. And it's actually happening. And it's time for us to just stop
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:20.880]  this. It's time for us to make this go away. We don't you're right because it's so freakish. It's
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:27.360]  so evil. People can't even believe it's happening. But it is. It's we can't make safer vaccines. It's
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:32.880]  not possible. And everybody at the UN just told us that we have to have adjuvants to quote make it
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:38.000]  work. Make an antibody that doesn't even keep you from getting sick. So they don't they don't keep
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:43.600]  you from getting sick. They're all risk and no benefit that the incidence rate of these infections
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:48.880]  is so low. There's no reason to have mass vaccination for any of it. It's a 200 year
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:54.560]  multi generational mistake. Alex and it's time for it to go away. It's a cult really isn't it.
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:42:02.240]  It's a religion. It's a religion. It's a people. People always say I believe in vaccines. You do.
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:07.680]  Why give me give me a really good reason why you believe in vaccines. Well my grandmother. Well
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:11.440]  then people say well what about smallpox. What about polio. Will we go through all of that in
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:14.880]  our boot camp course and teach people how to. All right. Let's talk about that in the final
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:18.640]  segment and how they're going to strike back. But I'll just say this. We got a break with Dr. Sherry
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:24.480]  Tempani. My grandmother died two years ago at 92. Amazing lady. The doctors told her she got a second
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:29.120]  round of polio vaccine. She got it a week later. They told her you got it from your polio vaccine.
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:35.120]  My mother was a master swimmer. She was getting gold medals against Olympic athletes. She didn't
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:40.240]  start swimming competitively. So she was like 30. The UT swim team told her take the shot. She
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:44.720]  took it almost killed her. A bunch of others got sick. I mean everybody I know has been hurt by these.
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:49.920]  Two people in my office have had their children died from vaccines and the doctors told them the
[2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:57.360]  vaccine killed your child. Real stuff man. We're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:01.440]  all day long. But man I tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:06.800]  shot over and everybody I mean I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:11.520]  said about two months ago I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have a warehouse
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:17.280]  full of hundreds of thousands of stickers. 20 different stickers. Impeach the Democrats. Save
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:22.080]  the Second Amendment. Defend the First Amendment. InfoWars.com and it looks like duct tape. It's
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:25.760]  just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth. You go to a Trump rally and you instantly
[2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:29.600]  take over without even disrupting things. People say why are you doing this? What's happening?
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:33.680]  When you go well we're being censored and you know Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr.
[2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:37.520]  Pachennick let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant.
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:43.920]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:49.760]  weapon. You have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:59.520]  Silence. Across the western world from high school to college sports to even the Olympics
[2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:07.280]  men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events. This is men invading women's
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:14.000]  spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away. All in the name of the liberalism and openness.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:20.400]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today. UK team find under house arrest
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:27.040]  for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings. UK mother spared jail
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:32.960]  for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:40.160]  anxiety in the new royalty. That's the thought police. If a leftist has their feelings hurt for
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:46.960]  any reason you get fined and you go to jail. This is tyranny. These people are bullies and it's sick
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:52.400]  and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover. Resist it. Speak out against it.
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:59.760]  We know that the globalists are in trouble. Humanities waking up to their tyranny, how they
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:05.120]  run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post human world. But we know they're
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:10.640]  going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:16.800]  countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:23.280]  west and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and pivot program. The UN also has said
[2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:30.400]  they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus. This is a
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:36.560]  critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because
[2:45:36.560 --> 2:45:41.920]  people are waking up like never before but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread
[2:45:41.920 --> 2:45:50.000]  the word about band.video and infowars.com forward slash show that is so important. You are at the
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:58.160]  center of the resistance. You are our only hope. There can no longer be any doubt. This coronavirus
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:05.040]  is serious on multiple levels. It's very communicable. It spreads very, very fast. It is killing a lot
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:10.560]  of people and the Chinese communist government has covered up just how bad it is and the lighthouse
[2:46:10.560 --> 2:46:17.600]  is now openly challenging them. Show our Trump's top scientist and so is Senator Cotton. My friends
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:24.640]  now is the time to get prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games with the globalist are trying
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:30.160]  to create economic collapse race riots. We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:36.800]  That's why listeners to info wars need to be prepared and infowarstore.com has the products
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:42.640]  that make your life better and make you healthier. We have the last of the immune gargle selling out
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:47.920]  as we speak. We have high quality, storable foods ready to ship and vitamin mineral fusion is back
[2:46:47.920 --> 2:47:07.920]  in stock along with ultra 12 at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:35.280]  You know, I was just sitting here thinking. How long have I been interviewing Dr. Sherry
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:46.240]  Tenpenny? And I remember interviewing her from my home studios in like 1998, 99. So that's how
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:51.760]  long she's been on air with us and back then she just go, here's this study. Here's that study.
[2:47:51.760 --> 2:47:56.000]  I'm just being very scientific and this is what I'm seeing with my patients and
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:00.720]  and then now you're here. It's a takeover plan to reduce population and pure evil
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:05.520]  because it's all admitted. So Sherry spend a few minutes. We got to personalize this and you are
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:08.800]  a hero. You don't say you are but you've been attacked. You've been demonized for what you've
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:14.720]  done. You've been totally vindicated. What woke you up? I mean, because you've been awake before I
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:21.840]  was interviewing you 20 years ago. What woke you up? It was just serendipity, Alex. It was I
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:26.320]  went to the National Vaccine Information Center meeting in Washington, D.C. and I came home and
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:32.400]  said, how did I possibly miss this? I've been a practicing physician at that point since 1985.
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:38.160]  I had my own clinic here in Cleveland, Ohio. I grew up in a chiropractic family that I was not
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:43.600]  vaccinated as a kid. I had all the age appropriate measles, mumps, rebelle, chicken pox, pertussis.
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:48.240]  I had those things. Never really gave it a thought. None of my cousins had been vaccinated.
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:52.160]  And when I came back from that meeting, I thought, maybe I ought to start somewhere and look into
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:57.280]  this. And the first paper that I read was the CDC's general recommendation for vaccination. It was
[2:48:57.280 --> 2:49:04.000]  the, I believe it was the 1998 paper. And when I read it, I said, this can't be it. This can't be
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:09.600]  what the entire, an entire industry is built on. And at that point in time, the vaccine sector of
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:16.560]  the pharmaceutical industry was about $8 billion. It's now like $57 billion now. And I thought,
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:23.040]  there has to be something more than this. And so that's why I kept doing it. It was just more and
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:28.000]  more and more. And I kept thinking that sooner or later, I would read something that made sense.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:33.200]  Sooner or later, I would find something that actually was the reason why we do all these
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:38.560]  vaccines. And to date, after all of these years of research, all these tens of thousands of hours,
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:42.480]  all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, even thousands of papers that I've read,
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.320]  because we have a research library called the 10 penny research library that has over
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:53.200]  11,000 articles pulled from mainstream medical journals showing problems associated with vaccines.
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:59.200]  And so all the thousands of hours I have yet to find anything that justifies injecting foreign
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:05.440]  matter into one day old children or injecting foreign matter into pregnant women for any
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:12.560]  reason whatsoever. I mean, there's no science at all that to support injecting pregnant women
[2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:17.440]  with DPTs or influenza vaccines or anything else that they're talking about doing it.
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:22.800]  There's no science to support injecting one day old babies with hepatitis B vaccines. There's
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:30.240]  no science to justify giving vitamin K shots to children that has aluminum in it.
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:34.000]  But it gets worse than that. Take Angelina Jolie now 10 years ago,
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:37.760]  has both her breasts cut off because she might have a gene for breast cancer. Well,
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:41.680]  yeah, I have a gene that if I smoke three packs of cigarettes today, I'll get lung cancer.
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:47.200]  And so then they sell women now to the doctor. Oh, you're 40. It's time to have double mastectomies.
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:52.000]  We'll take the fat from your stomach and then put it into the bags that were your breast. I mean,
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:57.920]  this and almost all the kids in Austin now 60% are born via cesarean. The medical system is just
[2:50:57.920 --> 2:51:05.840]  taking over normal biological activity. Yes, in every industry. And so to your question,
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:10.640]  what really woke me up? I mean, it was just kind of serendipity. And it was just that
[2:51:10.640 --> 2:51:15.520]  the more that I saw Alex, I mean, I don't have any children. I don't have any children. So I'm
[2:51:15.520 --> 2:51:20.480]  not in that fight. So I'm not in the autism fight. I don't have any vaccine injured cousins or
[2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:30.560]  relatives. I just see this as the truth and exposing a 200 year lie, 200 years of propaganda,
[2:51:30.560 --> 2:51:34.560]  200 years that if we say it over and over again, if we say it often enough, then somehow that
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:39.760]  makes it be true. Well, I think it's time for us to understand there's no truth to it. None.
[2:51:40.640 --> 2:51:46.320]  So let me ask you that question. Clearly, the head UN scientist and all the adjuncts are saying
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:51.200]  just what you're saying, they say they're losing and that needs to be fixed and tested. So that
[2:51:51.200 --> 2:51:56.960]  sounds like victory to me, except they admit we don't test. We're given this by Big Pharma.
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.360]  We're given this by Bill O. Melinda Gates. And so it really shows the UN isn't even running
[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:08.720]  things. This is just a staggering admission. Yeah, we it's we have been and think think about
[2:52:08.720 --> 2:52:15.680]  this way, Alex. I mean, since since the early 1900s over the last 100 years, how many tens of
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:21.760]  millions, if not even billions of doses of vaccine have been deposited into human beings
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:27.040]  and animals, if you want to put on that path to all over the world for the sake of commerce,
[2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:32.560]  to make them sick so that we can stuff them full of more pharmaceutical. That's right,
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:38.560]  corporations set the precedent by law that every cow and every cat and every dog and every pig
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:43.120]  and every everything will be given. That's the other question. They call it vaccine.
[2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:47.760]  I understand taking smallpox 500 years ago, putting in somebody helping they live, and if
[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:51.120]  they survive, yeah, you've learned immunity. That's real science. Those are risks.
[2:52:52.560 --> 2:52:59.760]  But when you pull back from this, now it's live viruses and and it's it's it's genetically
[2:52:59.760 --> 2:53:05.680]  engineered and it's got whole human genomes in it. And it's it's so it's not even a vaccine.
[2:53:05.680 --> 2:53:11.760]  It's just something big pharma, which is like big tech wants to put in you with their whole
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:16.720]  with their whole history of secret experimentation. Well, this just sounds like the beginning of a bad
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:22.880]  science fiction horror movie. It does. And it is. That's exactly what it is. And you can't prove
[2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:29.520]  a negative. So if you get a flu shot, and you do not get the flu, is it because the flu shot did
[2:53:29.520 --> 2:53:34.320]  something to keep you from getting sick? Or is it because you washed your hands or that your vitamin
[2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:40.800]  D level is between 80 and 100? Or because you eat well or you are overall healthy? How can you say
[2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:46.880]  it was the flu shot that kept you from getting influenza, particularly since the statistics
[2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:54.080]  show that over the last 19 years and I dug all this data out of CDC data over the last 19 years,
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:54:01.520]  only people get sick in the winter time, 85% of the time that illness is caused by something other
[2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:07.200]  than influenza viruses. So if it's something other than an influenza virus and you got a flu shot,
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:13.680]  it didn't keep you from getting sick anyways. It's one propagated lie, myth, distortion,
[2:54:14.640 --> 2:54:20.400]  whatever you want to call it, falsehood, fake news after another and another and another. And
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:26.080]  Alex, that's why they won't debate us. It's because we win hands down on every argument.
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:32.080]  And so the only tools they have left in their toolbox are disparaging our name,
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:40.000]  our blood slinging, are trying to shut us down, the censorship, stopping everything that we have
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:45.280]  to say. It's the only tools they have left in their toolbox to fight us because we win hands
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:50.720]  down every time that vaccines are not good. They are not safe. They do not keep you from getting
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:56.800]  an infection. They do cause disease and it's time for this industry to button up and blow away.
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:04.160]  And now the UN admits that's the truth but a total news blackout. So their censorship,
[2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:08.160]  their attempts for forced inoculation is their weakness, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:12.960]  should not give in to the intimidation. Let me ask you this in closing, Dr. Sherry Tenpenning.
[2:55:13.600 --> 2:55:17.520]  Obviously, learned immunity, artificially learned immunity is a real science. There's
[2:55:17.520 --> 2:55:23.120]  problems. It causes other problems. It causes side effects. There's all sorts of contaminants.
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:27.840]  I'm not selling vaccines here. But if there is some deadly super whatever going on, if we could
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:33.760]  have an attenuation, I mean, I might want it. I want that choice. But with this history of them
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:38.000]  acting like this, you can't trust any of it. So it's almost like the whole science is ruined.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:45.600]  Is there any salvage ability? No. Injecting foreign matter into human beings does nothing but make
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:50.880]  them sick. We need to get back to looking at things like homeoprophylaxis. We need to look at
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:56.880]  high dose vitamin C. And in fact, I had heard that they were actually even doing a study in China,
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:56:01.680]  like with 20,000 people using high dose. Oh, absolutely. Nutrition, sunlight, clean water,
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:08.400]  good. Yep. Washing your hands. I mean, we have been sold a bill of goods, Alex. Oh, bring that
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:13.760]  up. I've seen the studies in Australia, the UK and the US from the 20s on. And I don't have time
[2:56:13.760 --> 2:56:18.960]  to pull this up. But it's always like this. The graph shows the same thing. You basically get 1900.
[2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:27.840]  Document cam shot, guys. And you get running water comes in right around here. And so by the 1940s,
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:34.080]  when most people have running water, you see infectious disease go way down because of laundry
[2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:39.680]  detergents. And then suddenly vaccines come in, it goes back up some. And it looks like vaccines
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:43.760]  actually caused a bump in infectious disease. That's a primitive way to do it. But we've all
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:48.720]  seen those graphs. Alex, you're right. And at that 1940 area where you were talking about
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:53.520]  water, the other thing that is not talked about as much as it should is that is the impact of
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:58.320]  electricity, of electricity going into houses where they can have refrigeration. Yes. And that
[2:56:58.320 --> 2:57:04.000]  their food doesn't rot and turn into maggots. So we talk about this a lot in our boot camp course.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:07.840]  We go through all of this. And if people are interested, they want to get more information.
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:12.320]  They can go to Vaxter dot com and put boot camp in the search. And you can find out everything
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:16.640]  about the boot camp. You can sign up for our email list. You can send me an email at courses
[2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:22.000]  for mastery at gmail.com and we'll get you plugged in. But well, listen, Dr. Sherry Timpinney,
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:27.120]  you are the renaissance. I want to I want us to really say we need to end this. We need to end
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:32.000]  it. We need to end this industry. Let's do it. You have been on a couple years. Please come back
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:35.360]  in the next few weeks. I know you're busy. We love you. You're the vanguard. You've been totally
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:40.480]  vindicated. Dr. Sherry Timpinney nods your head. Promise you'll come on soon. She nodded her head.
[2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:45.600]  Well, they're right back. Your calls are straight ahead. Thank you, daughter. I spend a lot of time
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:52.000]  reminding the info wars, the family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:56.800]  air. And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping

[2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:07.840]  reviewers. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:12.480]  really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there,

[2:59:44.000 --> 3:00:00.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:17.360]  Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River. Life is older, older than the
[3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:24.480]  trees, younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze country road.
[3:00:24.480 --> 3:00:30.480]  Alex Adams takes over in 15 minutes for big news and I'm hosting down to go to your call. So
[3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:35.600]  those are patiently holding. I'm going to go in the order they were received. Let's talk to Ryan
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:40.400]  in Florida. Ryan, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hey, Alex. Thank you so much for taking
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:44.720]  my call, man. I appreciate a great show today. Appreciate you, brother. Of course. I just wanted
[3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:48.560]  to piggyback off what you were talking about, you know, like where's Trump? Where are the men in
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:54.720]  the country? I think that's a very, those are very good questions. I think a more important
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:01:03.120]  thing to ask is like, where are the true patriots? Because people that rely on Q or Trump or whatever
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:07.840]  plan, you know, they think is going to work, you know, work out in the end, I think they're
[3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:12.240]  the ones who are released down the country out because they're hedging their bets. And I'm not
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:17.200]  advocating violence in any way. I just want to put that out there. But the American Revolution
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:22.960]  was not one with the freedom of speech. It wasn't one by waiting for the tough guys to
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:28.800]  come in and do everything for it. Well, he wasn't one by everything's handled by Bill Barr and Q
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:34.640]  over there. No, it was handled by the people doing the right thing at the grassroots. And I think
[3:01:34.640 --> 3:01:40.160]  Trump does mean well when I back from it's just that his capitulation on censorship of the American
[3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:46.000]  people is not acceptable. I agree. I feel like, you know, having all these globalists around him,
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:49.840]  and he knows how bad they are, you know, Ruby Ridge, Bill Barr, you know, that's not somebody
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:54.880]  you want to put in charge of of anything in my opinion. I think I think people really need to
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:01:59.520]  step up. And I think that one of the closest things I think I would say the country is what
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:03.360]  somebody mentioned recently was having military tribunals. But I think more so than military
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:08.480]  tribunals, we need to have constitutional courts and constitutional patriot tribunals where
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:14.080]  you realize the globalists have stacked almost all the top brass with globalists. Everybody
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:19.760]  keeps wanting military tribunals. That could be even worse with you just saw a
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:26.560]  house tribunal try to put the president, you know, in jail for no reason. I appreciate your
[3:02:26.560 --> 3:02:33.360]  call, Ryan. There's no quicker easy fix. We are rotten at the core. And that's why we're in so
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:39.200]  much trouble. But at least we're starting to wake up to that fact in a minute. All right, who's up next
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:45.760]  here? Rebecca in Ohio. Thanks for holding Rebecca. You're on the air.
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:52.400]  Hi, Alex. I love you. You're doing such a great job. I'm trying. Sometimes I get tired.
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:57.440]  Hey, look, I'm never tired when I'm under attack. It's when I'm not under attack.
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:01.120]  Like right now I'm under a lot of I'm kind of winning behind the scenes right now. So I'm very
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:06.160]  weak. Don't worry, they're gonna attack soon. You take it a little break to take a little break.
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:10.800]  But you're doing a great job. They'll stick an eye for me. So don't worry, I'll get plenty of power.
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:16.640]  Hey, this is the first time I'm calling. I'm calling about Ohio University.
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:22.640]  Oh, is that not incredible? What happened to Caitlyn? This is my hometown, Alex. This is my
[3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:29.760]  hometown. This is where I grew up. This is where I was raised. This is where I had my 12 year old
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:38.320]  paper route. This is my hometown. Now I moved 15 minutes away to live in the country. So I could
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:45.040]  have my farm. Everything you talk about, Alex, I'm living the dream right now. I've got my gardening.
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:50.320]  We just started tapping. And there is an army of foaming at the mouth zombie commies right down
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:56.880]  the street. Oh, yeah. Those people that you saw with Caitlyn are my neighbors. They were the
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:03.280]  people that were around me my whole life. Now those kids, I do have to say our town people are not
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:10.000]  like that. We have liberal town people. They're good people. These are the students. Okay. These are
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:14.720]  the kids that have been indoctrinated by the malice youth brigades. I'm going to hold you over, but
[3:04:14.720 --> 3:04:20.480]  keep going. Tell folks the thing that comes to my mind now, Alex, because I live here and the
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:24.640]  thing that makes that I'm thinking about now, I was talking to a friend of mine, we both worked
[3:04:24.640 --> 3:04:31.920]  at Trump campaign. In fact, I'm the Trump chair for Athens County for 2016. And they came to my
[3:04:31.920 --> 3:04:37.440]  office as kids and they spray painted. I don't remember if it was racist or Nazi on my building.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:42.320]  But it you know, I'm used to hold on. I want to hear about your thought crime.
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:47.760]  I want to hear about your thought crime outside Ohio University. They have a thought criminal.
[3:04:47.760 --> 3:04:56.160]  She should never voice. There's a new way to show your support for the info wars crew at info

[3:06:16.320 --> 3:06:24.640]  He just joined us and she's a farmer girl up outside of Ohio University where Caitlin Bennett
[3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:30.640]  is going to be on during the war room coming up next hour. 400 people tried to attack her did
[3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:38.080]  attack her ran around natural news CNN USA today just celebrating it like thank God they ran that
[3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:42.720]  Trump supporter out of there. That's what you do you throw coffee on women and just that's good
[3:06:43.360 --> 3:06:50.080]  malice orgies of delight. But she was getting into what's happened to her.
[3:06:51.920 --> 3:06:57.680]  Rebecca was in Ohio. So so we start there you were saying you've been attacked or did I miss
[3:06:57.680 --> 3:07:04.400]  here you know I was I was just saying that excuse me. I was I volunteered for the Trump campaign
[3:07:04.400 --> 3:07:12.800]  in 2016 and we had an office Republican office in town here and I was in there every day and
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:19.200]  one day I guess it was overnight they had come those students the same kind of you know the
[3:07:19.200 --> 3:07:26.000]  mentality whoever is indoctrinating them is still there and a mob of really weak look. I mean
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:30.880]  let me tell you two soldiers I don't want any violence I'm saying one or two soldiers could
[3:07:30.880 --> 3:07:35.280]  deal with all these and I don't say that with pleasure. These are pathetically weak people
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:40.640]  but it just shows who the slaves of evil are. Well the professors is who I'm wondering because
[3:07:40.640 --> 3:07:47.360]  see this when it's in my own town. I say to myself who's indoctrinating these kids because
[3:07:47.360 --> 3:07:53.200]  they're coming to the college. There's someone's indoctrinating them there. So I'm interested
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:58.480]  in that now locally because this is where I live. So we're going to start looking into it.
[3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:03.680]  Well I'll tell you the good news it's the Ford Foundation the Carney Foundation.
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:08.480]  There's a three hundred and something million dollar investigation going on Department of
[3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:13.680]  Education how the chai comms run Harvard and Yale and they've already indicted some of the top
[3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:17.680]  people at Harvard and Yale. So the whole chai comm network is about to go down. I can actually
[3:08:17.680 --> 3:08:21.840]  pull it up for you. Let me find it here for you but it's not getting a lot of attention.
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:26.560]  That's why they're freaking out is that it's not the chai comms running it. The big mega banks
[3:08:26.560 --> 3:08:32.240]  funded chai comm because it has no rules and will do whatever they want. Then they project the power
[3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:36.560]  out of that command base. There it is education department investigating Harvard Yale
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:43.200]  over foreign funding three hundred plus million billions total to other universities from chai
[3:08:43.200 --> 3:08:51.200]  comms. Well Alex if it can happen here this is small town America okay and this is waking me up
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:55.840]  even more than I was already awake because honestly I thought I was protected in a way
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:09:01.920]  because we're really just tucked in here in small town Ohio. There's no reason we should be like this
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:09.040]  except they brought it here they installed it and they're acting on their plan and we got to stop it.
[3:09:09.040 --> 3:09:14.880]  And they've empowered these people that have no idea how dishonorable they are. I mean they are
[3:09:14.880 --> 3:09:20.240]  howling and screaming and attacking a reporter and attacking their vehicle and laughing even though
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:26.640]  they have no idea that you know at least the Nazis had militaries and professionals that were willing
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:33.120]  to fight. They're acting like Nazis and do not have any of the force to even fight us but they're
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:38.160]  going to get they're going to get it don't worry. I want to connect the fact that Caitlyn said that
[3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:43.920]  the police didn't do anything that's why I brought up the spray painting also was that when they did
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:48.800]  that to the building during the campaign we called the police and the police did nothing about it.
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:54.720]  They didn't even investigate. That's because you have scum obviously running that department and
[3:09:54.720 --> 3:09:59.040]  most departments aren't run by scum but and I don't say the kids the police ask it's true.
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:03.120]  They try to take over the police they haven't been successful but in blue areas they have
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:09.040]  and the police then become basically the same as like communist commasars and they're not the enemy
[3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:14.480]  they're just something that's got to be dealt with if this goes to 1776 it's very very sad.
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:17.840]  So that's why we should really work to politically fix this while we still can.
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:21.600]  Thank you Rebecca and God bless you and I'm not mad at Caitlyn not wanting to go back.
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:26.720]  I get it it was very traumatic for her. She didn't know this would happen
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:31.520]  but we'll bring thousands of people. We'll let them know that it's not acceptable.
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:37.120]  We'll teach those students by peaceful means how dumb they are but see everyone
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:44.720]  cowards the left so it encourages the bully. People ask me well I'll go to an anti-vote event
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:50.480]  and I'll tell security stand back and I'll just go into their event because go ahead hurt me.
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:56.240]  I'm not afraid of you. We have to break their will that we're scared of them. These bullies
[3:10:56.240 --> 3:10:59.600]  think that that's power and they don't know what to do when you're not scared of them.
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:04.320]  They have to have that broken that I'm not afraid of you and you're a piece of crap
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:07.040]  because a bully gets off on the fear they invoke.
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:18.320]  Let's go to Johnny and Denmark. He's been holding the longest now. Johnny thanks for holding go ahead.
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:23.760]  Hi Alex. It's my high honor and distinct privilege to talk to you again.
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:29.520]  It's my high honor to talk to you. We're like Uber mentioned up here right now.
[3:11:30.320 --> 3:11:33.360]  I'm following Gandhi's advice being a change you want to see in the world.
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:39.040]  Yes sir. Nancy Pelosi didn't do it for Uncle Donny. Hey I'm doing it for Uncle Alex.
[3:11:39.600 --> 3:11:47.520]  Anyway I know time is short and I just a quick five point agenda. The first and most important
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:53.760]  to me at least is you've been talking recently about doing this podcast with callers and it
[3:11:53.760 --> 3:11:56.960]  looks like you're very close and one day you were actually going I want to help push you over the
[3:11:56.960 --> 3:12:01.360]  edge here. Oh we're going to do it. We're just getting more people hired so we can do it. We're
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:05.520]  almost there. I get you but I'm just going to make you a quick offer then we want to the next
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:10.720]  point. If you want to start it right here right now today I'd be willing to do it for the whole
[3:12:10.720 --> 3:12:17.440]  three hours with you and any other day you know this week just start it would just be me you or
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:22.480]  whoever else. No listen I'm looking forward to basically commercial free shows I'm going to do
[3:12:23.040 --> 3:12:27.440]  and I've committed to do it. It's just that I've got a lot of other little things I got to deal with
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:33.760]  but truthfully I run around scrabbling trying to make money to fund things and so the thing is I've
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:38.880]  never worshiped money I never sold out for money but then I've still got to get it however I get it
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:44.880]  to fund things and so it just takes up half my time which then makes me disgusted by it but
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:47.440]  nevertheless we're starting to win brother and that's what matters.
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:54.480]  He's gone we love you we're going to do that show soon my friend Robert
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:13:02.240]  in New Mexico then Adam in Canada go ahead Robert. Yes Alex I just wanted to say I
[3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:08.080]  I disagree somewhat with what you said about with Gavin McInnes who said that there's no
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:15.360]  peak to leftism I think there is a peak and you've alluded to it with the the Maoist orgies of
[3:13:15.360 --> 3:13:21.760]  delight it's the cultural revolution that's where these people want to go it's a it's a playbook as
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:26.000]  you've said many times and when they come to my house they're going to die but they know they're
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:30.160]  going to have the cops do it they're going to break down civilization and then give an order
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:34.480]  for the extremists they want picked up and then they think we're just going to kill cops
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:39.520]  which then brings down no no no we're not going to kill cops it's not about kissing cops ass police
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:45.040]  aren't the target if they're able to bring down the government the left and the academics and the
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:51.120]  globalists of the target yeah and I agree with you that and and with Dr. Pachanik that they don't have
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:56.560]  the strength or the numbers to carry out their plan but my concern is the psychological state
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:03.760]  that these kids have been put into and how we move forward as a civil society you know because
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:09.200]  we need to defuse these people we need to deprogram them I agree with you if you try to talk to them
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:14.000]  they just scream racist and spit in your face you're like you're like hey George Soros is a Nazi
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:20.640]  shut up Nazi ass you try talking to one of them yeah and we have to we have to get them out of
[3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:25.200]  that mindset it's it's uh it's something that I don't think we're going to be able to look here's
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:31.920]  an example Starbucks throws police out that are getting coffee as if they think the average cop is
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:37.680]  a bad person that's how because the government isn't theirs it's we the people's so they see the
[3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:43.760]  lowest level of government police as their enemy because they want control of that you see what
[3:14:43.760 --> 3:14:51.760]  I'm saying yeah absolutely absolutely and we have to make sure that we we we as you've said many
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:57.120]  times these folks are not the enemy they're political opposition but they're fellow Americans and we
[3:14:57.120 --> 3:15:03.040]  have to I agree that they're mental patients so how do you get a crazy homeless person
[3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:08.320]  that's trying to bite you at a red light what do you want a crazy homeless person to beat your
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:11.920]  windshield out because I know they're crazy I don't want to get in a fight with them but they're
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:17.200]  attacking me yeah we have to defend ourselves that's at the end of the day we have to defend
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:22.400]  ourselves yeah and I'm not looking for that fight I'm saying we don't want that fight to kick off we
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:27.120]  want to politically fix it I'm saying they're not going to stop because they know they're losing
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:32.160]  they're going to start that political fight I got Braden and Adam and then Mike Adams this
[3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:36.720]  segment next segment's taken over but I'm going to give each Braden and Adam one minute them
[3:15:36.720 --> 3:15:42.000]  and ask Mike Adams what do we do well Mike's a pretty smart guy he's trying to fix things politically
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:46.720]  but he's bugged out and got a ranch I don't even have that yet so I gotta tell you we are entering

[3:21:05.040 --> 3:21:10.640]  tested mike adams will answer that question he wrote the article christine maxwell the
[3:21:10.640 --> 3:21:18.880]  sister of jis lane maxwell that worked for mr ebstin works with the fbi it turns out
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:21.840]  but nobody wants us to talk about that

[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:41.840]  but so many people that are conservative or nationalist or christian back away from

[3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:51.840]  just followers but our audience of viewers and listeners they're not followers they're the tip
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:56.480]  of the spear and their word of mouth and their financial support the broadcast is what allows
[3:21:56.480 --> 3:22:01.760]  all of us to happen that is changing history so i want to thank the listeners and viewers
[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:06.160]  for not being intimidated like everybody else and continuing to spread the word word of mouth
[3:22:06.800 --> 3:22:12.240]  of band dot video in fours dot com and in four store dot com because you are the reason this
[3:22:12.240 --> 3:22:16.720]  is still happening and we're changing the world together for the best mike adams takes over
[3:22:16.720 --> 3:22:20.000]  just about two minutes brayden in washington thanks for holding go ahead
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:26.880]  hey mr jones i really appreciate you taking my call appreciate you so i kind of two things here
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:34.320]  first off you know i'm a young guy washington state um and i'm currently going to community
[3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:39.680]  college right now fresh out of high school um and i just wanted to say that you know i really
[3:22:39.680 --> 3:22:44.880]  um kind of identify with what katlyn was talking about earlier i'm just the the craziness that goes
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:51.600]  on we we've seen this you know happen with with milo with gavin mckinnis steven crowder various
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:23:00.560]  comedians um and it just seems like we we are fighting because we have posters going up you know
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:06.880]  from like four chan like the it's okay to be white posters and various other kind of like
[3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:15.680]  campaigns going on um i guess the question is how do we you know get more young members in this
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:21.040]  community to go from just being like passive listeners to actually getting them to you know
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:25.360]  be active you know what the crew hears this and they're busy and they kind of halfway listen to me
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:30.400]  they're doing a great job but i want your name and number i want you to come on the show with me
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:35.840]  tomorrow for 30 minutes because the question of how do we influence college is more how are we more
[3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:41.760]  aggressive how do we stand up against this that is a microcosm for taking the whole world back but
[3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:47.280]  you get a bunch of followers there at the school and they believe by following the
[3:23:47.280 --> 3:23:53.520]  directives of the of the campus controllers they're in the powerful group you've got to explain
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:58.800]  they're the oppressors and that they're the group that's actually failing but it doesn't
[3:23:58.800 --> 3:24:03.760]  matter that's why there's always lots of followers and not a lot of leaders just because you're in
[3:24:03.760 --> 3:24:10.320]  the middle of this pressure cooker and most of these people are against you well most people
[3:24:10.320 --> 3:24:16.080]  you know end up not being successful and so don't look at being part of the group as success
[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:21.040]  look at being an individual as success promoting what has value listen
[3:24:22.240 --> 3:24:28.320]  i got on there 26 years ago and i fundamentally believed in what i was promoting from historical
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:32.880]  perspectives i wasn't trying to be a big leader in it i just believe that if i promoted freedom
[3:24:32.880 --> 3:24:40.880]  and be successful it was so we're promoting things that are powerful and organic and so
[3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:46.080]  fundamentally they may have the establishment and censorship on their side because what they're
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:53.120]  doing is unnatural we have truth and justice and the organic power on our side and if we just it's
[3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:58.880]  not an arrogance it's a confidence of you're in a war you're in a fight you might as well be confident
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:03.440]  about it like if you're in a war politically you just walk up stab somebody in the neck i'm not
[3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:07.040]  saying do that i'm saying as an allegory i'm going to try to go up and kill somebody with a knife
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:11.520]  i'm going to go up and really try to do it i'm going to kill him by the way i'm not going to stab
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:15.600]  him like it's a pretend or i'm going to shoot somebody to defend myself i'm not going to pretend
[3:25:15.600 --> 3:25:19.440]  i'm going to shoot him right in the chest or right in the face i'm going to do it well politically
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:24.320]  you've got to be the same way you have to execute at the point you have to believe it know it know
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:30.160]  you're in the right and then will it and you do that but you have to be ready to be a leader
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:33.840]  and i know you don't want to be a leader because you innately have leadership it's why you're already
[3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:39.360]  awake you already love god you love justice you know the truth and so you're not trying to lead
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:44.320]  you see all these others wanting to lead their followers the leader doesn't want to lead they're
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:49.920]  forced to lead because they can't let the cancer grow i appreciate your call get brayden's number
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:53.920]  let's get brayden on tomorrow that's a larger discussion mike adams has taken over
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:58.880]  very soon natural news dot com adam in canada last caller before mike adams takes over what's
[3:25:58.880 --> 3:26:04.400]  your question or comment it's so it's so true you just said i got a minute so i blog about the
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:11.120]  specific psychosis to the left at tower of babel dot ta from the point of view of an insider growing
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:17.280]  up in the family that basically brought socialism to canada my grandfather founded the ccf here and
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:22.640]  my father built the ndp in ontario i grew up knowing these people to be fabian communists
[3:26:22.640 --> 3:26:28.160]  the new fabian doctrine is to hollow out any specific structure and construct their utopia
[3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:32.960]  and by the way i was probably mentally last caller is great you two should come on together
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:38.640]  for 30 minutes both of you tomorrow because because what you're saying these last two callers
[3:26:38.640 --> 3:26:44.080]  is so key to understanding it please continue if you check out my blog tower of babel dot c a i
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:49.760]  talk about this is a fabian communist conspiracy these people are bolsheviks they can feel oh they're
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:26:55.680]  absolutely part of a cult they admit they're following a global government you said a communist
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:00.400]  tower of babel that's it they they've always been trying to build this thing where no one can
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:07.280]  communicate but them and by confusion they believe they rule instead of by clarity all of us come
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:13.600]  together they keep claiming they're the collectivists they're not clarity is a vision so pure everyone
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:21.280]  joins it by free will that's godlike collectivism their thing is just is division and total confusion
[3:27:21.280 --> 3:27:27.040]  and then they in the darkness direct us to their collective which is hell on earth that makes sense
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:34.400]  yes and their clinical psychosis it's a clinical psychosis to believe your dna controls you and
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:39.040]  if you don't believe in god then you don't believe the magna carter has any legal value you said it
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:44.320]  again the dna is only a resonance system to communicate with god and our past ancestors you
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:49.520]  done it go you listen no bs it's all coming together everything we do it's all happening right now

[3:31:11.600 --> 3:31:16.960]  of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the democrats save the second amendment
[3:31:16.960 --> 3:31:21.360]  defend the first amendment infowarstore.com and it looks like duct tape but it's just a regular

[3:31:25.520 --> 3:31:29.360]  even disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well we're
[3:31:29.360 --> 3:31:33.520]  being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and and dr pacinic i'm let me just ask
[3:31:33.520 --> 3:31:38.960]  you what you think because i've not launched this yet it's brilliant you've taken the very element
[3:31:38.960 --> 3:31:44.880]  that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound
[3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:53.680]  of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence silence silence across the western
[3:31:53.680 --> 3:32:02.160]  world from high school to college sports to even the olympics men biological men are winning almost
[3:32:02.160 --> 3:32:09.200]  all of the sporting events this is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:15.040]  rights away all in the name of the liberalism and openness and then every day i have stacks of news
[3:32:15.040 --> 3:32:21.840]  articles just like today uk team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender
[3:32:21.840 --> 3:32:28.400]  and it hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:36.400]  thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty that's the thought
[3:32:36.400 --> 3:32:42.480]  police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason you get fined and you go to jail this
[3:32:42.480 --> 3:32:48.000]  is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:58.000]  anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:58.000 --> 3:33:20.400]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones and now your host mike adams
[3:33:22.320 --> 3:33:26.640]  all right i've got major updates for you here breaking news on the coronavirus coming in just
[3:33:26.640 --> 3:33:32.160]  a few minutes but first just comments on the callers just fantastic callers in the previous
[3:33:32.160 --> 3:33:36.640]  segment with alex i'm glad alex said that he's going to have those two individuals on tomorrow
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:42.000]  and his whole new format idea about a like a podcast commercial free type of conversations
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:49.280]  with callers i think that's fantastic it's uh it's genius old school uh breakthrough format
[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:54.080]  it's it's it's really genius i hope he gets that going soon uh i might like to participate in that
[3:33:54.080 --> 3:34:00.320]  as well it's a great idea but first about katlyn bennett and what happened yesterday it's just
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:08.080]  astonishing the rabid lunatic left has now completed their transformation into a violent mob
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:15.840]  of mindless just completely insane zombies screaming hatred and death upon all conservatives
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:22.400]  and i have to say this free speech issue is now the civil rights issue of our time
[3:34:22.400 --> 3:34:30.560]  this is the civil rights fight today just as equality for african-americans was the civil
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:36.160]  rights battle of the 1960s and the 70s and the 80s today it's free speech for all people but
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:41.440]  especially conservatives whether they be be black or white or asian or latino conservatives are
[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:48.480]  being hunted and hounded and mobbed by violent lunatics and yesterday in fact katlyn katlyn
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:56.000]  bennett or i think it was two days ago she had a uh rosa parks moment and this is the the civil
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:35:02.480]  rights fight of our time and we are up against this violent lunatic mob that is encouraged by
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:08.960]  twitter so twitter has become the hate hub of the radical left and if you don't have enough left
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:13.120]  wing hate then you're not allowed on twitter if you're a conservative or if you're a trump
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:18.240]  supporter if you love america you love the constitution or you have any words of criticism
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:26.800]  towards transgenders or the the pedophilia the the child abuse a drag queen story hour of the left
[3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:31.840]  then you are banned off of twitter so twitter has become more and more by this selective banning
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:37.920]  it has become a hate hub for the radical left who have completely lost their minds they are insane
[3:35:38.480 --> 3:35:45.760]  and i repeat my call right now the president of the united states should either demand that twitter
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:52.400]  allow total free speech for all people all ideas all political philosophies or twitter should be
[3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:57.760]  seized and shut down twitter should be ended and taken offline if they are going to contribute to
[3:35:57.760 --> 3:36:03.440]  this lunatic mob this radical left-wing hatred that's going to get people killed because let's be
[3:36:03.440 --> 3:36:10.080]  honest katlyn bennett was trapped in a kill zone that was a kill zone they created around her vehicle
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:14.640]  and her security personnel there that was a kill zone they did not want her to leave
[3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:21.360]  they wanted to trap her and they physically trapped her and she had every reason to fear for her life
[3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:28.320]  and her personal safety in that context it was a lunatic violent mob that was already attacking
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:35.520]  her vehicle katlyn bennett would have been correct to order her security team to deploy
[3:36:35.520 --> 3:36:43.280]  tactical defensive tools and weapons to escape that kill zone by any means necessary in her
[3:36:43.280 --> 3:36:50.240]  own self-defense whether that meant driving out of there or or uh using self-defense weapons i'll
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:56.560]  just say it that way to to stop violence to stop the lunatic mob she was being assaulted and they
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:01.680]  are trying to drive somebody to the point of shooting one day they want a shooting they want
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:07.440]  to see a bunch of lunatic leftists shot and blood running in the streets because somebody decided
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:12.320]  to defend their lives against this lunatic mob this is what they wanted to come to and they were
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:18.000]  trying to invoke that with katlyn bennett but these universities have become nothing but hate
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:24.240]  indoctrination hubs and it is insane that we have arrived at this moment in america where
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:31.920]  a woman a woman going to a university to ask innocent questions on presidents day is threatened
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:38.080]  and hounded by a lunatic violent left-wing mob and the media celebrates it because the media is
[3:37:38.080 --> 3:37:45.040]  part of this mob and this is why ultimately when it comes to a civil war do not hesitate to defend
[3:37:45.040 --> 3:37:52.160]  america do not hesitate you are not dealing with rational intelligent informed human beings anymore
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:59.040]  on the left their rationality is gone they are totally insane they are violent lunatic emotional
[3:37:59.040 --> 3:38:05.840]  mobs and the media is contributing to this and even begging for this kind of behavior to continue
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:12.960]  the media is part of the problem the mainstream media is the enemy of america they are in fact
[3:38:12.960 --> 3:38:18.400]  hoping for massive killings of conservatives they openly call for it they celebrate this kind of
[3:38:18.400 --> 3:38:26.160]  violence we are dealing with the civil rights issue of our time so with that said i also want to
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:33.920]  just mention alex said he's he needs a bug out plan well i've got i've got extra space at various
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:40.800]  locations in central texas if alex needs to bug out we can help him accomplish that not even at
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:47.760]  at my ranch but other locations where we have assets and we have former special forces individuals
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:54.480]  who are also going to be relocated to those locations so alex jones you have a backup bug
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:39:03.360]  out plan that you didn't even know about and it it's you'll be safe there because even a thousand
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:10.640]  lunatic left us could not get through just three or four former navy seals trust me on that point
[3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:16.640]  because i've trained with these brave men and they are incredibly gifted at what they do and we are
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:22.240]  not going to surrender to the lunatic mobs we will defend ourselves we will defend our nation
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:27.840]  we will defend our property and we will defend the rule of law in america and it sure would be nice
[3:39:27.840 --> 3:39:33.600]  if trump would do something about these assaults on people like katlyn bennett if trump would speak
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:39.520]  out against it if trump would crack down on these universities and this insane indoctrination frankly
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:44.080]  this all comes down to the communist infiltration of america the communists have taken over the
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:48.880]  universities they've taken over the media they've taken over half of of the democrats in congress
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:52.640]  they've taken over the governor ships across america and they've taken over california

[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:04.240]  nyquist as well and he knows exactly what he's talking about there's been a long-term plan in
[3:40:04.240 --> 3:40:10.800]  place to drive the youth to this level of lunatic violence this is part of the communist revolution
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:17.360]  takeover plan that has played out in countries across human history including china and venezuela

[3:40:29.280 --> 3:40:35.680]  under assault this is a war against america being waged right now it's an information war the
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:41.920]  censorship of the tech giants the lunatic left-wing propaganda of the media that is anti america that
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:47.920]  are traitors to this nation and to its people and the left-wing lunatic students at these

[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:18.720]  the sustainability of the human race you can't have a child without a mother and a father and yet
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:24.480]  the very concepts of motherhood and fatherhood are being obliterated by this radical leftist
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:30.160]  lunatic zombie mob that is out for blood and wants to literally kill every person with whom
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:36.080]  they disagree and they call themselves tolerant they're the tolerant ones really they're pro-human

[3:47:13.040 --> 3:47:20.800]  adams breaking news on the coronavirus outbreak today here on the alex jones show mike adams
[3:47:20.800 --> 3:47:24.320]  from natural news staff then for this last segment i'm going to go through this very quickly because
[3:47:24.320 --> 3:47:30.000]  we got a lot of breaking news a story i just posted a few minutes ago why are 712 potentially
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:35.760]  infected people in washington state being monitored for the coronavirus infection but not tested
[3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:40.720]  now we went to the washington state health department website and we captured the numbers
[3:47:40.720 --> 3:47:45.600]  from their page we linked to it as well it turns out there are 712 people being quote
[3:47:45.600 --> 3:47:50.640]  monitored which i'll explain in a second what that means but they've only tested 25 people in the
[3:47:50.640 --> 3:47:55.680]  entire state and out of the 25 people they found one is infected at least what they're willing to
[3:47:55.680 --> 3:48:02.320]  admit to so far those of you watching online you can see the screen from the washington state
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:08.720]  website we are not making these numbers up now these 712 people are people who have had close
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:15.120]  contact or with potentially infected people or who have traveled from china and yet the state of
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:21.200]  washington refuses to test them and in terms of them being quote monitored we found out all that
[3:48:21.200 --> 3:48:27.520]  is is the state of washington sends them an email that says what they should do if they start to show
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:37.600]  symptoms so this is grossly incompetent almost criminally liable misconduct from the state of
[3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:43.200]  washington health department that apparently does not understand how epidemiology works has no
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:49.040]  clue about virology or the transmissivity of this virus because of course this virus spreads when
[3:48:49.040 --> 3:48:54.400]  you have no symptoms and yet the state of washington is telling people you don't need to contact us
[3:48:54.400 --> 3:48:58.960]  until you have symptoms which of course could be after you've spread it to hundreds or thousands
[3:48:58.960 --> 3:49:05.040]  of people it is my belief although i can't prove this i believe that there are already two
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:10.400]  outbreaks in the united states of america one of them is taking place in seattle right now
[3:49:10.400 --> 3:49:14.640]  which is why there are hundreds of people being quote monitored you know where do those people
[3:49:14.640 --> 3:49:19.440]  come from or why are there so many 700 why are they not being tested because the state of washington
[3:49:19.440 --> 3:49:24.880]  doesn't want to report infections i call it that don't ask don't tell policy of the pandemic
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:30.240]  don't ask i.e. don't conduct tests and guess what you'll have no infections what an amazing
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:34.720]  coincidence they finally figured out the science here and then the other place where the outbreak
[3:49:34.720 --> 3:49:39.600]  is taking place in my opinion again i cannot prove it but the evidence is pointing toward
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:44.800]  this and it is hana lulu or at least the airport of hana lulu because we had yesterday
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:50.960]  hawaiian airlines and delta airlines admitting that they had carried a couple who was later
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:56.080]  infected confirmed infected they had flown them on hawaiian airlines to the city of hana lulu
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:50:01.680]  and then delta had flown them out of hana lulu to japan the key factor to understand here is that
[3:50:01.680 --> 3:50:07.600]  the husband of this couple it was an elderly couple the husband was showing symptoms on february
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:14.240]  third before they took the hawaiian airlines flight so i believe we are looking at a situation where
[3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:20.960]  something about hana lulu is spreading this infection perhaps it's the airplanes because
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:26.560]  they're not sanitized perhaps it's an infected flight attendant or an infected pilot maybe
[3:50:26.560 --> 3:50:31.680]  infected workers at the hana lulu airport we're not sure yet but the state of hawaii in a related
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:37.280]  story told a person who was trying to self-report to the state department of hawaii the state
[3:50:37.280 --> 3:50:41.600]  health department that person had been in close contact with another infected person and that
[3:50:41.600 --> 3:50:46.560]  person was asking them what should i do and in an email back to that person the the health
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:50.320]  department of the state of hawaii told them i don't do anything just go on about your day
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:50:57.520]  normally and if you start to have symptoms then let us know so this response by hawaii officials
[3:50:57.520 --> 3:51:05.280]  and washington state officials it really smacks of the communist china cover-up and the wh o response
[3:51:05.280 --> 3:51:10.080]  which is don't ask don't tell hey we're going to change the parameters of what is an infection
[3:51:10.080 --> 3:51:14.640]  we're not going to count people who have no symptoms that was china's decision a few days ago
[3:51:15.360 --> 3:51:19.280]  and so the numbers are falling now because they're not counting infected people as long as they're
[3:51:19.280 --> 3:51:25.360]  not showing symptoms so you now have this this again this almost criminal negligence cover-up
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:33.680]  taking place now in the united states of america alongside the cdc admitting days ago dr redfield
[3:51:33.680 --> 3:51:38.160]  and dr nancy mesoni a redfields the head of the cdc mesoni a is the head of a department
[3:51:38.160 --> 3:51:44.400]  both admitting that they expect community outbreaks in the united states of america why are they
[3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:49.200]  saying that in my assessment it's because they already know these outbreaks have taken place
[3:51:49.840 --> 3:51:55.520]  but they don't want to panic the american people and so they have to kind of warm people up
[3:51:55.520 --> 3:52:00.720]  to this idea slowly to say yes we're expecting outbreaks even though they probably have hundreds
[3:52:00.720 --> 3:52:05.200]  of people already confirmed in the united states that's that's my assessment currently
[3:52:05.200 --> 3:52:09.520]  but they won't admit it until they kind of roll out this narrative slowly over time
[3:52:10.080 --> 3:52:16.400]  to try to not panic people now this this whole idea of panic you want to know what really panics
[3:52:16.400 --> 3:52:21.520]  people is when the authorities lie to you and then one day you're surprised by the truth that
[3:52:21.520 --> 3:52:28.080]  causes panic telling people the truth avoids panic encouraging people to get prepared
[3:52:28.080 --> 3:52:33.840]  now while supplies are available that avoids panic we the independent media we are helping
[3:52:33.840 --> 3:52:41.440]  people to not panic get prepared learn the truth be ready do not panic but be smart about this
[3:52:42.080 --> 3:52:47.360]  it's the censorship of the tech giants and it's the lies of the mainstream media the cover-up
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:53.840]  of the governments and the the the downplayed numbers of this by the cdc and the health
[3:52:53.840 --> 3:52:58.160]  authorities in washington that's what's going to lead to panic one day because you can't cover up
[3:52:58.160 --> 3:53:03.840]  the dead bodies forever eventually people going to work are going to notice hey where's where's
[3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:08.400]  my co-worker who used to sit in that cubicle over there what is the is the state health
[3:53:08.400 --> 3:53:13.200]  department of washington going to say what co-worker there was nobody there you're imagining
[3:53:13.200 --> 3:53:18.240]  it no no one's dying no one's disappearing there are no mass graves there are no cremation ovens
[3:53:18.240 --> 3:53:22.480]  running in america no none of that is happening you're just going to be told that you must be
[3:53:22.480 --> 3:53:27.840]  imagining all these things like oh didn't you used to have three children now you only have two
[3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:31.840]  well where'd that third child go and the state of washington is going to say you didn't have a
[3:53:31.840 --> 3:53:37.680]  third child there is no coronavirus outbreak none of that is happening stop reading fake news
[3:53:37.680 --> 3:53:42.880]  they're going to say i mean how far can they take the cover up right that's the question now
[3:53:42.880 --> 3:53:50.240]  there's an even bigger issue in all this which is the economic we call the supply chain armageddon
[3:53:50.240 --> 3:53:57.600]  that's coming i know this is coming personally because we you know my my whole operation we purchase
[3:53:57.600 --> 3:54:03.360]  food supplies and various supplies we can't get a lot of things now we're being told by our commercial
[3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:11.120]  suppliers it's all gone it's all sold out and china you see the store shelves will have appliances
[3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:15.200]  and electronics and many food items and so on even vitamins most of which are made in china
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:20.400]  and pharmaceuticals 97 percent made in china we have those supplies today right now but those
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:26.240]  supplies are running out because it takes about five weeks from the factories to go across the
[3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:31.840]  ships of the ocean to get on the store shelves so there's about a five week lag time before people
[3:54:31.840 --> 3:54:36.480]  in america are going to start seeing oh my gosh i went to buy a refrigerator that's made in south
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:40.880]  korea that uses components from china there are no more refrigerators there are no more microwave
[3:54:40.880 --> 3:54:46.560]  ovens oh the electronics have collapsed the whole supply line has collapsed uh the pharmaceuticals
[3:54:46.560 --> 3:54:51.200]  are running out at my local pharmacy they can't get them why because they're made in china so for a
[3:54:51.200 --> 3:54:58.240]  while you can lie about it if you're a government you can lie but eventually people notice that supplies
[3:54:58.240 --> 3:55:02.720]  are running out where are the vitamins where are the superfoods that come out of china like
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:07.360]  wheatgrass formulations and chlorella that comes out of china and so on vitamins and amino acids
[3:55:07.360 --> 3:55:12.800]  and proteins rice protein most of that comes out of china it's going to be in very short supply very
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:18.320]  soon it's already at the commercial level we're already seeing it so then we get to the motivation
[3:55:18.320 --> 3:55:23.600]  here the state of washington the state of hawaii they depend on tourism trump doesn't want to really
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:29.360]  address this i think full force because of the stock market situation trump wants the market to
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:33.280]  to keep going high all the way through the election i get it he wants to get reelected people need
[3:55:33.280 --> 3:55:37.440]  their pension money they need the illusion that that all this money exists even when it doesn't
[3:55:37.440 --> 3:55:43.280]  that's that's trump's ploy right now or strategy but trump is wrong on this i think he's making a
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:50.880]  critical mistake the stock market is highly highly vulnerable to this pandemic and this virus could
[3:55:50.880 --> 3:55:56.000]  wake people up to the reality that that stocks are overvalued and there's going to be a wave of
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:56:01.680]  bankruptcies throughout this year because of the supply chain armageddon that's happening in china
[3:56:01.680 --> 3:56:06.480]  so eventually we're going to have to come back to reality whether it's stock valuations or real
[3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:12.560]  estate bubbles or the supply chain crises or what's happening you know with infections being covered
[3:56:12.560 --> 3:56:18.560]  up in the united states right now eventually the cover-up fails eventually the virus wins and you
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:23.760]  know why an interesting philosophical point because if you're a government you can control the narrative
[3:56:23.760 --> 3:56:29.280]  you can censor the people but you can't censor the virus isn't that interesting the virus continues
[3:56:29.280 --> 3:56:34.880]  to replicate no matter what your policies are no matter what your laws are the virus is working on
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:41.680]  cause and effect it's being grown and incubated and shared in human bodies every second of every day
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:47.840]  as we are here talking and listening right now and you can't pass a government decree that eliminates
[3:56:47.840 --> 3:56:52.560]  the virus they tried that already they tried a two-week quarantine and uhan didn't work they
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:58.240]  try to quarantine on the diamond princess didn't work and by the way the diamond princess tomorrow
[3:56:58.240 --> 3:57:03.520]  thousands of people will walk off that ship into japan and they will take commercial flights all
[3:57:03.520 --> 3:57:09.360]  around the world because the japanese quarantine will end tomorrow and yet people are being
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:15.680]  reinfected during the quarantine so as of tomorrow the world will be infected with a new wave
[3:57:16.240 --> 3:57:21.280]  of the coronavirus as people step off the diamond princess cruise ship and take commercial flights
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:26.320]  all over the world that happens tomorrow and no one seems to be concerned about this because the
[3:57:26.320 --> 3:57:31.920]  level of government incompetence and lying and cover-ups on this is epic and historic
[3:57:31.920 --> 3:57:36.320]  and dangerous and will get millions of people killed that's the summary today thanks for watching
