[00:41.320 --> 00:46.680]  September 2011 I'm Alex Jones your host we're gonna be live here for the next
[00:46.680 --> 00:51.040]  three hours today Kurt Haskell survivor of the Christmas Day underwear
[00:51.040 --> 00:55.320]  bomber attack a year and a half ago or now more than a year and a half ago we'll
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.040]  be joining us with some big breaking news in the third hour today he and his
[01:00.040 --> 01:07.360]  wife both attorneys and law survived the firecracker slash firebomb that did set
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.640]  part of the plane on fire and were eyewitnesses to what really happened
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.600]  he's now been going to the trial of Mutalib and has some incredible
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.160]  information the standby lawyers because Mutalib is fired his lawyers are saying
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.840]  that they do believe it's an inside job staged event and entrapment is going to
[01:25.840 --> 01:30.480]  be their defense but Mutalib under torture or under threats to his family
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.760]  we're not sure this is standard procedure just like McVeigh's family was
[01:34.760 --> 01:39.560]  threatened we know has said that he's gonna go ahead and and say that he did
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.320]  it and go along with it so amazing amazing information and of course it's
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.200]  a fact the US government did get him on the plane and got him his visa that is
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.000]  been admitted to in Congress in fact Haskell was on the TV show the other
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.480]  night the nightly news and he he brought up the C-span clip we should
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.320]  probably get undersecretary of state with David Kennedy you just type into
[02:03.320 --> 02:08.960]  YouTube undersecretary of state talks about underwear bomber being helped by
[02:08.960 --> 02:12.000]  US government that should pull up that YouTube for listeners that's
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.160]  particularly powerful for folks that go oh yeah right the government got him on
[02:16.160 --> 02:21.040]  the plane but it's always the same in these high-profile events they're
[02:21.040 --> 02:26.600]  always staged if there's a terror attack that's real you'll really never see it
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.800]  the media or it's a minor footnote and there are some people that go haywire and
[02:30.800 --> 02:34.760]  engage in asymmetrical attacks on the government and different governments
[02:34.760 --> 02:41.440]  throughout history but again when it's not hyped up then it's a real event they
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.480]  don't give it attention when it's stage which it is about 98% of the time you
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.040]  will see absolute instant talking points because they're targeting the lowest
[02:51.040 --> 02:54.440]  common denominator the system is targeting people they know really aren't
[02:54.440 --> 02:58.600]  paying attention what's really going on and happening now here's the deal we're
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.760]  gonna go to break here a little bit of unorthodox radio I've been doing here in
[03:02.760 --> 03:10.400]  this particular time slot 11 to 2 central since I'm in 1998 so what is that
[03:10.400 --> 03:17.160]  13 14 years in this particular time slot where instead of just having news in

[08:07.640 --> 08:11.440]  mind
[08:14.440 --> 08:22.640]  we are live it is the 22nd day of September 2011 on this Thursday
[08:22.640 --> 08:30.520]  edition the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped more than 300 points soon
[08:30.520 --> 08:35.120]  it's going to be more like 400 if it continues to drop of course the stock
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.320]  market is admittedly completely rigged and run by the private Federal Reserve
[08:38.320 --> 08:43.200]  along with the federal government that dumps in some cases billions of dollars
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.960]  a day into it to select stocks and the whole thing is an insider trading scam
[08:47.960 --> 08:52.800]  they occasionally burn some mid-level minion like Bernie Madoff to create the
[08:52.800 --> 08:58.520]  illusion that it's all about boarded as a giant casino designed to get your
[08:58.520 --> 09:04.440]  retirement designed to basically get you into a Ponzi scheme and then hold you
[09:04.440 --> 09:12.080]  hostage to the globalist of course Kurt Nemo on Monday on Monday at info wars
[09:12.080 --> 09:20.120]  calm wrote that the federal government was preparing QE3 how did he know that
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.720]  well because Burdaki promised two months ago that they would not have QE3 now
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.320]  when they do that you know that they're lying even when the truth serves them
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.280]  they lie because they're insider traders they don't want you to be ready they
[09:34.280 --> 09:37.960]  don't want you to know they want you to go make another investment so they can
[09:37.960 --> 09:41.080]  burn you just like the Goldman Sachs email show where they're calling their
[09:41.080 --> 09:48.880]  customers scum saying we're selling them total crud they used a profane word just
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.040]  amazing information and so it's all about setting you up it's all about gutting
[09:54.040 --> 09:58.320]  you it's all about bankrupting you it's all about controlling you it's pure and
[09:58.320 --> 10:04.840]  total avarice now Kurt though of course in his article wrote that the IMF and
[10:04.840 --> 10:07.960]  World Bank which are just Federal Reserve branches worldwide the same
[10:07.960 --> 10:14.120]  private cartel of less than less than six major banks and just a few families
[10:14.120 --> 10:21.360]  that they were saying yes we want you to have QE3 which again will further
[10:21.360 --> 10:25.680]  devalue the dollar that will give the major central banks and their
[10:25.680 --> 10:32.440]  shareholders more unlimited credit at below zero percent interest so they can
[10:32.440 --> 10:40.040]  loan it out to you at 20 30 40 50 60 or even 70 plus percent annual interest rate
[10:40.040 --> 10:43.880]  and so we've got all that going on and they're claiming that they're doing this
[10:43.880 --> 10:51.040]  this this this twist program that hasn't been used in more than 50 years to move
[10:51.040 --> 10:56.600]  towards issuing more long-term bonds quote is a way to get the banks to loan
[10:56.600 --> 11:02.960]  ladies and gentlemen the big banks run the federal government they run Osama
[11:02.960 --> 11:09.160]  Ben Bernanke they are following their program of musical chairs and they all
[11:09.160 --> 11:15.280]  get a seat and you don't I don't that's how this works they know when they raise
[11:15.280 --> 11:19.360]  taxes it makes our jobs move offshore they know when they put new regulations
[11:19.360 --> 11:23.320]  in that China and India and Mexico and a hundred plus other countries are exempt
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.680]  from it destroys our jobs this is a stated post industrial world its
[11:27.680 --> 11:34.600]  globalism it's designed to deindustrialize us they know exactly what
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.880]  they are doing they are cold-blooded corporates that control the government
[11:39.880 --> 11:44.720]  and who have investments in the third world and are shutting us down and in
[11:44.720 --> 11:51.120]  the process making us more dependent on them this is all premeditated and until
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.400]  that understanding is clear in everybody's mind there is no hope of
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.520]  reversing we told you that Ireland of course they said was the per capita
[11:58.520 --> 12:06.160]  fastest growing least in debt country in Europe the minute they signed on to the
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.480]  Lisbon Treaty the minute they entered the euro their entire economy was folded
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.200]  up like a tent and they were told you're now going under foreign bank ownership
[12:16.200 --> 12:19.920]  even though it's not your debt their own head of their central banks said it is
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.680]  an honor to take on the debt of the IMF and World Bank and the and the and the
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.160]  megabanks and it's good that Ireland is now run by foreign banks he actually
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.280]  said that you can look it up in the BBC all over the place head of Irish
[12:34.280 --> 12:37.360]  central bank says it's good to have if we ought to pull that back up we haven't
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.520]  showed that in months head of Irish head of Irish central bank says it's good for
[12:42.520 --> 12:48.120]  Ireland to be run by foreign banks that is a quote it was all over the Irish and
[12:48.120 --> 12:55.360]  British newspapers all over the UK newspapers the minute they signed on to
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.680]  the euro all that was was a corporate agreement to take on the debts and
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.600]  obligations of the private banks that run Europe now they keep having bailout
[13:03.600 --> 13:06.720]  after bailout claiming it's about Greece they're bailing out the quote
[13:06.720 --> 13:12.520]  derivatives they're signing on to the Ponzi scheme okay and now they've
[13:12.520 --> 13:17.200]  announced oh Bank of the World based in Europe Germany's got to raise all its
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.080]  taxes cut all their pensions by the way Germany's worked hard they're in good
[13:21.080 --> 13:27.120]  financial stead to fund the establishment of a private financial union
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.800]  which has been called by many European newspapers a private financial
[13:31.800 --> 13:36.640]  dictatorship that is exactly what it is and I listen to Bloomberg and watch
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.520]  CNBC and they say the only obstacle to our global governance is the Germans and
[13:41.520 --> 13:44.760]  the fact that they can vote Merkel in the last two elections is almost lost
[13:44.760 --> 13:48.160]  control she's got a few seats left in the parliament and then she will be
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.480]  removed we and then they have bankers on to go it doesn't matter it's the only
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.920]  course we'll get it one way or the other we'll just bring it up forward again and
[13:55.920 --> 13:59.640]  again Germany doesn't have a choice their entire financial system will implode
[13:59.640 --> 14:04.160]  unless they bail this out and that's the trap and you bail it out again and give
[14:04.160 --> 14:10.160]  up more sovereignty more liberty and it gets worse same thing here you notice
[14:10.160 --> 14:17.360]  ladies and gentlemen the minute he announced the QE3 the plunging began and
[14:17.360 --> 14:20.640]  they love that they'll drive the market down more and then the globalists will
[14:20.640 --> 14:25.600]  come in knowing what is the bottom and buy up again and do it over and over and
[14:25.600 --> 14:30.240]  over and over and over and over and I got emails and got calls a couple months
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.080]  ago and I said you watch they'll be QE3 and they said Alex he's not going to
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.760]  say there's not gonna be QE3 and then and then double back Bob Chapman said no
[14:38.760 --> 14:43.080]  you're right Jones they're just not gonna call it QE3 that's exactly what
[14:43.080 --> 14:49.520]  they're doing now again it's all about deceiving you it's all about saying oh
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.840]  please walk right through welcome to dinner and sticking your leg out to
[14:52.840 --> 15:00.640]  trip you it's so funny to them it's all it's so much fun and they're disdain for
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.520]  you they're hatred for you I was thinking about in fact I want to open the
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.200]  phones up on all these issues I was thinking about this little tidbit and
[15:09.200 --> 15:15.320]  finally it broke all over the media yesterday saying the Orwellian policies
[15:15.320 --> 15:21.800]  of on star let me just not even sit there and make a claim of a quote let me
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.800]  actually just pull it up for you here I've got a whole whole stack of these
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.480]  from last night that we covered on the nightly news here it is on star begins
[15:33.480 --> 15:39.520]  spying on customers GPS location for profit here's another one new on star
[15:39.520 --> 15:45.120]  privacy policy expands on data sharing that's a nice way to describe spying

[15:51.920 --> 15:58.760]  the register GM on star cars will upload all data unless users opt out actually

[16:01.280 --> 16:05.560]  remove the cell phone tracker box it's coming your car will rat on you to
[16:05.560 --> 16:15.840]  insurers okay there it all is okay now here's the actual on star policy we have
[16:15.840 --> 16:19.760]  it linked in the articles at info wars calm and prison planet calm now I told
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.960]  you 12 years ago I was contacted by an engineer that worked on this and they
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.440]  said listen the government dials in it's a cell phone they're listening they're
[16:27.440 --> 16:33.200]  tracking the data is being sold I warned people years later it came out the FBI

[17:53.400 --> 17:58.240]  this is there to gauge and track all human activities and feed it into giant
[17:58.240 --> 18:05.640]  algorithms that can predict mass movement activities within 99% accuracy
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.400]  that's what they admit in the MIT algorithms off the Google snoop system
[18:10.400 --> 18:18.560]  they can track individual decisions 93% of the time before you've even
[18:18.560 --> 18:21.680]  consciously thought of what you're going to do they know what movies you're
[18:21.680 --> 18:25.880]  going to see they know they're reading your email when you have a gmail account
[18:25.880 --> 18:30.200]  that's admitted all these services it's not a person doing it it's computers

[18:54.400 --> 18:58.520]  many of the experts I've talked to off record believe that artificial
[18:58.520 --> 19:03.080]  intelligence has probably already been achieved and that most engineers even
[19:03.080 --> 19:06.680]  top engineers do not understand one-tenth of the systems they're building
[19:06.680 --> 19:10.840]  integration that it's now AI supercomputers well this has got the NSA
[19:10.840 --> 19:15.520]  systems pinging right now that it's that it's already self-aware AI

[24:12.920 --> 24:21.680]  robotic drones carrying do you head of state decapitation weapons it is
[24:21.680 --> 24:26.680]  admitted that upwards of 90% of the NASA US space program is classified and
[24:26.680 --> 24:31.640]  military never forget this stuff is hidden in plain view it is admitted that
[24:31.640 --> 24:37.480]  the SR 71 blackbird in service in the mid 50s they're still claiming as the
[24:37.480 --> 24:43.640]  fastest aircraft they have it is admitted that the b2 bomber was in
[24:43.640 --> 24:48.360]  service 20 years before it was announced in the late 1980s and developed
[24:48.360 --> 24:54.400]  decades before that my father growing up as a young boy saw what appeared to be
[24:54.400 --> 25:01.920]  b2 style bombers flying around in northeast Texas now continuing so so
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.760]  there's this whole other world going on that's why the system is on such a
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.200]  power trip that's why they think of you as an animal it's why they don't care
[25:10.200 --> 25:14.120]  anymore that we're even aware of the fact they're putting cancer viruses in
[25:14.120 --> 25:22.360]  the vaccine they're playing God there's a breakaway civilization built with the
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.920]  hundreds and hundreds of trillions of dollars stole that has been stolen from
[25:26.920 --> 25:31.840]  Western taxpayers to build the scientific dictatorship we're going to be
[25:31.840 --> 25:35.120]  filing more and more detailed reports on this on the radio show and on the
[25:35.120 --> 25:42.560]  nightly news now here is the big news document cam police or prison planet
[25:42.560 --> 25:51.400]  TV viewers a future for drones automated killing now again this has been
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.480]  going on for at least two decades with the automated killing these are
[25:54.480 --> 26:00.880]  completely automated pre-programmed with no human activity and the final phase
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.280]  is being worked on who have robot repair shops on aircraft carriers mobile
[26:06.280 --> 26:11.800]  factories they can build and set up where humans have to upkeep the systems
[26:11.800 --> 26:16.840]  but then the robots will take care of the drones and then robots will fully
[26:16.840 --> 26:22.240]  pilot and control the drones themselves now why is this so central because
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.480]  they're already using 30-year-old combat swords in Iraq in Afghanistan combat
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.760]  killer robots the classified stuff and I've talked to Marine Corps officers
[26:31.760 --> 26:35.120]  and others who've given me what they can just like Bob Bowman former head of
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.680]  Star Wars has given me what he can stuff that's up in orbit they have got killer
[26:39.680 --> 26:45.920]  robots right out of the movies right out of Terminator right out of it and
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.960]  reportedly they've even got them with the skill skull faces to freak people out
[26:49.960 --> 26:55.040]  as a psychological warfare development but mainly they're tracked vehicles and
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.240]  multi-legged vehicles there's not two-legged ones
[26:59.480 --> 27:05.240]  God help us ladies and gentlemen they've got declassified many tanks that look
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.280]  like something out of a science fiction movie bristling with guns on them they've
[27:09.280 --> 27:15.080]  got it all and this is all designed by the globalist to target the individual
[27:15.080 --> 27:19.320]  to target the nation to target the Congress to target the governors to
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.720]  target humanity the chemicals the biologicals the drugging of the food and
[27:23.720 --> 27:30.520]  water the poisoning it's a full spectrum dominance system okay all of us are
[27:30.520 --> 27:34.240]  under attack every member of the military every police officer everybody
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.680]  that serves this in a compartmentalized fashion every bureaucrat there is no way
[27:38.680 --> 27:43.000]  to make a deal with this it's in game is shut up the global control grid it's
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.520]  growing the tentacles it's growing the cage right now once the cage is in
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.600]  place the globalists have stated they will begin to release the mega death
[27:51.600 --> 27:57.280]  bio weapons we've got to stop it before it gets to that and exposure of this
[27:57.280 --> 28:01.960]  program is not enough this is not science fiction here's Washington Post I
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.280]  told you that by 2012 because the Pentagon said this five years ago they
[28:06.280 --> 28:11.800]  would begin to announce this to the public one afternoon last fall at Fort
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.760]  Benning Georgia two model-sized planes took off climbed 800 and a thousand feet
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.520]  began crisscrossing the military base in search of an orange green and blue tarp
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.360]  the automated unpiloted planes worked on their own with no human guidance no
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.440]  hand or any control for 20 minutes one of the aircraft carrying computer process
[28:29.440 --> 28:33.640]  images from the onboard camera zeroed in on the tarp and contacted the second
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.040]  plane which flew nearby and used its own sensors to examine the colorful object
[28:38.040 --> 28:43.320]  and they did the simulated airstrike now you're like oh those are a little craft
[28:43.320 --> 28:47.560]  they do it scale down on little cheaper craft so there's not accidents the
[28:47.560 --> 28:52.040]  people notice and so it's cheaper to then upgrade once it's been tested just
[28:52.040 --> 28:56.320]  like in an air tunnel up to the next level of medium drone then high-powered
[28:56.320 --> 29:02.760]  drone and I've learned from police contacts and I brought it up to the
[29:02.760 --> 29:06.320]  Austin police chief when he was in here with his aid to camp and the other guy
[29:06.320 --> 29:12.920]  said oh you're right and and and our day survey to say I'm here to talk before
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.960]  they came in actually the little nice guy jolly fed act went away and he he
[29:17.960 --> 29:21.200]  looked at his arm and said I'm the one doing the talking here don't talk the
[29:21.200 --> 29:24.760]  guy was like oh yes sir and I was like oh he got those laser couplers those big
[29:24.760 --> 29:30.240]  trucks you you're you're you're jacking into federal surveillance grids the guys
[29:30.240 --> 29:35.400]  like yeah we are yeah and the police he's like be quiet he said yeah this is an
[29:35.400 --> 29:39.200]  operative he's like my god you're letting an American Patriot know what our
[29:39.200 --> 29:44.840]  op is well you're under attack as well no matter what you think you've bought

[33:35.880 --> 33:43.040]  matrix is from a 1970s document that was declassified in 2000 we covered it I
[33:43.040 --> 33:48.240]  put it in my book to send into tyranny where they said that their goal by 2025
[33:48.240 --> 33:53.040]  was to have everyone with a brain chip wired into a central tracking system
[33:53.040 --> 33:57.960]  through the internet that DARPA and the Pentagon invented and they said that
[33:57.960 --> 34:03.280]  finally they would try to insert everyone into energy tanks and that we would
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.160]  all become virtual creatures living in pods and so you see movies like the
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.120]  matrix whether they're going to be successful with this or not that is
[34:12.120 --> 34:17.040]  actually their plan and of course that's pretty much what they tell their mid
[34:17.040 --> 34:26.080]  level people they plan to just kill everybody and perhaps store the intellect
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.160]  and the essence of some of their favorite minions in the matrix you've got
[34:31.160 --> 34:34.560]  to Ray Kurzweil running around as their high priest right now selling
[34:34.560 --> 34:40.200]  transhumanism that's really neo eugenics these are all the false sub level
[34:40.200 --> 34:45.720]  religions for the people that are truly uninitiated in the final equation this
[34:45.720 --> 34:52.640]  is a death cult a scientific technocratic death cult now continuing a
[34:52.640 --> 34:57.400]  future for drones automated killing and I want to show you this headline by Peter
[34:57.400 --> 35:05.400]  Finn and the Pentagon said back in 2002 that by 2012 they wanted half of their
[35:05.400 --> 35:10.920]  ground vehicles their attack vehicles and at least half of their aircraft to
[35:10.920 --> 35:16.120]  be fully drone fully automated including even many of the troop transport
[35:16.120 --> 35:22.960]  aircraft and obviously in several states now like Arizona they've passed laws
[35:22.960 --> 35:28.120]  allowing Google vehicles trucks to be on the roads and they've been in all sorts
[35:28.120 --> 35:32.000]  of wrecks and Google has covered all that up and been caught lying about it
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.720]  that just happened a few weeks ago another big wreck and the system is
[35:36.720 --> 35:40.000]  going to get behind it and allow it and then they're going to say well the
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.880]  machines the computers it shows are much safer statistically and it's going to
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.800]  cut down on deaths on the road so you're not allowed to drive and they're
[35:49.800 --> 35:53.240]  going to phase it in Toyota and others have talked about this with MIT a few
[35:53.240 --> 35:59.040]  years ago with it first the computer will when you're 16 not let you drive and
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.840]  track what you're doing and take control and tell you you're making mistakes and
[36:02.840 --> 36:05.960]  also report on you to the police department and that's been announced by
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.160]  Toyota they're they're pioneering it and then they'll just completely phase all
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.480]  of that out it's all about being bossed at by the technocratic computers
[36:14.480 --> 36:18.960]  mean all the drones are flying overhead the big derogable surveilling ground
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.080]  penetrating radar scanning your houses local police through threat fusion
[36:23.080 --> 36:26.520]  centers dialing into your phone line dialing into your cell phone anytime
[36:26.520 --> 36:30.600]  they like 95% or more of the cops don't know this but over time they'll all be
[36:30.600 --> 36:34.320]  brought in to be told it as the public is now being told oh yeah on stars
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.200]  listening to you and tracking everything you're doing oh yeah Google's doing and
[36:37.200 --> 36:40.040]  all yeah there's cameras inside the restrooms and public schools and
[36:40.040 --> 36:43.240]  colleges and rest stops it's all for your safety oh yes but we can't stop those
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.360]  drug cartels because we're shipping the drugs in and the guns out so this is the
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.480]  system it's all about dehumanization or affecting all the crops with GMO even the
[36:53.480 --> 36:57.400]  crops that aren't GMO are being infected by it big companies like Monsanto
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.440]  admits that's their program their plan they've got thousands of species being
[37:01.440 --> 37:05.060]  crossed together all sorts of new mutagenic viruses and bacteria being
[37:05.060 --> 37:10.000]  released UN has been caught dozens and dozens of times the last year injecting
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.080]  people with syphilis polio hemorrhagic fever every other nightmare you can
[37:15.080 --> 37:21.240]  imagine murdering people worldwide just ongoing death massive deaths illnesses
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.920]  autoimmune diseases exploding here in the West Gardasil accounts for 24% of all
[37:26.920 --> 37:32.040]  adverse reactions that are reported for all vaccines combined and they just run
[37:32.040 --> 37:35.600]  a hoax and get on TV and say not one person's been sick from this despite the
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.000]  fact there's thousands of newscasts admitting the carnage just don't know
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.160]  no one's been sick and Dr. Wakefield's been discredited and blah blah blah none
[37:43.160 --> 37:48.360]  of it's true WMD's when I rack Obama's not gonna raise taxes he's raised scores
[37:48.360 --> 37:53.560]  of different taxes it's just just all a total culture of lies trying to
[37:53.560 --> 37:59.320]  overthrow reality until you just give up there's another path though from just
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.840]  giving up you can get angry and if you are listening to my voice ladies and
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.280]  gentlemen you are the resistance make no mistake the federal government of
[38:08.280 --> 38:11.160]  course more than a decade ago announced and they're now giving seniors
[38:11.160 --> 38:17.720]  discounts if they live in communities from Illinois to Florida to Texas where
[38:17.720 --> 38:22.920]  everything in the refrigerator is AI surveilled the people opt in to have
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.680]  elder services monitoring them this will soon be the nanny state law your
[38:27.680 --> 38:31.320]  children will be taken if they're overweight at any level that's all now
[38:31.320 --> 38:35.760]  being announced just total hell being released all under federal
[38:35.760 --> 38:41.000]  international regulations all appliances all curly-q general electric light
[38:41.000 --> 38:49.360]  bulbs by law have tracker chips in the backs of them so that data over power
[38:49.360 --> 38:54.880]  can go in and access through the plug through the chip in the machine and
[38:54.880 --> 38:58.200]  track everything you're doing that's all being announced they pass that on in
[38:58.200 --> 39:01.760]  cost cell phones tracking everything on-star tracking everything total
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.000]  criminal takeover just absolute total surveillance end of bill of rights end of
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.560]  everything poison being put in all the major food lines water radioactive isotopes
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.040]  attacking you and your family and I'm supposed to sit here I'm supposed to sit
[39:15.040 --> 39:19.720]  here and get off on Barack Obama imploding who he was designed to implode
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.720]  an ugly disgusting demonic puppet meant to destroy hope and change meant to
[39:24.720 --> 39:27.960]  make you think he was going to bring you hope and then see the person of hope
[39:27.960 --> 39:32.000]  destroyed in front of you they rise him up as the image of hope and then
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.800]  destroy hope in front of you so that you have no hope understand that that is in
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.520]  a victory this is going along with their event I don't like Barack Obama but
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.080]  this was all designed to happen they're either going to stage terror attacks and
[39:47.080 --> 39:51.440]  make him king or they could try to assassinate him and turn him into a
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.160]  martyr that way or they'll flush him down the political toilet and give you a
[39:55.160 --> 40:02.080]  Rick Perry or a Mitt Romney and keep their program rolling and all these
[40:02.080 --> 40:05.280]  conservatives that have been upset about the imploding economy and the New World
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.240]  Order and all the rest of it a lot of them are going to roll over once they
[40:09.240 --> 40:12.840]  get a Mitt Romney or Rick Perry in because they'll have the Democrats attacking
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.160]  them and they'll get fooled by that well the Democrats I know were bad so if
[40:17.160 --> 40:22.160]  they're attacking Mitt Romney he must be good simple good cop bad cop hardler
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.600]  tricks one of the oldest roadside carriage jacking coach jacking and then
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.520]  later carjacking systems is to have a woman broke down on the side of the
[40:32.520 --> 40:39.960]  road and you pull over and her husband walks over she acts like she's estranged
[40:39.960 --> 40:44.600]  and then she jumps in the car with you and you let her in she pulls a gun on
[40:44.600 --> 40:51.280]  you and that's all that is oh look Obama's being attacked by the Republicans
[40:51.280 --> 40:56.360]  Democrats he must be good even though he's nailing us to the wall oh look
[40:56.360 --> 41:00.680]  Mitt Romney's being attacked by the Democrats he must be good elementary
[41:00.680 --> 41:08.680]  mind games elementary and if you can't see through those you don't have a hope
[41:08.680 --> 41:13.640]  or a prayer but by waking up and by admitting how sick it is and taking on
[41:13.640 --> 41:19.400]  the reality the full burning and disgusting reality you guys pull up
[41:19.400 --> 41:25.320]  Patrick Henry quote Patrick Henry quote as for me I will know the whole truth
[41:25.320 --> 41:30.840]  to make preparation for it just Patrick Henry quote I will know the whole truth
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.920]  and make preparation for it that should pull up the full quote you see the
[41:34.920 --> 41:40.040]  truth's already right there even if you refuse to admit it's there you can
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.600]  delusionally walk out on the top of 50 story hotel and climb to the top and
[41:44.600 --> 41:47.960]  jump off and say I'm a bird I'm a bird but if you don't have a parachute you're
[41:47.960 --> 41:55.720]  dead when you hit the bottom you're dead deader than a doornail
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.040]  so see that reality is there that 50 story drop is there even if you're on
[42:02.040 --> 42:11.200]  PCP and not knowing reality and are like I'm a skylark I'm a butterfly is this
[42:11.200 --> 42:17.240]  the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty are we
[42:17.240 --> 42:22.560]  disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes seen on and having ears
[42:22.560 --> 42:27.920]  hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.320]  part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost I am willing to know the whole
[42:32.320 --> 42:37.360]  truth to know the worst and to provide for it be a favor that's the gimme
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.680]  liberty or gimme death speech we print that little a little jewel that little
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.360]  succulent jewel of awakening and rebellion against air and a farming you
[42:46.360 --> 42:51.280]  see I understand the scientific dictatorship I read the declassified
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.320]  white papers by the hundreds over the years they tell us what they're going
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.840]  to do last night I showed Rockefeller Foundation in 68 and 66 saying we've got
[43:00.840 --> 43:05.560]  we've started to develop sterilence to be added to the vaccines and I have the
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.280]  report from from 85 we've made great steds we've made great accomplishments
[43:10.280 --> 43:17.000]  time to roll it out in the public I'm willing to go to the Rockefeller
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.160]  Foundation documents at the UT library I'm willing to read what they say they're
[43:22.160 --> 43:28.200]  doing to me I'm willing to put my name my body my family up against these people
[43:28.200 --> 43:32.960]  because there's no future if we don't beat them this is not a fight you choose
[43:32.960 --> 43:37.880]  or don't choose to join you either lay down and say I'm gonna be delusional and
[43:37.880 --> 43:43.960]  serve evil and decide not to see this or you commit to fight it
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.800]  everybody's got a sixth sense everybody's got a gut and everybody I talked to
[43:48.800 --> 43:55.080]  for years has been completely freaked out and just feeling dread and the
[43:55.080 --> 43:58.080]  globalist are masters they know you're already having that feeling your
[43:58.080 --> 44:02.120]  subconscious mind a thousand times more powerful than the conscious knows all the
[44:02.120 --> 44:07.200]  truth sees it all sees how fake it all is your conscious mind has decided to lie
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.760]  to you because you're scared you're acting like a child in denial a woman
[44:11.760 --> 44:15.840]  who just faints in the face of something so ugly a man who faints
[44:15.840 --> 44:21.240]  you're psychologically fainting that won't get you out of the jam and the
[44:21.240 --> 44:23.640]  globalists know you're afraid so they say you know why you're having that
[44:23.640 --> 44:30.200]  anxiety this man with a turban and people are yeah man I'm scared of him but
[44:30.200 --> 44:35.200]  deep down you know that's not who I'm scared of that's not who makes my heart
[44:35.200 --> 44:40.440]  go pitter-patter it's the evil your mind is so powerful it's scanning the
[44:40.440 --> 44:44.000]  poison your olfactory nerve when you drink that tap water and it and that
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.320]  taste and rolls over your taste buds your your subconscious is like what are
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.880]  you doing don't do it
[44:55.080 --> 44:59.200]  remember as a child drinking Dallas tap water and tasted like kerosene and
[44:59.200 --> 45:01.600]  remember how to make me get a headache and how when I brush my teeth with floor
[45:01.600 --> 45:04.480]  how to get a headache and lay on the couch and I'd never heard floor I was
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.280]  bad and I knew and one of my parents is saying is there some kind of other
[45:08.280 --> 45:14.480]  toothpaste it makes me sick just like when I was five six years old it was
[45:14.480 --> 45:17.320]  carbon monoxide all over the road because they didn't have catalytic
[45:17.320 --> 45:21.160]  converters yet I'd get sick driving into Dallas I'd say I don't want to go into
[45:21.160 --> 45:25.160]  Dallas I don't want to be in traffic I don't want you know to drive into to
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.600]  work with dad today you know because it was a holiday or something I don't want
[45:28.600 --> 45:32.120]  to breathe all that I didn't know what carbon monoxide was I just knew five six
[45:32.120 --> 45:37.080]  seven years old I got sick driving into work we lived outside Dallas on the
[45:37.080 --> 45:43.440]  edge of Dallas we drive into Dallas I mean come on folks you can taste food
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.280]  when it's rotten can't you when you drink milk and it's rotten don't you have
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.840]  any survival instincts look look I understand men that love football I
[45:51.840 --> 45:55.720]  understand people that are into things like that but but that that's a
[45:55.720 --> 46:00.960]  simulation of a tribe of an army of your men you're rooting for who are going
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.400]  out there and fighting the enemy and it punches buttons in your brain that are
[46:04.400 --> 46:11.200]  about survival it's simulated war and you know I've taken my son out he's
[46:11.200 --> 46:13.640]  really good at swimming and other sports I never spent much time with him on
[46:13.640 --> 46:18.960]  football so he's not that good at it and I watched these dads who are just
[46:18.960 --> 46:24.240]  incredibly competitive and crazed and and and and really you know into it
[46:24.240 --> 46:31.680]  competitively but almost in a sick way and they you know they go to this you
[46:31.680 --> 46:34.440]  know go to schools and things I've seen because my children are only in school
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.840]  twice a week their homeschool but then their regular school well it's like a
[46:37.840 --> 46:43.080]  homeschool slash school twice a week and and you know dads come off work on
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.600]  recess to play football and get all serious and it's like what if the dad
[46:47.600 --> 46:50.960]  was serious about knowing what's in his children's water what if they were
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.320]  serious about the legislature and using that warfare memory that warfare
[46:55.320 --> 47:01.640]  program that warfare system on real warfare in the modern battlefield not
[47:01.640 --> 47:06.480]  getting real serious about this is war this is success on this football that's
[47:06.480 --> 47:11.080]  a simulation to shunt all of your male energies often it's something that
[47:11.080 --> 47:18.160]  doesn't matter and and you see men at football games occasionally I'll go to
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.720]  one and they're they're strutting in they're sitting down and they're feeling
[47:21.720 --> 47:27.600]  manly getting there and orphans going for combat to watch simulated combat
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.080]  meanwhile there's drones flying above you meanwhile they're militarizing the
[47:31.080 --> 47:36.560]  police against you meanwhile they're they're garnering enemy databases and
[47:36.560 --> 47:39.840]  files on every man woman and child in this country meanwhile there's a
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.280]  scientific murder system set up and I've got to watch men run around like little
[47:44.280 --> 47:50.000]  children and let their children be groped and violated as prisoners so they
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.720]  can have the so-called American pastime of bringing their children into a
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.480]  football game and paying ten bucks for an iced tea or seven dollars for a hot
[48:00.480 --> 48:07.080]  dog and being ripped off while a bunch of swollen steroid human growth hormone
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.120]  heads run around and fight with each other and you teach your children that's
[48:12.120 --> 48:18.160]  who you idolize not Thomas Jefferson not George Washington not trailblazers not
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.360]  firefighters that go into burning buildings not mathematicians and you
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.760]  wonder why a hundred years ago in America trailblazers were our heroes
[48:26.760 --> 48:29.680]  scientists were our heroes and so we have the greatest scientists the most
[48:29.680 --> 48:38.320]  wealth and the highest test scores now our heroes are at best men who can put a
[48:38.320 --> 48:44.200]  ball in a basket or and again the primitive level that that goes back to
[48:44.200 --> 48:47.600]  the Greek games of who could run a marathon the best I understand being
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.720]  in athleticism and being into human exaltation in energy and then and how
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.920]  far can humans drive each other but physically is an ancient caveman system
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.840]  you know I see men constantly putting themselves into positions to feel
[49:02.840 --> 49:07.400]  physically powerful and that's important because when you produce those
[49:07.400 --> 49:11.880]  hormones with the exercise it will also develop the others associated with higher
[49:11.880 --> 49:18.960]  thinking but the real war is for the mind the real war is in understanding
[49:18.960 --> 49:25.080]  reality and reality is so much wilder the general public is in a false stunted
[49:25.080 --> 49:31.920]  shut down tiny spectrum of reality a very small Madison Avenue advertisement
[49:31.920 --> 49:38.880]  system what it is to be a woman what it is to be a man what goals are in life
[49:38.880 --> 49:45.760]  people are taught to feel unfulfilled people are taught to trust the system
[49:45.760 --> 49:54.760]  the drug ads all of it is a scientific global domination system and all
[49:54.760 --> 49:59.240]  cultures attempted to dominate every other group around them and the and the
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.560]  most popular form of total domination was total extermination in every culture
[50:03.560 --> 50:11.120]  Aztec Roman Jewish Chinese it doesn't matter Vandal
[50:11.120 --> 50:17.240]  Visigoth here's one Daily Mail War on the Red Empire how America planned for an
[50:17.240 --> 50:22.480]  attack on Britain the 1930s with bombing raids and chemical weapons the plan was
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.320]  green-lighted but then finally when he got an office Roosevelt said no but the
[50:26.320 --> 50:30.840]  U.S. war planners wanted a way to get the United States in the Department of

[50:34.920 --> 50:38.840]  Department of Defense and a plan to take over the British Empire and set up
[50:38.840 --> 50:44.520]  world government themselves that is in the Daily Mail today and yes they were
[50:44.520 --> 50:49.800]  going to nerve gas most the people in England and of course that was at a time
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.240]  when they were talking about making a deal with their Hitler which we tell
[50:54.240 --> 50:57.760]  you about an end game but the decision was made instead decide with the Fabian
[50:57.760 --> 51:03.000]  Socialist they're right back what you're about to hear are the real experiences
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.480]  of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again I
[51:07.480 --> 51:14.760]  lost 20 pounds I lost 40 pounds I lost 55 pounds I went from a size 14 to a size
[51:14.760 --> 51:19.880]  8 their secret is Ambron the revolutionary formula for women over 40
[51:19.880 --> 51:24.480]  that balances hormones naturally the leading cause of weight gain over 40
[51:24.480 --> 51:28.600]  is hormonal imbalance until you balance your hormones losing weight can be
[51:28.600 --> 51:33.440]  practically impossible but Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally so
[51:33.440 --> 51:38.000]  the weight can just fall right off even that stubborn belly fat plus Ambron
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.640]  eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging like hot flashes night sweats low

[54:32.800 --> 54:36.200]  take place in the economy Peter Schiff is going to be joining us because I want
[54:36.200 --> 54:39.520]  to get his take on the stock market plunging today but we'll continue to

[54:45.760 --> 54:50.880]  take your calls in the next hour on any of the subjects I've raised but does it
[54:50.880 --> 54:54.760]  concern you here's the headline Washington Post a future for drones
[54:54.760 --> 55:02.360]  automated killing so it's not enough to have a zit faced 20 year old 8,000 miles
[55:02.360 --> 55:06.800]  away sitting there giggling eating hot pockets and drinking drinking diet coke
[55:06.800 --> 55:11.120]  and I've seen that on the news you know dropping bombs on a whole wedding party
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.760]  to kill one person disconnected from the killing very manly well now you're
[55:16.760 --> 55:20.240]  going to be taken completely out of the equation and it's going to be automated
[55:20.240 --> 55:24.200]  and then the globalists don't need you and and their big goal is to have a big
[55:24.200 --> 55:28.720]  enough drone fleet where they can have the robots load the bio or Kim weapon
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.880]  and then deploy it against you and again the Sunshine project 12 years ago got
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.880]  declassified documents that the Marine Corps then contacted them those
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.720]  documents are posted on their archive they've since shut down due to threats
[55:41.720 --> 55:44.600]  but the website still up we need to get the former out of the Sunshine project
[55:44.600 --> 55:47.600]  on like I'm gonna have do do that that's important to the TV show and it was
[55:47.600 --> 55:51.240]  based out of Austin and it said the other Army Marine Corps are working on drone
[55:51.240 --> 55:57.040]  programs for lethal and non-lethal drones to knock out whole cities just like
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.160]  this wasn't a drill that you read the Daily Mail it's not been declassified 70
[56:03.160 --> 56:10.160]  plus years later from the mid 1930s a plan to nerve gas England and its other
[56:10.160 --> 56:16.400]  islands and take over the the Empire this is what governments do this is what
[56:16.400 --> 56:19.680]  this is what militaries do that's like in third world countries you always hear
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.480]  about the military overthrowing the government it ends up happening 100% of
[56:24.480 --> 56:30.520]  the time long enough in Asia Africa or Latin America it happens 100% of the time
[56:30.520 --> 56:34.640]  in every other system it just happens in a few decades in in third world
[56:34.640 --> 56:40.640]  countries it always happens within 200 years of any system oh except for
[56:40.640 --> 56:48.240]  America 230 plus we've got the record but it's already gone we just think the
[56:48.240 --> 56:52.040]  Republic still here by admitting it's gone we can get it back because it's not
[56:52.040 --> 56:58.040]  a living thing it's eternal it's an idea it can be resurrected but you have to
[56:58.040 --> 57:05.120]  breathe life into it and it does take the blood sweat and tears of patriots you
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.680]  don't have a future without committing and fighting this okay I want to get that
[57:08.680 --> 57:13.440]  across to people there is no decision there is a decision but it's a sick
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.040]  joke you can be delusional and decide to go along with this system or you can
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.480]  decide to research what I've said and find out it's true and then I have
[57:21.480 --> 57:25.440]  enough respect in you that you're gonna find ways to beat these people there's
[57:25.440 --> 57:30.040]  a million ways to skin a cat we're gonna hit them from every angle there's only
[57:30.040 --> 57:34.960]  a few thousand of these globalist so that's all coming up and they've got

[57:40.080 --> 57:45.360]  North Africa they put al-Qaeda in in Libya that's how dumb the globalist

[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.440]  globalist can just do whatever they want pre-program their armies that have
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.080]  some technicians that help when the robots can't fix the other robots this

[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:34.120]  that and other issues we've raised here today let's talk to Brad in Texas you're
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:40.920]  on the air hey Alex I'm my active duty military I'm just traveling through Texas
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:46.680]  right now just wanted to talk to you I recently left California at a base that
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.840]  we had protesters outside would constantly be protesting against the
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.640]  drone warfare and they really had a big push they did not like them out there
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:03.720]  all they constantly sent out emails on a regular basis trying to prepare people
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.920]  to tell them do not talk don't don't tell them anything you know point them
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.240]  towards your public relations rep and they would demonize them calling them
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.680]  terrorists for staging outside the base letting people know their opinions
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.320]  about you know drone warfare showing millions of Iraqis and Afghanistan
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:31.560]  Iraq well sir I mean I've I've seen documents where patriots have been
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:36.360]  called terrorists or even protesting the Federal Reserve but I would love to see
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.440]  those base emails if you've got them in your inbox and can send them to us that
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.240]  would be important news for folks to hear that protesters outside the base
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.760]  they were actually calling them terrorists well I didn't say so in the
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.040]  email actually I worked with the police there on base and they would constantly
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:01.120]  have riot training they would have you know big big training groups where they
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.840]  would openly talk about them being terrorists I didn't have actually any
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.760]  documents saying that they were on paper but we would constantly get emails
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:20.240]  just preparing us for the confrontation with this group called code pink and I
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.840]  think it's a fantastic thing that they were doing out there trying to raise
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.760]  awareness of yeah I don't agree with the code pink's attack on the Second
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.360]  Amendment and things but they are brave and drones are a war crime when they use
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.240]  them in built-up areas their favorite thing as a wedding or a family meaning
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.080]  and they've said it's collateral damage we'll kill 200 innocent people including
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.880]  children to quote kill one combatant because they're al-Qaeda and then
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.000]  meanwhile they're in the news today I read this headline earlier where they're
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.640]  saying they're they're they're secretly deploying London Guardian drones all
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.320]  over North Africa and as we said they would using Libya as a base for the
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.840]  drones those big airports there to fight al-Qaeda when our own government just
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.040]  gave Libya to al-Qaeda that's how dumb they think we are
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.360]  do you have any comments on that sir
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.600]  all right we lost Brad thank you Brad yeah here's the Washington Post US
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:24.920]  assembling secret drone bases in Africa Arabian Peninsula official say here's
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:32.200]  another one u.s. drone bases in Africa to focus on al-Qaeda targets in Somalia
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:42.040]  oh that's so sick everything's al-Qaeda except al-Qaeda our government isn't
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.040]  run by good people it's run by outside ruthless banks who've got a whole
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.720]  secret technological system under their control and they're getting rid of the
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.880]  last factors of human decision-making I want to hear from more military people

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.600]  states are in the process of passing or have already passed laws and the feds
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:24.480]  have already opened the way up for that as well to have Google cars driving
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:34.120]  people and products 18-wheelers buses you name it and in the MIT and Toyota
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.400]  analysis that I've I don't know read a decade ago on air T and again the last
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.520]  few years they said everyone in the car will be watched by the police department
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:49.160]  you can pull this up even in CBS news for safety via the cell phone system that's
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.920]  now being put in most cars even if you don't have on-star it's being built in
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.040]  as the new emergency system and all that data is uploaded in real time to the
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.440]  feds sent to the threat fusion centers and everything is to be remote control
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.680]  and it's already here so prepare yourself for that these cars are already on the
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.360]  road all over having wrecks crashing into people globalist don't care they're
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.080]  going to run it until it does have a higher safety standard then human driving
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.440]  and then they're going to get rid of human driving and that's all been
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.400]  announced that's all coming and of course the hood the head of the
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.560]  transportation department said we are anti-car we're going to try to shut down
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:35.680]  the use of cars unless they are robotic and this is how it's going to be phased
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.320]  in to where basically aircraft pilots will just be like a toilet attendant
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.960]  there in case there's a problem same thing with people driving buses and
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:50.080]  trains and cars it will be entirely ceremonial some of the other news that
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.440]  we have here US lawmakers will see gruesome reality of China's one-solve
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.880]  policy cyber news services reporting they're going to have congressional
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.480]  hearings about how they have forced abortions and kill babies that have
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.360]  already been born but this is all hailed by the UN Planned Parenthood and
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.320]  others and Obama has supported these policies so has of course the vice
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.000]  president and this has all been financed by the people that run our country in the
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.640]  deals that they signed back in the 1970s with the Chai comms
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:27.520]  continuing Fukushima fallout is in California rainwater and that's ABC
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.040]  news finally reporting some reality we're going to be going over some of that

[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.320]  tumble or percent Zollick world in danger zone the answer is set up the new
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.200]  bank of the world it's already been set up with SDRs but publicly have Europe
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.480]  sign over dictatorial power to it our Congress our Super Congress to sign
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.280]  dictatorial power over to it and the very bankers that have maneuvered us to
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.920]  this point all they say give us more power will fix it and then things get
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.400]  worse give us more power will fix it and then things get worse give us more
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.880]  power will fix it things get worse give us more power will fix it give us
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.960]  more power give us more power give us more power and even though you're awake
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.880]  to them they're like we know you're waking up you notice the SWAT teams and
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.040]  the drones the threat fusion centers and we're tracking people okay yes we're
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:27.360]  criminals sit down and take it and so that's how this works and those people
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.680]  just say well I'm gonna go along to get along for about 20 30 pieces of silver
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.600]  sorrow says us already in double dip ladies and gentlemen we have been in a
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.120]  depression for at least the last three and a half years another headline global
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.000]  meltdown investors dumping everything this is the big news of what's
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.120]  happening today
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.520]  we've also got these articles up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com it's
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:03.600]  also all up at drudgereport.com global meltdown and I told you as soon as they
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.880]  got the next round of bailouts in Europe this would begin it was all planned
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.640]  investors are dumping nearly everything with no solution in sight for Europe and
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.440]  new fears of global recession investors dump stocks and commodities and ran to
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:22.320]  the safety of US Treasuries themselves being mainly bought and by the private
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.200]  fellow reserve now propping up their investment.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.240]  Treasury yields as a result slipped to historic lows with a 10-year yield at
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:41.760]  1.75 percent the 30 year at 2.68 and again this is not the dollar rising this
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.600]  is it being the last bastion all the people are running what they see is the
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.720]  biggest piece of wreckage this is the command destruction model the dollar
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:58.320]  was also beneficiary of a massive fear trade since the US stock sharply lower
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.560]  on the heels of steep sell-offs and equities markets around the globe the
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.600]  worst-performing stock sectors mirrored the sell-off in global commodities
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.840]  markets with materials down 4.46 but this was a great boon our economy Obama had
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.520]  all the answers they did have the answers destroy our economy by design and
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:23.160]  energy stocks down to 4.1% copper hit by concerns of Chinese slowdown see they've
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.360]  got a global inflation happening but they're depressing the real economy
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.680]  while inflating the currency trying to balance the two in a double whammy against
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.600]  the general population only to help the mega rich and the central banks see all
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:44.160]  policies are a consolidate power in them your money's inflated but there's also a
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.600]  overall depression and so that puts the damper on prices going up that's why
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.560]  you're gonna see gold silver copper all plunge for now they'll only rock it back
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:02.520]  up if you follow this economic which is brewed gold usually a safety play was
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.880]  sold into the maelstrom as investors raised cash but see what happens then
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.760]  in the next phase is again the dollar starts to devalue and retrogrades and
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.840]  then the euro spikes it's a seesaw designed by the insiders with insider
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:24.520]  manipulation to continue to shear us down to the bone the euro also fell a
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:30.280]  recent bottom of its range and is trading in the 1.346 area an eight month
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.360]  low against the dollar but if you watch the long-term trends both are dropping
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.400]  but then they spike each other up and down against each other create the
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:46.600]  illusion of volatility but it's short-term people are finding it really
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.040]  isn't gold it isn't precious metals it's not currencies US treasuries are where
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.680]  people are flocking to at a time of extreme concern about risk because the
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.680]  United States has the globalist running it banksters running it and has the
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.000]  tens of thousands of nuclear weapons the drones everything and that's basically
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.880]  the whole hostage program as we continue to see treasuries continue to get bid up
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:15.920]  said zane brown fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbott the selling in risk assets
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.640]  picked up momentum after the feds statement Wednesday in which it
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.480]  characterized risk in the economy is significant and noted that strains and
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.880]  global financial markets on Europe could be the catalyst the overnight
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.280]  preliminary China manufacturing data showed moderating growth which again
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.960]  will start to drive down commodities because that's the big producer all in
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.120]  a managed economy working with the Chinese now I want to go to your phone
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.160]  calls I just want to remind people that right now they're telling Europe you
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.720]  will give all of your power that's left you've already given your sovereignty
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.480]  over to the euro now the euro is going to give it all to the new financial union
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.760]  they call it the United States of Europe but there's no republic there's no
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.720]  voting there's no freedom it's a bureaucracy of bankers running
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.280]  everything announcing increased taxes cutting all the benefits not to pay
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.880]  anything off it's an impossible black hole but to destroy the economies and
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.080]  now they have to have the Federal Reserve and others come out and say oh my
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.280]  gosh it's a panic to cause a panic as we said they would do last week and a
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.760]  month before that and a month before that we're now entering this zone just
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.520]  like 2008 they said blood in the streets martial law total collapse if you
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.560]  don't give the bankers unlimited trillions same thing happened total
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.760]  collapse if you don't create a super congress to decide monetary policy no
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.040]  longer does that come out of the regular house and Senate now it's a super
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.920]  congress all getting us ready for the fall and winter implosion that we
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.280]  predicted two months ago with the super congress everything is about a
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.080]  dictatorial system with all the talking heads tell us telling us they're gonna
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.400]  fix it and then you give them the dictatorship and they'll stop fear
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.280]  mongering stocks will go back up for a while and then a year or two down the
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.120]  road they'll start it again to get more power but always sliding into a deeper
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:12.000]  depression every time they want more power they plunge it even more you give
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.600]  up your liberties they let it go back up a tiny bit to a new low then a new
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.480]  plateau then they plunge it again and that's the power cycle it's very
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:29.360]  elementary let's go to another phone call here let's talk to pastor in Ohio
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:36.240]  welcome sir yeah Alex are you doing I'm doing all right good a reason I called
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.280]  you know the only time I call is if I have any information and yeah you're one
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.040]  of the fellows that gave us the documents that FEMA was recruiting
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.320]  preachers secretly to spy on their flock and tell them to go to be McCampson
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.760]  turn their guns in and a couple years after you gave us those documents it
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.640]  became mainstream news yes sir okay well first of all you're talking about the
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.280]  Bible studies and and the last time I was on here I was telling you about you
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.560]  know the different things that's happening in churches churches for the
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.720]  most part are getting people in but they're no more and coming in and they're
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.840]  turned around and leaving when they find out they can't get a handout so
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:14.240]  churches are actually losing people and losing money they're doing everything
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.800]  they can to keep them in there but people are finding out that they're
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:25.440]  being indoctrinated from the pulpit and and with shows like yours and and you
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.080]  know others like you know Steve quell and then George Norrie and and they're
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.600]  listening to people they're starting to listen you would not believe the number
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.880]  of people that listen to you just in the area that I am in and I find that out
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.680]  just through simple conversation and the next thing you know your name comes up
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.000]  and if your name doesn't come up well then I'm always one of the first ones to
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.760]  make sure it does because I'll mention it myself well I was in I was in Hot
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.080]  Springs Arkansas and probably and I wasn't out in public a lot I probably had
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.440]  about 20 people come up to me while I was there and again that's just an
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.760]  illustration of how many people are awake and listening to just this show I
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:09.120]  mean the fact is we reach a regular three million people a day or so but
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.760]  overall conservatively we reach about 10 million new people a week and that's our
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:22.240]  real mission a lot of people just brushing to us you know a few hundred
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:28.480]  times in a year or even a few times in a month but it's irrevocable information
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.960]  they get because then they never thought of it from that angle and then it all
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.800]  makes sense I can't tell you how many generals how many colonels how many ad
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.800]  executives how many doctors say nothing made sense till I heard your show well
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.840]  of course it makes sense I'm not smart I read globalist white papers pastor stay
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:52.440]  there have you finished up then we're going to go to Jason TM David Severin

[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:56.800]  and we have a right universal common law to resist this attack but 90% of it is
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:02.360]  psychological there is a war on for your mind break their conditioning become
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:08.680]  aware of the manipulation because from this tyranny there is no coming back if
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.860]  we allow these people to take over they want to give us no quarter they want
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.640]  full spectrum total dominance and that means extermination if you don't know
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.120]  history that is the norm it's just been declassified the US government planned
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.320]  to nerve gas most of England killing the population and to nerve gas the islands
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.280]  and different continents that the British controlled to take over the
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.400]  British Empire instead a deal was made to absorb the British Empire and to
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.760]  double-cross Hitler the deal had been made to overthrow Roosevelt link up with
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:49.520]  Hitler and take out the British there is a article out on this today out of the
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.440]  Daily Mail and if I have time later I want to get to that because it was here
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.600]  in my stack and now I can't find it I'll find it in a moment and it's kind of a
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.240]  whitewash but it does admit it so I think I'll you know you can go a bit more
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.200]  into that or perhaps tonight I'll talk about it on the nightly news let's go
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.640]  ahead and go back to pastor in Ohio so pastor what was the point you're gonna
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.560]  make today the point I was gonna make today like I was telling you people are
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.820]  leaving churches and they're forming their own Bible studies and they're
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:22.400]  learning more and more of the truth about the Bible you know this rapture
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.040]  theory and everything else the other thing I wanted to tell you about is this
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.760]  and I got doc I not only do I have documentation that that I got off of
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.680]  someone about this but I also got this by word of mouth face-to-face with an
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.440]  individual that that is a part of this if there are groups in I just wrote it
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:45.680]  down we said there are groups in place that once an event happens whether you
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.160]  know we get attacked again or whatever the case may be they're already in place
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:56.200]  to keep the Constitution in place but there are those who want to take it
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.360]  completely out and totally change it Obama's behind all that but it's not
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.000]  well let me stop you look it's the cover of Time Magazine Newsweek in the last
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.480]  six months time to get rid of the Constitution it's bad it caused the
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.280]  problems get rid of all the freedoms the bankers will give you money you know in
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.600]  Europe get rid of all your sovereignty will give you money again they hold you
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.840]  hostage it's why they they've been trying to take over forever and they're
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.680]  basically to that point so yes I mean we have a government and it's whore media
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:30.520]  telling us to get rid of the Constitution the founders explained that
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:37.360]  that's treason and not only that Alex that you got just for lack of a
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.760]  different way of announcing him you have the white hats and you have the black
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:48.880]  hats and the white hats are the one that are that are in the government and in
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:56.480]  in different high places and other places that are military that are making
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.480]  sure that if anything goes down you know they don't know people don't know who
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:07.040]  other people are but they are in place trying to do everything they can to keep
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.680]  things in place but I will tell you this they told them they told me that over
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:22.480]  80 plus percent of the US troops have already stated or shown in one way or
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.640]  another whether they've been on drills or whatever that they will not fire on
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:35.320]  American citizens and that has that has these black hats so called very very
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.600]  upset I know here's the problem though what they'll do is and we've seen this
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.480]  from past actions in other countries they'll commit massacres and then say
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.280]  that the Patriots did it they'll string cops up you name it and then say that
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.000]  that we did it well just like they say Ron Paul's calling for violence and I'm
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.160]  calling for violence on MSNBC with that rise in the new rights special they did
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:02.120]  and the police and military have got to be smart when this goes down and they've
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.680]  got to go investigate themselves and find out that it's going to be private
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.640]  mercenaries that are actually doing it they're going to dress up foreign
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.440]  mercenaries and others like constitutionalist and commit all manner
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:19.720]  of atrocity and that's just standard false flag deception and so we've got to
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.320]  be aware of that and people got to understand this anything else sir they
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:32.600]  are going to convert the American people and even and first and then the other
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:39.560]  people throughout the rest of the world to their way of thinking by offering new

[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.520]  Homeland Security visit they figured out who'd sent me the documents all the
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.520]  public was busy saying they were fake documents that had actual FEMA phone
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.600]  numbers about teacher flocks to turn their guns in when told to go to the
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.760]  FEMA center to take the shots it's of the Lord and a few years later they had
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.960]  different newscasts around the country with preachers saying it's of the Lord
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.280]  to go to the camp martial law is good let's do what the authorities say we're
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.720]  the government's problem the American people are bad I mean I've played that
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.320]  probably 50 times there on air and they just say it with a straight face the
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.760]  government's biggest problem is you see you're not the government now you're the
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.400]  enemy you're the slave you're the terrorist you're the bad one what are
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.240]  the army person earlier calling in about people protesting outside their drone
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:21.360]  base in America the police in there called him terrorist the MPs I've got
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:27.440]  FEMA on tape before 9-11 2000 Kansas City firemen shot the video in there with
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:31.320]  firefighters deputies and police and they were bad mouthed George Washington
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:37.040]  Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin San America's bad and and people see this
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.520]  footage and don't think it's real the government is run by hardcore criminals
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:47.440]  and they go in and teach the cops all this and if the cops wake up good you
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.880]  just get kicked out of the force or relegated to supply or something yeah
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.240]  sure they've had all the different surveys of the troops will you shoot
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.360]  at Americans and on average it's close to 80% usually that say no well you just
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.040]  get shot up with all the deadly vaccines and shipped overseas for six
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.240]  tours but the guys that say they'll shoot at Americans they're like all right
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.560]  you're an officer boom and by the way when you're out here in four years we
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:12.280]  got a police department waiting for you and a lot of these cops now we showed
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.720]  you that internal memo from DPS they said we want military we want military
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.040]  that's who we're actually only gonna hire total discrimination against the
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.560]  rest of the population specific military were sent by the Department of
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.520]  Defense Department of Defense is like here's somebody will do whatever they're
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.720]  told they'll take every shot we give them they'll confiscate every gun we tell
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.840]  them to take they're like all right they're going in a DPS trooper uniform
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:41.560]  they're fast-tracked they're in it's over and they're just forging this army of
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:50.320]  miscreants against us who who will do whatever they are told the last number
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:57.640]  we got a few years ago was 100,000 preachers and it grows exponentially it
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.080]  doubles every year and we got that three years ago I guess two and a half three
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:06.800]  years ago so it started with 10,000 and 20,000 and 40,000 and 80,000 so it's more
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:13.960]  than 100,000 preachers in America and then now you see the actual propaganda in
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.680]  the sermons and on TV Romans 13 do what government says hard times are coming
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.040]  this was all being done before the implosion of the economy all premeditated
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:29.080]  that is right out of the Soviet Union the preachers trained and the manuals go
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.960]  to the camp this is total evidence of the government getting ready during
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.640]  emergencies to have your pastor come in and say just like in red dawn you know a
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.440]  fictitious example of the Soviets taken over part of the US and who do they have
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:47.080]  they have the preacher they have the mayor all you know cowards the politicians
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:53.160]  there to keep the city in line and they come to the mayor and they say we want
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.040]  you to give us names of the families and kids we're gonna kill them the mayor
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:59.240]  goes in that little harsh and they said listen you're in the position you are
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.720]  because we want you there you want to be arrested he's like no I'll I'll I'll
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.680]  report on all the children too good that's who they are they love feds
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.320]  coming in now you tell them to go to the camp when we say they're like yes sir I
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.600]  will instead of completely freaking out it's secret police coming in we want
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.120]  you to watch your flock and report on them but it's all done in a friendly for
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:28.720]  the security of America that's always at first and later it's like it's these
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.800]  Ron Paul groups want you to target them when the time comes you tell them it's
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.880]  of the Lord to take the shots it's of the Lord to go to the camps of the Lord to
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.680]  turn their guns in and those preachers actually get off on it yes and their
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.400]  seminaries order them all these big centralized world council of churches
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.560]  Rockefeller system they all tell them what to do and if their preacher won't do
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.360]  it I know a lot of repeaters are forced into retirement then they send in the
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.440]  next ones they send them in they send in these weird husband and wife teams and
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.520]  the rest of it and they come in and it's Bella Melinda Gates is here take the
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:11.880]  shots it's of the Lord oh it's so lordly right here in Austin government
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.160]  operatives coiled up like big fat cobras just sitting up there at the front of
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.520]  the church I mean you talk about a wicked government of course this all went
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:27.480]  on under Bush so folks are like it's the Lord faith-based initiative and as soon
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.960]  as the churches go along with the evil they get the free trucks they get the
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.160]  free TVs they get the money all right now I gotta get to other news and your
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.960]  calls but pastor was bringing up some of these high-level folks he was talking
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.360]  to and they were saying the way they're gonna get the global government is
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.240]  through technology deals well that's always public see a lot of these feds
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.800]  think they've got something that's secret just because the general public
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:53.560]  doesn't know how to tie their shoes and doesn't know which end is up doesn't
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.240]  mean all the stuff you think so secret isn't actually public and white papers
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:04.200]  and in any organic intelligence operation the movements and the systems
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.120]  of the globalist reveal what's happening but beneath the service as well and
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:13.040]  because the globalist know we're so dumb down they operate in full view with
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.120]  just simple label changes on what they're doing so their entire op is
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.320]  completely transparent and nightmarish they don't even care I get on air and
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  talk about uranium being added to the water supplies then they just come out
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.160]  responding because local newscasters hear it notice this all broken Texas because
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.040]  I was pointing out some cases in Texas and then they go out and test the pipes
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.040]  and they're highly radioactive and the government comes in it says it's in the
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.920]  aquifer and the local news goes all right it's in the aquifer then we've got
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:47.160]  to say no test the aquifer water it's not the aquifer it's being added to the
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.000]  sodium fluoride now there's local newscast going defense told us that it
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.920]  was in the aquifer but it wasn't we were trying to find out where it come from
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:00.280]  because their bosses at the news stations won't let them say it's the
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:06.040]  government oh mr. mr. Jones or mr. Johnson or mr. Brown Mrs. Mrs. Brown
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:10.480]  that's too inflammatory to say it's the sodium fluoride well boss I'm trying to
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:15.280]  get into the water treatment plant I'm trying to get in right now but they're
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.640]  not letting me get in that reportedly I can get samples from what they're
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.760]  adding reportedly it's on the bag we don't want to cause trouble with the
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:29.520]  city here now don't report that we're gonna keep feeding our kids uranium we
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:38.840]  do we told the preacher says from 13 you hear what I'm talking about you hear
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:43.640]  the incredible bombshell nature of it every morning I wake up like out of a
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.440]  dream other things all right oh my gosh it's all real every day it hits me
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.880]  just how hardcore it is just how incredible it is just how evil it is
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.560]  how amazing it is up until three years ago in every manual in every country
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.160]  they said never give a pregnant woman a vaccine it causes brain damage or
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:05.840]  miscarriage now they say in TV ads vaccinate more when you're pregnant and
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:09.640]  the women's babies die and it's all a test to see if they can kill your baby
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.720]  and then and then handle it and how to finagle it through the news media because
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.920]  they want to start killing more and more people now and just get it kind of
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.240]  normal over here oh breast cancer I actually looked up the numbers yesterday
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.840]  breast cancer has tripled since 1981 CDC's own numbers I covered that last
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:34.200]  night on the news tripled and they say it's set to triple again and I know
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.920]  you're it feels too good to believe in the system and it's too scary so you're
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.640]  not gonna believe me new listeners I understand you're gonna sit there and
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.720]  bury your daughter bury your mother bury your wife oh isn't it fun to watch
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.400]  your wife getting chopped up and burned and watching their beautiful breasts get
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:55.120]  removed and all this hell and then watching them shrivel up and stick them
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.000]  in the ground it's too much fun to buy into the evil it's too much fun to love
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.960]  it it's too much fun to get into it it's just you love it you love it you love
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.880]  it you love it you love it you love it and you will continue to love it I'm
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:18.360]  talking to you out there it won't listen to me I wanted to stop now now and the
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:23.240]  only way it's gonna stop is waking up to the full horror of what we got going
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:29.560]  here but it's not we're not gonna turn this around ladies and gentlemen until
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.720]  you grow up I told you each time they have a bailout it's gonna get worse I
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.800]  told you that announce a bank of the world run by private banks it's all
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.760]  been announced they're announcing it as a political dictatorship run by banks in
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:47.600]  Europe we're already under it with the Super Congress and the sick thing is
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:53.320]  ninety nine point nine nine nine Geron do the number out of seven billion people
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  divide six thousand into seven billion police the globalists say there's six
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.560]  billion superclass minions less than 20 families Rothkopf best-selling
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.120]  Washington Post articles about it everything superclass we've had him on
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.480]  head of the Kissinger group he thought it was Alex S. Jones of the
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.200]  Shorenstein Center who also does commentary on him PR he figured out it
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:21.520]  was that has been very useful these guys what a lot of times that happens they
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:27.360]  figure out it's not Alex S. Jones we don't tell him I'm Alex S. Jones but
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.720]  they just oh Alex S. Jones is called certainly all cuz he normally nobody
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.040]  wants to interview CFR heads and you know groups like that no one's really
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:40.960]  calling them except for national news that's not on the radar for talk radio
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.400]  because Russell Limbaugh said you should say it didn't exist I heard him 20 years
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:53.560]  ago say the CFR didn't exist didn't exist didn't exist and so you call these
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.600]  guys up me automatically think oh it's another one of them there's nobody wants
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:03.440]  to interview them but their own people how many times does a 6,000 divide in
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.840]  seven billion
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:13.880]  well we'll we'll we'll get that going here let's go ahead and go back to
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.480]  pastor in Ohio and I got to get to the other caller since we got Peter Schiff
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.440]  coming up and heard Haskell heaven help us go ahead to pastor finish your point
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.440]  okay you mentioned the cancer how it's increasing one of the like I said they're
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.080]  gonna offer what it said is is they're gonna offer new technology to prolong
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.320]  people's life yeah they give you the bio weapon they then give you the treatment
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:41.560]  but it sterilizes you right but it still it offers longer life they've been
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.840]  playing with this all along cuz it with government assistance and everything
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:50.480]  else just to see how people will follow now here's the thing churches are to
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.600]  we're are actually pushing people away instead of helping them they're pushing
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.760]  people away towards the government yes because they can't afford it they they
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.080]  need to spend their money on all this high technology and pastor salaries and
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:09.480]  all these other things and programs programs programs they everybody's
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:14.400]  pushing programs so they got to have the money to do that and big monster
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:20.440]  churches and everything anything but the Bible right now that's one of the
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:25.840]  things they mentioned and and but here's the thing they're these people that are
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:31.600]  in these these white hats that are in these in these places all they're all
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.400]  over the world and I mean they've even mentioned you know certain things about
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:41.800]  the war the the earthquake in Virginia and the one out in California weren't
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:49.000]  weren't actually earthquakes or Colorado I mean Colorado and Virginia those
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.320]  weren't actually earthquakes but then that just needs that's not my needs be
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.280]  checked out because of the way the size McGrath no I understand it you just came
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:00.600]  up from nowhere with no buildup I got it John pie appreciate your call it's
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.200]  always good to hear from you okay so that the globalists themselves say
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:10.120]  there's 6,000 operatives less than 20 is about 18 families total and then there's
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.360]  only a few at the top of that so we're talking about 6,000 people divided into
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:31.480]  7 billion and 6,000 divides into 7 billion 1,166,666.67 times that's weird
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:39.200]  you get all those sixes there but there you have it so it divides in so we
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:50.120]  outnumber them millions to one but we've got to let them kill us because they're
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.520]  wearing fancy suits and talk to us like we're children with authority this is
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:59.120]  the way it is get over there and do that do what I say take the shots eat the
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:07.240]  GMO just see them for who they are learn that they're murderers not understand
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:12.320]  they're your mortal enemy and then begin to wake people up to the enemy and we
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.720]  will bring them down period all right I'm gonna go to all these other callers
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.360]  here I've got all this other news I need to hit on the economy we're watching
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.240]  that stock market 400 points down we're and then again they're saying banker
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.680]  dictatorship will fix everything I also just want to add again we are doing some
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.560]  power-packed transmissions where I don't just rant and rave the whole time but

[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.840]  seen as okay but some of the intelligentsia were communists so they
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.640]  were all killed it's all vice versa whatever group the globalist want to

[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:48.320]  just kind of scrambled my brain but I do have a few things pat on the back to you

[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:59.800]  to add on the 11th I'm trying to say too so scrambled right now I'm just gonna
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:04.200]  put out a couple information things I'd love to buy your t-shirt but I wanted to
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:08.640]  come as a combination with a flag think about that if you want to see if
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:12.560]  listeners want to do it put it out there cool but I would love to do that I'd
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.760]  love to have the same flag flying next to my little yellow one it's been flying
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:21.240]  since 1964 what do you want an info wars flag or a liberty or death flag
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:26.600]  your death flag just like the t-shirt info wars prison planted around the
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.680]  board you know what I've been wanting to do a flag for a while you want it you
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.120]  got it we're not gonna come out with one flag we're gonna come out with three
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:40.720]  flags how's that sound well sounds great to me buddy hey but I'd love to fly it
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.960]  right next to my other one it's been flying since my mother took on the city
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:48.640]  at plummet Michigan here in 1964 it'd be great to have next to it wasn't it good
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.480]  job that's a great way to advertise liberty to absolutely and it tells who
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.320]  you are without you know just throwing it in their face let's go back to what
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:59.320]  you originally called just think back to the issue you wanted to call in about
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:02.960]  what do you think of the drones I was I was saying they now admit the drones
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.240]  are gonna be robot-controlled no human decision pre-programmed and that's where
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.240]  this is they've always wanted to go with this where the globalist have a robot
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:17.520]  army working for them well that hold it doesn't surprise me we always kind of
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.800]  saw it if you were into sci-fi and had really thought about it you would
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:28.960]  actually know that this is possible and well I was in Fort Bliss and I learned
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.920]  a lot of things and one thing I did learn and did one and reason I was
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.680]  calling is when it finally had come out that we're doing the weapons and the
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:40.560]  drugs and stuff through there basically I just kind of laughed and people couldn't
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.760]  understand why I says people have known this forever but you couldn't say it
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:49.200]  well that's right I've had a lot of family who were army officers and it's
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:57.000]  just well-known it was totally amazing so yes the flag deal is very big for me
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.680]  and one thing radio stations is there anywhere on prison planet or info wars
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:05.520]  that we can find all the stations Detroit metro area I haven't found one

[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.360]  issue here is they use these for federal martial law takeover drills and a lot of
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:40.080]  times in the case of 7 7 9 11 they use a drill to actually stage an attack they
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:43.680]  go what a funny coincidence and then that way of any of their operatives get

[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.840]  standby lawyer you said their case if they could take it would be entrapment
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:41.560]  right you know as I've been been saying I've been going to the hearings because
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:46.040]  I've found out that the mainstream media isn't really reporting what's going on at
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:51.920]  the hearings not in my opinion so I've been going down witnessing them and you
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.400]  know it's quite apparent that the prosecution's hiding evidence from the
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:02.520]  defense and you know you'd have to ask why why are they doing that number one
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:09.360]  if we have some crazy lunatic El Cato guy you know with 200 some odd witnesses
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.000]  here that saw him try to blow up a plane why do we have to hide evidence so you
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.320]  know that's a big question that people need to think about and you know as I
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.240]  talked about on your show a couple days ago the evidence that was recently
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:29.760]  turned over to chambers ties in with exactly what I've been saying along they
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:37.480]  would held this evidence for 19 months or so to not let chambers hire experts to
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:43.240]  look at it to testify on behalf of the defense or to analyze it and you know
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.520]  things like the passport I guess it took took them a while to create who Mars
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.840]  passport 18 19 months because you know you didn't have it as I've been saying
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:56.080]  all on and things like that I I don't know you want me to keep going Alex do
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.520]  you have a break yeah this is just incredible yeah we're going to break in
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:01.760]  a moment I want you to come back and recap all this but just like they planted
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.760]  passports on 9-11 and then it turned out it was the wrong guy they planted it on
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:10.720]  so they withdrew those just like they found one at the flight 93 site just you
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.800]  witnessed him being gotten on the plane without the passport later the State
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:18.880]  Department had to admit and we got that clip coming up in Congress that an
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:23.480]  unnamed agency ordered them to give him the visa and so you've got them and
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.360]  just really shows you just how criminal the prosecutors are as well they're
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:33.120]  all complicit and I guess they love it yeah you know it's really obvious to me
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.640]  that prosecutors are in on this just you can just tell what they say at the
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:42.720]  hearings and their attitude and you know that they know they have an open and
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:46.320]  shut case but now for the reasons you think they have an open and shut case
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:50.320]  because they know he doesn't have an attorney he only has standby stay there
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.840]  let's let's recap it all on the other side heard Haskell with incredible
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:05:01.080]  information that could bring these criminals down if we use it this is
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.440]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:08.400]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:12.640]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.920]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:21.280]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:25.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:29.920]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:34.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:38.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:44.560]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:50.160]  michigan on christmas day back in nineteen back in 2009 and kurt recap for
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:55.440]  listeners that just tuned in the latest developments the inconsistencies and now
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:59.440]  as a survivor the fact that you are clearly saying that this is an inside
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:05.040]  job in your researched view right well alex i think the evidence is now or
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:10.880]  overwhelming that this is definitely a false flag set up by the u.s. government
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:15.000]  just anyone that does their research i think will come to the same conclusion
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:20.120]  obviously that's being part of my life i've done thousands of hours of
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:26.120]  research into this so you know i think you have to take a look at who can
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:33.120]  control the the not only the media but the ports the prosecutors what witnesses
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:38.560]  say or don't say who can control what law enforcement says and what the victim
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.240]  says and there's only one and the entity that can do that in my opinion the u.s.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:47.400]  government that's what we have here and it's becoming increasingly obvious if you
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:55.320]  go back to your hearing i went to on july 7 2011 this was a hearing set up by
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:00.240]  standby attorney chambers remember chambers are umar does not have an
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.480]  attorney who's representing himself but chambers is the helper of sorts anyway
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:08.160]  he set this hearing up because he wanted to delay the trial access to the start
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:13.440]  year october 4th and the reasons he gave and i was sitting
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:17.280]  sitting in the courtroom watching this and this wasn't reported this way in the
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:23.760]  media but he said i just received the most significant evidence of the case
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.920]  the most significant remember what my theory is the u.s. government gave umar
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:32.080]  an intentionally defective bomb escort him without a passport through security
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:37.360]  to stage this attack well that's my theory here's what he says he got a copy of
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:43.920]  umar's passport okay why has this been with health for 18 months did it take
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:49.280]  them that long to create it i mean come on don't you just make a copy and hand it
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:53.360]  over within a couple weeks okay number one number two a
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:58.800]  discontainment chemical analysis of the composition of the bomb perhaps maybe
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:02.160]  the composition shows that it couldn't have exploded
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.680]  as all the experts that have been hired so far have indicated
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:08.720]  to chambers anyway and he stole that to me
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.560]  uh airport security video and audio okay
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:16.240]  why was this with health for 18 19 months when it can clearly
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:19.840]  show what i've been saying all along by the way all of this is still under a
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:23.520]  protective order so nobody can talk about it no one can talk
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:26.480]  about the details of it judge edmunds issued this
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.120]  early in january 10 i want to talk about that in a few minutes but
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:34.240]  nobody can talk about the content of this this is why we're not seeing it in the
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.400]  media four discs of dna analysis i'm not really
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:43.680]  sure what that is but okay and the next thing that was turned
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.440]  over a witness statement from a dutch
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:51.120]  non-law enforcement citizen government profiler
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:54.480]  who talked to umar during the time in question and
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:58.000]  after thinking about this for a while i think this would be the sharp dress man
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.160]  and i think the sharp dress man is the the person that has these
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.680]  security questions in amsterdam they have an additional
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.800]  level of security there that we don't have here in the us they have a
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:11.840]  security interview and after looking at this
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.320]  hearing chambers talk thinking about it i'm thinking that this was the sharp
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:20.480]  dress man so the next question is why is his witness
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.000]  statement being withheld for 18 months or 19 months
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:30.640]  from chambers why was this statement so important or for whatever reason
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:36.160]  what held this law again it's to give chambers the least amount of time and
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:39.280]  least amount of resources to look into these things
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:44.080]  to prepare a good case just briefly for people that don't know the backside on
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.520]  this and we have the clip from c-span if we have time we'll play it
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.440]  but the detroit free press reported on as well the undersecretary of state mr
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.760]  kennedy testified on c-span a month and a half after you made your claims along
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.040]  with your wife and since then others saw similar things
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.480]  that the clearly disheveled you know could have been drugged
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:05.920]  out of it mutalib not wearing a coat in freezing weather
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:08.720]  is led on by the sharp dress man there's a little bit of an argument with
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.240]  security but this guy's so high up he's able to get him on
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:15.680]  without the passport you witness all this
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:18.640]  they admitted there wasn't a passport now suddenly it's
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.400]  appeared i mean this gets weirder and weirder and weirder
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:25.280]  so we know they got him on the plane please continue
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.680]  yeah you know the the testimony by patrick kennedy if you just watch the
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:33.360]  video out of it of it on the internet you see him squirming in his chair to
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:37.120]  lie and not say that this was an intentional plot it's so obvious to
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.320]  anyone that watches it so you have and then
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.080]  after that what all what's also telling is
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:47.600]  nobody reported that there were hearings in congress over this if you look
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:51.200]  on the internet the mainstream media i think maybe the
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:55.440]  detroit news and maybe one other newspaper even had an article about
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.920]  these hearings we think these would be significant
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:01.840]  nobody talked about them because they were such uh they were so telling
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.840]  that this was an obvious setup and you know from that on you have the
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.640]  government saying oh yeah we need to do this because the
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.880]  denier bomber case or that this or that they all refer to this case as a
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:15.680]  basis to do whatever they want for spending and
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.200]  to cut down on our rights so it's so telling and
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.120]  if the people would just see hey this is a setup here
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:27.280]  then everyone would be questioning well why do we have body standards to airports
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.680]  now why are we spending all this on tsa why are they now going to nfl stadiums
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.600]  whatever it's just totally ridiculous in my opinion
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.480]  and it's so obvious um you know something i really haven't
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.440]  talked about yet and i've shied away from this somewhat
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:47.440]  it's uh discussion about judge edmunds you know i
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:51.280]  watched her in the courtroom quite a few times and
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:54.480]  she doesn't seem to be biased if you watch her in the courtroom but the more
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:59.200]  i think about her rulings the more um i have an issue
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:03.680]  with her we'll just say that because it's judge judge edmunds that put in this
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.400]  protective order they indicate said nobody can talk about the evidence at all
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:13.360]  so you have you know you have the the airport video chemical analysis of the
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:16.240]  bomb and all these other things that could be talked about
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:20.240]  but instead no one can talk about these things that would show that this was
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.320]  an intentional setup it's all hush hush of course now
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:28.320]  umar's representing himself is that any of this even going to come out
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:32.240]  probably not face closed let's move on but not only that
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:37.280]  a couple other rulings judge edmunds did um
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.720]  you know we're not along the same line one was
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.400]  that since chambers is only a standby attorney
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:47.680]  he can only have the evidence that umar decides to give him
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.040]  so umar gets all the evidence chambers can only see
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:58.960]  what umar wants to give him um and then the second part of the july 7 hearing
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:02.880]  which i didn't get to was after chambers complained that
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:06.160]  hey i was given all these things last minute he then said
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:10.720]  well what have i not been given was there other evidence being withheld
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:13.920]  you know how can i be sure i have everything and
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.760]  instead of the prosecution saying yes you have everything now
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:21.200]  they said well there is more evidence where it was holy
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:24.960]  it's secret government evidence and we're not going to turn it over we're
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.600]  going to let you look at it judge edmunds
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:31.840]  and so we're getting national security declared here just like in chicago last
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:35.920]  month it's now been confirmed senola drug cartel did ship in
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:40.480]  massive cottage of cocaine under u.s government contract and guns into
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:43.360]  mexico i mean this is just amazing how they
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.200]  declare this national security right and again
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.080]  what is the official story a crazy okay to man goes through and lights off this
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:54.880]  bomb okay where's the national security there we have
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:58.800]  again 200 some eyewitnesses we can easily go in and say yeah
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.160]  he let this bomb you should go to prison rest of his life
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:05.600]  case close where's the national security here but
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:13.040]  again that ties into um another aspect of this there there's just so many
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:17.040]  there are offshoots to this well they find mentally ill people in all the big
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:21.280]  patsy cases and provocateur them to do these events or they
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:24.480]  frame somebody and then threaten to kill their family as we know happened with
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:28.080]  mcvay so in this you know something else it's
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.200]  kind of interesting here it took the prosecution
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:36.720]  a year to charge umar with conspiracy now this was only after all plea
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:39.760]  negotiations had broken down do they bring out this charge
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:44.320]  obviously they didn't want to make this charge because the next question is
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:48.160]  and again you don't see anyone talking about conspiracy charge it's not being
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:51.440]  recorded anywhere the news isn't talking about it
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:56.400]  why not and the the bigger question is who are the co-conspirators
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:59.680]  but why aren't they being charged why aren't they on the FBI's 10 most
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:03.520]  wantonist wanted list why isn't their participation being
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:07.040]  described there the evidence that there's conspiracy
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:10.320]  where is it and it all ties back to the same thing
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.840]  the co-conspirators are undercover government agents
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.480]  it's it's too obvious Alex it's just it just all ties in the air
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:22.960]  that's the mo that we've seen over and over and over and over again even
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:26.640]  mainstream news the last two years admits where the FBI goes and creates
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.160]  out of whole cloth and finds mentally ill welfare
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.720]  ex-prisoner type to do this i mean that they've been caught over and over again
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:39.440]  not infiltrating groups but purely creating them
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:45.680]  right right it seems like their uh their activities have no ends here
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:50.480]  because they control everything they control the release of the information
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:54.160]  what activities take place they control the courts the media
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:57.440]  it's all a perfect setup they have free reign to do anything they want
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:01.120]  and it continues and it continues and still continues
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:05.040]  you know if this were a legitimate situation
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.560]  we would have umar with a legitimate attorney
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:12.560]  presenting a case presenting all the evidence accurately calling people as
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:16.320]  witnesses like myself to testify in an entrapment case
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:20.000]  we don't have that here we're not going to see it in my opinion
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  we're going to see umar go and make some show that where all the media can
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.560]  report on him being a crazy nut job they can put pictures of it on tv
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.160]  and make them crazy and say this is a crazy terrorist
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.160]  but the real story won't come out it's being covered up and i think it will
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:39.280]  always be covered up at least that's the sense i'm getting now
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:44.320]  well look hurt i mean look day one it's sunday
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:47.760]  or it's it's christmas day felt like a sunday it's christmas day
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:53.840]  and i'm driving up to get eggs and within the time i went in you know driving up i
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:56.240]  hear that there's been an underwear bombing on a flight into
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:59.920]  detroit on christmas day and then by the time i got out of the store five
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:02.320]  minutes later they were already saying don't worry we've
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:05.440]  got body scanners that just so happened to be going in next month
[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:09.200]  we've just made the order for them but i knew from covering it that they just
[02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:13.440]  made the order um you know a year before
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:16.640]  and that cherdorf was involved i mean this whole thing was a
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:20.320]  rollout and the fear mongering and the ring of the hands and
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:24.000]  the little bomb and then the connections to it and the way they handled it
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.080]  and then you came out on your blog and said he was gotten on the airplane
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:31.040]  and the government's like that's preposterous and then a month and a half
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:34.640]  later it comes out in congressional testimony that indeed that's true and
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:38.400]  then there's no subsequent investigation how much more obvious does this have to
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:41.520]  get i agree you know and all the people that came
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:44.720]  out and said hey i'm doing this for money publicity
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:48.560]  uh political office promote my office whatever
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:52.480]  well i think i've shut them all up now they've all seemed to have gone away
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:55.920]  um i don't i don't have any agenda here i never have just
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:21:01.280]  getting out this story and uh you know i have to i have to question
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:05.680]  to some of the passengers where are the passengers and backing me up on the
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:09.360]  story you know i've been told that many of them were military
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:13.040]  personnel government employees and government contractors
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:17.200]  and you know there were some uh foreign citizens
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:22.000]  hardly any u.s citizens would no ties to the military or the government i
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.360]  i don't really know how i even got on this plane but don't you think they
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:29.600]  should be out there backing me up on the story at least some of them
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:33.680]  i mean where are they even some that i try and contact
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:39.200]  ignore me now i've talked to some um but you know
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:42.640]  interestingly enough alex by the way i i think
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:45.680]  they should be out there supporting me or at least doing
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:48.880]  investigative work to see if i'm right or not but we don't have that
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:52.640]  but uh something you might be interested in i actually got a call from the
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:56.880]  cameraman in this story um you know there's been
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:01.040]  much talk about the man that pulled out his video camera and filmed this whole
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:05.760]  story and since i talked to you i talked to you a couple days ago but i didn't
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:08.400]  mention this he called me out of the blue about two
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:13.440]  months ago and we talked about a
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:16.880]  an interview he was going to do with prosecutors
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:23.120]  and some security and i believe fbi or cia or something
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:27.760]  and we you know we talked about and he told me that
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:33.120]  he was filming outside at 20 000 feet and turned his camera and started
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:37.040]  filming the incident then it didn't stop now that's his story
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:41.120]  for what it's worth but the story doesn't sound real credible but just for
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:43.840]  what it's worth he did sound credible to me and i
[02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:47.520]  at least at this point i think his involvement is probably a red herring
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:51.520]  in this to just to detract from what the real story is the sharp
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:54.720]  trust man and the other man arrested the man in orange
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:58.000]  but anyway it was just kind of interesting to me that he called me out of
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.080]  the blue do we know whatever happened the other
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:03.840]  guy that was arrested that the government tries to deny was arrested
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:07.760]  no we don't know we don't know about him but again you know the government
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:11.760]  changed their story on him five times continually live did you see the report
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:16.160]  two weeks ago with the supposed live explosives smuggled into the phoenix
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:19.120]  airport by the police in a drill and then lost and
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:23.600]  then dumped on the side of the road no i i'm not aware of that
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:28.000]  no now there's more and more of these events and uh obama advisors
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.920]  even in the financial times of london have said barring a new oklahoma city or
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:35.040]  9-11 they're not going to be able to get their agenda through and you can see
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.920]  all the pre hyping and fair mongering kurt
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:41.120]  you know you survived this your wife survived this we've never talked to
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.920]  your wife uh what's her views on this do they
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.440]  mirror yours yeah they do she um just a couple of
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:50.480]  things she didn't see the sharp trust man because
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:54.160]  if you recall we were playing cards and she was sitting opposite so
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:24:00.560]  facing me so that this happened behind her so she isn't uh as uh wanted by the
[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:03.120]  media as i am because of that number two
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:07.360]  she's not real comfortable with the media because early on uh there were some
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:10.720]  people that came out and put some negative blog posts about her and she
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:14.160]  kind of got turned off yeah that's co until protrona shuts you up
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:17.200]  the terrorists don't want you to get the word out
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:20.880]  me a hundred percent and fully supports everything i'm doing
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:24.880]  which is good because you know there's some trying times with this and people
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.360]  saying i'm doing this for the wrong reason but she agrees with me well cart why
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.560]  even respond to that you were the voice in the
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.760]  wilderness talking about the guy getting him on and then later the state
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:38.720]  department and testimony had to admit that indeed they've been
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.240]  ordered to help him get on i mean that is incredible information
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:46.880]  absolutely verifying what you've said they always attack even if it's asinine
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:50.640]  to make you go on the defensive instead of looking at the facts it's a way to
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.680]  change the subject as you know as a lawyer now now in the time we've got
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:58.720]  left here you said on the tv show info wars nightly news a few nights ago that
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:01.760]  you know it's over you can't fix it leave the country
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:05.280]  and i made the point that there's no war to run this is a global corporate
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.040]  government they're imploding every system we've got to stand and fight now
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:12.960]  now i'm not saying you're wrong completely and i understand your view
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:18.240]  but i mean you get my point that that that it's always darkest before the dawn
[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:21.120]  and and and yes the government's very corrupt but
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:25.040]  we don't have a hope i mean i mean it's not like this is albania or something and
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:29.520]  we can just leave the america is the heart of the world government right now
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:32.960]  and they want to take over the whole planet these criminals using america
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:36.880]  we don't have a choice we've got to stay here and expose them and god put us in
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:41.200]  the heart of this wicked empire to be able to try to restore the republic
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:45.600]  that's why we're here that's why you were on that aircraft cart
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:49.200]  yeah you know i i think you have a point there but
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:52.640]  do they control the entire world yeah i i guess i don't know i'm not convinced
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.200]  that yeah but maybe you are right but uh you know i
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:00.800]  i've done everything i can i think to expose this and
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.640]  you know i'm just going up against the walls i i think at least in my position
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:07.920]  everything i've done everything i can do so far
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:12.720]  to expose this and i think um you know i need some more help
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:15.760]  i need some help have you walked over to the prosecutor in the hall
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:20.400]  and said how can you be part of this you know what really happened here
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.400]  no i've thought about doing that but i haven't i think it probably caused a
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:28.720]  scene and i you know i wouldn't want to get into any kind of streaming match
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:34.480]  um remember too i can still file a civil suit
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:38.240]  i haven't done that yet but that's not out of question and that's how you're
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:41.440]  going to start getting the documents you know it was civil suits that proved
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.040]  mcvay was with a bunch of other men as i witnessed as it said
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.480]  and that the feds were running the operation and and then and then said
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:51.680]  that all 20-something videotapes had disappeared or
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:55.280]  been destroyed or been lost uh i mean i think that's probably what's
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:00.080]  needed next is a civil suit right i i'm taking a position at least
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:03.200]  right now i i want to watch some of the trial first
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.120]  i have till christmas day to file a case so i i'm going to watch and see how this
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:11.760]  plays out before i decide what i'm going to do with that but i haven't
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:15.280]  i haven't made a decision on that yet but i could potentially
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:19.520]  shed some new light on this too i want to i want to see how the trial plays out
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:23.680]  if it plays out uh as i think it might just a total
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:27.680]  farce that will you know that may propel me more to file a civil suit
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:32.160]  well let me say this you've already done a lot for truth all i'm saying is
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.840]  you're already deep into this you might as well go all the cards on the table
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.520]  all in because from my research you aren't in
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.760]  danger until you get the suit going once you've already got that in action
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:46.640]  they tend to go ahead and go to the game plan
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:50.480]  of trying to beat you on that it might just be easier to kill you though we
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:54.160]  know these are killers uh in the interim so i want to tell you what i told
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:56.240]  many others that they have subsequently killed
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:59.840]  like the dc madam and others uh and of course barry jennings and others who was
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.280]  a 9-11 witness the deputy head of emergency management in new york
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.360]  you need to go public now with everything are you watching your back
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.680]  kurt
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:14.960]  well to the extent that i can i am but you know if somebody wants to kill me i
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.400]  don't think would be too difficult really i i try not think about that i'm
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:21.120]  not overly concerned about i got it you're a real man you're just
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:23.760]  committed to the trade that they kill you that's the way it is that's exactly
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:26.720]  how i operate right they're going to kill me they're
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:30.160]  going to kill me that and that's fine they can only do it once i'm not overly
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:33.280]  concerned about that so you've got the spirit we need
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:36.720]  you know if we had 10 000 more people like you who would take action kurt we
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:40.000]  would kick these people's butts we're probably right but it would
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.760]  probably take 10 million well it takes 10 000 to wake up 10
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:46.240]  million into march on these people in the info war
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.680]  briefly any other points and give us your website
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:53.200]  um just you know with everything i've said
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:57.840]  anyone paying attention to the trial keep keep my position in mind as you're
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:00.400]  seeing how this plays out so you can see
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:03.920]  how the government system works and hiding these sort of things because you
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.760]  know what's happened now i'm telling you you can see the misinformation and the
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:10.320]  steps they take to deceive the american public
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:13.200]  so it'll be pretty obvious as you watch this play out

[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:11.680]  who's predicted so much of what's now unfortunately unfolded
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:15.360]  i know he's not glad all his predictions have come true peter schiff
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:19.440]  but just a lot of the very important news taking place dow plunges
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:22.480]  400 points after they announced further quantitative easing
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:26.320]  global markets tumble four percent zolic says the world is in danger their
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:28.880]  answer give the euro completely over to the private
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:31.840]  bankers sorrow says us already a double dip how
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:36.160]  about a depression global meltdown investors dumping everything
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:42.560]  cnbc breaks that down also another economic news
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:46.240]  we've got some very important developments on that front that we're
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:50.880]  going to be breaking down with our guests here
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:55.600]  here's an amazing number study immigrants filled 81 percent of new jobs in
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:35:00.480]  texas well that's the thing is that if you pay taxes and work in the system
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:04.240]  then you can't afford to live but the illegals pay very low taxes
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:07.440]  and most of their wives stay home and get welfare that's on record
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:10.880]  and their studies on that and so the government subsidizes with taxpayer
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:14.160]  money driving down the wages this is not free market
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:17.840]  this is a rigged crony situation incredible news
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:24.080]  on that front you've got billions and billions spent on quote green jobs
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:27.440]  given to select insiders you've got obama with the lowest
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.880]  approval rating ever of a president this far into the presidency
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:33.680]  the democrats are talking about ditching him but that won't matter they'll just
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:36.880]  put in some new puppet it'll take folks a while to figure
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:38.640]  out that the new puppet isn't going to save them
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:42.400]  same thing with rick perry on the republican side of things along with
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:48.320]  mit romney obama care lovers uh hillary care lovers carbon tax lovers
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:51.840]  uh former chief of staff for al gore in the case of uh
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:55.920]  texas with rick perry i mean you can't make this up it's only ron paul
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:59.680]  we are deep into this but going to peter shiff
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:02.720]  uh the ceo of euro-pacific capital joining us via
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:06.880]  a video connection from his headquarters wow we are really
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:11.520]  seeing things plunge what is what is happening in your analysis right now
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:15.280]  yeah you know first of all alex uh the bad news is all of my predictions have
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:18.320]  not come true i think a lot more of them are going to which
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.480]  means it's going to get a lot worse you know this phony economy
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  is unraveling which is actually a good thing the problem is the government
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:30.240]  won't let it happen because we can't really have a restructuring
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:34.160]  and a legitimate recovery until we allow the phony economy
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:38.560]  that the fed and congress have created to unravel but they won't let it happen
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:41.920]  so i think we're going to get a lot more money printing and a lot more
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:46.560]  regulating and a lot more spending which is going to prolong this depression
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:50.960]  well sure i meant up until this point you predicted the oh eight situation
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:53.760]  uh you predicted that it wouldn't help and within three years it would start
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:57.360]  imploding even faster so what i'm saying is up to this point you've called the
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:01.760]  ballgame up to halftime so tell us what's coming next i mean they're
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:05.040]  announcing new wars they want to have to get try to get us out of this
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:08.880]  they're announcing this wars are the last thing we need you know for a number of
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:12.080]  reasons let forget about the the humanitarian aspect of it
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:15.680]  you know the financial aspect is we don't have the resources to fight a war
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:19.200]  we can barely afford peace although we don't actually have that either right
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:22.320]  now but the real crisis is going to come when the
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:26.640]  world is fleeing the dollar not embracing it right now as bad as it is
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:30.160]  the dollar is actually going up treasuries are going up
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:34.240]  people are buying dollars in treasuries as they sell stocks
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.840]  when the real crisis happens they're going to be selling dollars in
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:41.520]  treasuries that's the real crisis is then the dollar plunges
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:45.120]  then interest rates go up and then prices go through the roof
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:48.160]  and that is what's really going to turn this into a crisis because it's going to
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:52.080]  be an inflationary depression well isn't this like a seesaw
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:55.440]  talking to dr paul craig roberts and the father of reaganomics
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:59.120]  just about three months ago he said alex you could see a big saw off of gold
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:03.600]  it'll go up later even more as people run from the euro to the dollar then
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:07.600]  they'll run from the dollar to the euro but overall both the currencies in the
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:11.360]  long term or even medium term are going down i know you've
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:14.960]  talked about that that there could be this run into treasuries for a time
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:19.520]  but that's the sign that the circling of the toilet bowl is basically
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:24.000]  coming to its final conclusion yeah well look the fed came out yesterday and
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.480]  didn't promise endless money printing they just did this operation twist which
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:32.640]  is actually going to backfire the markets are going down but i believe
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.240]  the fed will eventually cave in they will they won't you know it's a game of
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:39.680]  chicken between the markets and the fed and and the fed is going to blink the
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:43.760]  fed is going to give the market what it craves it's going to feed the addiction
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:48.000]  for cheap money quantitative easing it's coming and when that happens
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.640]  gold goes up and the dollar goes back down but right now maybe the market
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.160]  doesn't realize that that's coming and you're getting a lot of liquidation
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:00.160]  as people who believed that there was a recovery there were a lot of people
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:04.400]  who managed money who actually believed that the us economy was getting better
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:08.800]  i knew that was just an illusion but most people didn't well now that reality
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:13.200]  is rearing its ugly head that's causing a lot of the people who invest money
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:17.280]  to have to you know change their their their portfolios around to take into
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:20.400]  account this new information and so you're getting a lot of unwinding
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:25.680]  of trades that were based on a recovery that just is not happening
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.000]  so what's going to unfold then i mean clearly they're not going to take ron
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.880]  paul's advice they're not going to take your advice they're not going to take
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.240]  dr paul hig robert's advice they're not going to take bob chapman's advice or
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:39.600]  gerald zalente's advice or or john williams advice they're not going to
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:43.600]  take uh rubini's advice they're not going to take uh
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:47.920]  roger rubini's advice is the exact opposite of mine remember rubini wants
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:51.040]  more stimulus he wants more government no no you're right and he's also said we
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.080]  weren't really in a recession for a while but now he's kind of jumping over to my
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:57.440]  view but my point is they're going ahead with
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:03.760]  their current program of more stimulus uh more qe3 what is that going to do
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:07.280]  it's just going to do more harm it's good just two more this creates more
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:10.960]  inflation you know the the the key is in track this isn't to
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:14.160]  stimulate consumption or stimulate housing the government's
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:17.920]  got it backwards i mean we stimulate the reason we're in trouble is because we
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.240]  overstimulated those things in the first place
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.840]  we need to reverse all that we need the government to get out of the way so we
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.880]  can save and we can invest and we can produce
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:30.720]  and we can work our way back out of debt and repair the damage
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.120]  that bad monetary and fiscal policy has done to the economy we're not going to
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:38.960]  repair the damage by breaking it more but that's all they're doing but i know
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:41.440]  they're going to continue with this because that's all they know
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:45.040]  they are convinced that we need more spending even though we're spending like
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:47.920]  crazy they're convinced we need to go deeper into debt
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.760]  look Bernacchi thinks that the problem with the economy is that rates aren't
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:54.240]  low enough i mean they've never been this low
[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:58.320]  well how can we get a much lower the fact of the matter is low rates are part of
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:02.320]  the problem they're not part of well peter what about the two-tier system
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:05.040]  sure sure what about the two-tier system though the big banks the
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:09.200]  institutions they get it at zero or less than zero basically free money for the
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:12.480]  general public though they're paying high interest rates i mean isn't that why
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:16.640]  the big mega private banks goldman sacks jp morgan and others
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:20.240]  are very happy with what's happening i mean this is a command control
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:23.680]  economy they well they've been happy they've gotten bailed out and
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:28.480]  my feeling is if the fed withholds the next round of qe if we don't have qe
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:32.000]  three we're going to have tarp too because i think these major banks are
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.200]  about to fail again if the government doesn't rescue them
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.160]  and the rescue is going to either have to take the form of qe
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:42.480]  or tarp and you know maybe the public as much as they don't like to qe
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:46.160]  they probably dislike tarp even more so i think that the government is going to
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:49.040]  is going to go the route of the money printing rather than the bailout so
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:51.840]  though in order to bail them out they need to fed the print money so
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:55.120]  if we get tarp we end up getting both but you know
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:42:00.640]  i don't want americans to have access to cheap credit to consume and in a free
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:03.360]  market they wouldn't it's all the government subsidies
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:06.240]  that enable people to borrow money for consumption
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:10.640]  i we i want people to save money and then buy things that they can afford
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.040]  we need credit to go to businesses to make capital investments
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:19.840]  that can grow the economy and create jobs and that provide the means for paying
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:22.800]  off the debt if you borrow money to invest
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.200]  the investment returns will pay off your debt if you borrow money to consume
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:30.320]  you have no way of paying off the debt
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:33.280]  peter schiff joins us the CEO of europe pacific
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:37.200]  capital peter there is a method of this madness
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:40.240]  in my view but i want you to give us your take on it
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:44.880]  just like we saw in october and and in the month before that
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:48.960]  in september in 2008 when they wouldn't give them the tarp
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:52.080]  money um pulse and went into congress and said
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:54.960]  there'll be blood in the streets martial law total collapse
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.240]  and held people hostage and when congress wouldn't pass it because they
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:00.800]  were getting a thousand to one phone calls against it as barbara boxer
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:04.320]  admitted uh they went public and fearmongered well
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.560]  we've seen the heads of the imf the world bank the head of the
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:12.480]  european central bank all come out yesterday and say
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:17.520]  total collapse if you don't do qe3 and then bernacky says okay i'll do qe3 with
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:22.080]  his twist uh scam well the twist and qe3 because
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.920]  remember he's he's buying 400 billion of long term but he's
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:30.240]  selling 400 billion of short term so he's not actually expanding the balance
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:33.280]  sheet he's just twisting a little bit but he's actually going to put the
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:36.880]  squeeze on the banks which is going to backfire on bernacky
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:40.800]  because see remember what happens if if we reduce our interest rates so that
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:44.400]  people can refinance their mortgages and reduce their payments
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:48.480]  that represents a loss to the banking sector because the banks
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:52.160]  own the mortgages and the banks are already in trouble and if you take away
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:55.040]  their cash flow they're going to be in bigger trouble
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:58.320]  and so you know this is not going to work do you think bernacky's really
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:02.080]  doing this to try to make the big banks loan
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:05.760]  i think he's doing it out of desperation he wants to he wants to do
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:10.080]  something and so this is what he's doing because he doesn't want to he doesn't
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:14.320]  want to be seen as doing nothing so you know he's doing something he's
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:17.200]  grasping for strong okay so if the big banks do start
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:21.440]  loaning all these trillions peter won't that accelerate inflation
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:25.360]  if what if the big banks do start loaning all this money they've
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:29.600]  gorged on they are loaning the money they're loaning it to the government
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:32.480]  they're buying treasuries you know they're buying you know they're loaning
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:35.760]  it for home mortgages and student loans and and all kinds of stuff that the
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:38.880]  money's just not sitting there unfortunately you know if the government
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:42.720]  wasn't borrowing all this money there'd be more money available for business
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:46.240]  sure sure look look put it in layman's terms the point i'm trying to get out
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:50.480]  here is we saw fear mongering to get new monetary
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:54.320]  policy that the system wanted three and a half years ago
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:58.080]  now we're seeing the same fear mongering clearly all the heads of the big
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:01.680]  central banks coming out and talking about gloom and doom and total collapse
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:05.440]  and greatest crisis they know that's going to kill the stock market
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:08.960]  so so normally even if things are bad they'll lie and say they're great
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:12.720]  why did they come out in the last 48 hours and scream bloody murder
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.720]  thus precipitating the stock market plunge well i don't you know i don't
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:19.600]  think that was their intention you know i don't think that they said hey let's
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:22.240]  make the stock markets go down they were probably surprised
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:26.720]  i bet ben Bernanke is very surprised at the way the market reacted
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:29.920]  to his announcement yesterday i think he probably thought the markets were
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:33.840]  going to like it you know and i i so he's probably scratching his head
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:37.200]  right now trying to figure out how to undo the damage
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:41.280]  but i'm but sure but normally you get a federal reserve head or an imf or
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:44.000]  world bank head or european central bank head comes out and
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:47.600]  talks about total collapse and i mean i've got all these headlines here
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:51.280]  they've been doing this the last two days i'm no rocket scientist peter
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:54.240]  that's going to make people not have confidence well i don't know if they're
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:58.160]  talking total collapse who's saying that oh there's a bunch of them here saying
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:03.280]  greatest crisis world in danger zones zolik
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:07.440]  they're talking about you know worse than 08 i mean the culture i mean it's
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:10.560]  going to be worse than 08 i mean but in many cases they're probably sugar
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:13.840]  coating it i don't know if they even know how bad it is but the real problem
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:17.840]  is that the the monetary system of the world does not work because the dollar
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:21.760]  is the center of it the dollar is the focal point of all these problems
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:25.440]  see the world is trying to continue to to to grow
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:30.320]  by selling products to america but we're broke we can't afford these products
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.160]  and even though they keep lending us money we still can't afford them because
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:38.080]  that's how broke we are so the only way the global economy can heal
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:41.040]  is if we if they gets out of this dollar system
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:45.040]  where the dollar is allowed to sink and other currencies are allowed to rise so
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:48.320]  that instead of the chinese for example china produce goods for us
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:51.200]  they produce goods for themselves but meanwhile you know you've got all these
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:55.360]  currency wars brewing now because of this dollar peg like you saw what happened
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:59.200]  in brazil you know they were upset because their currency was rising against
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:03.680]  the r&b so they imposed tariffs and then their currency tank but you've got all
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:08.080]  this global trade and currency wars because the current monetary system
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:12.320]  without gold using the dollar instead of gold does not work
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:16.560]  okay peter what about the swiss then uh what did their move a few weeks ago to
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:19.680]  lower the value of their of their currency do
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:22.960]  you have more proof that it doesn't work i mean you have a race to the bottom
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:27.120]  now the swiss had a strong currency because they were doing it right they
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:30.560]  had a vibrant economy they didn't have government budget deficits they had a
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.400]  trade surplus had a current account surplus and then what they did is they
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:37.840]  decided to destroy their currency because it was going up
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:41.280]  against the euro it's like you know europe was jumping off a bridge
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.480]  and so switzerland said hey let's jump off the same bridge
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.600]  but this shows you it doesn't work the reserve you can't have a monetary system
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:53.280]  that forces people to be reckless and irresponsible that's the globalist model
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:57.280]  is lower everybody instead of building things up and and get everybody
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.600]  dependent so in simple information that that that lay
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:05.760]  folks can understand what's going on in this crazy bond market
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:08.480]  how would we know the u.s. is in deep trouble
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.280]  could the bonds be going up even though their yield is lower
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.920]  and how does this unwind well it's going to unwind badly because you know
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:20.400]  nobody who's buying if you look at the yield
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:26.480]  on a 10-year bond at 1.7 percent nobody who's buying that bond plans to hold it
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:29.840]  to maturity no one wants to clip those coupons for 10 years
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:32.880]  at some point the people buying the bonds are going to want out
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:36.080]  and the question is who's going to be there to take the other side of the
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:38.320]  trade the only one is going to be the fed
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:42.480]  and it's going to have to create massive inflation to buy up all these bonds
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:45.760]  when the bubble bursts this is the problem this is the mother of all
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:49.200]  bubbles and when it bursts interest rates go sky
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:52.880]  high and then whatever problems we have now with our debts are going to be
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:56.880]  compounded because it's going to be so much more expensive to service them
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:00.880]  okay what would you do if you were the president the treasury
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.160]  secretary and the congress all rolled in one if you could wave
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:09.760]  a magic wand what would you do to try to reverse the situation we're in
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:13.440]  if i had a magic wand i'd probably have to go back in time because we'd have to
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.880]  we'd have to reverse the policies from 20 or 30 years ago that would be the
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:21.040]  thing we would do but assuming i didn't have a magic wand but i had powers i had
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:24.480]  the power to you know i was a king or something and i can i can dictate what
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:27.680]  was going to be done you know we would have to allow the
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:31.360]  economy to restructure and what that means that means sound money that means
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:34.960]  higher interest rates substantially higher that means we let all the banks
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:38.800]  that have to fail fail we don't bail anybody out we shrink government
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:41.840]  dramatically we eliminate entire departments and
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:45.360]  agencies we we dramatically cut government spending we
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:49.360]  you know we we try to reform our tax code so it doesn't punish
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:52.720]  you know work and entrepreneurs we've got to abolish all these rules and
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.240]  regulations that are unnecessarily not only diminishing our rights but
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:59.920]  running up the cost of doing business we have to really unravel the entire
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:03.760]  social welfare monstrosity that has been built up over the years
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:07.200]  that is the only solution that's going to work and the problem is you're going
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:11.840]  to need a king to do that because no politician is going to vote to do that
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:14.400]  you know because they're afraid of they're afraid that when they when they
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:17.440]  take away the benefits they're not going to get a lot reelected
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:20.800]  and instead they're just going to keep running us down the same path and
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:24.320]  passing the buck i want to do five more minutes with you if you can to end the

[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:44.640]  some people would spend it that schiff is calling
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:47.920]  rostarity that's not what he's calling for it's calling for
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:52.160]  common sense solutions instead we're going to get the king type deal through
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:55.920]  the bureaucracy and they're going to cut a lot of things

[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:12.800]  news it's going to be completely jam-packed
[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:17.200]  Peter Schiff is our guest and we put him back up there on screen i can give it
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:22.880]  the folks his website it's peter schiff

[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:38.880]  Peter look a lot of people are going to say you're calling for quote austerity
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:42.720]  my issue is the establishment is offering a different alternative to what
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:46.160]  you've been promoting as you know and that's
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.480]  keep government big and just start cutting the military pensions and the
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:54.880]  general public's pensions but keep the corporate welfare the defense going
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:58.560]  keep the bailout of the big banks going you're calling for something
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:01.120]  different you're talking about it across the board
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:04.560]  so continue with with the type of economic policy you think we'll get this
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:07.440]  country going the government is basically talking about
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:11.600]  widespread poverty if we continue on this program i want austerity for
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:14.960]  for government i want government to shrink because that's our wealth that
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:18.800]  they're spending and dissipating if the politicians really care about
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:22.800]  the little guy stop spending their money you know stop
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:26.560]  regulating and taxing their jobs away stop destroying the value of their
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:29.440]  savings and their wages with inflation you see
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:33.280]  that's the only solution that works i want the government to cut back i don't
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:37.040]  want the people to have to be austere austere but i want them to save more
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:41.360]  i want them to earn money and not spend it but you know that's not austerity i
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:44.160]  mean austerity would be you know massive cuts in
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:46.800]  government i want austerity for the people who are
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:50.240]  in the wagon not the people who have been pulling the wagon you know we need
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:53.440]  to lighten their burden and the people who are riding in the wagon
[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:57.120]  have to get out and push that's what they need to do so the government has to
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:00.880]  keep stop encouraging the able body to to go on a free ride
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:04.880]  and then ask for sacrifice by saying that the people who are pulling the car
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:08.560]  need to pull harder so that the people in the in the ride in the wagon can get a
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:11.440]  smoother ride well there's no doubt that government
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:16.560]  dependency has created a monstrous groups across this nation in the world
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:21.600]  entitled dumb down crime loving people on average
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:25.120]  and it's killing us the problem is government is going to use those people
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:28.480]  as their army to rob what's left of the middle class peer
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:32.480]  and and the biggest irony is the very people who think they're benefiting
[02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:36.080]  from the government largress those are the ones whose standard of living
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:39.440]  is being diminished the most if we just got the government out of the way
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:44.000]  they would enjoy a much better quality of life in a vibrant free economy
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  but you know the government has got them so used to this free this these free
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.360]  checks and they're living still in poverty they have no idea
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:54.560]  how much better their lives would be if they had freedom
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.880]  instead of government dole that's right in the last two minutes we've got left
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:03.200]  we know they're not listening to your advice they're demonizing ron paul
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:06.880]  they're probably not going to change course until things get even worse
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:10.480]  so what's going to happen in the short term hey in the short term
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:13.280]  there's no way to know i mean as i said i think the markets are going to be
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.680]  under pressure until the fed caves and caving means
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:20.720]  giving in on the qe coming out with a bigger plan
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:24.720]  of more asset purchases whether it's bonds mortgages who knows
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:27.840]  but i think the fed is going to commit to additional
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:31.920]  money printing and and then you know then the markets will rally and gold will
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:35.440]  rally more and oil will rally more that's what's going to happen
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:40.320]  but in the interim can we see the dollar and the gold market at a bond market
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:44.080]  reverse this pattern i mean are people going to wake up right now people
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:48.320]  are buying the dollar and treasuries as if those are the safe havens
[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:52.240]  they're not the safe havens at all i think that's where the most risk lies
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:56.160]  so i think we need to see a change of perception among the world as to
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:58:00.240]  exactly what is safe and what is risky i think when that happens
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:03.760]  then we see a much bigger crisis here in the us because we are benefiting
[02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:07.360]  from the perception that there's safety in the dollar and in treasuries
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.960]  but as long as that happens it only exacerbates the imbalances
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:14.800]  it lets our government go deeper into debt it screws up our economy even more
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:17.840]  yeah we benefit in the short run because we can consume a little bit more and go
[02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:20.960]  a little bit deeper into debt but all that's going to come back to bite us in
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:24.000]  the end sure as it has been peter ship thanks for spending
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:27.040]  time with us here all right ladies and gentlemen that's
