[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:22.080]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.080 --> 00:31.280]  Okay, my friends, we are live. It is Columbus Day, the 10th day of October, 2011. On this live,
[00:31.280 --> 00:35.640]  Monday edition, we're going to be here for the next three hours live. Then, of course,
[00:35.640 --> 00:42.920]  back tonight, 7 p.m. Central, 8 p.m. Eastern, for Info Wars Nightly News. And we're working on
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.800]  getting a whole bunch of different guests on the Nightly News tonight, but that'll be a surprise.
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.320]  And we've got some really big guests coming up throughout the week. Also, one of my favorites
[00:54.320 --> 01:00.200]  and also extremely famous musicians is saying he's probably going to come visit me next week or the
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.040]  week after and stay at my house here in Austin. And that musician, if that does happen, will be in
[01:05.040 --> 01:11.400]  studio with us. So, I'm extremely excited about that coming up next week. Certainly, a lot of
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.000]  people out there are awake and waking up even further and waking up others around them. It is
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.840]  extremely exciting. And it was so wonderful. I didn't talk enough about this yesterday because
[01:21.840 --> 01:31.840]  I'm just so polaxed by it, so lightning struck by it, that it's just so good to see the liberty and
[01:31.840 --> 01:40.520]  the burning spirit of freedom in the eyes of anti-fellow reserve demonstrators calling for an
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.360]  end of the private banking dictatorship over the United States and the world at the big,
[01:45.360 --> 01:52.120]  successful event in Dallas, Houston, and then in the pouring rain in San Antonio yesterday. Just
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.160]  incredible. It was so good seeing all of you out there. And I'd like to open the phones up for
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.880]  people that are protesting the Federal Reserve and calling for a return of the Glass-Steagall Act
[02:00.880 --> 02:06.160]  and for the Federal Reserve to be audited and then abolished. I'd like to talk to people who have
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.320]  been at Occupy Wall Street events, specifically if you've been at in the Fed events or Occupy
[02:11.320 --> 02:18.440]  Wall Street events. And clearly now the Democrats have tried to co-opt the entire Occupy Wall
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.240]  Street movement. That was my point a few weeks ago is I don't want to see it turned in to just
[02:23.240 --> 02:30.640]  more class warfare and a call for collectivism that we've been seeing. And now that's definitely
[02:30.640 --> 02:37.840]  how the liberal and conservative mainstream media have framed it. But is that really what's
[02:37.840 --> 02:42.800]  happening on the streets? We see a lot of people that are part of the Occupy Wall Street movement
[02:42.800 --> 02:50.200]  that are awake right now. But we also see the unions and others coming in and clearly at least
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.560]  as far as media coverage taking it over. And I did see some Occupy Dallas people that were upset
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.400]  with us somehow thought that, you know, occupying the Fed was the wrong thing, but others from their
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.120]  group came over and understood what we were doing. I know that there was some Occupy Houston
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.880]  people that were big supporters of ending the Fed, but also a few at first that thought that,
[03:12.880 --> 03:18.720]  you know, that we weren't on their side till I explained we were. And then in Occupy the Fed in
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.600]  San Antonio, Matt Medina has been hanging out with them for several weeks. And it was grassroots.
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.640]  And a week ago he was telling us they were great until moveon.org came in and did take it over.
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.040]  And they said, no Ron Paul, no Alex Jones. We have an interview from in the Fed yesterday in
[03:34.040 --> 03:40.960]  San Antonio, powerful with Matt Medina that if I can get it cold out of all the hours of video
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.200]  we have that we'll be airing tonight. The guy that knows where everything is is Rob Dew. But I
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.480]  told him go ahead and take today off because he hadn't seen his children in three days. So Rob
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.640]  Dew, I took to do camera work and who heads up in fours nightly news. He's not here. And we've
[03:54.640 --> 03:57.920]  kind of got a skeleton crew today. We're going to try to dig through all that incredible footage
[03:57.920 --> 04:04.400]  and bring that to you on the nightly news tonight and of course more by tomorrow here on the radio.
[04:04.400 --> 04:15.520]  I have a correction to make also and I'll play the video again. The headline is police admit
[04:15.520 --> 04:21.400]  that the Federal Reserve is private. But after I watched the video, you know, you're there,
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.880]  you do the interview. I told do, hey, get it ready when we got back yesterday afternoon and to do
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.880]  the Sunday show. I said, go get the footage of those cops ready and make the Federal Reserve
[04:29.880 --> 04:35.280]  private. And then by the time I watched it for the first time when we aired it, you watched it
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.960]  for the first time through a camera, not through my own eyes. The cops like, I don't know if it's
[04:39.960 --> 04:47.000]  federal or not. And he goes, is it captain? And the captain says, yeah, it is private. We are
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.600]  private. That was the head of Federal Reserve security. I've since checked his name. And so
[04:52.600 --> 04:58.200]  that wasn't a cop. The Federal Reserve security admits they're private. We'll be right back. Stay
[04:58.200 --> 05:06.360]  with us. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[05:06.360 --> 05:12.280]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[05:12.280 --> 05:18.360]  underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress. And they
[05:18.360 --> 05:24.440]  really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[05:24.440 --> 05:30.920]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held
[05:30.920 --> 05:35.960]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[05:35.960 --> 05:40.280]  Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying,
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.920]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[05:44.920 --> 05:51.960]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[06:59.640 --> 07:04.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[07:04.200 --> 07:08.520]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.640]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[07:13.640 --> 07:19.160]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[07:19.160 --> 07:24.280]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[07:24.280 --> 07:29.560]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[07:29.560 --> 07:34.200]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from
[07:34.200 --> 07:39.480]  weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.480]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[07:43.480 --> 07:49.640]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[08:01.160 --> 08:12.360]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:16.040 --> 08:23.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Columbus Day 2011 on this 10-10 transmission. We're going to be
[08:23.720 --> 08:29.480]  live here for the next three hours. Obviously, I am your host, Alex Jones. I want to run down some
[08:29.480 --> 08:35.400]  of the top stories and big developments taking place in our nation and across the globe. We're
[08:35.400 --> 08:40.920]  going to have Kurt Haskell popping in for about one segment today. He's the lawyer who survived the
[08:40.920 --> 08:47.160]  Christmas Day underwear bombing now almost two years ago along with his wife and saw the underwear
[08:47.160 --> 08:52.600]  bomber being gotten on the plane by the sharp-dressed man and ordering them to let him on without
[08:52.600 --> 08:58.120]  credentials. Of course, then it came out a month and a half later that indeed the U.S. State Department
[08:58.120 --> 09:04.680]  had been ordered to give him a visa and get him on the aircraft without a passport. That was
[09:04.680 --> 09:11.640]  confirmed. The underwear bomber was gotten on the plane by the U.S. government and he has now been
[09:11.640 --> 09:17.800]  at the trial and has talked to the standby lawyers and others who do believe it is a staged event
[09:17.800 --> 09:24.760]  and that Mataulub is either completely mentally ill, under mind control, or has had his family
[09:24.760 --> 09:29.640]  threatened. He's saying, I don't want the lawyers. I did it. That's the way it is. I don't want to
[09:29.640 --> 09:36.600]  discuss the people that got me on the plane. I don't want to talk about it. Just like McVay told
[09:38.520 --> 09:42.440]  other people on death row with him, yeah, they're going to kill my family if I don't say I did this.
[09:42.440 --> 09:49.160]  And, of course, we have Jane Graham from the federal building, the head of HUD, who saw McVay
[09:49.160 --> 09:54.040]  with known federal agents putting what she thought was telephone wire in the day before the attack
[09:54.040 --> 10:00.040]  along with a bunch of other witnesses. Of course, those witnesses had to be killed, police officers
[10:00.040 --> 10:06.520]  and others like Terence Yeke. Oh, but the government holder wouldn't do something like that. He was
[10:06.520 --> 10:13.320]  the deputy head of the Justice Department at the time. His emails and lawsuits have been released
[10:13.320 --> 10:19.480]  where he talks about this is a D-Day situation, maximum alert. We've got to get down to Oklahoma
[10:19.480 --> 10:24.920]  City and cover this up. I've shown those emails here on air. They've come out in major newspapers
[10:24.920 --> 10:31.160]  a few years ago, thanks to lawsuits by Jesse Trinadu, the lawyer, trying to find out why
[10:31.160 --> 10:34.680]  they tortured his brother to death. Well, they thought he was John Doe number two. He looked
[10:34.680 --> 10:41.480]  just like him, picked up an internal border checkpoint and drug off to be tortured to death.
[10:42.280 --> 10:51.960]  And the same holder caught now shipping, in one case, 2,000 guns directly to the Sinaloa cartel.
[10:51.960 --> 11:02.040]  Of course, you remember, let me just turn off this fan.
[11:06.840 --> 11:10.360]  They put a nice air filter in here, even though I didn't request it. And then it's always on
[11:10.360 --> 11:17.160]  when I start the show. I don't know. It must automatically turn on its own because every day
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.080]  I got to like go turn that off. I hear like Darth Vader breathing in the background. It's that
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.800]  air filter over there. Going back to what I was saying here.
[11:32.440 --> 11:40.440]  This is the same Eric Holder who has been caught. You see, when they started getting caught
[11:41.320 --> 11:46.920]  six months ago or so, when their own agent said, I'm angry, something's fishy here.
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.960]  We were ordered to go tell gun shops to set up cameras and then surveil people coming in and
[11:51.960 --> 11:58.840]  buying guns. When CBS News broke that, it was because they knew that there was a whole rebellion
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.440]  going on inside the ATF to these crimes. And that it was starting to come out in federal
[12:04.440 --> 12:10.680]  courts separately. It was really an Iran contra type deal with cocaine allowed to be shipped in
[12:10.680 --> 12:17.080]  and guns shipped into Sinaloa and others for a drug war by the Federal Reserve against cartels
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.920]  not laundering their money through the big globalist banks. I mean, if you go back over six
[12:22.920 --> 12:31.320]  months ago, if you go back in February, I guess eight months ago, you will read prisonplanet.com
[12:31.320 --> 12:37.400]  articles by Paul Watson about the federal court hearings where the feds were declaring national
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.560]  security concerning cocaine and different drug cartels authorized to bring the cocaine in.
[12:43.560 --> 12:49.720]  And then separately, the media reports, oh, by the way, the same cartels that are being sent
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.040]  the guns. And this is really starting to come out. I was listening to Beyond the Beltway,
[12:56.040 --> 13:02.920]  a big syndicated Sunday night news show with what is it named, Bruce Dumont or whatever I met him
[13:02.920 --> 13:08.360]  once, pretty nice guy. And he was saying, oh, this fast and furious, it goes a lot deeper than just
[13:08.360 --> 13:13.880]  guns. As we've seen in some of the Chicago papers, this is going to be coming out. The White House
[13:13.880 --> 13:21.000]  isn't going to get away with this one. But he didn't go forward and tell you what's in the El Paso
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.960]  Times or the Houston Chronicle or the Honolulu advertiser. These are a few of the papers that
[13:25.960 --> 13:31.480]  have had the courage to report on this stuff six, eight months after we did. And I'm not tooting
[13:31.480 --> 13:37.320]  our horn, the narcosphere, narco news, there's all these other sites that we're reporting on at the
[13:37.320 --> 13:43.320]  same time as us as well. And our listeners ferreting through the federal court cases and sending us
[13:43.320 --> 13:49.960]  emails pointing out the different filings in the federal docket and the Homeland Security Justice
[13:49.960 --> 13:58.600]  Department declaring national security. So we have a president with an attorney general who
[13:58.600 --> 14:05.160]  quote said, get down to Oklahoma and cover this up. Cover it up because cops showed up in the
[14:05.160 --> 14:11.240]  Oklahoma Police Department and said, why are you ATF 30 seconds after the blast? Why are you all in
[14:11.240 --> 14:17.960]  your bomb gear? And why are you ordering ambulances that are showing up to put bandages on you and
[14:17.960 --> 14:27.240]  say you were on the ninth floor? What's going on here? By the way, you guys were doing a drill
[14:27.240 --> 14:34.040]  here yesterday. What's going on? And the cops all saw the bombs being removed that didn't go off
[14:34.040 --> 14:37.880]  because McVay and others didn't wire them right inside the building.
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.880]  McVay, of course, was angry. He knew he was deep covered and was supposed to be setting up militias
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.560]  and right wing groups. He'd been sheep dipped special forces. And he wasn't as smart as a
[14:53.560 --> 15:00.360]  mod salon who a few years before Oklahoma City was hired by the CIA. He was an Egyptian
[15:00.360 --> 15:07.080]  security force agent trained in the US to cook the bomb, train the driver. First it was going to
[15:07.080 --> 15:13.640]  be a fake bomb. Then it was going to be a real bomb with fake detonators, then real detonators
[15:13.640 --> 15:18.520]  because they needed that to really bust the group. He was leading the group and then he found
[15:18.520 --> 15:22.280]  they were going to set him up. So he recorded them saying go ahead with the bombing and was
[15:22.280 --> 15:26.920]  smart enough the day after the First World Trade Center bombing to come out and say this was all
[15:26.920 --> 15:33.560]  a big shut up and to release the tapes. And it was in CBS News and New York Times. Or he would
[15:33.560 --> 15:40.120]  have been on the news as the mastermind, as the McVay, as the bin Laden, as the Lee Harvey Oswald.
[15:40.120 --> 15:45.400]  Remember that when you work for these globalists, they're always going to set patsies up, usually
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.680]  their own agents, like Muhammad Atta. We know he was trained at US bases. The head of the Defense
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.720]  Language School went public and said this guy trained in my school out in Monterey, California,
[15:55.720 --> 16:00.040]  Colonel Butler, was told to shut up or he'd be court-martialed. We know even Time Magazine reported
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.120]  they were trained at bases. We know they were taken part in security drills in the months before
[16:04.120 --> 16:09.240]  getting on and off planes. We know James Woods, the actor, saw it and reported it, was told don't
[16:09.240 --> 16:18.920]  talk about this. It's always the same. And so you've got the same attorney general who was the
[16:18.920 --> 16:24.920]  deputy attorney general at the time, caught. They only had the cameras inside the gun shops
[16:24.920 --> 16:30.760]  to later claim that it was drug cartel people coming in to buy guns. And they were just tracking
[16:30.760 --> 16:34.760]  it and showing how the Second Amendment was causing the problems in Mexico. The truth was,
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.520]  it was ATF agents and informants from other branches, unknown to the other ATF, coming in and
[16:40.520 --> 16:48.120]  buying thousands and delivering them as we reported six months ago. And as the Mexican TV reported
[16:48.120 --> 16:53.880]  three months ago, it's been all over Mexican national TV. Their own police coming out now
[16:53.880 --> 16:59.400]  and saying this cartel works for the US government. They're being protected. They ship the guns directly
[16:59.400 --> 17:11.720]  into Mexico. So see, they hope that Issa can control this and just keep this about, oh my goodness,
[17:11.720 --> 17:21.720]  they screwed up on this sting and a holder lied to us. And about the fact that he knew,
[17:21.720 --> 17:27.080]  of course he knew, he gave a speech two years ago about fashion furious. The memos have come out,
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.160]  the minutes of his meetings, of course he lied and holder is going to continue to lie.
[17:33.960 --> 17:39.640]  Because Sena Loa has filed in federal court that five and a half years ago, they had this deal
[17:39.640 --> 17:45.480]  going with the FBI, ATF, DEA, Coast Guard, Border Patrol. That's why when I drive through a Border
[17:45.480 --> 17:52.680]  Patrol checkpoint, 98 miles into the US, like I did two weeks ago, a week and a half ago,
[17:53.640 --> 17:58.120]  and the guys just mind if I search your car and I go, I look at them and I say it's well known.
[17:58.120 --> 18:03.800]  The US government ships in the drugs. I mean, I'm not playing along with your stupid games
[18:03.800 --> 18:10.120]  anymore where you're all pulling me over and you got me drugs. Gee, I don't know. Do I have any of
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.680]  what the government ships in? Hoping I'm dumb enough to use it so you can throw me in a big
[18:15.320 --> 18:20.680]  private bank owned private prison owned by drug dealers. You got to love this thing. The drug
[18:20.680 --> 18:25.640]  dealers ship the drugs in, they make it illegal to jack up the price. The public goes out and
[18:25.640 --> 18:30.120]  robs everything to buy the overpriced drugs to pay the tax money for the drugs into the
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.640]  federal reserve. It's an official tax. And then if you're dumb enough to be caught using it,
[18:35.160 --> 18:38.840]  they put you in one of their private prisons. And there's been big studies we've covered here
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.280]  on air where the big four private prisons are owned and subsidiaries of the big federal reserve
[18:44.280 --> 18:50.280]  megabanks that are the drug launderers. Now, these drug dealers have got it figured out.
[18:50.280 --> 18:54.440]  They sell you their product. They keep it illegal to keep the price up. And then they
[18:54.440 --> 18:58.920]  put you in their prisons and then SWAT teams bust down doors and go to the wrong houses and kill
[18:58.920 --> 19:04.120]  people all the time looking for drugs that the federal government shipped in through client
[19:04.120 --> 19:09.160]  cartels. That's how you bring down a society. That's full spectrum dominance.
[19:12.360 --> 19:16.280]  That's just how terrorism works. A lot of times the terrorists don't even know they're funded
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.840]  by Western corporations and the Pentagon, but it comes out over and over again. They are
[19:22.520 --> 19:27.080]  Pentagon federal reserve money goes directly to jihadis and little villages where their
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.560]  mommy and daddy got killed by a drone and they're ready to kill. And they never know they're the
[19:31.560 --> 19:37.240]  other whole attack is financed right through to the point. Why? Because the globalists need to
[19:37.240 --> 19:42.120]  have attacks on the West to take our liberties and to have a pretext to keep invading these countries.
[19:42.840 --> 19:47.400]  Now you see full spectrum dominance, not this side against that side, full spectrum,
[19:47.400 --> 19:53.480]  three dimensional analysis. That's how the whole world works. It's all a big play and I'm not
[19:53.480 --> 19:57.240]  taking part in it. You understand that? I'll give you the rest of the news, the phone number to
[19:57.240 --> 20:03.560]  call in and more when we come back. Stay with us. Smokers, are you still smoking traditional

[21:26.120 --> 21:33.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors

[21:39.000 --> 21:43.800]  the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about

[24:02.360 --> 24:06.920]  All right, I'm going to finish up with the past and furious. Then I'm going to get into some other
[24:06.920 --> 24:13.000]  news and give the phones out, the phone number out for people that have been in the Fed demonstrations
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.280]  or at Occupy Wall Street demonstrations to give us your take on what's happening in this country.
[24:19.160 --> 24:24.040]  Now, I got criticized back when I said, look, the mainline Republicans are trying to take over the
[24:24.040 --> 24:29.720]  Tea Party. And then when they were somewhat successful, not totally successful, I would then
[24:30.280 --> 24:36.120]  be told by the official Tea Party people, Alex Jones, you're not welcome in a movement that
[24:36.120 --> 24:42.680]  myself and other Ron Paul supporters started more than four years ago. That's the type of garbage
[24:43.320 --> 24:48.040]  that I put up with on a routine basis. And it's the same thing here. I understand Wall
[24:48.040 --> 24:53.320]  Street's been taken over by corrupt interest. That is who dominates this country in a general sense.
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.880]  Most of Wall Street's free market and great. And it's preyed upon by the big brokerage firms,
[24:57.880 --> 25:06.600]  the mega insurance companies that are openly owned by the big six mega banks and their subsidiaries. So
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.480]  the establishment's very good though at spinning what we've said and what we've done.
[25:11.480 --> 25:17.080]  I come out a few weeks ago and I say, look, I've been looking at this move on.org democratic
[25:17.080 --> 25:22.680]  operatives, Al Gore calling for Arab Spring, George Soros connected groups. They want to make
[25:22.680 --> 25:28.200]  revolution about class envy, class warfare, playing the poor and disenfranchised off
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.280]  against the middle class instead of against the monopoly capitalist.
[25:34.760 --> 25:43.080]  The crony operatives, the mafia types. And that's all this is. And sure enough, it's happened again.
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.440]  Sure enough, listening to mainline talk radio, there, every one of these occupied Wall Street
[25:48.440 --> 25:54.600]  people is a dirty commie and evil and horrible and Wall Street's perfect and blah, blah, blah.
[25:55.160 --> 25:58.920]  Nothing about the Federal Reserve and Herman Cain, the former head of the Federal Reserve,
[25:58.920 --> 26:05.320]  Kansas City, he will save us with a new sales tax paid to the bankers, which is their global plank
[26:05.320 --> 26:10.040]  to set up world government. Every country have VAT and sales taxes paid to them. Europe's expanding
[26:10.040 --> 26:15.080]  it right now to quote, pay off what they owe because banker operatives, central bank operatives
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.000]  have gotten the countries to shine on to their fraudulent derivatives debt. I mean, it's all
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.120]  happening according to their plan. Sure, we got a lot of folks awake. And sure, the Republicans
[26:24.120 --> 26:29.720]  haven't been fully able to take over the Tea Party. The Democrats haven't been able to fully
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.840]  take over the other opposition movement, the Occupy Wall Street, but they're trying.
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.800]  They're trying. And it doesn't matter if they don't take it over in reality, because the way
[26:39.800 --> 26:47.720]  they cherry picked the interviews on NPR and CNN and MSNBC, isn't it great? The demonstrators want
[26:47.720 --> 26:52.600]  a $20 minimum wage and free healthcare and free college and free everything and an end
[26:52.600 --> 26:59.960]  to the rich and a redistribution of wealth led by Warren Buffett and Al Gore and the Federal
[26:59.960 --> 27:07.160]  Reserve is in solidarity with them and feels their pain. And then the right is led by Herman
[27:07.160 --> 27:13.400]  Cain going, the Federal Reserve is your friend. Why, if you aren't rich, it's your fault. No
[27:13.400 --> 27:20.040]  discussion. No discussion about tens of trillions of dollars in bailout money to the private
[27:20.040 --> 27:25.240]  Federal Reserve shareholders. No, I just get to hear Herman Cain go, look at you dirty,
[27:25.240 --> 27:33.560]  lazy people out there, want some government money. This literal gangster of the New World Order
[27:33.560 --> 27:40.440]  pushing new taxes, the feds over sales taxes nationwide. Can you, I've told you for 16 years
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.640]  this was coming and I told you when they got time for it, they were going to keep the income tax
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.480]  and the social security, they're going to rename them. You're going to have an income tax, a social
[27:51.480 --> 28:00.040]  security tax and a sales tax and probably a VAT on top of it. The 999 program make me throw up
[28:00.040 --> 28:09.080]  nine times nine times nine. Flip those 999s over, you get 666. Man, I tell you, I know every one
[28:09.080 --> 28:13.240]  of their games, I know every one of their playbooks and it didn't even hard. That's what's frustrating
[28:13.240 --> 28:20.760]  about it. We start knocking down Perry, exposing his record up pops Cain. He gets number three in
[28:20.760 --> 28:25.720]  a state, number two in Florida. Boom, they say he's the winner. He goes to number one overnight.
[28:25.720 --> 28:29.640]  Ron Paul's been the number two or three position for six months. If they had just said he was the
[28:29.640 --> 28:36.600]  winner, he'd be in the number one position. But they've got to have Ron Paul lookalikes and to the
[28:36.600 --> 28:44.840]  untrained mainline middle America conservative constitutionalist Herman Cain looks good. He
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.120]  talks a good talk on the second amendment, talks a good talk on a few other issues,
[28:50.120 --> 28:58.120]  but at the end of the day, he is a corporatist. I mean, he comes from the top of the pyramid
[28:58.120 --> 28:59.960]  right out of the fellow reserve.
[29:02.040 --> 29:03.880]  Herman Cain is super bad news,
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.560]  but Republicans are not racist by the way on average. I've grown up a white person,
[29:11.560 --> 29:18.040]  grown up around a bunch of Republicans. They are guilt ridden just like liberals and they want to
[29:18.040 --> 29:25.800]  elect a black man bad just like Democrats did to like prove something, but it won't matter
[29:25.800 --> 29:30.840]  once Cain gets up there because they'll make it all about him being black instead of about the issues.
[29:33.080 --> 29:37.800]  Believe me, if they had a Ron Paul that was black, the globalist would kill him dead in a hammer
[29:37.800 --> 29:43.240]  in two seconds flat. And there are black Ron Pauls out there. All right, they need to step to
[29:43.240 --> 29:46.600]  the plate though. All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us. I'm going to break it all down.
[29:46.600 --> 29:47.160]  Stay with us.
[29:47.160 --> 29:56.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.680 --> 30:06.120]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[30:07.320 --> 30:12.440]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[30:12.440 --> 30:19.240]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[30:21.160 --> 30:27.560]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[30:29.480 --> 30:33.640]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[30:34.280 --> 30:39.320]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[30:39.320 --> 30:46.120]  We turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[31:21.800 --> 31:27.400]  Now being expanded nationwide, this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[31:27.400 --> 31:32.440]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth
[31:32.440 --> 31:38.520]  to which our republic has fallen. Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[31:38.520 --> 31:44.440]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[31:44.440 --> 31:49.960]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[32:04.200 --> 32:09.720]  to crash and recrash daily. Since July, the market has dropped 15% with no signs of recovery.
[32:09.720 --> 32:14.680]  What does that mean to you? When stocks crash, jobs are lost and you can't buy the food that's
[32:14.680 --> 32:19.960]  already too expensive and continues to raise in cost. eFoods just got noticed that wholesale costs
[32:19.960 --> 32:25.880]  on pasta, rice and beans will immediately jump 20%. The already high cost of sugar is tripling.
[32:25.880 --> 32:30.680]  If you invest in the stock market for security or save money in the bank, you continue to see the
[32:30.680 --> 32:35.160]  dollar drop in value while your weekly food bills increase. So what are you going to do?

[33:15.560 --> 33:18.440]  All right, we are back live. Let me give you the toll-free number.
[33:19.080 --> 33:22.840]  You don't normally screen your calls, but occasionally I say I'd like people to call
[33:22.840 --> 33:29.880]  in on a specific subject. Are you part of Occupy Wall Street? You agree with my analysis
[33:29.880 --> 33:34.360]  with the predictions we made about this movement? Or do you disagree? Or do you have another point
[33:34.360 --> 33:39.960]  you want to make? Have you been part of the in the Fed events now spontaneously popping up all over
[33:39.960 --> 33:45.960]  the country? My dad just called me right before I went back on air a minute ago and said there's
[33:45.960 --> 33:52.040]  some in the Fed demonstrations in Austin tonight and that he's heard of others around the country
[33:52.040 --> 33:55.480]  and he said he texted it to me, but I didn't have time to read it yet. So I'll tell you,
[33:55.480 --> 34:00.680]  tell you more about that as it develops. But I'm seeing now in the Fed stuff just happening all
[34:00.680 --> 34:06.760]  over the country. And sometimes there's 10 people, sometimes there's 500. I mean, this is exciting.
[34:07.320 --> 34:13.640]  We need to go after the big six megabanks that have been orchestrating the Ponzi scheme to
[34:13.640 --> 34:19.880]  bankrupt this country by design. I mean, I know for a fact the private Federal Reserve goes into
[34:19.880 --> 34:26.120]  local areas and recruits the local wealthy and kind of gives them inside cues and things
[34:27.400 --> 34:30.360]  on how they can avoid what's happening. And I talked to a fella
[34:32.040 --> 34:36.680]  who was at the Houston in the Fed thing Saturday and he said the name of it, it's one of the big
[34:36.680 --> 34:42.200]  chain funeral homes down there. And that's big money. And he said, yeah, my grandpa owns this
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.800]  big funeral home chain. He got invited to this, this, this Houston branch of the Fed and they had
[34:47.800 --> 34:53.000]  the Fed economists there and told them this is in confidence in a dark room with like 20 people
[34:53.720 --> 34:56.600]  and said, this is how you protect yourself from the coming collapse.
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.440]  And well, people need to speak out about that. That's how the Federal Reserve has gotten America
[35:04.440 --> 35:11.160]  to go along with this. They go to your local wealthy people who aren't part of the elite,
[35:11.160 --> 35:16.040]  but are at that next level because the elite know if they don't have the, the, the wealthy
[35:16.040 --> 35:22.200]  new variation, the new wealth, they won't get it through. So so much of what the CFR, the Federal
[35:22.200 --> 35:29.880]  Reserve does is about recruiting anybody who pops up. I mean, look, I'm not special that when I was
[35:30.600 --> 35:37.160]  22 years old and it just been on air for about a year. I had high power democratic party operatives
[35:37.160 --> 35:42.280]  calling me. I had Republican party operatives calling me. They'd say, well, so be an off the record
[35:42.280 --> 35:46.840]  dinner. And I'm, you know, as a journalist, I learned that quick, even taking community college,
[35:46.840 --> 35:51.240]  don't give up the source. And then they would just be like, you know, Bill Clinton's good.
[35:51.240 --> 35:55.560]  You ought to come be part of the Democrats. You know, we'll really make you go far. Same thing
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.440]  on the Republicans. It wasn't that I was special. I knew enough about history then to understand
[36:00.440 --> 36:06.680]  that they were going around to anybody stuck their head up. They come to you and they say,
[36:06.680 --> 36:13.240]  you want to join this, be part of the winning team. The analogy of that is they live where
[36:13.240 --> 36:18.200]  rowdy Piper, you know, gets under the city and sees the aliens that are taken over society,
[36:19.240 --> 36:23.160]  you know, dressed in their suits. And you can only see them if you're wearing your sunglasses.
[36:23.160 --> 36:27.240]  And it's all a bunch of humans in there. It's all the humans that teamed up with them to sell
[36:27.240 --> 36:31.800]  it her body out. That's the analogy. And you put the sunglasses on, you know, rowdy Piper's
[36:31.800 --> 36:39.240]  got to beat up the black guy that he befriends to finally make him put the sunglasses on.
[36:40.920 --> 36:44.280]  My dad's calling again over and over again. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, what's going on?
[36:46.840 --> 36:50.360]  Okay, it's in Dallas. Well, I couldn't tell it was 15 seconds before I went live and
[36:50.360 --> 36:53.240]  he was saying, okay, I got to go. I got to go. Thanks.
[36:55.160 --> 36:58.440]  Man, I tell you, I got to start keeping this phone outside out there. It just rings off the
[36:58.440 --> 37:01.960]  hook. Well, you guys come get this and just get it out of here. And Kurt's out here with an obvious
[37:01.960 --> 37:07.320]  question. Come on in, Kurt. Not mad at my dad calling. It's just that I could tell if he's
[37:07.320 --> 37:11.480]  calling up like five times earlier. And then again, here you go. He's excited about it in the Fed.
[37:11.480 --> 37:18.520]  What's going on, Kurt? They say the name of it. They say the name on the video. In fact,
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.360]  Kurt, just come on in since we're doing this now. Let's just have a discussion in here right now.
[37:22.360 --> 37:29.080]  Go ahead and wheel Kurt a chair in. Go ahead and wheel him a chair in here.
[37:31.480 --> 37:35.320]  This is what goes on behind the scenes around here. We can go ahead and go to
[37:35.320 --> 37:38.920]  this camera over here if it's hooked up. Or to that camera right there is probably the robot
[37:38.920 --> 37:45.960]  we want to go to over there on Kurt. Kurt Nemo in studio with us. This is what happens around here.
[37:45.960 --> 37:53.720]  I ran back during the break to his office on the other side of our aircraft carrier size
[37:53.720 --> 37:59.640]  office. And I went over there and I said, listen, we've made a mistake. We've got to correct it.
[38:00.200 --> 38:07.160]  But it's a good mistake. And so I said, I want a headline that head of federal reserve security
[38:07.160 --> 38:16.120]  admits Fed is private because yesterday I was there live in the thick of it in San Antonio,
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.520]  where 150 people are so showed up in the pouring down rain want to salute all of you
[38:21.320 --> 38:28.120]  from 10 a.m. to noon. And I got back to Austin about two o'clock and got up here to get ready
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.160]  for the show. And I told Rob, do I said, before you go home, please get me the clip of the cops
[38:33.160 --> 38:38.200]  admitting that the federal reserve was private. We had to get off their private property.
[38:39.320 --> 38:45.720]  Now, when the video then got loaded and already named on YouTube as police admit
[38:45.720 --> 38:53.640]  federal reserve is private, once I saw it on air, I realized that the reason I've got Kurt here is
[38:53.640 --> 38:56.200]  I'd have to tell him this later. So he's just here getting it right now. And then we're going to
[38:56.200 --> 38:59.960]  talk to Kurt about it in a moment because Kurt immediately saw this is bigger than even the cops
[38:59.960 --> 39:04.120]  saying it's private. We know it's private, but the sheeple were taught for decades
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.760]  by neocon talk show host and other that the Fed was federal and that we were liars and they've
[39:08.760 --> 39:15.400]  got police APBs out and special training manual saying it is federal. Those that say it isn't
[39:15.400 --> 39:21.160]  or evil, you know, they tell cops this. So I was being laughed at at the Dallas Fed by
[39:21.160 --> 39:24.520]  some of the cops saying it was private, even though they had signs up saying private property
[39:24.520 --> 39:32.040]  keep out with a big cage around it. I was there trying to expose all of this. And so as soon
[39:32.040 --> 39:40.520]  as I air it yesterday, because remember, I saw it myself live, not on tape. And if people yell
[39:40.520 --> 39:47.800]  and screaming, the cops show up one of them in San Antonio police uniform. And you get used to head
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.440]  cops in plain clothes. That's how it was in Dallas. The head lady cop out there commanding them
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.080]  around. She was public affairs, I guess, you know, she was in plain clothes and looked like,
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.800]  you know, dressed like the security guard head of the Fed. So we are saying police know it's
[40:01.800 --> 40:07.880]  federal. And I even say on the video, we're going to play here in a moment. I say, well,
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.040]  wow, you guys know this is private. I cops usually laugh at me about that because your
[40:12.040 --> 40:18.520]  training manuals say it's federal and we're liars. And the San Antonio cop who's some type of officer
[40:18.520 --> 40:23.160]  you can see it on his shoulders. I guess we can look it up and find out. I think he was a captain
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.440]  as well or something or a lieutenant. I think somebody called him a lieutenant. But the point
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.280]  is I didn't really pay attention. I run over because I'm told I'm around the corner doing an
[40:30.280 --> 40:35.880]  interview with Matt Medina that we're going to air later about how Occupy San Antonio didn't want
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.240]  us there and doesn't like Ron Paul and basically told him, yeah, we do just want socialism now.
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.240]  At first they weren't like that a week and a half ago, but now move on is running it. They're
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.480]  like, we don't want to talk about the Fed like Michael Moore said. We want to end capitalism,
[40:49.480 --> 40:54.200]  which is exactly what the monopoly feds goal is. He not only said that they didn't want to talk about
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.120]  it. He said it was irrelevant. He said it was irrelevant. Move that mic closer to you. And
[40:58.120 --> 41:01.080]  we're going to go to Nemo in a moment. I'm going to give you the number, but just giving you how
[41:01.080 --> 41:06.360]  big this is. Okay. Before we play this clip, we're interviewing Medina around the corner
[41:06.920 --> 41:12.360]  under the eve of the Federal Reserve building that looks like a federal building. It's designed
[41:12.360 --> 41:18.920]  to look like a big post office, gothic federal seals, gothic lettering, gothic building says
[41:18.920 --> 41:24.040]  federal on it. And we're surprised because in Houston and Dallas, the cops showed up.
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.440]  There's no cops there an hour and a half into it, but we see security people up in the windows up
[41:28.440 --> 41:33.320]  on the third or fourth floor looking down on us and waving at us. So I'm interviewing Medina
[41:33.960 --> 41:36.520]  and all of a sudden they go, Hey, the cops are here. They're saying it's private property. We
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.880]  got to go. So the idea is, oh, cops are here. So I run around the other side and you've seen
[41:41.880 --> 41:45.400]  that footage. And I come over to the police officer at San Antonio police officer in his
[41:45.400 --> 41:49.080]  uniform. And I say, this is private. I heard you just said it's private. And he goes, you've
[41:49.080 --> 41:53.560]  got to ask captain such and such and the names on the video. And actually looked it up and found
[41:53.560 --> 41:56.760]  that name as the head of federal reserve security down there. You can call them too, but that is
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.960]  the head of security. And he says, yes, this is private. Please get off the property. If you
[42:01.960 --> 42:06.520]  want to know more, you can call our Dallas head office, which is the head of these four states
[42:06.520 --> 42:09.960]  of all the federal reserve branch banks. That's the head federal reserve where we were Friday.
[42:09.960 --> 42:16.840]  And so then we say, okay, we'll leave. We agree. We know it's private and they leave. But I say to
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.400]  the cop, well, officer, you ought to investigate this. Look at masquerades as a federal building.
[42:21.400 --> 42:25.160]  It says it's federal. It's got what looks like federal seals on it with, you know,
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.240]  Eagles. I said, you ought to investigate and the cops smiling going, yeah, you're right.
[42:30.200 --> 42:34.520]  Because the cop, the cop at first wasn't really smiling. If you watch this video,
[42:34.520 --> 42:38.440]  and when the head of the federal reserve, the head of security says it is private,
[42:38.440 --> 42:43.640]  the cop gets this look and goes, what? Because all these years, you know, this, this head cop,
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.640]  high level officers getting the same manuals, police have given us where they're told we're
[42:47.640 --> 42:54.360]  liars, Ron Paul's a liar. You know, they tell the army, the federal reserve is, is, is federal
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.320]  and that we're lying cooks. And so here's this cop, the sunglasses are going on. Here's the head
[42:59.320 --> 43:05.480]  of security of the federal reserve telling him, no, we're private. Now get off. And the cops start
[43:05.480 --> 43:11.240]  smiling going, what? All these years he's been told that, right? And I had the Dallas cops laughing
[43:11.240 --> 43:17.080]  at me going, you know, when I'm saying this is not federal, they're like, I didn't listen to this guy,
[43:17.080 --> 43:23.160]  man. And I'm like, but the sign says private because they'll have to admit they're being lied to.
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.320]  That's what I mean, folks. It's such a fraud, fake federal buildings with fake federal seals on it.
[43:29.320 --> 43:34.520]  Of course the cops can't believe we're telling the truth because when you admit we're not lying
[43:34.520 --> 43:40.520]  and that we told you the truth, then the dominoes start to fall and you realize you were bamboozled.
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.160]  It's embarrassing when you get conned. You know, when you go to a magician's show,
[43:46.440 --> 43:50.840]  my kids like to go to those sometimes, you know, you tell your kids up front, now this isn't real.
[43:50.840 --> 43:54.040]  But a five or six year old will come out and say, dad, are you sure that wasn't real?
[43:54.040 --> 43:58.920]  They weren't shoving swords to that lady or, you know, he didn't really pull that rabbit out.
[43:58.920 --> 44:04.360]  You gotta tell them, no, it's sleight of hand. Don't be like children, America. Now, now,
[44:04.360 --> 44:08.680]  we're going to play this clip in a moment. But when I ran this morning and so we got to correct
[44:08.680 --> 44:12.440]  this, I've watched it a bunch, I've checked the name, that's the head of Federal Reserve Security.
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.240]  That's the Fed. The head of their security says, call our head Dallas office.
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.080]  That's the guy who'd been upstairs and came down. That's the guy who's silhouette we could see up
[44:25.080 --> 44:29.320]  there waving at. He was there saying, get off the private property. How big is this, Kurt?
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.200]  Well, it's pretty big. Usually federal buildings have signs saying this is federal property.
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.760]  And then this didn't say that. And he said it was private. So there you go. You have an admission
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.800]  from the, from the head of security that that it's not part of the federal government.
[44:43.800 --> 44:48.680]  Now, do hadn't seen his kids in three days. And she's a better father than I because I hadn't
[44:48.680 --> 44:53.240]  really either, but I'm here. But do stayed up here late last night getting all the photos ready
[44:53.240 --> 44:57.560]  off his camera where it says private property with signs. They stuck up behind the fences.
[44:57.560 --> 45:01.000]  They built in Dallas and then right behind it, Federal Reserve with the fake seals.
[45:01.560 --> 45:05.800]  We need to dig that up off of his hard driver or whatever, but I'll try to get John in there to
[45:05.800 --> 45:11.240]  find it. That's why we need more crew folks. We need you to buy the books, buy the videos,
[45:11.240 --> 45:15.880]  buy the tapes, buy the t-shirts, buy the high quality water filters, buy our products,
[45:15.880 --> 45:21.400]  because then I will hire more reporters. I will hire more video editors. A lot of times we can't
[45:21.400 --> 45:25.240]  even get the news out because a holiday comes up and somebody's got to see their kids and this
[45:25.240 --> 45:29.480]  stuff's coming at us so fast. It's coming at us so fast. Kurt, what's it like? Crazy around here.
[45:29.480 --> 45:33.400]  You write like eight articles sometimes a day without me even telling you to, right? Because
[45:33.400 --> 45:37.000]  it's just so much information. You've got to tell people because if you wait more than 24 hours,
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.680]  it's gone. It's irrelevant as they would say. They're very relevant. Like irrelevant is the
[45:42.680 --> 45:47.960]  Federal Reserve. Well, again, we've got to dig out. We've got videos. We've got it on YouTube,
[45:47.960 --> 45:51.880]  but it's shot off the iPhone and uploaded right then where they're admitting it's private and
[45:51.880 --> 45:56.200]  get back to cops in Dallas. Again, the head cops saying, yeah, it's private. Get back. Then the
[45:56.200 --> 46:01.960]  others laughing when we tell them it's private. I mean, it's just total double thing. It's private,
[46:01.960 --> 46:07.880]  but it's not, Kurt. Well, there you go. There's the admission right there. They admitted it.
[46:07.880 --> 46:11.400]  First, they admitted it anyway. They will admit it if you ask them that it's not
[46:11.400 --> 46:13.720]  part of the federal government. You remember 10 years ago they wouldn't.
[46:13.720 --> 46:18.440]  Well, no, you remember like Rush Limbaugh saying, you know, the CFR, it doesn't exist.
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.840]  Right. Now he says it doesn't have any power or that the Federal Reserve is federal. And
[46:22.840 --> 46:25.960]  you know, people calling about it, oh, you're kooks. Yeah, first come to shove,
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.040]  they have to admit it's not a federal agency. Oh, there is to it.
[46:32.040 --> 46:37.720]  You know, you might add to the clip to, you know, a few videos where, where
[46:37.720 --> 46:44.840]  what's his name? Greenspan. A couple years ago on PBS, Larry News Hauer says, well,
[46:45.880 --> 46:51.240]  we are an agency of our own and no one, no one can investigate us. We, we are above the law.
[46:51.880 --> 46:57.480]  He says we, like Cheney said, the vice president's own branch. So they're trying to become government.
[46:57.480 --> 47:01.720]  That's what this euro deal is with the European Central Bank. Same shareholders. They're saying,
[47:02.280 --> 47:06.200]  now countries can never leave the euro and you'll do whatever we say financially
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.680]  in this financial union. That's what they're always after is that government power.
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.960]  So instead of just masquerading as feds or as government or as sovereign, now they are
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.240]  actually trying to become it. Right. What they're trying to do is consolidate the euro
[47:21.240 --> 47:24.520]  and then that way strip all those countries of their sovereignty.
[47:24.520 --> 47:27.800]  They admit it. They admit it. Yes. They go on Larry News Hauer and
[47:28.520 --> 47:32.600]  all these shows and brag about it. Well, we're going to go to break with this video clip
[47:32.600 --> 47:39.160]  from, uh, in the Fed and, um, in San Antonio, this is big news. And so we got to go into the
[47:39.160 --> 47:44.680]  YouTube channel and change the headline from police admit it's private to head of fed security
[47:44.680 --> 47:50.440]  amidst fed rule reserve private. Here's that video. Hey guys, how are you doing? I'm Alex Jones.
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.200]  Good. How are you doing? Still good. Can you just repeat your saying this is private property?
[47:54.200 --> 47:59.320]  Uh, I don't know. Sure. Sure. Go ahead, sir. This is the property of the federal reserve
[47:59.320 --> 48:04.120]  right here. It's not federal, right? Yeah. Private property. I need you to go back to
[48:04.120 --> 48:07.800]  the public street. I think, you know what? It is private property. I think you're right.
[48:07.800 --> 48:11.480]  We will get off. You're absolutely right. Let me just ask you this one question and I'm going
[48:11.480 --> 48:16.040]  to ask everybody to move off the private property. Don't this look like a post office and it's got
[48:16.040 --> 48:22.120]  federal seals on it? Like counterfeiting or something. It'd be like if people opened up a
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.240]  not a fit in counterfeit, do they? I think that's something police are investigating.
[48:25.240 --> 48:29.480]  Yeah. I mean, just down the road, doesn't this kind of look weird? It's a federal building,
[48:29.480 --> 48:32.920]  but it's not federal. I mentioned that to him. They said. Oh, sir. I'm sorry. We're just saying
[48:32.920 --> 48:37.480]  it's not a federal building. It's not a federal building. 10 years ago cops were laughing at that.
[48:37.480 --> 48:41.400]  I'm excited you know. However, however, you're welcome to call our public affairs or call our
[48:41.400 --> 48:44.840]  head office in Dallas and speak with that. No, sir. You've been super nice. You're right.
[48:45.720 --> 48:49.080]  Some people thought it was like a park because it looked like a post office. You're right.
[48:49.080 --> 49:00.280]  Hey, guys, well, they do get our tax money and they do control everything slave. I mean,
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.440]  sure, they are the slave masters, but see that you heard the police officer. He's right.
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.680]  This is private property. So we want our private property. Now that's it's private property of
[49:08.680 --> 49:14.520]  a mafia of a criminal cartel. But nevertheless, it's their private property for now. And until
[49:14.520 --> 49:19.240]  they're indicted and imprisoned, we won't. And until you know, we finally get the audit, we want
[49:19.240 --> 49:24.920]  freedom. We're going to we're going to respect their private property until then. So let's get
[49:24.920 --> 49:29.800]  off the private property of the Federal Reserve right now. Come on, everybody. Let's go.
[49:35.080 --> 49:39.720]  Two days earlier in Dallas, we made a similar discovery at the Fed.
[49:39.720 --> 49:45.560]  Well, rather, they are here protecting our First Amendment. And I wonder how many of these police
[49:45.560 --> 49:53.560]  officers can lead on the sign Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Federal Federal. But right here says
[49:53.560 --> 50:04.520]  private property. Does that sound like you? Can't you investigate it? There's the criminals
[50:04.520 --> 50:15.080]  right there. We didn't have these people. We didn't have these people. Officers, I have a question
[50:15.080 --> 50:22.440]  for you. You're here guarding the private offshore Rothschild Bank of Federal Reserve
[50:22.440 --> 50:28.280]  from evil Americans. Evil, evil Americans. I know you get the Homeland Security Report saying
[50:28.280 --> 50:31.560]  those that don't like the Federal Reserve are evil. I've read the Homeland Security Report
[50:31.560 --> 50:38.520]  until they tell cops the Federal Reserve Federal. We're going to go to break. We're going to go
[50:38.520 --> 50:43.720]  to break and come right back. By the way, there are folks still at the Dallas Federal Reserve
[50:43.720 --> 50:47.720]  protesting and staying there and occupying it. And that's where they're having a demonstration
[50:47.720 --> 50:52.680]  tonight out at a banner hang on a highway. And I'll give you that information coming up. I want
[50:52.680 --> 50:56.520]  to salute those folks. And I'm going to give the number out specifically who goes the head of the
[50:56.520 --> 51:01.000]  line when I give the number out are our folks up there still occupying the Fed. But you're about
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.280]  to hear is the real experience of women over 40 who finally lost weight even around the stubborn
[51:06.280 --> 51:11.880]  belly area. How? By becoming hormonally balanced again. Their secret is the Amberan Slim After

[51:17.640 --> 51:22.280]  You see, deleting cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance. Unless you balance your

[53:01.800 --> 53:07.320]  Solutions from Science and you know, in this economy, it doesn't seem like there is much that
[53:07.320 --> 53:13.480]  any of us can do to cut back on our monthly expenses. That's why I'm excited to tell you about a way
[53:13.480 --> 53:21.160]  to cut your light bill by 90%. Yep, a full 90%. Ultra-efficient LED light bulbs are now available
[53:21.160 --> 53:26.280]  from Solutions from Science. They run cooler, cheaper, and they're guaranteed for 30 years.
[53:26.280 --> 53:31.720]  That's right, 30 years. And with many experts predicting electrical rates could double or
[53:31.720 --> 53:37.960]  triple in the next few years, there has never been a better time to make the switch to high-efficiency
[53:37.960 --> 53:44.440]  LEDs. And here's the best part. These are not old-style LEDs. These are the new cutting-edge
[53:44.440 --> 53:51.000]  LEDs with full spectrum light. You can learn all about the new LEDs by watching my video at
[53:51.000 --> 54:03.320]  ledfreedom.com. I'll show you how to save 90% on your light bill. Go to ledfreedom.com.
[54:03.320 --> 54:08.840]  Okay, we're loaded up within the Fed protesters, occupy Wall Street protesters. There have been
[54:08.840 --> 54:13.560]  many protests against Wall Street excesses and the private fellow reserve. But the mainstream
[54:13.560 --> 54:19.400]  media is giving attention to this now. Why? Because it is the Democratic Party election strategy
[54:19.400 --> 54:24.200]  to co-opt anger at Wall Street. Just like anger at Wall Street and the banker bailouts brought
[54:24.200 --> 54:30.120]  Obama in, even though he was financed by the culprits. By the way, Rahm Emanuel threw him under
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.240]  the bus yesterday saying he probably won't get reelected. Democrats are coming out against him.
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.840]  That's because they want to blame everything on him. He's horrible. But they want to blame it on him
[54:40.840 --> 54:48.680]  and move on to the next puppet. We're going to be talking about that. Also, California bans the
[54:48.680 --> 54:57.480]  use of tanning beds by minors. But meanwhile, Governor Jerry Brown has signed the legislation
[54:58.040 --> 55:06.440]  to allow children to be injected with the Gardasil deadly vaccine without parental consent.
[55:07.240 --> 55:12.040]  So you can get an abortion without mommy and daddy knowing. This is the LA Times reporting on
[55:12.040 --> 55:19.400]  this. You can get a deadly vaccine without mommy and daddy knowing. But you got to get a letter
[55:19.400 --> 55:24.760]  from mommy and daddy to be able to go to the planetarium or the zoo. New law lets 12-year-olds
[55:24.760 --> 55:30.760]  consent to preventative care for STDs. I love how they won't even tell you it's a forced inoculation
[55:30.760 --> 55:33.960]  because they will twist their arms into taking it. I mean, you've seen them in California.
[55:34.680 --> 55:38.840]  The health department going to people's doors saying it's the law. Take the shot.
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.800]  They'll lie to parents. They'll lie to those kids. By the way, they're reportedly going to pay the
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.960]  kids to take it because they care so much about you, the same federal government shipping weapons
[55:49.960 --> 55:54.200]  into Mexico and cocaine into the United States. And here's that news. House committee to subpoena
[55:54.200 --> 56:00.600]  holder in Fast and Furious probe. Will they get into that Fast and Furious under another name was
[56:00.600 --> 56:06.360]  going on two, three years before Obama got in office? Oh, I think not. The special counsel,
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.400]  you'll be assured, won't be getting into the real story that this is part of a drug running
[56:13.400 --> 56:20.120]  operation. No, they will be punished for trying to use it against the Republican party and for
[56:20.120 --> 56:26.120]  trying to use it against the Second Amendment. And that is what Obama did do that was new. He did
[56:26.120 --> 56:31.160]  try to then use it against the Second Amendment. And here's another one. Fast and Furious weapons
[56:31.160 --> 56:37.320]  were found in Mexico cartel enforcers homes by the hundreds. Of course they were delivered directly
[56:37.320 --> 56:45.640]  there by the ATF. That was in federal filings months and months and months ago. In other news,
[56:45.640 --> 56:51.240]  they're imploding the Euro by design. Oh, and nanny state news under new rules. Children are not
[56:51.240 --> 56:58.840]  allowed to have balloons and blow them up because it might help hurt them. But children can have
[56:58.840 --> 57:05.880]  deadly vaccines and still have BPA plastic and eat GMO crops. See, government always likes to
[57:05.880 --> 57:11.480]  act like it's protecting you. But really, it's about an incredible nanny state that quote protects
[57:11.480 --> 57:17.080]  you for things you don't need protecting from. Kind of like million dollar fines for that headline
[57:17.080 --> 57:22.120]  for people with garage sales that are selling recalled items. And it turns out there's tens
[57:22.120 --> 57:27.320]  of thousands of things recalled a year. You've got some target table sold five years ago that's
[57:27.320 --> 57:31.800]  got lead pain in it. You don't know. Here come the federal enforcers all over the country.
[57:32.360 --> 57:40.040]  5,000 fines start out up to a million. Remember that million dollar fine for garage sale was the
[57:40.040 --> 57:46.440]  Fox News headline last year on that. This is the nanny state on steroids. But the good news is
[57:46.440 --> 57:50.520]  we're fighting them. They're saying the time is short for the Eurozone. They've got to give total
[57:50.520 --> 57:55.080]  power to the globalist or they'll implode the Euro fully threatening to take everybody's pension
[57:55.080 --> 57:59.320]  funds so they'll capitulate to the terrorist. That's coming up. We're going to go to break and come
[57:59.320 --> 58:03.960]  right back with your phone calls for the entire next hour and get into some of the other news
[58:03.960 --> 58:09.800]  as well. The good guys that our government help put in in Egypt have killed 20 plus Christians
[58:09.800 --> 58:15.480]  running over them with tanks. It's Tiananmen Square, but hey, it's freedom. So that's being
[58:15.480 --> 58:21.960]  hailed by the media is very loving. Don't forget we do info wars nightly news power packed reports

[58:38.040 --> 58:47.240]  back. This is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.240 --> 58:56.200]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day
[58:56.200 --> 59:01.480]  in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[59:01.480 --> 59:05.720]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your
[59:05.720 --> 59:10.920]  own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions of the years. The crazy part is he's
[59:10.920 --> 59:16.120]  usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest
[59:16.120 --> 59:21.960]  mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently,
[59:21.960 --> 59:26.280]  he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important
[59:26.280 --> 59:31.080]  prediction yet. And it's a real eye opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[59:31.080 --> 59:35.240]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple
[59:35.240 --> 59:41.640]  steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:15.080]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:21.560]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:29.960]  All right. Coming up, the globalists are getting ready to flush Obama. Here's the headline.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:38.360]  Aimless Obama walks alone. 51% don't want second term for President Obama. On and on. That's all
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:44.920]  coming up. We've got Kurt Haskell, who's been at the trial, the underwear bomber popping
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.400]  out to start the next hour. But let's take your calls now. I want to talk to everybody who's been
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.200]  at the demonstrations, either occupied Wall Street or in the Fed and get your take on all of it.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.640]  Let's go ahead and see who's been holding the longest here. That would be Ladd in Texas. Ladd,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:08.040]  thank you, welcome. Hey, how you doing, man? Good. Hey, look, I just wanted to tell you,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.560]  I wanted to mention just a few things. But first thing I wanted to mention about the Houston Federal
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:19.400]  Reserve Building Occupation. Number one, it was just flat out fantastic. I mean, to have the wealth
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.440]  of knowledge and conviction that so many people that were united standing together against the
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.760]  fraudsters that created this mess, man, it was just incredible. I mean, tears almost come to my
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:38.440]  eyes because I wanted to mention the second thing that has meant a lot to me, Alex. What you have
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:45.480]  done for me personally and my family has been incredible. When I saw you, I was at the Houston
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.480]  location. And when I saw you, I told you that my name was Ladd because I'm the ultimate knife guy.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.760]  And you looked at me like I looked familiar. But when I said, yeah, I'm the ultimate knife guy,
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.480]  you said, yeah, I know you look familiar. It was great to finally meet you. You got a great knife.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:08.040]  You know, we've been supporting your website and we've been advertising on your site.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:14.680]  And it's done so much for us even as a small business. I can't even thank you enough for what
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.000]  you've done. You got that Fox Karambit knife because I've watched your video. So that's how
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.200]  I recognize you. And was that your sweet little daughter you had with you? No, actually, that
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:31.000]  was a little girl that was with another family. And when I read what she had,
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.560]  because it was a rulesome monopoly. And I know a lot of your listeners probably already know this,
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:41.080]  but the rules to that monopoly game I saw about two months ago when my wife was reading it to my
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:46.840]  kids and she was laughing. And I said, what's so funny, honey? She said, it's just the last rule
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:53.720]  on the game. And I said, well, what does it say? And she said, well, it's amazing, you know,
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:00.360]  hon, because it says loans, the bank loans money to players who mortgage their property. The bank
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:06.360]  can never go broke. If the bank runs out of money, the banker may issue as much as needed by writing
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.560]  on ordinary paper. And that's what that girl had. And she said, and I'm not playing the game.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.880]  That was so convicting to see that little girl. No, it allows the insiders to totally take over
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:22.360]  the entire society. Great to hear from you. God bless, lad. Okay, let's go to another caller.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.880]  I'm trying to move quick today now that we're going to the calls Debbie in California, you're on the
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:33.800]  year. Hi, Alex. Welcome. Um, I just wanted to tell you that we went to the Occupy LA
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:41.400]  over the weekend. And the police were really nice, the LAPD, because a bunch of us moved
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:47.480]  over the overpass the weekend, have all that traffic looking at our signs. And the cops did
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.320]  circle above us. And then they came on to the freeway. And when they got out, I was expecting
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:59.400]  them to tell us to move. But they didn't, they said they loved us and they supported us. And
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.320]  they just wanted us to keep our signs on this side of the rail. So we didn't drop anything onto the
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:10.920]  freeway. But it was Danny Glover showed up. And, um, well, listen, the police have been told
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:16.760]  everywhere but New York, don't get in people's face, because they understand the public's mad
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:23.560]  and a spark could lead to a conflagration. Uh, some democratic operatives admit they do want
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.720]  to go ahead and get riots going and make it a class warfare thing. Uh, also, uh, the police
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:35.000]  don't want to brutalize people because they know it'll bring media attention to you.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.320]  But also the police know Wall Street's corrupt, but it's good. They tried to totally shut down
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.800]  protests the last decade. But more and more, the police are acting like a first amendment
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:49.080]  exists also because they've lost thousands of lawsuits nationwide. Thousands. Anything else
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:56.040]  you want to add from Los Angeles? Well, stay there. Stay there. I'm going to come back to you.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.520]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.600]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming. And I think it's important for my
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:16.680]  listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past history really does repeat
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:24.520]  itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:31.160]  action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:37.480]  read the new book, rising prices, empty shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.560]  in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:49.000]  at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.880]  how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.760]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:10.120]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:15.800]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:21.560]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:27.800]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:34.280]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:39.000]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.640]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care,
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:50.200]  and right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the republic. Yet your copy of Fall of
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:57.560]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prison
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:05.800]  planet.tv. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.760]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:16.200]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:21.400]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:27.640]  respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:33.080]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:12.680]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:21.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to salute you.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:35.880]  TV stations in Des Moines, Iowa, Dallas, Texas, San Antonio, Texas, Minneapolis, St. Paul,
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:44.840]  literally hundreds of news articles. If you put Alex Jones fed in and that's just
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.760]  rallies all around the country with people out there protesting against the fed, getting on
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:09:00.280]  local television, getting serious issues covered. And that's just examples of where my name and
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:07.080]  info wars.com got mentioned. I just googled Alex Jones fed to see how much coverage our
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.920]  little demonstration said. And it turned out all over the country. Our listeners went out to occupy
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.720]  the fed and told the media why they were there and mentioned my show and what we're doing.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.440]  Great way to get people across the country to go check out, you know, who Alex Jones is,
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:28.360]  who Ron Paul is. Very, very exciting. Is that web you're clicked on or news?
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:34.360]  News. If you click on news, you'll, yeah, yeah, but click on the news tab of Google if you want
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.160]  to show them because that's web, I think. Now it's up at the top. You just scroll to the top right
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:44.920]  there on the sidebar. You just scroll to the top and then, you know, the control bar right there
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:51.640]  at the top. Okay, and then you click on news where it says news right there. There you go.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:59.960]  And then that's where you can go through it. But it's very, very exciting to see this happening.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:06.440]  And if you just type in in the fed, you get hundreds and hundreds of news articles, TV stations.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.080]  I mean, think about what we're doing. We're not just going to let George Soros and the Democrats
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.280]  claim that revolution against corruption on Wall Street is more taxes and more collectivism
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.040]  that the monopoly capitalists use to control us and steal our wealth. We're out there really
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.760]  putting real issues on the table, just like Ron Paul running for president is. And whether he wins
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.280]  or loses, we win by putting real issues out there. We've got the superior information.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:39.080]  We've got the superior fighters. And all we got to do is take the field and we'll win every time.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:44.440]  So I salute all of you. All right, I want to go back to your calls from listeners who've been at
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:50.760]  events around the country. And we were talking to Debbie in California, and then I'll go to
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.000]  everybody else. I went to her a little bit late before the break. So I'm going back to her.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.320]  So you were at the LA in the Fed. You said that you blocked or got on the highway and
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.160]  had banner hangs and got a lot of attention. The police left your first amendment alone.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:09.080]  That's good. What happened next? We're passed over the freeway and got a lot of support.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:15.960]  Most of the people honked in support. My sign said in the Fed, stop the unconstitutional printing
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:22.840]  press for the Wall Street Casino and enlarger font info wars.com. And because I had the info
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.800]  wars.com, there were a lot of people that came up and gave me high fives because they were listeners,
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:34.760]  including this little seven year old boy. I have never with an info wars.com and Ron Paul
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.960]  signed. I've never seen anyone so small and enthusiastic. Well, Debbie, I've got to say this.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.680]  I've got to say this. It's wonderful, but it's also like torture because I know who I am.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:54.600]  I'm not perfect. I try to be a good person. But I understand my faults. And then when I go to
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:00.920]  these events and see men, women, children, every race, every religion, little children looking up
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:08.360]  to me like this, it's just such a responsibility. And I'm proud of a lot of the work I've done.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.360]  But at the same time, I realize I'm just human and I get so afraid that I don't ever want to let
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.720]  people down because even the smallest mistakes get twisted or even things that aren't mistakes get
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.080]  twisted. But I just want to say I love you guys. And people kept thanking me for coming out and
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.360]  demonstrating against the Fed. Thank you for coming out. We're all the same. We love liberty.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.560]  We understand what's happening. I'm nothing special. I'm just somebody that came along earlier than
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.160]  some of you. But I stand on the shoulders of people that came before me. You are all just as
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.560]  good as I am or better. So I want to say you're wonderful. But, you know, when you tell me about
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.200]  little kids coming over to you because you had the Info War sign, that is such a responsibility,
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:57.160]  Debbie. Got interviewed. The little kid got interviewed by one of the new stations that was
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.880]  there. I'm not sure which one, but continue, continue with what the little kid said and what
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:10.680]  you saw. He loves Info Wars. He listens to Alex every single day. And he is all for the in the Fed.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:20.920]  They're crooks, he said. Well, that's why. Go ahead. Hopefully he'll share that at school.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.200]  And we all know that you're human, Alex, but you still inspire us. No, I know. It's just,
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.280]  it's just that people always say you're great. You're wonderful. And, you know, I'm a guy who
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:36.280]  eats too much. You know, I'm a guy who has a bad temper. I understand. It's just, it's,
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:43.480]  I'm just a regular guy. And I never sought or wanted to, you know, more and more become
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:49.960]  a figurehead for liberty. And quite frankly, it's like the Wayne's World thing where they're saying,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:55.320]  we're not worthy. We're not worthy. God bless you. I appreciate your call. What an exciting
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:04.120]  call from Debbie. Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's talk to Doris in Tennessee. Doris,
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:13.640]  welcome. Hello. Hey, Doris, welcome. Hey, um, well, we protested Gibson guitar,
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.200]  and I have been awake about the same amount of time you have. I've been telling people about
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.720]  the Federal Reserve, but I, and I'm a prison planning member and I buy all the vitamins and
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:33.880]  all that stuff and they're great. Um, now the, uh, gov, the government accountability office didn't
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:42.600]  audit, you know, back in July and they found out that, you know, there have been 16 trillion
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:51.800]  dollars of secret bailout. Yes. To people, to people like, um, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley,
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:59.880]  Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Barclays, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs. I mean, it's ridiculous
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:07.160]  what we were, it was on Fox News for about two minutes. Then people, you know, they just,
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:12.200]  um, I mean, I just don't even act like you've been. Well, the globalists are masters back at
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.560]  the time they said it's only 800 and something billion and the banks are going to pay it back.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:23.480]  So they use that red herring of the bailout, but that was just one part of it. The bailout
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.840]  allowed the Federal Reserve to monetize trillions in debt, give themselves trillions of our tax
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.800]  money. And as you mentioned, it's 16 plus trillion. There's another 10 trillion plus that they won't
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.360]  tell us about. And that's been a couple of years since we got new numbers. Who knows what it is
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:45.160]  now? And I hear these mainline neocon hosts going, it's only 870 something billion and it was all
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:52.360]  paid back. No, it wasn't. And of that 800 billion, remember when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.440]  quote ordered under national security, even though they didn't have the authority,
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.360]  they ordered local banks to take some of it. And some banks refused and said, well, I don't care
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:10.120]  if you order it. I mean, I've seen articles the last three years of feds order pension funds to
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:17.000]  invest in this and that to prop up market. And they order companies to invest pension funds
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.480]  in their derivatives. And because federal regulators show up at these pension funds,
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.920]  sometimes with hundreds of billions, they follow the order. It's all just knuckle dragon gangster
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.720]  government shows up and we're here to order you to take a vaccine. Well, where's the law?
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.400]  I got a cop behind me. Well, that's a federal building. It says Federal Reserve. It's all
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:43.320]  hoaxes and fraud. And I'm so glad you bring up that fact because I hear these talking points.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:48.600]  The left has their talking points of raise taxes, get the rich people. That's all Federal Reserve
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:54.600]  written. And then on the right, they've got the talking point of the Federal Reserve is basically
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.200]  created the planet. And they're the reason flowers bloom and fish swim and birds tweet.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:07.240]  And it's just amazing. And then they want to paint any demonstrations. I see all the big mainline
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:13.960]  neoconsights except for the drudge report out there criticizing out there criticizing Ron Paul,
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:20.520]  criticizing in the Fed saying I can't believe Ron Paul supporters want to team up with the dirty
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:27.000]  hippies. Don't go down there and hang out with them commies. We have the have the occupy Wall
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.720]  Street people in most cases coming over and henpecking us and griping at us for for because
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.120]  the Democrats have told them that we're that we're evil Republicans. And then they're mad at us
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.680]  because we're evil Republicans. And then the evil Republicans that they're talking about are attacking
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:48.440]  us. We're the real group. Ron Paul's the real guy by the whole system attacks them. We know the
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:57.080]  real threat. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm ranting. Anything else? Okay. Yes. Okay. You know, it was Ron Paul
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:05.560]  that got Allen. It was an Allen Grayson amendment to the Dodd Frankville. Yes. And it was Ron Paul
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:11.720]  that got that done. And when they did that audit, they didn't go as far as Ron Paul wanted to go.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:20.360]  It was HR 1207. And when they did find out, though, I mean, they did get to the bottom of it and
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:27.000]  see here's what people don't understand. All this money has come out. And then big people here are
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  losing their job. No, no, I mean, it's insane. Look, the country is falling apart. And Herman
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.520]  Cain's answer is, if you're not rich, it's your fault. Okay, if somebody's not rich in North Korea,
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.640]  is it their fault? Yes, the American system is the best it's ever been anywhere in history. This is
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:51.720]  the land of opportunity. There are a lot of deadbeats. But to say if you're not rich, it's
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:57.720]  your fault. Okay, let's say you're in the Marine Corps and a mind goes off and blows your eyes out
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.280]  and blows one of your arms off. Is it your fault? You're not rich now as the government
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:07.960]  swindles your military pension and gets ready to basically get rid of it and kills what's left
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:15.080]  with inflation. I mean, this statement that if you're not well off, it's your fault. Oh, really,
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:20.680]  you're in a car wreck, a Mack truck smacks into you, breaks your back. Now you're being kicked off
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:26.680]  your disability. Really, Herman Cain, is it your fault? My point is, you got this Federal Reserve
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:33.880]  guy up there, the biggest welfare recipients in the galaxy. And he's lecturing everyone. And I see
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:38.440]  all these main like conservatives. You tell them Wall Street's perfect, Herman, Federal Reserve.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:45.000]  Look at them run Paul people. They're hanging out with them dirty hippies going up against our
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:53.240]  Federal Reserve. It's federal. It's going to take care of it. And Herman Cain don't fix it. Oh, man,
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.800]  I tell you, they're just as dumb as Obama supporters. I mean, is there no con you people
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:05.320]  won't buy into? More call straight ahead. Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.080]  All right, we're back live. We're going straight back to your calls. I will be getting into the fall
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:17.400]  of Barack Obama. I told you, I don't know, three years ago when Obama deception came out. Hard to
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.800]  believe it came out in March of 2009. So I guess that's Obama's been in two and a half, three years.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:32.040]  I don't know. How long is that? Two and a half years or so? The film came out and I said he will
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.520]  be destroyed politically and I explained how I could tell that was going to happen because they
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.080]  were getting ready to implode the country. They always blame the sacrificial lamb and people
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:46.840]  are like, this film's insane. This guy's got an 80% approval rating. He's the Christ. Remember,
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:54.120]  they had black preachers saying he was like Jesus? The one and all that bull? Yeah, the one to take
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.800]  the blame for everything. There's about a 90% chance now they're going to fully destroy Barack
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:04.840]  Obama. There's a 10% chance they're going to blow up a bunch of stuff and resurrect him politically
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.800]  or they could do a failed assassination attempt like a Taiwanese president got caught
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.920]  six, seven years ago with even fake bullet wounds. Remember that? Didn't get much attention,
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.440]  but it was in the news. They got a few things they could pull, but it looks like they're going with
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.320]  fully destroying Barack Obama. That's coming up if I take some more calls. Got a bunch of economic
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:31.000]  news. I promise I'm going to go through it all. We got a lot of time here to take calls, but
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.400]  I don't go out on the road a lot, but I'm planning to do it more and more,
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:41.720]  but I don't have security. I just plunge myself out into the crowd and I'm not like a politician.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.040]  I used to always see politicians just shaking people's hands like a zombie and not really paying
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:51.560]  attention to them. And I thought, how dare them be fake? But I know why they're fake. There is like
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:58.600]  this weird psychological calculation that's made when you size somebody up, when you actually shake
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.960]  their hand and actually talk to them and actually ask their name and actually look them in the eye
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.480]  and then even answer their questions. So at one event, there's like 400, another 300,
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:15.640]  another 150 or so, whatever it was. And I'm just got, when I'm not bullhorning person after person
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:21.080]  after person talking to me, look it in the eye. They're sizing me up. I'm sizing them up and
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.800]  I'm not going into zombie mode with them, but I've caught myself sometimes about two hours,
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.480]  three hours into a demonstration. After I've shook hundreds of hands and hugged people and
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:38.360]  listened to them, I'll catch myself as I'm going kind of, and then I get back to the car and just
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:48.440]  like, oh, there is nothing more tiring because I'm actually talking to you. I'm actually seeing you,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.840]  you know, like they say in Avatar, one of the only new agey things in there I agree with,
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.640]  because it's not new age. It's old age of sizing somebody up when you, you know, when they say,
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:05.560]  I see you. I mean, I see what you are. I look into you. I pick up your essence. I feel your presence.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.320]  You know, when you ever get around really famous people or really powerful people,
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.520]  that is the only thing that's interesting is they're still regular people,
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:23.960]  but they've always got this aura. Even more so, like a lot of times you'll think a movie star
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.720]  doesn't look like that in person. And then when you get around them in person, it's like they,
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:38.840]  the charisma, like starlets, take, take, take. I have met in person famous female stars who I
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:44.040]  didn't find particularly attractive in the film. And then you meet them in person and you go,
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:52.040]  wow, I can tell why you're a movie star. It's very strange to, but it's not a negative thing. But
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:58.760]  when people are your fans and they admire you, it's almost like the adulation and the energy
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:07.480]  they're shooting at you drains you. It drains you. I mean, I am stumbling around two days later,
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:14.040]  stumbling around. I went to a UFC fight too. You know, Joe Rogan, good friends with him going back
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:21.400]  like 13 years. I've known Joe since like 1998. When he's doing stand up here in Austin, Joe Rogan
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:28.760]  host of fear factor UFC, who's just a big funny hilarious part in the zookeeper. And he said,
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:33.720]  Hey, he sent me a text that I heard you're coming to Houston for in the Fed thing. And you want
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:39.640]  some UFC tickets and go to dinner beforehand. And I went to that and even the UFC, I mean,
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.880]  everywhere I went in Houston, shake hands, shake hands, shake hands, shake hands, shake hands,
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:51.480]  shake hands. And again, that is an illustration of just how big the Liberty movement is,
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.400]  because I'm just one prominent person in the worldwide fight to awaken humanity out of their
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.320]  trance. So when I get on there and say, Hey, everywhere I go, I'm running into more people,
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.720]  that's a sonar ping, because you're not known 99% of you that listen are not public figures.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:14.520]  You're not well known. So you don't know how big our Liberty movement is. It's big. Ron Paul
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:22.920]  should be the next president. Ron Paul is the front runner. Ron Paul is the man. But the system is
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:31.000]  trying to act like he isn't numero uno. But we're going in the right direction, exponential Liberty
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.960]  movement. That's why the globalists are trying to trigger and then co-opt the Occupy Wall Street
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  so they can misdirect the revolution. Well, they're right back with your phone calls, a ton of news,
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:52.920]  straight ahead, stay with us info wars.com. We're on the March, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:30:03.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:09.160]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.880]  everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.640]  how you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:23.080]  predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:27.960]  collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:33.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.200]  online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet. And it's a real eye
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.920]  opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:47.000]  explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:54.040]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number three dot

[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.720]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one,
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.960]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.840]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:20.520]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:30.200]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.680]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.480]  from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.880]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:50.280]  from science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:09.560]  market continues to crash and recrash daily. Since July, the market has dropped 15% with no signs of
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:14.760]  recovery. What does that mean to you? When stocks crash, jobs are lost and you can't buy the food
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:19.960]  that's already too expensive and continues to raise in cost. eFoods just got noticed that wholesale
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:25.640]  costs on pasta, rice, and beans will immediately jump 20%. The already high cost of sugar is
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:30.600]  tripling. If you invest in the stock market for security or save money in the bank, you continue
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:35.560]  to see the dollar drop in value while your weekly food bills increase. So what are you going to do?

[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.520]  You know as I sat there watching the UFC fighters beat the living daylights out of each other
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:29.160]  in blood spewing, particularly bloody group of bouts. Guys with blood spilling out of broken
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:35.240]  noses all over the other person. I realized why people like gladiatorial events because it's
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:42.360]  about the human struggle. It's about two men facing each other down. But the system is expert at
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:50.440]  stylizing it and basically making it ceremonial or vestigial. But there's other forms of war going
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:57.640]  on every day. Many communists and fascists and others, well when Hitler went into Poland he
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:04.120]  killed hundreds of thousands of the intelligentsia, not just the Jews but the Polish intelligentsia.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:11.320]  Doctors, sociologists, psychologists, writers, journalists. And then when the Soviets came
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:17.000]  in after World War II and took over Poland, they did another perch. Pol Pot, as you know,
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:24.120]  killed around 30% of the Cambodian population under U.S. government funding, and Brzezinski's
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:31.240]  written two books bragging about it. And they killed everybody who could write. And a lot of
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.720]  folks would act like they couldn't write. And so if they found out you had glasses, if you could
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:41.320]  afford glasses, you were taken out and killed. That's why it's called the killing fields. Just
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.800]  giant piles everywhere of people shot in the head where they ran out of bullets. They just tied
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:52.360]  you up and hacked you up with a machete. That's how the U.N. likes to run genocide over in Africa.
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.000]  I guess they say it's more fun to actually not just shoot somebody but get a little lovin' in.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.200]  So I could pass like it. See, the globalists, they kill our minds with the sodium fluoride,
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.560]  with the bisphenol and the plastics with the GMO. That's a story I want to tell and I'm going back
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:17.800]  to your calls. And by the way, after we've talked to Steve and Pappy and Lauren and Emanuel and
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:27.560]  Darby and others, I want to specifically for in the Fedders who are there demonstrating in Dallas.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.720]  I'm told there's going to be some demonstrations for in the Fed up in Dallas tonight. I do need to
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.840]  get out there and get the address of it and cover it in the next segment. And I also want to hear
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:42.200]  from the folks as I'm told a few dozen people stayed overnight at the Dallas Fed and then that
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.400]  people more showed up Saturday and Sunday and then off and on at least 10 people have been camping
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:53.560]  out there. I want to salute you because that's the thing that really starts to draw media attention.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:59.160]  Realize that we got hundreds of newscasts, hundreds of newspapers to report on in the Fed this weekend.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:06.440]  Hundreds of mainstream and alternative. That is millions of dollars of publicity
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.920]  towards the real enemy, towards the private fellow reserve. They hope it's all just going
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.560]  to be nebulous, capitalism's bad, let's race tax on the middle class, that'll fix it,
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:21.480]  which is what the globalists want. The Herman Cain model, only Herman Cain and Sean Hannity and
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:30.680]  and and all these Republican leaders blend back. Miller Riley could come out and say we need VAT
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:37.240]  and sales tax to pay off our debt. And conservatives are like pay our share, that's right. Put put in
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:45.400]  a federal sales tax, that's a great idea. That Alex is a liberal, he had four new tax. I'm conservative.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:52.280]  I want to pay it to the fellow reserve. Herman Cain said and we got to pay it.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.760]  You get so sold on a fair tax to get rid of the income tax that when they bait and switch it and
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:08.040]  keep the income tax and the social security tax, nine for income to phase it out. Of course,
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:19.080]  it'll never get phased out. Nine for social security and nine on the sales tax. As well,
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:25.080]  just put nine bullets in your head or jump off a cliff nine times. Nine, nine, nine.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.840]  Out of the federal reserve, give us the income tax. Oh, I've got to do an article or a video
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.360]  about this. I know I've read it in the historical news reports over and over again. Anybody can
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:37.560]  pull this up. I know there's a lot of writers that listen to the show and then right off the
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:44.200]  id is we talk about here. I don't care who covers it. We'll link to your story up at info wars.com.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:51.480]  You can look up the income tax of 1913 that they got passed right along with the fellow reserve act.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.080]  One really ratified, but so what? It's a hoax.
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:05.000]  It was a 1% tax on the top 1%. Oh, this is all federal reserve propaganda.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.840]  They were like, listen, it's only a tax on the top one. The 99% don't pay diddly jack squat.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:21.240]  And it's only a 1% tax on the top 1%. These guys have got an old dusty playbook. And hey,
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:30.600]  if it works, if that old 1951 design of a certain type of top water bait works, why not keep buying
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:36.040]  it grand daddy did and grand daddy's grand daddy did. And let me tell you, it works really good.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.400]  Some of those old design 1905 top water designs are still some of the best.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.960]  And they get out that they say, how do we do it in 1913? Well, we told them it's going to be a 1%
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:54.760]  tax on the 1% and that 99% of you, I've seen the news articles 99 to be exempt, get that 1%.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:00.760]  But still they couldn't fool the American people. And so they didn't ratify it in all the states,
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.800]  but they just said they ratified it and put it on through. Just like they said,
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:13.480]  the Federal Reserve was federal when it's not. And Mr. Benson and Mr. Beckman went to all 44
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.320]  states that were in existence then in 1913. And they went in and found out some didn't even ratify
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:24.200]  it period. Others didn't completely ratify it. Others refused to even hear it, but were marked as
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.800]  present and that it happened. And the feds just announced we have the ratification,
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.360]  falsify the certification. But that part doesn't matter because people didn't really care.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:37.720]  It was only 1% that was going to pay it. And that was 1% until World War II.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:43.720]  And they use the provisions in it for a wartime tax. We're fighting Hitler and Tojo
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:53.000]  and Yamamoto. Are you patriotic? Are you going to have that withholding tax?
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:40:00.840]  Then let us withhold 20%. Your sons are over there dying in foreign fields.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:06.200]  Are you going to pay that tax? Are you patriotic? Right to check payable to the Federal Reserve.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.200]  They're going to handle it. And they funded Hitler the whole time.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:18.360]  Woo, weren't good, didn't it? And then they said it's only a temporary tax instituted in
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.520]  1941 and the week after Pearl Harbor when we got hit.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.720]  And did they get rid of the withholding? Oh, that was for the 1%. It was only for the rich.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:42.280]  Only for the ultra rich to get part of your paycheck paid right to them at the Federal Reserve.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:48.200]  And right now they got the great grandsons, the pimps. They've got the Rockefellers,
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:53.080]  David Rockefeller, the son of the scammer at the time. They've got Warren Buffett up there,
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.520]  always meeting, lecturing you how you need to pay more taxes.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:04.520]  You need to pay more taxes to pay your fair share because he's rich. He's a billionaire. And he wants
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:10.520]  to tell you, and he's a good billionaire who gave his money 40-something billion tax-free Warren Buffett,
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:19.800]  50-something billion from Bill Gates because he cares so much about you. Then you go check it.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.000]  Their entire empires are now tax-free even though they operated a profit. Then they put it into other
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.120]  subsidiaries, and their wealth has massively increased. And all they do is spend part of the
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.520]  profit of their now tax-free businesses that nobody can compete with to finance eugenics
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:42.920]  worldwide. Then Bill Gates comes out and lectures groups of college students in the education
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.120]  department at a major university last year. And he says, if we don't give grandma end of care in
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.320]  the last year of her life, and he smiles like a devil, he says, some call it death panels,
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:59.560]  but so what? He goes, that's what it is. And he got this little smile. And he said, you'll get 10
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.840]  jobs. And there was a ooh. And he liked it. He was teaching people. When you kill old people,
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:11.640]  you get jobs. And all the dumb little yuppies were buying into the sum game, small pie system.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:17.000]  And he was like, that's right. We don't give people health care. You get a job. You get something
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.120]  when somebody loses. Do you like that? This is one of the most wicked little Hitler's in the world.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:31.240]  And they were all, you bet we do. There was a smacking and a hissing. Oh, and covered a news week,
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:38.280]  the case for killing granny with an image of a plug pulled out of a wall. Yeah. He teaches us
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:45.080]  to be predators when grandma dies or when we don't give somebody eye surgery. What is the guy worth
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:51.720]  $200 million? Running around, say, who's got all the big, you know, Halliburton stock and
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:57.720]  Dinecore stock? What is, uh, what is the self-propelled little fascist posing as a liberal, uh, say,
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:03.480]  Michael Moore? He says it's patriotic to have a cane instead of eye surgery. It's patriotic
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:11.000]  to wait a year for brain surgery, crawling a hole and die. There's too many of you big, big fat
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.240]  demons like, like, like me want all your taxes. Oh, yeah. Cause the real predators know how to
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:27.240]  saddle up to you, saddle up to you and tell you, I'm in PR with a sweet little, let me do an NPR
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:35.080]  voice today on all things considered brought to you by the Rockefeller Foundation. We're gonna
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:47.560]  soothe you to sleep. Trust me. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Little sheepie.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:44:01.240]  When you awake, we would have chewed your guts out. Drink the fluoride, baby. Give your baby. Give
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:14.280]  your baby formula. That's over half the corn syrup. Give a mercury shot. Watch the childhood
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:23.560]  cancer skyrocket. Watch the IQs fall. Watch the murder and death happen. Cause after all,
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:33.240]  killing granny is sweet. Oh, we're so liberal. We have sweet little voices. We're gonna take
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:40.200]  good care of you. We're so liberal. But you don't like us. Well, there's Herman Caden on the other
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:47.560]  side. That's right. He worked for the Federal Reserve. He's got a new tax for you. It's so cute.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:56.760]  I can't handle it anymore. I just can't handle it. I mean, I have to sit here and see these people
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.600]  naked in front of me. All their crimes, all their sickening, gibbering, getting off on conning people,
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.720]  the demonic Bill Gates eyes just fired up full psycho killer on parade. I mean,
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:14.040]  you look at that guy and it's just those eyes are on. I mean, it's predator and it's he enjoys it.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.880]  He prances around and it just, it just goes on and on for him. The power trip.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.960]  We are uncloking you though, buddy boy. We're uncloking you.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:32.760]  All right. You've held long enough. Steven, New York, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:39.480]  Thank you, Alex. I love that lullaby. I'm dying to see the YouTube version of it coming out.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:46.760]  Anyway, I spent over the weekend at the Occupy Wall Street and yeah, it's pretty interesting. In
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:52.040]  fact, I'm like the woman earlier is mentioning about the cops being actually pretty sympathetic
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:57.880]  in Houston and other areas of that. I'm really finding that in a lot of ways, the cops that are
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.840]  hanging out around that area are pretty much been accepted as being part of the protests,
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:07.240]  as being part of the 99%, you know, they're going over talking to people, asking them what their
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:12.520]  sign means, you know, what they're about and stuff. And in general, there's a good discourse all
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:17.000]  around people are you're talking to, you know, you've got your liberals and your conservatives
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.560]  and your wall streeters and everybody talking back and forth. And I think that's something that,
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.960]  you know, we really haven't had in a long time. It's like a giant living room in the middle of
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:33.000]  the city. No, you're right. And then that's why the system wants us to not talk to the police.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.840]  They don't want the police talking to us because we're all just humans. We're all Americans and
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.360]  the police are going to have their future destroyed. In fact, when I started going into that whole
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:46.840]  rant about how we're being poisoned, the Dallas cops did put a cage around us and were kind of
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.400]  bugging their eyes out and they had a gang unit. Some of the cops came over and said,
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:54.920]  no, we know about the Federal Reserve. We appreciate what you're doing, you know, off record.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.240]  But that was the commanders, you know, people in charge. Some of the cops were laughing when I
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:03.240]  was saying, this is, this is not federal. And I went over and I said, listen, I was real nice.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:07.400]  I said, this isn't a joke. This is serious. And the cops are kind of giving me this where they
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.640]  try to intimidate you where they do the scary eye. And I just looked at the guy and I said,
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:16.920]  let me tell you something, buddy. They're poisoning your water and your food cancers up
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:23.160]  several thousand percentage points, diabetes, the GMO is sterilizing all mammal species,
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.120]  but almost 100% within three generations in every study. I was playing Jim rat studies
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.400]  and some were still kind of laughing about it. And I said, listen, it didn't funny. And I said,
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:36.680]  a lot of you aren't going to listen. But when your young wife dies of breast cancer early
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:41.320]  or your kid dies, it didn't funny. Then they look kind of freaked out, but then kind of aggressive.
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:46.040]  And then I saw him go over to the head cop and I heard the cop going, he was being really mean
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.520]  and saying horrible things. I don't appreciate it. And I kind of almost went over, but I was
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:55.480]  tired about to leave and she was saying something to him. But the point is that cop was kind of mad
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:02.440]  at me for saying that. Like I was threatening his kids telling the guy, don't let your kid,
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.560]  you know, use cocaine. It's not trying to hurt your kid or telling you don't drink out of bisphenol
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:16.360]  A or don't give your kids this baby formula made out of deadly toxin filled, you know, garbage
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:22.520]  and melamine and all of it, the mercury warning you when the cops are laughing at you. I'm like,
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:28.760]  listen, body boy, this isn't a joke. Just because you think it's funny, doesn't make it one. I'm
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:34.200]  a real person that's done the research that cares enough to break my trance and come out here on
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.960]  a Friday night and warn you, so don't play games. Now I didn't get like that, but that's basically
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.880]  what I was trying to explain to him. This isn't a game. I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:49.240]  Oh, you know, the other thing too, like you mentioned before, the idea of move on and all
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.720]  these organizations trying to co-opt it, which they definitely are. But this is what they're
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.840]  sort of organized through this great grand assembly type of thing. So everybody sits down and
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:06.440]  discusses. They have to have, you know, basic consensus on what they do for the marches and
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:12.120]  this and that. And there's so many people that are so vehemently against being co-opted by
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.720]  anybody that, you know, they'll gladly accept the donations and stuff, but they're, you know,
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:22.520]  they're refusing to like go buy anybody's particular, you know...
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.520]  No, you're right. And because it's a pure democracy, it remains a mob. It's got to be a
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:35.880]  republic. They should adopt the constitution. They should adopt the constitutional dean,
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:40.680]  Ron Paul, who's already figured it all out. And again, I didn't just believe what Ron Paul said.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:45.240]  I did my own historical research, perfect voting record, understands our problems,
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:51.240]  predicted it 30 years out. I mean, the fact that Ron Paul is at this point, this paramount point
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:56.920]  in his career of liberty, right as all this is cresting is how the universe works. For every
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:03.080]  action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Tyranny's cresting, liberty is beginning to crest.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:09.080]  And the collision is on. Every bit of energy we put into this now is key. And yeah, it's because
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:14.680]  Occupy Wall Street thinks they're being totally nebulous and not having any direction. That's
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:21.080]  why Obama can project onto this white wall whatever he wants. They don't understand that.
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:26.680]  They should adopt Ron Paul. Instead, they're letting operatives like move on kind of slowly
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.440]  control them to where they're now. We're not going to that Alex Jones thing. He's for Ron Paul and
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:38.120]  ending the Fed. We like the government. I mean, that's what I've been told. It's not the government.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.320]  See, they're just but again, that's not everybody in the movement. But because they don't take on
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:48.840]  an ideology. Well, the globalists have projected one on to him. Great points. More calls coming up.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:54.680]  Tons of news. Kurt Haskell popping in with big news on the underwear bomber news that inside job.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:51:00.120]  We got big, big info coming up a bunch of breaking stuff. You'll want to stay with us.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.520]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:12.280]  constant attack. The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994. Governments
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:17.400]  are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:22.600]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.640]  conditions. Storeable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:34.200]  you need to stay healthy during emergencies. Go to survivalrx.com today and see the amazing line

[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:06.360]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.440]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:16.440]  listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past. History really does repeat
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:24.280]  itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:30.920]  action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:37.240]  read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:43.320]  in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available

[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:06.680]  like half the man you used to be. Are you gaining more body fat? Are you feeling tired?
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:12.040]  Are you losing your sex drive? It's not your fault. After 40, your body's testosterone may
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:17.480]  start dropping and if you're an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:23.080]  turning into estrogen. Be the man you used to be. Call for a risk-free trial of ageless male,

[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.560]  Almost two years ago, the government got him on the plane, but it gets even crazier. If that's
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:33.560]  coming up for one segment, then I'll continue with calls. I need to start getting into this
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:39.400]  news. BPA levels in humans far higher than previously thought. No kidding. It's in everything now.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.800]  What's it do? Lowers your life expectancy, increases cancer, lowers fertility, and makes you
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:52.760]  obese amongst a big other list of horrible things all by design. Different companies are now lobbying
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:55:00.760]  to not allow it to be taken out when it's very easy to use other plastic formulas. Continuing,
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.000]  fast and furious weapons were found in Mexico cartels and forced her home. I want to spend a
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.560]  lot of time today on this, at least five minutes or so. The design destruction of Barack Obama,
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:22.840]  Rahm Emanuel, the Democrats all deserting him by design. What Herman Cain is up to, that's all
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:31.320]  coming up. I briefly want to encourage listeners to visit infowars.com for the anti-globalist
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:35.800]  t-shirts that will help you meet like-minded people in your area. The Purchase also supports
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:43.160]  this broadcast and the news site and our growing organization reporters and server costs and everything
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:48.360]  we're doing here. We couldn't have done any of this without you. We've got great films that are
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:55.560]  available at infowars.com like Invisible Empire, Terror Storm, Obama Deception, Endgame, Fall of
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:02.360]  the Republic, and we're carrying the best gravity filters I've ever used because I needed some more
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:07.160]  of these getting ready for what's coming down in this country. I did a lot of research. I had Tim in
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:12.040]  the back try out a bunch of different brands. We have found with the specs in a side-by-side
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:18.520]  comparison with all of their competitors, Pro Pure is the way to go. Stainless steel, gravity
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.840]  filter system, bigger filters, more filtration. Just go look at the side-by-side at infowars.com,
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.720]  click on the shopping cart, and check out the water filtration systems. We also have our stainless
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:37.240]  steel water bottles at infowars.com on them that do hundreds and hundreds of gallons and reduce
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:42.040]  everything. You know, make swamp water safe to drink. This, though, basically gets almost everything
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:46.360]  out. Fluoride's so small it's even harder. It reduces fluoride, but you can buy special filters
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.960]  that knock it out to non-detectable levels. Again, all available at infowars.com. Pro Pure
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:58.680]  and your purchase supports this broadcast and what we are doing. Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.960]  Darby in North Carolina. Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:08.840]  Hi, Alex. How's it going, man? I'm 21. I've been with you about three years. I want to thank you
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:15.400]  for waking me up and truly changing my life. But anyway, I live close to Charlotte, North Carolina,
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:21.880]  and they had the Occupy Charlotte meeting on Saturday. And I gotta say, there's a lot of people
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:26.200]  with the right intention down there, and there's a lot of people that know something's wrong down
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:34.520]  there. But the vast majority are just entirely clueless about the source of tyranny and oppression.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.480]  Well, that's why you're there. You were there to educate them. Did you have any success?
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:46.760]  I did. I was met with some opposition. It's funny. When they first started the protest,
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:50.840]  and the guys running through the rule of protest that were given to them by the police,
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:56.920]  the last thing he ended with, and the protest started in a park right next to the Charlotte Federal Reserve Building.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.600]  The last thing he says is, don't mess with the fed. And he points over there, and he's like,
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:08.280]  this isn't CMPD people. These are federal agents. Oh, just be scared.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.480]  Oh, no, no. That's what Occupy San Antonio said. They said, those are federal agents.
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.840]  And the move on people were running it now. And they said, you do not join with Ron Paul or Alex
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.760]  Jones. I'm going to try to hear that Medina interview tonight where they told him all this.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:26.760]  They were good a few weeks ago, but now, and you tell them, no, it's not federal. They go,
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.760]  shut up, right wing. And you're like, no, no, that's who stole the trillions.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:35.720]  I like George Soros. He runs everything now. I mean, it's just they are so ignorant,
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:54.600]  and they love their ignorance. Incredible. Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:59:00.360]  that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk. Saving means to make money.

[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:10.920]  soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from

[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:23.160]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:27.480]  and a terrorizing clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something

[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:15.240]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:21.720]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:29.640]  All right, let's continue with your calls right now ahead of Kurt Haskell.
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:34.840]  The lawyer has survived the underwear bomber. He's been following the trial. We've got new
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:41.480]  anthrax news proving it's an inside job from those attacks 10 years ago that were going on right at
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.320]  this time. Let's go ahead and go to Emmanuel in Texas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:53.480]  Hey, Alex. I have some friends that occupy Wall Street. They are trying to talk about a new
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:59.080]  invention called Bitcoin. And it has the potential to end the globalist regime on money. And they're
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:02.360]  trying to end it before it gets any bigger. They're hacking all our exchanges. They're tearing
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:07.080]  everything up. And I just want to get to a bit there. Have you heard about Bitcoin? Have you
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:11.960]  researched it yet? Yes, I've done some research on it. There's a lot of these digital currencies.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:18.600]  But then isn't it, at the end of the day, cashed down in dollars? We try to avoid that. But yes,
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.080]  this cash on exchanges, that's what's making the price go down. But really what separates
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.960]  apart from other private currencies, it's completely decentralized. It's like if you took
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:32.200]  the internet and turn it to money, the globalists can't touch this thing because it's directly
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:37.400]  in the hands of the people. So this is a big innovation and it really can change the world
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:44.040]  if you look into it. But hey, I'm totally into alternative currencies and an awakening to that.
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.880]  That's why they raided the Liberty dollar was because it was exposing it. We've got a bunch
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:53.400]  of states moving in that direction. The globalists want to hold us hostage with the currencies
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:02:01.560]  they're debasing as a form of economic warfare. Definitely. But what separates this one from
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:07.400]  the other currencies is it basically mimics gold in terms of scarcity. It takes scarcity of what
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:12.520]  we had in gold and silver and perfectly puts it on the internet in a safe cryptographic form.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:17.160]  Like nobody can break this cryptography, not yet at least until we get some quantum computing in.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:20.680]  But very interesting. You know, I should get an expert on about it and do a piece. Thanks for the
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:26.280]  call. Let's go ahead now and take another call. Let's talk to Lauren in Texas. Lauren, you're on the
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:33.720]  air. Hey Alex, hey brother. Welcome. Man, I'm excited. I've been trying to get on the show
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:40.440]  for a while. But anyway, it's really exciting seeing everything that's going on right now.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:49.880]  I've been, I woke up on September 11, 2001, just graduated high school. I'd stayed up all that
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:56.600]  night before and I was watching ABC when the news broke and I immediately started recording on my
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:02.520]  VCR and I filled up, you know, several VHS tapes full of, you know, live news. I was like, this is
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:09.320]  important. Well, I fell asleep around lunchtime and I woke up just in time to watch Building Six
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:15.640]  fall. So I saw all three buildings, you know, from the first moment to the end. You mean Building
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:20.760]  Seven? Building Seven, I'm sorry. Yeah, Building Seven at six o'clock in the afternoon or five o'clock,
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:27.880]  whatever. But I immediately knew that there was something wrong with it because I knew that that
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:33.560]  was controlled demolition and, you know, I just didn't really have anything to go on and I, you
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:39.320]  know, I was new to all this. Well, I'd kind of, you know, wondered about it. So this looks like
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:43.320]  it was brought down by explosives. I mean, how would the terrorists get in the building to
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.840]  plant the explosives? Well, I talked about it for a while and a friend of mine said, hey, man,
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:52.440]  you need to check this stuff out. If you're into all this, you know, check this guy out. So
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:57.720]  the first video I saw of yours was Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove and
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:03.880]  from, it was like the tearing of the veil. I mean, you know, putting on the sunglasses or
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:09.560]  taking the red pill, you know, once you know the truth, you can never go back. So I've been living,
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:15.640]  you know, this way for, you know, going on 10 years now, nine years at least. And,
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.880]  you know, I'm a very spiritual person. I'm a very passionate person,
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:29.560]  very creative. I love my friends. I love my family. I love life. And if I was 24, 22 years old,
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:34.600]  I would be at the Dallas bed right now. You know, I didn't have anything to go on. I'm just like,
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:40.280]  you know, I'm going vicariously through the kids out there. So I guess what I'm calling about is
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:46.200]  the message of solidarity, you know, that we all need to stick in this together is not left, right.
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:53.640]  Exactly. The system wants us to in fight with each other, but we do have to educate these young
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:05:05.000]  people. I will be right back, but I love the analogy you use there. Red pill, veil, sunglasses.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:11.800]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.760]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:22.840]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:28.280]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:33.320]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:39.400]  to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:45.320]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:50.840]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:17.480]  information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. We are back live ladies and
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:24.680]  gentlemen. And we're going to go to Tony, Jordan, John, Cameron, Steve, everybody that's holding,
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:33.080]  I promise, and more. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231. Now for one segment,
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:38.680]  we're joined by Kurt Haskell, who is the lawyer with his wife who was also a lawyer that survived
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:44.280]  the underwear bombing attack almost two years ago on Christmas Day. And then witness the
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:48.840]  feds basically getting him on the aircraft. Before anybody talked about this and then later
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:55.400]  in congressional testimony, the undersecretary of state admitted that it was true. And boy,
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:00.280]  you could have heard a pin drop whenever that came up that unnamed agency told them to help,
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:07.480]  you know, get him the visa and get him on the aircraft basically. Now since then, Haskell at
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:11.240]  the time didn't know if it was an inside job. Now he's saying clearly it was. He's talked to the
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:17.080]  lawyers involved, the standby lawyers and others. And, you know, they think this is entrapment and
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.480]  a setup and the guy's clearly being threatened or out of his mind. All of that's been covered.
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:26.520]  I want to get Kurt Haskell on now to give us the latest because now the trial's going,
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:32.520]  it's being used as propaganda for the groping of our children and the microwave oven machines at
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:37.080]  the airports. I want to get his take on that and then ask Kurt Haskell a question. I don't think
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:44.200]  he's been asked in context. Going to, if somebody's committed crimes before, then, you know, that goes
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:50.680]  in investigation towards their credibility or lack of it. The federal government's been caught
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:55.640]  lying over and over again staging all sorts of criminal operations. And now we know it's admitted
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:03.640]  not just letting guns be shipped to Mexico, not just doing that, but actually shipping them to
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:09.240]  Mexico to Sinaloa, major cartel, then allowing drugs to be shipped back in. That's in the El Paso
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:15.400]  Times, Chicago Tribune. It's in the federal filings, but it's not getting national TV attention.
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.720]  The Attorney General has been caught perjuring himself. This is the same Justice Department
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:26.920]  up to their eyeballs in the underwear bombing situation where it's come out in congressional
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:35.160]  testimony. The feds helped this guy. Now, Amaral Olaki, they say, was his handler. The guy meeting
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.920]  secretly at the Pentagon, the guy running the Fort Hood shooter, the Times Square bomber,
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:46.520]  the shoe bomber. He's just a cutout they use. We pointed this out, so now they've, quote,
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:50.680]  killed him. If you believe that, that's the fifth time they say they've killed him. They never
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:54.680]  retract the last time they kill him. There is no credibility. Someone asked Kurt Haskell out of
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:11:00.760]  the gates here. Sir, what is, before we get into the latest developments, as a lawyer watching this,
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:05.400]  what is it like to see the same Justice Department that's clearly covering up in this kangaroo trial
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:09.960]  right now? I know you have some key stuff that the jury was asked, and jury selection coming up.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:16.440]  How does in your mindset fast and furious play into this, or have you added that into your
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:22.200]  equation? I don't think it's going to have any effect on the trial. It would really be surprised
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:31.800]  if it comes up at all. In my mind, I see some parallels there. You have a plot here by,
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:37.720]  I don't know that much about fast and furious. I know some that the government was providing
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:44.040]  weapons to Mexican drugs. Yeah, it's basically, I ran Contra, and they're just claiming it's a
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:48.840]  gun sting. It wasn't just letting the guns be sold. It's delivering them. Certain cartels can bring
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.240]  the drugs in. My point is it just goes to what criminals this Justice Department is.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:12:00.600]  Yeah, it would appear that way. And there's some contrast between the two cases,
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:08.760]  doing some illegal acts with the thought that it will restrict constitutional rights of Americans.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:15.000]  It appears that way to me anyway. Daniel were bombing restricting rights at the airports in
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.760]  regards to the fourth amendment, illegal search and seizures and the gun runner case trying to
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:27.400]  restrict, you know, rights to possess weapons. So we'll see there you are cutting right to the chase
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:33.240]  and simplifying it in the underwear bombing. It was used for a police state rollout and confirmed
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:39.000]  in the fast and furious. It was used to call for a rebanding of semi automatic rifles and a
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.160]  bunch of more harassment of gun purchasers. There you go. Same modus operandi of a false flag,
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.640]  fast and furious, a false flag, underwear bomber, a false flag. Kurt, I'm giving you the floor for
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:53.400]  the next eight minutes before we go to break. Tell us the incredible things you're witnessing in this
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:13:01.160]  trial. Right. Well, I went to court last week, October the fourth, the jury selection began that
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:06.600]  day. And I wanted to go watch, you know, to see how things went because I've seen all these hearings
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:13.560]  I go to. Their press doesn't accurately report what I see. You know, the ones I go to, I come home
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:18.760]  and I read the reports and what happened at the hearing and what comes out are things that are
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:23.400]  totally different than what I'm seeing in court. So I figured out the only way for me to really
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:28.280]  find out what's going on is go down there and watch. So I went down there last Tuesday, I watched
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:34.600]  for four hours and for your listeners that don't know, jury selection involves first,
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:39.080]  you bring one one jury in at a time. First, the judge gets to ask them whatever questions they
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.800]  want, then the prosecution and then the defense. And the goal is to try and get non-biased jurors
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.800]  that don't have a strong opinion on the case or know that much about it. So that's the goal.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:57.960]  And what I was witnessing was a lot of the questions from Judge Edmunds or Anthony Chambers,
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:07.320]  that's Umar Frugabdou Mutalab, standby attorney, were really similar to each juror. I watched 18
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:13.080]  jurors get questions and two questions kept being repeated again and again, not by the prosecution
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:19.800]  though. And there are variations of these two questions. Do you think after listening to all
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:25.480]  the evidence and seeing all the testimony, you'll be able to determine whether Umar actually
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:32.280]  possessed a bomb or an explosive device? That was one of the questions that was repeated over
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:38.920]  and over. And the second one was, do you realize that sometimes the media doesn't always tell the
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:44.840]  truth? And of course, you know, with what I've been saying that's been going on in this case all
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:51.640]  along, again, that was just more confirmation to me as if I need it anymore. I don't think I really
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:58.520]  do. But that, you know, what I've been saying all along has been true now. Well, some folks aren't
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:04.200]  a lawyer though. So explain why a trained legal mind would see those questions is so damning.
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:11.960]  Well, with the first question about the bomb, you can see not only Anthony Chambers, but also
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:22.120]  Judge Edmonds questioning whether the jurors can tell if the bomb was really a bomb or was a safe
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:27.880]  bomb is what they're getting at, whether it was concocted to not explode and blow up a plane,
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:35.720]  but just merely to have some sort of minor incident. So you can see that's what the question was,
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:42.200]  you know, will you be able to tell if you really had a bomb or did he really have an explosive
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:48.920]  device? And of course, anyone, you know, just tuning into this, my theory on the case is that
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:57.080]  the US government, the undercover intelligence officers provided Omar with a fake bomb and
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:04.360]  put him on the plane intentionally to stage a fake terrorist attack. So that directly ties into what,
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:09.800]  you know, what I've been saying on the case. And then number two, you realize sometimes the media
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:15.960]  doesn't always tell the truth. So, you know, it was really hard to find jurors that hadn't heard
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:19.960]  something about this case. You know, almost everybody, especially here in Michigan, knows
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:27.000]  something about it. So again, directly pointing to the media not telling the truth in this case.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.840]  And obviously, the media's opinion on this case is that Omar is some lunatic,
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:38.600]  al-Qaeda not with a bomb that tried to take our plane down and that, you know, the US government
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:46.040]  was not evolving at all. So you can see the questions there for, you know, for the jury on
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:52.680]  that question. And trying to see if the jury is biased into this, that they've already made up
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:58.920]  their opinion that the media story is the true story, which obviously Judge Edmonds and Anthony
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:09.000]  Chambers both know is not the true story. Now, also at the hearing, it was somewhat interesting to me
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:15.640]  that Omar made some outbursts in court. He acted a little strange, which I hadn't seen before,
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:21.800]  I've been to, I don't know, four or five other hearings before this. And he made some statements
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:28.600]  like the US is a cancer, you know, we need to wipe out the US or something like that. And
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:36.840]  statements about ANWAR, ANWAR-L, Alaki still being alive. Now, after the hearing,
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:45.720]  I talked to an AP reporter. His name is Ed White. And this is what I said to Ed. I said,
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:52.680]  you know, I saw Omar before he boarded the plane. I saw him on the plane when he lit his fake bomb.
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:59.720]  And I've seen him in several hearings now. He's always very quiet, you know, hardly ever says
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:05.720]  anything. And this is really out of character for him. And what Ed White reported in his article,
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:14.760]  which is in print all over the place from the AP, Associated Press, AP. He left out two details.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:21.240]  He left out that I said it was a fake bomb. And he left out that I said that I saw Omar before
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:27.720]  he boarded. So I was kind of irritated with Ed White over that, because again, we see the mainstream
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:34.840]  media covering up for the government here. And not again. Oh, I'm sure the AP reporter dispatched
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:42.360]  by the Associated Press to cover this is very nonbiased. Kurt, I mean, come on, they're gonna,
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:48.440]  they're gonna make sure the truth comes out. You know, it's admitted the government helped get him
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:53.480]  on the plane. Why would the AP want to question the government about that? That's not an interesting
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:19:02.120]  point. Let's move on here, Kurt. Yeah, exactly. You know, I was pretty irritated once again,
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:07.240]  you know, if the media even talks to me at all. And most of the time, they don't even talk to me,
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.040]  or they talk to me and they don't print anything about it. But now,
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:15.800]  they're talking to me and twisting my words around. So to me, that's even worse than ignoring me,
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:21.960]  trying to, you know, we characterize what I'm saying here. So it's pretty irritated about that.
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:26.840]  But the hearing, the hearing ended with Judge Edmond saying, well, we're going to finish this
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:31.160]  up Thursday at 1 30. Kurt, I tell you, stay there and do one more segment. And I promise,
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:34.600]  folks, I'm going to get to all the news I haven't covered. And then your phone calls, those that

[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:44.200]  because this is so important. We're running out of time here today. And I've got to get to this

[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:26.440]  government got him on the plane and then the guy that witnessed all this and told the world before
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.280]  the undersecretary of state had to admit it, you go tell the AP this again. It has come out
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:36.600]  in the Detroit Free Press and a few other papers and you'd think that a real media would want to
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:45.320]  know about that. And then the big mystery of why doesn't Mutalib want this brought up? Why does he
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:56.600]  want to say that he's been set up or that he's working with the US government, the criminals
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:00.680]  that run it? And I want to ask you that question. I mean, I know you've talked to a standby lawyer
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:04.600]  and others. Is he completely crazy? Does he think he's a secret agent? We know they've done that
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:10.440]  before. Are they threatening his family? Is it like McVeigh? I mean, who knows, but getting back
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:16.760]  to the last point you were going to make about that of the trial. Yeah. So the hearing finished
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:22.280]  with Judge Adam and saying, we'll pick our final jury Thursday at 1.30 Thursday, you know, of last
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:30.520]  week. And we took a break and I had to go back to my office and I asked Anthony Chambers,
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:36.360]  assistant attorney, I said, look, you know, I haven't heard from your office in quite a while
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:41.480]  to expect that I'll be called as a witness in this case. And he said, as of now,
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:48.600]  that has not been determined. And I said, okay. And then I said, well, I'll see you on Thursday.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:53.800]  And I plan to come back Thursday to watch the final jury game play. Now, on Thursday,
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.040]  I had a trial in one of my own cases here at the firm that lasted till one o'clock. And then I was
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:05.720]  going to go over and watch the final jury game play. As I was leaving my trial, I got a text from
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:12.280]  my brother saying, I hear you're going to be testifying an underwear bomber case. And I had no
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:17.080]  idea where that was coming from because I hadn't even heard that myself. So I called him and what
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:22.120]  he said was I just heard here on the radio in Florida that you're going to be testifying
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:27.960]  underwear bomber case. He said, you know, Anthony Chambers said in court this morning that you'll
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:32.440]  be testifying. And he said, really, well, I'm going to try and find that out. I'm heading over
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:37.880]  there right now to watch final jury selection. So I started walking over to there. It's about
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:44.280]  four blocks away from the courthouse that I was at. And I ran into one of his office workers
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:49.560]  on the sidewalk. And I said, so what's this about me testifying something happened in court today?
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:56.520]  And he said, yeah, um, Omar said, you're going to testify for him. Right. And I was kind of shocked
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:02.200]  because my brother said it was Chambers. Remember, Omar is representing himself. So he has final
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.800]  say. So apparently, um, but what he said was you need to talk to Anthony Chambers about it for
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:13.480]  more detail. He's right there across the street. So I walked over to talk to him and Anthony Chambers
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:19.720]  said, uh, Judge Edmonds this morning asked Umar to provide a witness list. And Umar said, well,
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:25.080]  I don't have one ready. And then Judge Edmonds asked him who do you intend to call? And he said,
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:31.320]  well, my only witness is going to be attorney Astell. So let me just stop you right here because
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:37.960]  I'm going to be honest, uh, Saturday in Houston, listeners came over who were up in the Fed and
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:42.520]  said, you better get Haskell and he's got some powerful info. And I, and I said, you know,
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:48.600]  and the guy mentioned your blog and things. And then I just searched your name when I got home
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:55.960]  last night and saw the stuff about the questioning, uh, of the jurors. I thought that was the news
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:59.880]  because I'm busy like you are. I didn't know this. I've got to beg you back on the nightly news
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:03.960]  tonight. I wasn't even sure we needed you for both because now we're out of time and we've got to
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:10.360]  break this here. I mean, this is big news. I had no idea the underwear bomber who,
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:16.440]  I mean, obviously he knows it's come out that you really witnessed what happened.
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.720]  I mean, whoa, this is in her twilight zone. If we've got to come back, if you got the time,
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:27.560]  this is where you twilight zone level. Kurt, what is going on here? I didn't know this is my point.
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:34.040]  I don't really know a whole lot yet. I, like I said, I only talked to Anthony Chambers for
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:41.000]  a couple of minutes on the sidewalk and we agreed that I would meet with him in his office soon.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.480]  Now remember the prosecution gets to put on their case first and they've indicated they're going to
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:52.440]  take about a month. So I probably won't be on the stand for until early November. So, you know,
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:58.840]  there's still going to be some time here, but honestly, I'm absolutely stunned. I really
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:03.320]  did not think I would be called as a witness in this case with him representing himself.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:06.760]  Now, I thought for sure I would be a fan. Anthony Chambers took over the case,
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:12.280]  but he hasn't. He's still stand by, so I'm absolutely stunned that the underwear bomber
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:20.920]  himself plans to call me not only as a witness, he was only witness. So how ironic is this that
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:26.840]  someone that tried to blow up a plane with me on it, admittedly with a fake bomb,
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:31.880]  his life is now in my hands only? How ironic is that?
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:36.920]  Incredible. Kurt, stay there. Just to finish up with this and we'll have you back tonight.
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:41.480]  I mean, I knew you had a lot of breaking news, but this is insane. This underwear,
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:47.240]  things like Fast and Furious, it could bring down the Justice Department. This is incredible,
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:53.160]  incredible. I should have been plugging this all day. We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:56.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:06.360]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:10.920]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:15.320]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:21.160]  in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator.
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:26.680]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:30.520]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:36.440]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:42.200]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:50.040]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:55.320]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works. As well, we are always ready to answer
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:31:00.280]  any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:06.920]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:11.000]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past. History really does repeat
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:24.840]  itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:31.480]  action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to
[02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:37.800]  read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines
[02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:43.880]  in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available
[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:49.320]  at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival,
[02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:56.200]  how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:56.200 --> 02:32:04.440]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:10.120]  have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk. Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:15.240]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:20.600]  soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from
[02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:27.160]  vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:32.840]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:37.320]  and deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've
[02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:41.560]  never had before, you've had to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog
[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:49.560]  is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com. Take charge of your
[02:32:49.560 --> 02:33:04.440]  health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:20.920]  You take a model man and put him in control. Watch the government become a god. Watch him become a god.
[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:36.440]  Watch Heads of Role. That's Dave Mustaine, Megadeth. That's the one heavy metal band that
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:43.640]  if I listen to it will actually play back in my head afterwards later. I mean, I could actually
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:49.320]  hear it. You could imagine a song you like or something classical or whatever, but you can't
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:55.320]  actually play it back, but Megadeth, I can. I need to ask Dave why he thinks it has that
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:34:02.680]  effect on me. Very strange. Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, with Kurt Haskell,
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:08.840]  we're going to have him on tonight. Something like this I should have built up. I should have
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:13.800]  known. I just had a listener come up and say, hey, he's got really big stuff. Check his blog. It's
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:19.960]  huge. What's happening? Who's going to testify? You got to check it. I'm like, great, I will.
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:23.960]  Then I tell him last night we're up for doing the Sunday show. I said, get Haskell.
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:29.160]  And then I kind of checked the blog. I didn't even notice that somehow. I mean, this is huge. The
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:37.240]  fact that he's saying he doesn't want a lawyer. He's got a standby lawyer sitting there. The
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:42.520]  media is saying he's going to go along with it and say he did it. And now, I guess they didn't get
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.280]  his meds right or whatever's going on. He has an outburst and says, Kurt Haskell.
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:52.040]  Whoa, ladies and gentlemen, the guy that saw them get him on the plane.
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:58.200]  Kurt, you're a trained lawyer, a smart guy. You called this from the beginning.
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:03.960]  Now it's all unfolding. This is like something out of a movie. I pray they don't pressure him or
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:09.000]  whatever or showing pictures of his mama or whatever until he refuses to have you. But
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.480]  you know, the fact that he said you're on the list, is there something in legal precedent
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:19.320]  where if you are a honest witness that somehow you can force your way in as a witness?
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:26.120]  I'm not sure I understand the question. Well, I mean, let's say if he withdraws you later,
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:29.960]  I guess there's no way. I'm just rambling. This is insane.
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:36.600]  It's up to Umar. He can change his mind and not call me. But as of now, he intends to call me,
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:39.960]  again, not only as a witness, but his only witness. So
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:47.160]  how strange is that, Alex, that the underwear bomber who I've never talked to, never met,
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:55.880]  who tried to kill me, wants me to testify. Yet the prosecution not only doesn't want me to testify,
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:01.800]  has never even tried to contact me or talk to me ever. When I have first hand,
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:08.600]  I'm at first hand, I witness a count of the definite accomplice to the underwear bomber
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:14.360]  that should be a person on the FBI's 10 months one. Sir, sir, and the AP
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:20.840]  isn't even quoting you correctly and out of context. You should do a formal grievance with
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:27.240]  this and force them to retract because they took what you said out of context. You're there going,
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:32.200]  hey, I survived the bombing. They got him on the plane. It's admitted. And then they use your
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:38.040]  credibility to twist and push their official story. When you are the guy, this should be national
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:43.720]  news, but it's not. You are the only witness he's planning on calling. I was, I was watching a Fox
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:48.920]  news piece on this this morning. Nothing about you, Kurt. I mean, everyone should be obsessed
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:54.600]  nationwide over the number one trial right now. And who is the underwear bomber going to call? It's
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:59.960]  you. I know a lot of stuff ran through your mind. What are you? I mean, what could be going on here?
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:07.400]  I honestly don't know. I hate to speculate because, you know, if I speculate now about it,
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:11.880]  I could be grilled about it on the stand. So I don't really want to speculate about why I'm being
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:16.920]  called. You know, obviously the prosecution is going to go all out to try and paint me as some
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:23.320]  kind of crazy nut. So I got to really watch what I say. So I don't really want to speculate on why
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:29.080]  he's calling me at least right now, but I want to say something back about the AP. Now I talked to
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:36.520]  the AP again after the announcement Thursday that I'd be testifying. I got back to my office
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:43.880]  and I had a call again from Ed White and here's me stupidly talking to the AP again. I said,
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:50.280]  Ed, you misquoted me twice in your article from Tuesday. I said, I'm only going to talk to you
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:57.400]  on one condition that you accurately report what I say every word and don't cut or paste or twist
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:04.200]  my words around. So I talked to him again and here's what he reports in his Thursday article
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:11.480]  that I'm going to tell the court some wild story that I have about this. So as of Thursday, I'm
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:18.840]  done talking with the mainstream media with a couple exceptions of the couple of reporters that
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:26.120]  have, you know, I think have been fair to reporting this article, which are very, very few reporters.
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:30.680]  So, you know, if you're not seeing me in the mainstream media for a while, it's my choice.
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:35.720]  I'm only talking to a couple of them. One will be Fox TV though. I think they've been more than fair
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:44.120]  to me. So is that Fox local? Fox local. Yeah. I was about to say usually live local can be a
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.920]  lot more trusted. When you start at this level, having AP reporters come out of the woodwork,
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:53.000]  you can bet they've been hand vetted and sent in there. And I think you're experiencing that,
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.280]  but you could use this. You can demand AP actually get it right. I mean, instead of quoting what you
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:05.640]  told him, he just construed it down into wild stories, which prejudices everything he says.
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:11.880]  I mean, that is outrageous. It is outrageous. It's outrageous to the extent the media is going
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:18.840]  to cover up this story. This should be bombshell, a bombshell front page story everywhere across
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:23.880]  the United States. And they're doing their best to hide it, not cover it at all and paint me as a
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:29.400]  knife. Well, you know what? You're not going to be able to paint me as a knife. So good luck trying.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:34.600]  I'm going to, I'm going to tell the truth and I'm going to expose everything that there is in this
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:40.040]  case. You know, whether the media reports on it or not, it's going to be on the record. And, you
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:44.760]  know, people may be shocked that the underwear bomber actually gets a verdict of not guilty
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:51.400]  instead of guilty. But you know what? Even if the man tried to kill me, he deserves a fair trial.
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:58.280]  He doesn't deserve to go to life in prison because, you know, the evidence not being presented fairly
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:04.840]  in the case. Well, the issue is he was gotten on the airplane. Those are all accomplices or
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:12.040]  potential accomplices. The cover up is proof that they are the accomplices. We have the
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:17.400]  undersecretary of state in sworn congressional testimony shang an unnamed agency told him to
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:23.960]  help the underwear bomber. I mean, that is absolute proof right there that there needs to be a
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:29.960]  serious public discourse about this. And then you add the absconding all this cover up going on.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:34.920]  I mean, that is definite evidence. And I know you don't like to speculate, but
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:42.920]  this could be like Fast and Furious. This could bring them down. I'm going to... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:49.800]  It can actually be bigger, Alex, if you start pulling at the string of the ball of yarn because,
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:55.000]  you know, you start looking at these things one step at a time. Okay, well, we have
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.160]  a so-called terrorist. Okay. Well, now we have an admission that he was put on the plane intentionally.
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:07.560]  Okay. Now we have evidence that he had a fake bomb, which is going to come out in testimony.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:14.360]  The experts that are going to testify. Okay. So where did he get his fake bomb? Well, obviously,
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:19.880]  it was given to him by, you know, an undercover agent of the U.S. government. Okay. So now we have
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:26.360]  that. We also have admissions that Anwar Al-Awaki was involved in this plot. Well,
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:33.000]  how is he involved if it's a fake plot by undercover U.S. intelligence officers? Okay. I
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:38.840]  guess he's also undercover U.S. intelligence officer. If we have that, then, you know,
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:43.720]  it's been lotten also an undercover U.S. intelligence officer. You can see where this is
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:48.360]  going, Alex. You just keep pulling the string and pretty soon everything unravels. That's how
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:53.960]  big of a story this could be. Huge, huge. Well, absolutely. I've been out of the loop because
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:58.280]  I've been driving around, you know, Texas protesting the Fed and a listener said, Hey,
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:03.080]  Haspel's got some big stuff. You better get him on. And then I'm like an ignorant buffoon talking
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.880]  about fast and furious with you. And you go, Oh, by the way, one more thing. And Kurt Nemo just
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.880]  came in here and said, No, it's in the local paper this morning. So I guess this is national news
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:17.240]  that you're the only witness that he's saying he's going to call. And you'd think every media
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:21.160]  station out there will want to put you on live. But you notice they're not doing that because
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:25.880]  they want to just have the AP call up and twist everything you've said. Man, this is,
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.480]  I'm going to tell you something, Kurt. I'm going to be honest. I'm not trying to scary. I know you
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:34.040]  say all they can do is kill you. And I got the same position here in my life. And once you know
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:38.920]  this evil's going on, you instinctively, spiritually, whatever you want to call it,
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:44.040]  know it's got to be face down, especially when it happens to you individually. But I got a chill
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:50.280]  when you announced that. And I was like a deer in the headlights here for your safety and for
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:54.280]  Mutalib, because whatever they're pressuring him with, and I don't like to speculate, but I've
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:59.160]  got a pretty, I know you seem like you're smarter than I am in some way. So I wish you would speculate
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:03.880]  because I mean, I'm trying to put my finger on this, but whatever pressure they've got on him
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:09.560]  isn't working, whatever they're threatening in his family, or he's figuring out he's been set up.
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:14.600]  Because they do that a lot with these type people because I've seen so many of these in history,
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:19.720]  not just in our country, but other countries. We know there's a playbook. And so I would follow
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:26.680]  playbooks of past Patsy's McVeigh, Lee Harvey Oswald, folks like that. You start getting a really
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:32.280]  sir hand, sir hand, a really clear image of how they're going to pull this and how they've profiled
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:37.640]  him and what they've done. But you two guys, I'm going to tell you right now, Kurt, I'm not trying
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:43.400]  to scare you and your wife, you know this, you need everybody's prayers right now. And you also,
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:50.120]  you're not suicidal, correct, Kurt? No, Alex, I'm not suicidal. You would never commit suicide.
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.400]  No, never. Okay. And I'm sorry to even raise this, but I mean,
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:04.440]  I mean, I really feel the danger level here. No, I understand. I, you know, that I understand
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:08.600]  where you're coming from, especially with the case of the DC madam and some of these other cases.
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:14.200]  So I know, you know, I know where you're coming from. Well, you know what though, you're so public
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:25.080]  now that I, it's just, wow. Wow. The question is, how, how is the prosecution plan on handling this?
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:32.120]  Obviously, I present a huge problem to them. So, you know, that's, I think that's a legitimate
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:39.240]  question I have. Well, take the anthrax attack. They tried to frame three patsies, didn't work.
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:44.440]  So the fourth guy they grabbed, they took to a government psychiatric facility. He ODs
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:50.760]  on prescription Tylenol while he's in straight jacket. And now it's come out that he was completely
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:54.760]  innocent and world authorities are coming out saying it's totally fake. So I mean,
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:45:01.000]  that's what I'm talking about with the feds, man. They are, they do these botched things
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.720]  like launching the anthrax attack, first world trade center attack, all of it.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:11.960]  And then they go to any end to get their patsy nailed. But now you've got fast and furious. It's
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.920]  just the difference is 10 years ago, they still had some credibility. They have no credibility
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:22.040]  with people, Kurt. Well, no credibility with people that are paying attention.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.840]  Yeah. Great deal. Great deal. The population of the United States doesn't pay any attention. So,
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:34.840]  you know, they still have some credibility with those that has put their head in the sand.
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:39.000]  Todd, almighty. Folks, I don't know if Kurt even wants me to do this, but
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:42.600]  Kurt, would you be happy for folks out there to pray for you?
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:45.320]  Oh, sure, Alex.
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:53.080]  Well, I found it. I found it really, it does good. And also right about you. Give us your blog,
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.760]  because I think the safest thing here is to get you as much attention as possible. Give your
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:04.040]  blog out for folks. Sure. Haskellfamily.blogspot.com. All right, Kurt, I know I've been basically
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:07.480]  just dumbfounded here by this announcement on air that everybody else seemed to know.
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:12.920]  Anything else you'd like to have before you join us tonight and kind of recap this on the nightly
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:20.680]  news? Just one last thing, you know, I found something else over the weekend that the
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:27.160]  prosecutor's office that is handling this case, the last terrorism case that they handled,
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:33.240]  Kurt Kretrini was the guy's last name, was overturned on appeal because the prosecutor's
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:38.440]  office hid evidence from the defense during the trial. And I've seen two pretrial hearings already
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:43.320]  where the prosecutors have attempted to not turn over evidence to the defense in this case. So,
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:47.480]  I just thought that was pretty interesting. Yeah. I mean, if they've got a lone nut,
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:53.000]  pop, doing this with a firecracker in his pants, why not just go with that? All of this covering
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  up and twisting, I mean, that's, and there's so much of it. I forget in Latin where covering up
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:06.360]  something is called the highest form of proof. In some cases, it's even higher than eyewitness.
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:10.840]  What is that Latin term? Do you remember that, Kurt? No, I don't.
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.640]  Somebody will email it to me. All right, we'll talk to you tonight, sir. Thank you so much for
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:22.280]  spending time with us. No problem, Alex. Wow. I am just a man. I tell you, this is crazy. And
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:26.600]  I'm glad Kurt Haskell trusts us enough to come on this show when he's not talking to the rest of
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:33.320]  the media. Yeah, here it is. Chicago Tribune. Lawyer may testify for defense and terror case.
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:38.120]  You know, more and more, I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. I'm going to be honest. More and
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:44.120]  more stuff is just getting so weird. And all the people I'm talking to and that you're listening
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:51.320]  to, I mean, when does it end? I want the government to not be terrorist. I want. Hey, Kurt, come on
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:55.720]  in, buddy. I'm sorry. I know I have to come up there and I need to put a speakerphone here.
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:03.640]  What's going on, Commander? Oh, yeah. Hey, how's it going on that article about
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:11.240]  head of Federal Reserve Security? Okay, but this my computer must cash forever. I knew it would be
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:16.280]  up. I just keep hitting refresh, refresh, refresh. I think that's a really big article. I got all
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:20.600]  this news. I want to cover and I'm so exhausted. I don't even want to cover it. Oh, there it is.
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:25.400]  Head of Security at San Antonio Fed admits institution is private.
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:33.240]  Head of Security at San Antonio Fed admits institution is private. Well, that is a big deal
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:37.400]  because when that cop was standing next to him and the guy admitted that it was private, the cop
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:43.720]  was like, what? All these years, the cops are told that we're crazy. There's no end to this.
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:49.640]  It's all a false reality, man. I couldn't get I couldn't find his name. So we don't know what
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:54.200]  his name is. It's not in the video. All right. Well, I thought he said he said you got to talk
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:59.720]  to captain. I don't think he knew that San Antonio cop didn't know the guy's name. No, I looked it up.
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:04.360]  I think his name's on there. Okay, I'll try. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:08.200]  matter. Why don't you just call down there? Oh, it's a holiday. I did. I got voicemail.
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:12.280]  It's a holiday called tomorrow. It doesn't matter. There's the sign at the Dallas Fed that says
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:18.920]  private property. It's just Captain Nemo. It's the first comment. Everybody knows they are private.
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:23.400]  Well, that's original. We'll call you Captain Nemo. So as Fed admits the truth,
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:27.800]  hell of a long story for the news that does nothing to change the situation.
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:32.760]  Yeah, it's your fault that we're here working hard and exposing this just because this guy,
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:38.520]  just because this guy already knows it means everybody else does. People think by osmosis.
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:42.200]  Like all the time some news breaks and I get emails going, you piece of filth,
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:45.640]  you didn't report this. And I'm like, well, thank you for letting me know.
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:49.400]  Most people, it's not even on the radio. It's not even on the radar screen,
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:54.760]  most for most people, you know? They don't know it, but these are the kind of comments we get.
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:01.080]  Well, Kurt, you deserve it. I mean, you're a bad person. I am terrible. I mean, it's all your fault.
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:10.840]  But there's a proof right there is a photo of this private property right there. Bingo.
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:18.360]  Oh, it's nothing. I bet that guy's a paid show. I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:25.000]  I mean, we could have the Virgin Mary set down in front of them and make them a pasta dinner and
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:29.320]  they wouldn't, you know, care. We'd have space aliens laying on this guy's backyard. He wouldn't
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.080]  care. Head of security at San Antonio Fed admits institution is private.
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:39.080]  Amazing. And we got a call update. I'm going to change the headline because I was wrong when I
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:42.440]  said that guy was a cop. The cop's there, but that's the head of their security.
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:46.280]  Thank you, Kurt. I appreciate you coming in here. Good job on that. All right, we'll,
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:51.240]  we'll come back and take some calls. I got a bunch of news I got to get to on Obama.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:57.080]  Maybe I'll go into overdrive. But I am so exhausted, man. I just beat me to death going
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:03.400]  to those protests this weekend. I'm sure going to UFC wasn't life before the collapse.
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:18.520]  Final LP by the Lost Biggers.
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:48.520]  Life before the collapse by the Lost Biggers. Oh, yeah.

[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:12.520]  All right, this is a big, big deal and I cannot do justice to this in the time we have left today.
[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:23.960]  But Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, again this weekend, New York Post, just you name it,
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:30.280]  are all, including Rahm Emanuel, are saying, yeah, Obama may not be able to be reelected.
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:38.280]  Basically, they're all saying it's his fault. This is a teleprompter reading CIA manufactured
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:49.320]  nobody. Just like George W. Bush was a nobody. Bill Clinton was a nobody. These are nobodies.
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:54.200]  These are frontmen. Shields, the new order picks up and they take all the blame. They throw the
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:58.280]  shield down. That's why I'm going after the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve wants to make you go
[02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:05.240]  after Wall Street. That's a totally different animal than the Federal Reserve. Wall Street is
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:11.000]  just American publicly traded companies. That's like you're trying to kill one person in Dallas
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:17.400]  so you nuke the whole city. No, I want to go directly to the problem. And as much as I hate
[02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:23.320]  Obama and Bush, I mean, they're all on savory sell out fake pieces of trash. I mean, I hate these
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:28.920]  teleprompter readers on the news, but they're not my enemy. They're just a rancid little sell out
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:34.200]  person. I actually feel sorry for them. They never experienced truth. They never experienced honor.
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:40.120]  All they've experienced is a bunch of knuckle dragon, ladder climbing, sell out behavior.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:45.560]  Thank God we're not with those timid, pathetic vassals.
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.960]  That's why it makes me so mad when Fox News and the media, they've done it repeatedly now,
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.920]  say, Alex Jones wants to come to work with us, but we don't want him. See, they need you to think
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:02.920]  they're special and got something you want. I don't want to drink a bucket of rotten vomit.
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:12.040]  That's what Fox News is. That's like some makes me want to throw up. Makes me want to throw up.
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:19.800]  And they're there nailing Obama right now because they want you to think he did all this.
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:26.040]  The Federal Reserve, the globalist, David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrix, Lord Rothschild,
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:32.520]  they did it. They're the ones that did it. You got all this big banker funded attack on
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:38.440]  the free market. The big bankers don't want a free market. And so everybody's like,
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.640]  woo, I hear all these neocons on radio. Woo, we're beating Obama. Woo, boy, we're really getting him.
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:48.600]  You're like kids beating a piñata thinking you're really beating up a
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:55.240]  Trinosaurus Rex or whatever it is. I was driving by one day and saw kids look like a Frankenstein
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:00.840]  piñata. They're all beating it. You know, kid, I'm beating up. Woo, I'm beating the real monster.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:06.600]  No, you're not. I don't want to play games with some teleprompter reading nobody.
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:13.000]  Now, when he was built up at first as a symbol to sell evil, I said, he's a puppet. We got to
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:20.760]  pull him down. But it doesn't mean now we all get into, woo, we had a victory. Woo, Obama's going down.
[02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:25.480]  How about the crooks at the Justice Department who are there,
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:30.680]  no matter who's in office? How about all those crooks that ship drugs in here? How about they get
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:34.040]  in trouble? How about the Federal Reserve banks that launder the money? How about they get in
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:39.560]  trouble? That's cold blooded to make drugs illegal. So you get higher profits and then
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:45.400]  they have long prison sentences for the low-level drug dealers that bought drugs from you.
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:53.880]  And then they get out of the prison with a four to 10-year degree in crime to go run scams on
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:58.440]  me and my family. And then the drug dealers that run the country try to pass legislation to take
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:05.160]  my guns so I can't protect myself from the zombie drughead criminals you created through your social
[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:10.040]  engineering the same way you brought down China with opium. I mean, I've studied history. I got
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:16.520]  your number. I got it. You understand? I got it. I see you. I see you. And I'm going to get as many
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:22.360]  people as I can to see you. I know people won't be mad at me. I wanted to hear from you. I tried to
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:26.680]  take a lot of calls today. I did okay. I'm not going to do five minutes overdrive. I'm too exhausted.
[02:58:27.720 --> 02:58:30.440]  And the only reason I'm telling you I'm exhausted because I'm not, you know, I just,
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:34.200]  I'm kind of leaning on the rails here. I'll be back with the news tonight, seven o'clock.
[02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:52.920]  I'll be back tomorrow. Lord willing. God bless you all. Prison Planet dot TV tonight, seven o'clock.
