[00:00.000 --> 00:24.880]  In the 90s, Mar-a-Lago was Trump's South Florida party palace, one frequented by Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:24.880 --> 00:27.320]  Today Donald Trump has three friends in jail.
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.400]  Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, now Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:30.400 --> 00:38.760]  Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a sex offender and accused sex trafficker.
[00:38.760 --> 00:45.000]  The mainstream media is focused on the connections between President Trump and convicted pedophile
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.280]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:48.280 --> 00:53.240]  And yet they ignore the biggest part of the Epstein story.
[00:53.240 --> 00:58.640]  The thing about Jeffrey Epstein is that he is connected to a long list of some of the
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.640]  most influential and powerful people in the world.
[01:03.640 --> 01:11.040]  Influential media names such as Rupert Murdoch, George Stephanopoulos, Woody Allen, and actor
[01:11.040 --> 01:17.040]  Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexually assaulting a minor and was a frequent guest
[01:17.040 --> 01:20.520]  to Epstein's pedophile island.
[01:20.520 --> 01:29.880]  Fledeliques such as Prince Andrew, Lynn Forrester-Daroff Child, Sarah Ferguson, the Count and Countess
[01:29.880 --> 01:37.000]  of the House of Bismarck, and the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanel Bolkia, who was accused
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.640]  of drugging and raping a group of women who were hired for promotional work, including
[01:42.640 --> 01:46.000]  Miss USA 1997.
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.440]  The case was dismissed on the grounds that Bolkia had sovereign immunity.
[01:52.440 --> 01:58.360]  Jeffrey Epstein is closely connected to President Bill Clinton, as well as his daughter Chelsea
[01:58.360 --> 02:01.760]  and his former National Security Advisor.
[02:01.760 --> 02:07.360]  He has connections to several other politicians, including Chuck Schumer, Ted Kennedy, and
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.360]  John Kerry.
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.920]  Jeffrey Epstein served on the Council on Foreign Relations with Henry Kissinger and on the
[02:14.920 --> 02:22.480]  Rockefeller University Board with Nancy Kissinger, and provided services to Saudi Arabian arms
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.000]  dealer Abnan Khashoggi.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.160]  Epstein's private island, known as Pedophile Island by the Locals, is located in the biggest
[02:32.160 --> 02:38.360]  hotbed of the human sex trade and is just miles away from neighbor and friend Richard
[02:38.360 --> 02:39.860]  Branson.
[02:39.860 --> 02:45.520]  Epstein is associated with Edgar Bronfman, the father of Claire Bronfman, who is also
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.320]  Epstein's neighbor in the Caribbean and is a major part of the Nixian cult, who has been
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.200]  charged with child porn and human trafficking.
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.280]  Jeffrey Epstein's Zorro Ranch property in New Mexico was purchased from Governor Bruce
[03:01.280 --> 03:09.560]  King in 1993 and is insulated on all sides by properties owned by the powerful King
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.560]  family.
[03:10.560 --> 03:19.200]  It is a mystery how Jeffrey Epstein acquired his wealth and influence, but the most simple
[03:19.200 --> 03:25.920]  explanation seems to be sex trafficking and blackmail.
[03:25.920 --> 03:32.240]  Alexandra Costa claimed that Epstein belonged to intelligence.
[03:32.240 --> 03:38.000]  With all of the power and influence involved, it seems it will take a miracle for the Jeffrey
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.680]  Epstein case to ever see justice.
[03:42.680 --> 03:59.040]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  for our society.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.640]  Why are they doing this now?
[04:05.640 --> 04:09.560]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but they...
[04:09.560 --> 04:10.560]  Yes.
[04:10.560 --> 04:11.560]  Exactly.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.560]  Yeah.
[04:12.560 --> 04:16.600]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now
[04:16.600 --> 04:20.200]  they banned him, they banned his little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.400]  Now that they kicked them off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll
[04:24.400 --> 04:25.640]  back the clock.
[04:25.640 --> 04:29.720]  You have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.280]  I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things
[04:34.280 --> 04:38.120]  and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[04:38.120 --> 04:39.600]  I have no issue with it at all.
[04:39.600 --> 04:43.600]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.720]  for our society.
[04:45.720 --> 04:49.680]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[04:49.680 --> 05:00.280]  But don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.640]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[05:05.640 --> 05:09.720]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.840]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.480]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.000]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.280]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[05:31.280 --> 05:35.640]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[05:35.640 --> 05:41.360]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[05:41.360 --> 05:46.160]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.160]  going to find anywhere.
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.400]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[05:52.400 --> 06:00.080]  Revolution against the tyrants at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[06:22.400 --> 06:47.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, July 31,
[06:47.720 --> 06:53.560]  2019 Global Transmission, it's about all the attacks by the establishment, thanks to your
[06:53.560 --> 07:01.840]  support we're here in some ways more effective and stronger in others, but certainly in battles.
[07:01.840 --> 07:11.920]  Okay, I would like to be able to focus here today on the incredibly boring, but at the
[07:11.920 --> 07:21.120]  same time, horrifying second round of the Democrat debates that kicked off last night
[07:21.120 --> 07:22.960]  in Detroit, Michigan.
[07:22.960 --> 07:26.720]  I would really like to do that and we're going to be doing that and we have as you can see
[07:26.720 --> 07:36.880]  as a TV viewer, satellite feed directly into the main circus ring as part of our clown world
[07:36.880 --> 07:44.320]  Part 2 global coverage, quite frankly last night I was up here for part of the live broadcast
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.240]  doing it tonight, this one should be even more lively with Joe Biden being attacked,
[07:49.240 --> 07:54.560]  but it was nauseating to watch and in fact at one point anybody wanted to tune into another
[07:54.560 --> 08:00.600]  place could, I just cut away for 20 minutes at a time because I just couldn't watch it
[08:00.600 --> 08:02.920]  and couldn't listen to it.
[08:02.920 --> 08:09.880]  I drove home, watched the rest of our coverage till we ended at past midnight, then of course
[08:09.880 --> 08:14.760]  we came back live this morning at 5am, so we're having 40 hour marathon transmission
[08:14.760 --> 08:20.680]  right now that we're in the middle of, but I then went through the highlights and the
[08:20.680 --> 08:27.480]  lowlights of it all and it's just unbelievable, this is communism, this is authoritarianism,
[08:27.480 --> 08:34.760]  this is evil, this is enslavement.
[08:34.760 --> 08:47.200]  And there is no doubt that these individuals are absolutely financed and paid and put into
[08:47.200 --> 08:55.960]  their positions of power to sabotage and bring this nation down, I mean that's what's going
[08:55.960 --> 08:58.840]  on here.
[08:58.840 --> 09:08.400]  And I know all of you know that, but we really need to let that burn in, let that burn in.
[09:08.400 --> 09:17.920]  Now let's play a clip first of Marianne Williamson, the new ager who in a drudge poll won, a Google
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.480]  poll won, a bunch of other polls won by a huge margin even though she was given the least
[09:22.480 --> 09:26.640]  amount of time and even though they say this is her last debate.
[09:26.640 --> 09:29.360]  Now why was it that she was so popular?
[09:29.360 --> 09:39.360]  Because she was the only one that was genuine, she was genuinely wrong, she was genuinely
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.800]  saying a lot of things that weren't true, but she meant well it was from a position of
[09:45.800 --> 09:52.840]  a useful idiot, but at least there was humanity there, the woodenness, the plasticness of the
[09:52.840 --> 10:00.600]  others, even when Bernie tried to act up real and upset, it just came off as bossy.
[10:00.600 --> 10:10.120]  The mechanicalness of this whole thing really made people recoil, but these are the slaves
[10:10.120 --> 10:15.560]  of the globalists, these are the people on the mega bank payroll and the big multinational
[10:15.560 --> 10:20.840]  payroll, the UN payroll, the IMF payroll, and the Chicom payroll, these are the America
[10:20.840 --> 10:21.840]  haters.
[10:21.840 --> 10:27.760]  So this is the type of knuckle dragon trash, the type of poison being injected into America's
[10:27.760 --> 10:29.600]  veins to bring us down.
[10:29.600 --> 10:36.200]  Now I would love as I said to cover all these lowlights first and we're going to get to
[10:36.200 --> 10:44.920]  some right now, but at the bottom of the hour I'm going to cover the big stories and that's
[10:44.920 --> 10:52.360]  global conflict is shimmering over, China is making its move under their dictator who
[10:52.360 --> 11:02.400]  has more power at the mouth of tongue, Xi, and is mashing troops on the bridge preparing
[11:02.400 --> 11:04.400]  to invade Hong Kong.
[11:04.400 --> 11:13.720]  Now we reported on this on Sunday, but now it's in the Australian news, it's in the US
[11:13.720 --> 11:17.400]  news and the Pentagon says that indeed that's what has happened, they've already had Chinese
[11:17.400 --> 11:24.400]  troops come in in plain clothes and attack the folks that don't want to be fully absorbed
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.000]  in the mainland under an extradition law that allows them to be arrested and disappeared
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.960]  like regular Chinese citizens and taken back to the mainland for organ harvesting.
[11:35.960 --> 11:39.560]  I'm not kidding, that's what the riots are about and the fact that people are already
[11:39.560 --> 11:40.560]  disappearing.
[11:40.560 --> 11:47.440]  So if you think Tiananmen Square was a big massacre in the capital of the Chinese hellhole
[11:47.440 --> 11:57.840]  back in 1989, this is going to be horrible and it's going to be spectacularly bigger.
[11:57.840 --> 12:03.840]  So the government's Chai Kong run in Hong Kong and they've already killed a bunch of
[12:03.840 --> 12:10.160]  people, but now it's about to go supernova and there's a bunch of other big conflicts
[12:10.160 --> 12:11.160]  taking place.
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.480]  These stories are all up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.960]  Crackdown coming, China gathers forces on Hong Kong border amid unrest.
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.720]  We just witnessed three major developments that could easily lead to global war.
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.680]  I'm going to cover all that at the bottom of the hour.
[12:29.680 --> 12:37.840]  But first let's go ahead and play this clip where Marianne Williamson talks about dark
[12:37.840 --> 12:49.760]  psychic forces, now she's projecting who she is serving, who brought her there to speak.
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.360]  But when she keeps showing up in the polls right up there with the congresswoman from
[12:56.360 --> 13:06.080]  Hawaii, the system is preparing to remove them because they resonate too much truth.
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.200]  But notice she says because the government doesn't care about you and rich, powerful
[13:11.200 --> 13:18.360]  racist forces want to hurt you, they don't care and are giving you bad water.
[13:18.360 --> 13:25.480]  It's very easy to purify water in areas like Michigan.
[13:25.480 --> 13:31.080]  But because the IMF and World Bank got international laws passed, we're under their regulations,
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.880]  you have to put giant expensive systems in that don't even clean it and then they add
[13:35.880 --> 13:43.440]  chemicals, chlorine and all this other garbage to it and hydrofluorosalic acid from all over
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.320]  the world is shipped in here as a toxic waste and added to the water.
[13:47.320 --> 13:50.160]  76% of our water is fluoridated.
[13:50.160 --> 13:56.160]  So oh, I'm the other poisons in the water guy, I'm the cook, but it's everywhere, it's
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.160]  true.
[13:57.160 --> 14:07.160]  And he's blaming Trump saying he won't fix the water when Trump is not doing any of that.
[14:07.160 --> 14:11.920]  And the so-called clean water act in all of that is a smoke screen for the fact that they
[14:11.920 --> 14:14.840]  take control of our water and put poison in it.
[14:14.840 --> 14:20.080]  And Trump's saying let local governments decide what's best and how they want to do it.
[14:20.080 --> 14:21.520]  So here's part of the clip.
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.320]  Ms. Williamson, what's your response on the Flint water crisis?
[14:25.320 --> 14:30.000]  My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.560]  I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina, where there is a lot of talk about it being
[14:34.560 --> 14:36.320]  the next Flint.
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.520]  We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act.
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.760]  We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.440]  over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice.
[14:47.440 --> 14:49.360]  I assure you, I lived in Gross Point.
[14:49.360 --> 14:52.080]  What happened in Flint would not have happened in Gross Point.
[14:52.080 --> 14:58.080]  This is part of the dark underbelly of American society, the racism, the bigotry, and the
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.720]  entire conversation that we're having here tonight.
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.200]  If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.960]  collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid
[15:09.960 --> 15:12.520]  that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.
[15:12.520 --> 15:14.040]  We need to say it like it is.
[15:14.040 --> 15:15.280]  It's bigger than Flint.
[15:15.280 --> 15:16.280]  It's all over this country.
[15:16.280 --> 15:17.800]  It's particularly people of color.
[15:17.800 --> 15:20.720]  It's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.200]  And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're
[15:24.200 --> 15:25.200]  there for us?
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.160]  And if those people don't feel that they won't vote for us, then Donald Trump will win.
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.960]  So Donald Trump, he's poisoned in the water, not the Democrats and the globalists that
[15:33.960 --> 15:36.400]  set all this up.
[15:36.400 --> 15:39.640]  And by the way, David Hogg attacked me for saying you should filter your water, and then
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.720]  he goes, and he sells water filters.
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.520]  He's trying to make money absolutely off doing something good.
[15:45.520 --> 15:46.680]  You can't trust the government.
[15:46.680 --> 15:48.000]  You can't trust the globalists.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.080]  You've got to filter your own water yourself and the water you shower in if you want to
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.080]  live longer.
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.680]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.680 --> 16:04.600]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.600 --> 16:06.160]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:06.160 --> 16:09.120]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.120 --> 16:12.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:12.400 --> 16:14.640]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.640 --> 16:15.960]  I can help you too.
[16:15.960 --> 16:19.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.200]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:21.200 --> 16:29.280]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.440]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.680]  backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:38.680 --> 16:40.480]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:40.480 --> 16:44.360]  Bill Hyde, here I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.960]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:48.960 --> 16:49.960]  off the grid.
[16:49.960 --> 16:53.880]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[16:53.880 --> 16:55.320]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.320]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[16:59.320 --> 17:02.920]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:02.920 --> 17:07.280]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:07.280 --> 17:08.640]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.920]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[18:57.280 --> 19:00.320]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them.
[19:00.320 --> 19:09.080]  What's happening now, right now, all over the world, humanity is fighting back against
[19:09.080 --> 19:10.920]  the transhumanist globalist world government, mark of the beast, agenda.
[19:10.920 --> 19:14.840]  The forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear in full wars,
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.840]  more than ever.
[19:15.840 --> 19:21.800]  Well, we're doing a special 40 hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and

[19:43.760 --> 19:48.200]  that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[19:48.200 --> 19:53.040]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show or clownworld.us.
[19:53.040 --> 20:04.080]  Please take action.
[20:04.080 --> 20:11.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.440 --> 20:30.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.480 --> 20:39.200]  There are never any slow news days, there haven't been the 25 years of it on air because we
[20:39.200 --> 20:43.600]  don't just go off whatever mainstream media says the big story of the day is, but sometimes
[20:43.600 --> 20:45.960]  whatever the big story of the day is, we will focus on it.
[20:45.960 --> 20:49.160]  Well, there are a lot of big stories of the day here.
[20:49.160 --> 20:54.200]  Next segment, I'm going to get into it, China is massing troops to invade Hong Kong, they've
[20:54.200 --> 20:58.560]  already invaded with a plain clothes pair of military, you think Tiananmen Square was
[20:58.560 --> 20:59.560]  bad?
[20:59.560 --> 21:04.320]  Well, you may see nothing yet, in fact, let's queue up Tiananmen Square footage if we can
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.120]  to the famous tank man and the rest of it for next segment because that's where we're
[21:09.120 --> 21:10.120]  going.
[21:10.120 --> 21:15.880]  They're also threatening to invade Taiwan as Trump just sold $2 billion of anti-ship
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.680]  missiles to them.
[21:21.680 --> 21:30.680]  Now that's all coming up next segment.
[21:30.680 --> 21:33.920]  Let me just tell you what else I'm going to be covering about the broadcast and what's
[21:33.920 --> 21:42.520]  up on infowars.com and newswars.com that I'm here looking at.
[21:42.520 --> 21:49.160]  Starting a week ago and now right through to today, there have been a whole bunch of
[21:49.160 --> 21:57.440]  mainstream publications come out and apologize to Trump and that's a really good thing and
[21:57.440 --> 22:04.800]  apologize for Russiagate admitting it's fake and a big federal judge in New York just threw
[22:04.800 --> 22:09.320]  out a DNC lawsuit against Trump saying he's basically a Russian agent and the Democrat
[22:09.320 --> 22:16.160]  judge appointed by Bill Clinton said, none of what's in your lawsuit represents anything
[22:16.160 --> 22:22.440]  happening in reality, close quote and that article is up on infowars.com.
[22:22.440 --> 22:37.280]  So we're going to go over some of those coming up in the fifth segment of this hour but the
[22:37.280 --> 22:44.560]  bigger question is what about everybody that got deplatformed in the name of being Russian
[22:44.560 --> 22:45.560]  agents or Russian bots?
[22:45.560 --> 22:51.240]  What about all the hearings where they have the CIA left us from the CIA testify that I'm
[22:51.240 --> 22:53.800]  a Russian agent and I'm going to be taken off the air?
[22:53.800 --> 22:58.680]  That's what all this media disinfo and all these attacks has been.
[22:58.680 --> 23:04.120]  That's why it resembled the type of propaganda you see before a war against the country we're
[23:04.120 --> 23:05.560]  going to invade.
[23:05.560 --> 23:10.320]  That's because Obama legalized using the CIA against the American people seven years
[23:10.320 --> 23:15.040]  ago, the New York Post reported on it.
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.520]  Obama and Congress legalized domestic propaganda and the CIA.
[23:19.520 --> 23:24.000]  So I'm not a victim here, I'm a target because I've been effective telling the truth because
[23:24.000 --> 23:36.320]  I'm a loyal American but criminal globalist in control of our weaponized systems have
[23:36.320 --> 23:40.600]  been waging war against the American people and it's taken Trump almost three years to
[23:40.600 --> 23:46.600]  just get some control over the executive branch.
[23:46.600 --> 23:56.240]  So I'm not here saying that I need relief, though that would be nice.
[23:56.240 --> 24:01.720]  I'm saying the president and the Pentagon and some of the better people in those agencies
[24:01.720 --> 24:04.640]  who understand how dangerous this is to the country and the world and understand that
[24:04.640 --> 24:09.240]  Obama was allied with the Chai comms and others that this has got to be removed out of our
[24:09.240 --> 24:14.400]  system if we've got any hope of a future but you can't leave these people in place because
[24:14.400 --> 24:21.640]  they're so dug in and then not know they're not going to keep leaking this info, keep sabotaging
[24:21.640 --> 24:26.520]  the recovery and keep coming after you as well.
[24:26.520 --> 24:33.600]  And that's what Admiral Rogers went and told Trump when he was president, elect and we knew
[24:33.600 --> 24:40.360]  through forces at Trump Tower at that time that Trump had been told he was being illegally
[24:40.360 --> 24:49.240]  spied on, that's why we broke it all in and around the inauguration.
[24:49.240 --> 24:52.960]  So this is the real deal.
[24:52.960 --> 24:55.960]  Why do you think so many people in media rolled over to the intimidation?
[24:55.960 --> 25:04.520]  Because they'll dox your family, they will threaten those that work with you, they will
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.960]  take your credit ratings away, they will physically attack you, they will set you up, they will
[25:09.960 --> 25:12.680]  try to put you in prison.
[25:12.680 --> 25:18.280]  You know why do you think the Pentagon computers have more child porn on it than any other
[25:18.280 --> 25:19.280]  government computers?
[25:19.280 --> 25:22.640]  It's not because the Pentagon's looking at porn.
[25:22.640 --> 25:28.160]  I reported on this 20 years ago or child porn for that matter.
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.400]  They know all those computers are heavily watched even if they wanted to look at that
[25:31.400 --> 25:34.400]  crap, that evil.
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.040]  It came out, I learned almost 20 years ago that they were going around on people's computers
[25:38.040 --> 25:44.360]  planting it with viruses that the CIA had and then they come in and tell the officers
[25:44.360 --> 25:48.040]  and people, well, this was found and we know it's probably not you, but everything's going
[25:48.040 --> 25:53.720]  to be okay, but we need you to work with us.
[25:53.720 --> 25:58.040]  Just like we got the calls, oh, some child porn got found in your email, but don't worry,
[25:58.040 --> 26:03.640]  they're not going to say anything, but they do want to talk, oh, you want to talk like
[26:03.640 --> 26:08.400]  I'm scared of somebody sending me that crap and then you subpoena it and scan it and find
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.080]  it hidden in digital code and then, oh, but you let me know, you know about it, but just
[26:15.080 --> 26:16.400]  sit tight, Alex.
[26:16.400 --> 26:17.400]  Yeah, right.
[26:17.400 --> 26:20.560]  Well, you saw what happened, didn't you?
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.920]  Guns of blazing bitch.
[26:24.920 --> 26:31.600]  Fill your political hand.
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.440]  You think for against a fat man is a dog fall.
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.480]  You guys have been living around your own cowardice so long, I'm talking to the establishment
[26:42.480 --> 26:45.480]  that you don't know what real resistance is when it's looking at you straight in the
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.200]  eyes, but I'll tell listeners, this is we go to break and come back with a really important
[26:49.200 --> 26:57.080]  nose, but there has been a huge move to compromise everybody in this country and to intimidate
[26:57.080 --> 27:01.800]  everyone and this idea of just bow down to you, let pedophiles have access to your kids
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.760]  in the schools and libraries or we'll call you a name and don't say mother or father
[27:05.760 --> 27:11.480]  or we'll call you a name or don't do this or that or we'll come after you.
[27:11.480 --> 27:14.360]  Well, let's just get it on then.
[27:14.360 --> 27:20.560]  Let's get the party started and we have politically and I told Mueller over a year ago that he
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.240]  would be destroyed politically and I would expose him for protecting Epstein and the
[27:24.240 --> 27:25.240]  pedophiles.
[27:25.240 --> 27:30.960]  I told him over the new state, I told you Mueller, I'd meet you at high noon politically
[27:30.960 --> 27:36.200]  and that you and your controller trying to set me up as a Russian would go to hell before
[27:36.200 --> 27:44.480]  I ever bowed to your un-American globalist deep state souls and that's why we are supported
[27:44.480 --> 27:48.720]  by the listeners and that's why we continue to let them know that they are the only reason
[27:48.720 --> 27:49.960]  we're still on air.
[27:49.960 --> 27:56.000]  You are the info or viewers and listeners and we need you now more than ever but when
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.680]  I get in people's faces like Robert Mueller, I don't do that to act macho.
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.520]  I do it because everyone's afraid of people like him and somebody's got to call their
[28:04.520 --> 28:09.200]  bluff like Toto pulling back the curtain.
[28:09.200 --> 28:13.600]  Toto wasn't that big or strong, a little black dog but was willing to pull the curtain back
[28:13.600 --> 28:18.920]  and wasn't afraid and that's what leadership's all about and now when you saw the little
[28:18.920 --> 28:27.000]  man behind the curtain, he was frail and shaking and didn't know what to do and resembled Gargamel.
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.240]  His cat, Esmeralda's more scary, it's always the Minion, Sportators, the Master, Darth
[28:36.240 --> 28:43.320]  Vader, Emperor Palpatine, fiction playing off reality.
[28:43.320 --> 28:50.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, where are they now? All their intimidation, all their threats just
[28:50.200 --> 28:58.000]  have to be called and if I die in the process, show his life and point by Osh, but in the
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.880]  end.
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.880]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:04.880 --> 29:10.440]  may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes
[29:10.440 --> 29:14.960]  and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can
[29:14.960 --> 29:17.120]  alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.640]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:21.640 --> 29:22.640]  across America.
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.720]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.220]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:30.220 --> 29:31.220]  healthier I feel.
[29:31.220 --> 29:33.840]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[33:28.760 --> 33:37.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.560 --> 33:43.240]  All the chickens are coming home to roots.
[33:43.240 --> 33:51.920]  New York area fire commissioners make history call for new 9-11 investigation into what really
[33:51.920 --> 33:57.080]  happened because the official story, is it true and they all know there were bombs in
[33:57.080 --> 34:05.240]  all 3 buildings?
[34:05.240 --> 34:12.520]  Just like the old Jeffrey Epstein thing, Robert Muller and others in the Clintons using it
[34:12.520 --> 34:14.720]  to blackmail people with Obama.
[34:14.720 --> 34:21.640]  I'm going to tell all that in the third hour and notice what I told you 10 years ago, 6
[34:21.640 --> 34:24.080]  years ago and last year.
[34:24.080 --> 34:29.680]  I knew that I had to say something like, I'll meet Robert Muller at high noon politically,
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.160]  non-violently, the spaghetti western music playing in the background and when I pull
[34:34.160 --> 34:41.800]  my gun, if he pulls his, I'm politically going to defeat him because he supported framing
[34:41.800 --> 34:46.520]  people with having sex with children, setting them up.
[34:46.520 --> 34:54.040]  Many opted into it and I knew the media would only take the pedophile news that was true
[34:54.040 --> 35:03.680]  but now they were using pedophilia to blackmail scumbags if I added the high noon piece and
[35:03.680 --> 35:07.040]  made it very clear that I wasn't talking about physical violence against Robert Muller
[35:07.040 --> 35:14.160]  the third but they were so deceptive they still edited it and took the bait.
[35:14.160 --> 35:19.120]  And so it's just amazing how ridiculous the establishment is.
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.640]  Now that was back still a year ago when they hadn't figured out what I was doing.
[35:22.640 --> 35:27.920]  Now they just know to not quote anything I say and keep their mouth shut and never actually
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.040]  quote what I say, just make up completely separate total lies because there's always
[35:32.040 --> 35:38.880]  traps with whatever I've sent them and they're starting to figure that out like their stupid
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.200]  attempt with child porn.
[35:43.200 --> 35:46.760]  These damn devil worshipers are not that smart folks as people aren't willing to take them
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.760]  on because they're roaring so loud.
[35:52.760 --> 35:59.040]  Satan goes about like a lion roaring seeing who he made of our.
[35:59.040 --> 36:04.280]  You know I used to go see movies when I was a kid like Pride the 13th and Jason pulls
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.880]  a knife out, puts her knife, they just fall down and crawl and go, no, please don't got
[36:08.880 --> 36:09.880]  it.
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.200]  I always thought that's ridiculous, you'd run or you'd fight but in reality now that
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.760]  I see all these criminology books and watch all these films and all the surveillance footage
[36:18.760 --> 36:22.240]  stuff that comes out a lot of people act like that.
[36:22.240 --> 36:29.200]  They just go, and there's this learned helplessness that has been programmed into everyone and
[36:29.200 --> 36:35.960]  this broadcast is trying to get people out of that learned helplessness, out of the victimology
[36:35.960 --> 36:40.800]  of being a victim and people just cherish how they're a victim and how they can't do
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.040]  anything as they're a victim and they think it's like a shroud of invincibility or some
[36:46.040 --> 36:53.120]  royal coat that they wear and what it's called is spiritual, cultural and physical slavery.
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.840]  So there's lots of physical courage and lots of guys that go lift weights and work out
[36:56.840 --> 37:01.520]  in great shape and skydive and everything else but do they have any moral courage to
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.400]  go out and be politically involved and get attacked for things they know are right and
[37:06.400 --> 37:12.600]  to get blackballed or to get demonized and the answer is no, most of them don't because
[37:12.600 --> 37:15.520]  they're not leaders, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:15.520 --> 37:18.840]  The last thing I would want would be Robert Mueller to be hurt physically and I made that
[37:18.840 --> 37:28.280]  clear before and after but I said politically he pulls his gun, I'm going to pull mine
[37:28.280 --> 37:33.080]  and the truth will out and he will go down in history as a criminal and I will be vindicated
[37:33.080 --> 37:37.480]  because I'm sick of being called a Russian agent and spit on in the street.
[37:37.480 --> 37:43.000]  I'll play that video coming up later but I'm explaining to folks the thought processes
[37:43.000 --> 37:50.200]  that go on here so people understand why I do the things I do sometimes.
[37:50.200 --> 37:56.520]  It's because it needed to be on record to the president that Mueller was involved protecting
[37:56.520 --> 38:01.200]  Epstein, the president didn't know that, I've done deep research on this and I know that
[38:01.200 --> 38:05.080]  the president saw that, it was a big scandal, the Justice Department looked at having me
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.440]  indicted for something I didn't say, it's okay.
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.280]  That would have been even better, if they would have indicted me for threatening Mueller
[38:15.280 --> 38:21.200]  when I meant no such thing I could have then really exposed their pedophile operation.
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.160]  You see how it works now, don't you?
[38:24.160 --> 38:29.320]  Because when you don't care about yourself and you're willing to die to defeat the enemy
[38:29.320 --> 38:38.920]  then you're truly strong and no longer a coward like these men that only seek power over others
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.280]  instead of turning humanity loose, oh they might have physical courage to kill somebody
[38:44.280 --> 38:52.640]  but they're doing it for their own evil aim, selfishness and their selfishness has blinded
[38:52.640 --> 38:53.640]  them.
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.360]  Oh I said I'd get into the big top story.
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.240]  I'll do it next segment because there's not time in four and a half minutes and it's
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.760]  such a big deal that it's kind of like a shoe dropping, we're waiting for the other shoe
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.360]  to drop and I am not really pleased to even report this so you know I have a problem when
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.400]  something so horrible that I have trouble getting to the point.
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.640]  But the Chinese trips are massing and the Chinese government says they're looking to
[39:22.640 --> 39:28.440]  invade Hong Kong, which you had Hong Kong and Taiwan that were autonomous, Taiwan more
[39:28.440 --> 39:34.480]  so after 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek got set up by the leftist, the Ford Foundation, the
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.720]  Carnegie Endowment who had their operatives inside the CIA and they set Chiang Kai-shek
[39:39.720 --> 39:44.120]  rifles without firing pins when Congress ordered the weapons sent and it's just total betrayal
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.120]  of the Chinese people.
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.160]  Imagine if China had been free, oh my god it'd be so wonderful, so many good people
[39:49.160 --> 39:57.600]  but the very worst bloodthirsty chai comms were put in control and now they have had
[39:57.600 --> 40:04.720]  decades of having most favorite trade status by the Clintons and one-sided deals and they
[40:04.720 --> 40:11.000]  produced three billionaires a week and they've got more conventional weapons than we've got
[40:11.000 --> 40:18.000]  and they've got human clones, cows that produce human milk, robots, I mean they just, it's
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.200]  mad scientist cuckoo land, any U.S. corporation can go there and do whatever you want but
[40:23.200 --> 40:28.880]  guess what, they're all fleeing now because Trump's getting ready to roll them up, see
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.160]  in about a last month it became clear that Trump's getting the upper hand and is winning
[40:32.160 --> 40:37.680]  and taking back America and so now the rats are all leaving the sinking ships and they're
[40:37.680 --> 40:43.920]  leaving China and they're leaving the EU and they're all coming here because every day
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.640]  that passes it's clear that Trump's winning and the deep state traders that sold the country
[40:48.640 --> 40:58.360]  out are losing and so it is a very, very good position to be in ladies and gentlemen.
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.800]  The problem is when things start turning this good for us, that's when you better watch
[41:02.800 --> 41:07.680]  your back and better not count all your chickens until they're hatched because we've got plenty
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.200]  of problems and that's what leads us when we go to break, we'll come back.
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.520]  With crackdown coming, China gathers horses on Hong Kong border and there's two other
[41:16.520 --> 41:21.720]  big crises elsewhere in the world and another one in the South China Sea.
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.120]  We'll get to all of it coming up, I promise, when we start the next segment.
[41:25.120 --> 41:27.960]  Please don't forget that you know what's going on.
[41:27.960 --> 41:30.600]  A lot of you knew what was going on before you ever heard this show.
[41:30.600 --> 41:32.680]  What about your friends, your neighbors, your family?
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.720]  What about local people that you can listen to local station or listening to or TV station
[41:36.720 --> 41:37.720]  you're watching on?
[41:37.720 --> 41:39.760]  But I say it's paramount.
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.440]  It's paramount that you tell people about the broadcast, word of mouth, hey, you heard
[41:44.440 --> 41:45.440]  of Alex Jones?
[41:45.440 --> 41:46.440]  Yeah, I used to watch him.
[41:46.440 --> 41:50.720]  Well, you know, he's at infowars.com, forward slash show with podcast, audio, video.
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.400]  It's forbidden and hey, pass it forward.
[41:55.400 --> 42:00.840]  Tell folks, infowars.com, forward slash show, newswars.com, forward slash show.
[42:00.840 --> 42:02.400]  That's easier to share at Facebook and Twitter.
[42:02.400 --> 42:07.640]  They won't censor you as much at Facebook if you put out newswars.com, forward slash
[42:07.640 --> 42:08.640]  show.
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.640]  There's infowars and all their bots and all their minions and all their servants watch
[42:12.640 --> 42:14.040]  for and try to ban.
[42:14.040 --> 42:20.800]  But newswars.com, forward slash show is there for everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.200]  And that's how you hear all the other hosts and all the other people in this special 40
[42:25.200 --> 42:31.920]  hour live Clown World 2 Meet America's Real Enemies, 40 hour transmission that ends tomorrow
[42:31.920 --> 42:34.600]  night at 6 p.m.
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.360]  And I forgot to even add, this is a fundraiser to launch the next phase.
[42:38.360 --> 43:03.640]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[43:03.640 --> 43:08.400]  The other thing that's unique about infowars is it is the only network of this reach that
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.920]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[43:12.920 --> 43:16.920]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely independent of
[43:16.920 --> 43:17.920]  all that.
[43:17.920 --> 43:23.160]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[43:23.160 --> 43:27.000]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.320]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[43:31.320 --> 43:34.880]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.760]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[43:38.760 --> 43:42.760]  who have been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person is allowed
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.480]  to have or express or hear and the infowars audience has broken through that, that they
[43:47.480 --> 43:52.160]  are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom
[43:52.160 --> 43:56.600]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[43:56.600 --> 44:23.000]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[44:23.000 --> 44:49.880]  and
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.520]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we'll do a 50% off,
[44:54.520 --> 44:57.560]  and then you do something like that, where you have patriot points, we lose money,
[44:57.560 --> 44:58.920]  but that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.640]  It's happening now, right now. All over the world, humanity is fighting back
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.800]  against the transhumanist, globalist, world government, mark of the beast agenda.
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.120]  And the forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear,
[45:14.120 --> 45:20.840]  Info Wars more than ever. Well, we're doing a special 40-hour broadcast to get new projects
[45:20.840 --> 45:26.760]  we've developed up and into orbit, and to take action at the next level. The globalists know
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.000]  we've already devastated them, and they hope that you don't take action, because when you support
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.040]  Info Wars, you change the world. Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com, but whatever
[45:38.040 --> 45:43.880]  you do, join us during the special 40-hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word

[46:54.360 --> 47:05.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:05.880 --> 47:27.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic is Alex Jones.
[47:35.960 --> 47:55.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I've talked about it, but let's get right into it.
[47:55.960 --> 47:59.240]  Before we start the second hour and get into all the other news, your phone calls and cast
[47:59.240 --> 48:05.560]  Robert Barnes in studio. These stories are both on infowars.com. Excellent reports. Michael Snyder
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.640]  does a great job at the Economic Collapse Blog, laying it out. We were talking about this again
[48:09.640 --> 48:14.040]  last week and a few days ago, the specifics, but now it's mainstream news, Australia,
[48:14.840 --> 48:22.600]  top news, ABC news. This is happening. Crackdown coming. China gathers forces on Hong Kong border
[48:23.800 --> 48:30.440]  amid unrest. Massive anti-Beijing protests, which have gripped Hong Kong over the past month,
[48:30.440 --> 48:36.040]  have become increasingly violent as both an overwhelmed local police force, it's pro-Beijing,
[48:36.040 --> 48:41.000]  and counter protesters have hit back with force and are threatening to escalate on a larger
[48:41.000 --> 48:48.600]  geopolitical scale after the winehouse weighed in this week. Now again, not since Ronald Reagan
[48:48.600 --> 48:55.320]  that we had a president that didn't abandon Hong Kong and Taiwan. And so China is saying it's the
[48:55.320 --> 49:02.440]  hidden hand of the United States that is there supporting Hong Kong not going under Communist
[49:02.440 --> 49:10.440]  China's total control. Well, yes, it's emboldening the folks that live in Hong Kong and in Taiwan
[49:10.440 --> 49:14.840]  that finally the US is standing up for them. We should never have sold them out and given the
[49:14.840 --> 49:20.440]  keys to the whole planet and the rare earth minerals and industry to the chai comms. So yes,
[49:20.440 --> 49:26.200]  you better believe this is this is Trump but not ordering people to do this. They've been waiting.
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.880]  You know, like I said, the Chinese are ready for a fight any time folks and these are the real
[49:29.880 --> 49:34.520]  Chinese that are not the Communist and they are and they're the brain trust that was in China
[49:34.520 --> 49:41.240]  that ran to Hong Kong and ran to Taiwan and and they're again trying to pass a law there because
[49:41.240 --> 49:44.840]  you know they actually have representative government because the British put that in the
[49:44.840 --> 49:52.600]  Chinese want that gone to arrest and take people to the mainland to Beijing and the Peking and
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.560]  other areas. And so these protesters aren't going around hitting people in the head who are for
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.360]  free speech. They're not going around and you know, pissing on themselves like leftists. They're
[50:02.360 --> 50:05.880]  going into government buildings. They're taking over and when the cops attack them,
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.720]  they're beating the hell out of them. And when the cops fire guns at them, they take the guns
[50:09.720 --> 50:17.080]  away and beat them over the head. So this is called a real revolution. And this is going to end up
[50:17.080 --> 50:22.360]  being way bigger than Tiananmen Square. In fact, you heard it here first. I'm not going to even
[50:22.360 --> 50:27.640]  hedge bets. I think within the next week, you're going to see a Tiananmen Square level event
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.480]  only if the Chinese government backs down and their dictator given more power than Mao Zedong
[50:33.480 --> 50:43.800]  Xi has not been showing any signs of that. So this is going to get extremely violent, extremely
[50:43.800 --> 50:49.080]  quickly because I'm telling you, folks, studying warfare and the Asian brain and everybody can
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.640]  turn it loose and kill people. But once the Asians start getting into a fight, it gets real
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.600]  bloody real quick and both sides don't give up. So this is going to get really, really, really
[50:58.600 --> 51:07.240]  nasty fast crackdown coming. China gathers forces on Hong Kong border amid unrest with China fast
[51:07.240 --> 51:13.880]  losing patience. There are new reports of significant buildup of Chinese security forces on Hong
[51:13.880 --> 51:19.480]  Kong's border as Bloomberg reports. And again, don't think that the folks in Hong Kong don't
[51:19.480 --> 51:24.200]  have weapons. Either they haven't pulled out yet. This is going to get serious. This is going to be
[51:24.200 --> 51:28.840]  like Tiananmen Square where nobody's got weapons. And by the way, you can take all the weapons you
[51:28.840 --> 51:33.160]  want all day with just a knife or a hammer. You know, if you're not anti for swinging the hammer,
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.560]  you can actually get something done. I mean, I could kill 10 people in about two minutes with
[51:37.560 --> 51:42.040]  a hammer in a fight. Thank God, if it didn't know how to use one, he's usually hitting people with
[51:42.040 --> 51:48.200]  those hammers. It says from nearly the start of the protest, which began over a proposed
[51:48.200 --> 51:55.400]  extradition bill, which would see Hong Kong citizens under legal accusation potentially
[51:55.400 --> 52:02.120]  extradited to the mainland, interpreted as major Chinese overreach inside historically
[52:02.120 --> 52:08.280]  semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Officials in Beijing have suggested an external plot afoot by the
[52:08.280 --> 52:13.480]  United States. But here's the thing. They never came in and took over all of Hong Kong because
[52:13.480 --> 52:21.000]  the Hong Kong population was going to fight. Now, gosh, hard to believe that's almost 70 years ago,
[52:21.000 --> 52:29.640]  1949. Unbelievable. And it's the same reason. Thomas Jefferson was asked, what level level
[52:29.640 --> 52:37.160]  of tyranny will the tyrants push? And he said, the level you will put up with. Well, here's the
[52:37.160 --> 52:45.720]  difference. Hong Kong's military is not going to resist China. Taiwan's is. And they've got
[52:47.000 --> 52:55.480]  high tech service to air missiles. They've got ship to ship, ground to ship, air to ship.
[52:56.040 --> 53:03.160]  And the Chinese is also the military is massing, obviously, a military to invade Taiwan. And
[53:03.160 --> 53:07.800]  they've said just a week ago, they may invade Taiwan. And believe me, folks, if the Chinese
[53:07.800 --> 53:11.880]  start saying we're looking to invade, they're not just saying that they're building all those islands
[53:11.880 --> 53:16.040]  over the South China Sea. They're saying territorial waters of Japan, territorial waters,
[53:16.040 --> 53:23.880]  way south of Vietnam and of the Philippines are theirs. This is just like the Japanese pulled
[53:24.760 --> 53:30.840]  in 1941. They're about to pull the same thing, but they've got nuclear weapons this time. And
[53:30.840 --> 53:36.840]  it's the chai comms. So that's why the left's flipping out. That's why Netflix is trying to
[53:36.840 --> 53:41.720]  cause a race war. It's why Hollywood's a lot of control because the chai comms own Hollywood.
[53:43.000 --> 53:51.080]  And they are flooding billions of dollars a week into unrest. So you wonder why you're seeing all
[53:51.080 --> 53:57.320]  this stuff go on because the chai comms are exerting force on America. They've rolled up over 50
[53:57.320 --> 54:04.040]  Confucian institutes run by the Chinese intelligence network inside the US, including one at the
[54:04.040 --> 54:11.800]  University of Texas. And again, we were watching the group. And the only reason the state police
[54:11.800 --> 54:16.680]  and others via the feds came here and said, Hey, you can go watch them if you want, but we're there.
[54:16.680 --> 54:22.280]  But please don't alert them because we're there watching them. Please don't step on our toes.
[54:22.280 --> 54:27.160]  I said, fine, you just handle it then. I'm glad you're what and boom, year later, they shut that
[54:27.160 --> 54:33.800]  whole thing down at UT chai comms were pumping 50 million a quarter into UT,
[54:35.320 --> 54:41.880]  the Chinese intelligence. And that's down the street from me, man. UT has nuclear reactors.
[54:42.360 --> 54:50.360]  It has everything weapons and drug labs. I mean, it's the DARPA and the we let the chai comms into
[54:50.360 --> 54:56.920]  DARPA underground bases under Austin used to be the sat command headquarters was here at Bergstrom.
[54:56.920 --> 55:05.320]  They've got railways out to Fort Hood. We've let the chai comms into everything and Trump is removing them.
[55:05.320 --> 55:22.360]  And they're pissed. And so they're now saying that they are going to invade these countries as a way
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.800]  to checkmate Trump. Good luck. But the point is, this could turn into a regional war very easily,
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.080]  probably will. And it could turn into a catastrophe of biblical proportions. By the way, I see you
[55:33.080 --> 55:41.080]  guys are pulling up other Confucius Institutes. Just type in UT cancels Confucius Institutes
[55:41.080 --> 55:47.160]  because of Chinese intelligence. That was last year and over 50 have been shut down across the
[55:47.160 --> 55:51.080]  United States because Chinese intelligence was caught because, you know, the crew just searches
[55:51.080 --> 55:54.440]  whatever I talk about. And sometimes they get it right. Sometimes they get it wrong. Because,
[55:54.440 --> 55:58.600]  I mean, how could they always get it right? They were pulling up other Confucius Institutes. But
[55:58.600 --> 56:04.920]  it's well known this is going on. And so this is a big deal. And when we come back, I'll get into
[56:04.920 --> 56:13.640]  the other two areas that could start giant wars in the Middle East and in Africa and another area
[56:13.640 --> 56:20.680]  that's happening there in Asia as well. But this is a big, big deal. Separately, let me do a proper
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.720]  plug. We're in the middle of a fundraiser. If we sell a million dollars a product, then we'll only
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.520]  make like $150,000. We sell a million. We'll probably make about $300,000. I got up at 5.30 this
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.640]  morning and I went and looked at infowars.com.com.com where you can make donations and where you can
[56:35.640 --> 56:40.120]  also purchase products at huge discounts. And then all those numbers are added together by some
[56:40.120 --> 56:46.440]  computer program they put together every 30 minutes at updates. And I get up and like at 6 a.m. I'm
[56:46.440 --> 56:53.000]  text messaging Michael Zimmerman and I'm saying $700,000. I said, when I went to bed, it was like
[56:53.000 --> 56:59.480]  $300,000. And he said, let me check. Well, an hour later they go, oh, when they batched the orders
[56:59.480 --> 57:05.160]  that came in on the shopping cart, it triple-batched that batch. So yeah, that removed $200,000 from
[57:05.160 --> 57:12.040]  it. So it's at $389,000. And again, it's just a system that adds the donations that get entered in
[57:12.040 --> 57:16.280]  and the shopping cart stuff and updates every 30 minutes, I'm told. So it's not exact, but it's
[57:16.280 --> 57:22.840]  around $389,000. And that's triple what we normally bring in in the last few days.
[57:22.840 --> 57:27.640]  And so that's good. But when we're selling this stuff, some of it is very close to no profit,
[57:29.080 --> 57:33.960]  the supplements, all of it. So it takes a lot of sales to do it. And I'm just going to keep pushing.
[57:33.960 --> 57:38.680]  And I hope by tomorrow we bring a million dollars gross sales added donations. And we're getting a
[57:38.680 --> 57:42.200]  lot of gross sales, not a lot of donations, but it's easy to do that as well. Donations are better
[57:42.200 --> 57:46.360]  because we get 95% of the money. And that's really needed for the next project. So check it out
[57:46.360 --> 57:53.320]  infoworksstore.com. Thank you. George R. Wells said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.560]  truth is a revolutionary act. And so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag,
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.360]  because we still loved our country. And there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[58:02.360 --> 58:07.560]  But now they're trying to take it out of schools. They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[58:07.560 --> 58:11.480]  Weird white leftist that won a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running
[58:11.480 --> 58:16.920]  up Mexican flags. This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing. So now it is a
[58:16.920 --> 58:21.880]  revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American
[58:21.880 --> 58:27.240]  flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti slavery flag. And particularly when it says on the back,
[58:27.960 --> 58:33.080]  right there, ladies and gentlemen, America's back in pull wars.com. So whatever you do,
[58:33.080 --> 58:38.440]  take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all over not just the U.S.
[58:38.440 --> 58:42.760]  but worldwide because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[59:08.440 --> 59:14.520]  Special guests, telomeres and telomere support with your DNA. So I started to look into the
[59:14.520 --> 59:21.240]  science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[59:21.240 --> 59:26.920]  your telomeres. So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because it is an
[59:26.920 --> 59:31.880]  elite supplement. And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[59:31.880 --> 59:38.600]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went. But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[59:38.600 --> 59:43.480]  It is the elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's
[59:43.480 --> 01:00:03.240]  expensive. So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at infowarstore.com.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:10.840]  Devastating globalist lies, exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine,
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:18.040]  tirelessly waging war on corruption, from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas,
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:45.800]  transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.320]  We've got it. America's got it. We've got it.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:02.520]  America's got it and the whole world wants it. But we've got evil, but we've also got good. We've
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.520]  got the heights, we've got the lows, we've got the renaissance, the real awakening, the real
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:13.400]  enlightenment that the Illuminati of Adavisop tried to hijack with communism, with Jacobinism,
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:20.280]  with the left hand path. No, we don't want the left hand to rise above here. It will never rise
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:30.600]  above. Left hand rise above. Not going to happen. You can try to cheat your way to heaven, but all
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.040]  you'll do is go straight to hell. So we just witnessed three major developments that could
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.480]  easily lead to global war. And I agree with this analysis. And it just goes through the
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.800]  situation with Israel's already in a shooting war with Iran and Syria and in other areas.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.560]  You've got the Hong Kong situation. You've got the Taiwan situation.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.400]  And so much more that's unfolding. And then meanwhile, ISIS warns of terror strikes in San
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:04.600]  Francisco, New York, and London. Now Saudi Arabia had been financing that as part of the
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:11.080]  Arab Spring under Obama's authorization. Trump said that's over or we're going to overthrow you.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.560]  The Saudis said, hey, we were told to do this set up by the British, you know, 100 years ago,
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.760]  we've been doing this the whole time. Yes, sir, boss, when you say jump, we say how high? Well,
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.000]  that's good because I don't want to blow up Saudi Arabia. I don't want to be at war with the Muslims.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.080]  Yeah, radical Islam is real. It's out of control, but globalists are there financing it,
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.600]  funding it. You know, I've had prominent Muslims on air off very tell me,
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.800]  you know, why don't you leave us alone? You know, most of us don't want this, you know,
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:43.080]  the CIA and others are in there fomenting this. I'm like, yeah, I get it. But it doesn't matter.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.680]  Even if something's a wind up toy, it's still attacking me. So I've got to deal with the
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:54.200]  globalist threat. And I got to deal with the stuff that's releasing and pushing and turning
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.560]  lotion. I can't as a culture have the left sit there and tell me that I can't criticize radical
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.240]  Islam and then let it run my life. Then we have all the videos I didn't get to this week of gay
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.920]  pride parades with the Muslims showing up in England, the US screaming at them, saying you're
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.920]  an abomination, go to hell. You need to bet you what you're doing is horrible. Shame on you.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.040]  And I'm sitting there watching the gay pride parades that have turned into pedophile parades
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.440]  with a bunch of half-naked little kids. And I'm like, unless there are two evils as the Muslims,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.440]  you know, at least they're not wanting to parade kids around to have sex with them.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.360]  And do you think the average person that's gay is into that? Oh, but through this culture of
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:43.080]  leftist acceptance, pedophilia is now being accepted. And it is disgusting. I mean, I don't
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.840]  even want to say the things I've seen on video that is mainline news, but I won't even show on the show
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.320]  because I know some children could be watching. But parents can't hide this from their children.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.800]  There's so much evil out there now that you just got to tell them. Sheltering them is not the way
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.720]  to go. You need to explain what it is and how it works. By the way, I haven't even gotten to that
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.600]  yet. That's coming up. In Australia, they're putting out public service announcements saying,
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.960]  don't let grandma kiss you on the cheek. That's pedophilia. But pedophilia is okay.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:21.720]  See how that works? Family is bad. Your mom kissing you. I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.360]  My grandmothers all kissed me on the lips. And it's because they wanted to eat me up. They loved
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:36.440]  me so much. Again, they take normal, healthy, good things. Until I was about 10 years old,
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.960]  my mother kissed me on the lips. After that, she stopped doing it. But that was pure affection.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.840]  It's incredible. But they turn what's wholesome and good into sickness. But then tell you,
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:50.360]  pedophilia is good with a big potbellied fat man with your kid riding horsey at the
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:56.520]  public school event or the library event. Total evil. You're trying to extinct the family. Stay
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:02.280]  with us. David Knight here. You can join me every Monday through Friday at 9 a.m. Eastern,
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:08.440]  8 a.m. Central Time for The David Knight Show. We have the first independent news as it breaks
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.000]  every morning, but we'll not only give you the news, we'll give you the background, the context
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.920]  behind that news from a perspective that values our God-given liberties. We're going to take a
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.960]  look at those who want to do a detour around our Constitution, those who want to deconstruct our
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.160]  culture and destroy our civilization. So make sure you join us every Monday through Friday again,
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.160]  9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central Time. You can find the program on infowars.com forward slash
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:41.800]  david-night-show. You can also find us on YouTube at Liberty Terrient and on Twitter live broadcast
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:47.080]  both of those places again, 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central Time. Again, don't forget to tune
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:06:03.000]  in to The David Knight Show on infowars.com forward slash david-night-show.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:24.200]  Well, so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. It's the eyes, Chico.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.880]  The eyes. They never lie.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:36.760]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going from memory
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:43.000]  here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the earth.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.080]  Beware the Elons and the Elon invasion. Dr. Werner von Braun, wonder what he knew.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:54.280]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.760]  like they're on hardcore drugs. I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.920]  I mean, they look nuts. You know, when somebody's on drugs, you know, they admit Silicon Valley is
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:12.520]  into hardcore speed and illusions. They're taking IV drips at work of DMT. They're taking LSD microdoses
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:18.920]  and a civil society mushrooms and peyote every day. Who in the hell would want to join with these
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.200]  people? I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big. What the hell
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.120]  are they on? And one of the crew members said, maybe they've already got this whole neuro link
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.200]  wires hooks in their brain because this PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s,
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.920]  the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want. Just plug in,
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.560]  but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days. You just die because you just plug all
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.680]  this in and it's the matrix. And now the matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook or Elon Musk or
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.600]  any of his executives, when they're up there on that stage, they'll be under white lights. Their
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:54.840]  pupils are 90% open. Zuckerberg, all of them. These people either have brain chips. That's it.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:02.040]  These guys are wire heads. Something's going on. I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.080]  are very little and zoom into the camera. My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs. I've had two
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.520]  cups of coffee today. Let me show you my pupils. My pupils are little. They're supposed to close.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.680]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys. These are drug addicts
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.240]  and they want the hit of wires in their brains and all of them have got those giant pupils
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.600]  because they've been there and they ain't coming back.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:42.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.480]  front lines of the Info War. All right, a guy that's become a good friend of mine,
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.120]  really smart, funny fella and one of our top hosts here now, co-host,
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.280]  another chief legal strategist, Robert Barnes, joins us.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.880]  By the way, he didn't get his Covington kid lawsuit thrown out this week. That was the
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.400]  other fellow that filed lawsuits. I've gotten a bunch of calls about that. You haven't filed your
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.560]  suits yet because you've been strategically planning them. We're both a couple months behind
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.560]  right now, but those suits are very, very close. Our suits are very, very close. We'll give our
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.560]  friends and our enemies an update in the last segment of this hour, so remind me to do that
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.760]  coming up. But it's an important footnote, but the first thing I want to hit with you is something
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.600]  that I normally don't want to talk about, but now it's come to a head. So we should.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.320]  The Robert Mueller hearings last week, it all coming to a head. Trump's saying there's going
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.640]  to be criminal investigations and there are criminal investigations of the leakers and the
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:45.080]  illegal spying and the perjury to Congress. And Trump coming out and saying it's the end of a
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:50.760]  witch hunt after judge appointed by Clinton, dismisses DNC lawsuit out of New York, the Southern
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:57.080]  District of New York, completely dismissed as if saying that it was entirely divorced from the
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.680]  facts, yet another total and complete fraud, but entirely divorced. Then I've got a whole stack
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:08.280]  of articles. I never really mentioned last week, the Washington Post, all of them coming out and
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:13.880]  saying, okay, we apologize. It's not bad that we investigated, but we were wrong. You're innocent.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.840]  So they're trying to have their cake. I need it too. But what does the Mueller report mean
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:26.120]  for Trump 2020? And it just goes on to say, okay, he didn't do it. We were wrong. New York Times
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.760]  owes Americans a big fat apology. That's the New York Post. Apologies to President Trump, the hill.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.640]  But like a dog going back to its vomit, I don't think they can help it. The Democratic leadership
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:42.440]  still doubling, tripling, quadrupling down. The media had every right to pursue Russia,
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:50.040]  Trump, but Washington Post, again, goes on to say that they're wrong. This can be a pretty big deal.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.840]  What do you make of this, Robert Barnes? So the case in New York, this was a liberal jurisdiction.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.320]  The case was before a liberal judge in the Southern District of New York, who said there's
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.560]  something called the Twombly Standard, T-U-U-W-O-M-B-L-Y, United States v. Twombly. And what the
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:10.520]  Twombly Standard stands for, and there's another one called Eekball, in two cases that say that
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.600]  just because you allege facts in a complaint does not mean a court has to take them seriously.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.760]  So the court has to look at plausible facts. So what was significant was here you have a
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.960]  liberal judge in a liberal jurisdiction saying that there are, quote, no plausible facts that
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:29.880]  supported any allegation of collusion against the President and his allies, of conspiracy against
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.760]  the President and his allies, or of any crime against the President and his allies. He said
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.080]  their complaint was so weak that nobody could look at the facts. He said divorce from reality.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.680]  Divorce from reality and his exact quote was no plausible facts, period. And that's a liberal
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.640]  judge in a liberal jurisdiction declaring that. So at this point it is beyond doubt,
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.480]  beyond question. I mean, last night they didn't even ask a single question about Mueller,
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.480]  because it's so dead, because it's so mute, because it's so irrelevant, because it's so
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.960]  implausible, that when you have liberal judges and liberal jurisdictions saying this case is crap,
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.680]  that this argument is crap, that there was no collusion, no crime, no conspiracy, at this point
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.000]  that it's, that's where you're starting to see apologies. Yet the Democrats in Congress and in
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.400]  the House in particular continue to double down in increasing number, calling for impeachment
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.560]  and increasing. They're now saying members of Congress are Russian agents. Yeah, exactly. They're
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.560]  accusing Senator McConnell, who's maybe been a corporate agent for a long time, but not really
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.320]  been a Russian government agent by any. Oh, he's a total globalist agent of any. Right, by any
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.360]  imagination he's a toad, but the, but he's by no definition, or by any one's imagination, Putin's
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:40.040]  toad. So the, at this point it's so, the question is, to what degree do they continue to live in
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.040]  a denial land? And it was a fascinating day. You have a day in which there are headlines about
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.800]  New York fire commissioners calling for 9 11 investigations, because there was clear use of
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.960]  explosives by what happened to the health condition of the fire workers that they've now been able to
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.520]  look at over a 15 year time. So what's happening is, there's a complete loss of confidence in the
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:02.280]  system now. Exactly. And even GQ magazine came out with a big article, let me bring my name into
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.840]  it and said, well, there has been so much lying. That's why this is the age of Alex Jones. No,
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.080]  it's the age of you being caught being liars. And now everyone that was afraid to speak out about
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.280]  what they saw, they told the police get back, they had a countdown FEMA had a countdown on
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.440]  building seven. Oh, exactly. I mean, it's even was on local news. Well, and I talked to the cops
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.240]  that were there and heard the countdown. And then the media went, Jones says cops blew it up. No,
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.800]  I interviewed the cops that heard the damn countdown. And it's probably not a coincidence
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.760]  this is all happening while President Trump is President Trump. So you're looking at I mean,
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:40.280]  President Trump was one was who said live at the time, when the when the when the when the buildings
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.200]  came down, that this was evidence of a controlled demolition. And this was someone in the building
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.960]  trades who knew about it. And on top of that, I mean, like Japan, for example, announced that
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.080]  they're going to start doing animal human hybrid experimentation, because they were limited, they
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.160]  are no longer limiting themselves legally and their doctors from doing so. So that's because
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:01.480]  China's been doing it forever. And so they're racing ahead. Oh, exactly. Well, you see, like,
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.120]  for example, there's a major publication that has started to become more substantial, called the
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:11.000]  epic times. And the reason is because they represent a sort of a religious tradition that has been
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.440]  targeted for donor experimentation in China. That's a long gone. Exactly. And the whole epic
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.680]  times and everything about it. So the newspapers call the epic times. But they're big fans of mine.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.280]  And I'm not saying I mean, for years, I go to the Chinese food restaurant owned by those folks,
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.720]  they're always trying to give me free food, just love it. Oh, I mean, they would they created
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.160]  what's fascinating is they created a spiritual movement, a real spiritual movement, unlike
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.480]  sort of meditation with Mary Ann, a real spiritual movement that was so strong, the government was
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:39.800]  so scared of it in China, that it felt the need to suppress totally decentralized. It's all about
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:46.920]  life and action. It's a pro human pro individual movement that used its spiritual connection
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.800]  of allowing people to connect to nature in an organic and authentic way that challenged systemic
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.080]  and institutional power that would have misused and abused human because they want us out of
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.640]  nature. That's the satanic system out of nature inside of a bubble. Exactly. They're the sort
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.040]  of digital reality that the Democrats are living in the debate says that they think going harder
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.360]  to the left is the appropriate path, which is what both Warren and Bernie Sanders were doing
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.520]  last night. They're I mean, they're trying to shorten the climate change. It was 12 years,
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.680]  we're going to all die now. It's 10 years. I mean, but by the time it's coming up to exactly by
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.280]  the time of the election, it's going to be two years. It's going to be the planet will blow
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.880]  up like Krypton if you don't elect Joe Biden. Exactly. The on the inauguration day, the whole
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:29.400]  country and the whole world will be over unless a Democrats in the White House. That will be the
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.320]  pitch because every other conspiracy theory that they've pushed has been wrong and every other
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:40.680]  conspiracy theory that they said was wrong has turned out right. Wow, powerful. I've got a lot
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.440]  to cover. I don't know which one of these top stories. They're also insane. Which one is the
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.200]  top story? We're going to come up with something big on the other side. I've got so much in my

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.520]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.440]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political,
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.440]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades. And because of that, that's why the
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.280]  courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.880]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.960]  social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.440]  change and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:30.760]  who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.640]  recover after the Great Depression. The info war's audience is the fuel that flames the light of
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.760]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.640]  original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.560]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.320]  and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:57.480]  gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what what you just saw.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:09.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:28.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting in the middle of wide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.160]  Boy, if there was a fly on the wall, ladies and gentlemen, what Robert Barnes and I was talking
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:38.680]  about, big news this Thursday will be announced. We'll see it all over the national news,
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:43.640]  we'll just stop there with Robert Barnes and wheels within wheels. We are definitely fighting,
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.880]  taking action and it's amazing. But I was asking you during the break, I said listen,
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.640]  we've got all this news here and then the next few seconds we'll play some of the highlights of
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:56.920]  the insane debate last night and the ratings crashing. I mean, I'll be honest, I went home
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.480]  and watched the show. I was just sitting here all night. I couldn't look at them and watch them.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.680]  I can listen, but I can't look at Democrats. So I went home and got on the computer and listened
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:12.120]  to our covers. It was great. I literally couldn't sit here looking at them and calling the shots
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:16.600]  and go to this, go to that. I had to get out of here. I mean, I literally got depressed watching
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.080]  it. And I'll be honest, I feel good watching Trump. I feel good watching, you know, the other
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.640]  shows we do. I feel good watching Tucker Carlson. I feel good looking at dredgerport.com because,
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:30.040]  you know, these are good people. I cannot stand watching or listening to people. But I said,
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:36.840]  what do you want to hit first? You said, man, this whole thing where Mario Lopez, I've always liked,
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.480]  you know, even when you're at the hotel and he introduces the movies you can watch,
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.360]  Mario Lopez is being attacked for saying three year old children should be encouraged to be
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:50.600]  transgender. No, I mean, that's literally child beyond sexual abuse, its identity abuse. And that
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.680]  ties into Jeffrey Epstein and the sexualization of children and this whole movement. And so you
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.400]  wanted to speak to that. Absolutely. So I mean, like to to Dershowitz's credit, Professor Dershowitz
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.800]  put out an article where I disagree with his article, but he pointed out there's an inconsistency
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.560]  between saying that children are children and cannot consent in certain areas and then saying
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.400]  that they absolutely can't another year. So for example, if you're going to treat children as adults
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.920]  for criminal purposes under juvenile laws, or you're going to treat children as adults for the
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.440]  purposes of getting an abortion without parental consent, or you're going to treat children as
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:26.040]  adults for picking their gender and being able to do forced various forms of biological experimentation
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:30.680]  and surgery against parental consent as happened in Canada, if you're going to talk about three
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:36.520]  year olds picking what gender they are, like Charlie Theron who talked about raising the
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.680]  state, the state confuses the children and then says, Oh, we represent your child now,
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.560]  it's a form of child kidnapping. Absolutely. And it's a severe form of mind control in the
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.280]  sense that we recognize and the Tabistock Institute who heads up global mind control admits they
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.040]  created this. Oh, exactly. And the reason why you don't want kids voting and the reason why you
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.960]  don't want kids drafted for the war and you don't want kids treated as an adult for juvenile crime
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.960]  purposes and that we have statutory rape crime principles is because we recognize that until
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.440]  they reach a certain age, they do not have the moral cognizance or emotional maturity to make
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.240]  those complex decisions. They didn't do it with with like capital murder is done with intent with
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.320]  a conspiracy. They don't have what it takes to actually make the conscious decision. They can
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:21.480]  be manipulated. Exactly. And so when you see these trying to have three year olds pick their gender,
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.320]  which is, you know, kids dress up as all kinds of things. They have no idea what that even means.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.320]  And it's easy to trick them into a new role and then say now that's your role. Exactly.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.760]  They're trying to tell the kid you're a superhero. Exactly. They're sexualizing them and create
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.080]  making identity a social construct rather than a biological reality when we all know it's a
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.360]  biological reality. There's nobody in the biological sciences that's propagating some of this absurd
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:48.200]  nonsense. So it reflects a deep severe disconnect between biological reality and social reality,
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.760]  a disconnect between our laws recognizing that children are not of the moral cognizance or
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.880]  intellectual capability to make these kind of decisions. And let's be clear. People biologically
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.640]  go through the clock. So before they hit puberty, they're basically asexual. Absolutely. And so
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.920]  it's a trick before they go through what they really are. I mean, when I hit puberty at 12,
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:13.960]  I became a killer. And I was after because I wasn't stunted. I was after women. I was in fights.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.960]  People wanted to fight. It was on before I was a little sweetie pie. As soon as the testosterone
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:22.760]  kicked on, look out Godzilla's here. Well, they know that. But if they could have tricked me earlier
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.680]  on, I'd have been happy to sit there and what I'm addressing, you know, and sit there and cook
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.040]  pancakes or whatever. So again, they are stunting and coming in early to steal the future potential.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.920]  Just several years ago, we would have universally recognized this as child abuse. What's what's
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.400]  going on. And those trying to hardcore child abuse. Absolutely. It is because it's confusing
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:45.400]  children. By the way, you shouldn't be praised as having courage to say this. But this guy says
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.400]  you shouldn't sexualize three year olds and they're caught and they're trying to kick his job away.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.560]  Exactly. They're attacking him. There was public calls and social media today for him to lose his
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.800]  shows for him to lose his audience for him to lose any contracts that he has solely for saying what
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:02.200]  is morally and intellectually obviously true. But here's the thing. He won't lose his soul though.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.400]  Right. Well, exactly. That's what he cares more about. And then that's more consequential.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.360]  But amazing that we live in an era where it's controversial to say you should not sexualize
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.520]  three year old children and you should not have three year old children trying to make decisions
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.600]  that the law recognizes they are not morally, intellectually or emotionally capable of making
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.480]  and to try to ask them to do so does so in a way that violates their core sense of identity
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.120]  and their capabilities. So it's it's it's illegally offensive. It's morally in offense offensive.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.680]  It's intellectually offensive. It's just an outrage from top to bottom. But it's just a full
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.680]  assault with Caitlyn Jenner. All of it. It's a full corporate rollout. So the question is why?
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.000]  Well, what you get is you end up getting the I'll give Dershowitz credit while I disagree with his
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.560]  conclusion. What he's right about is that the law why do you go to jail for a 16 year old girl?
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.160]  But it's okay to have little kids sitting on the laps of trannies riding horsey telling them
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.640]  they're a whole other sex. Exactly. Whether you intended to or not, Dershowitz drew what the logical
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.680]  conclusion of this ideology is what's what it's designed to do. Exactly. It's a green light
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.240]  Epstein's relationships to green light pedophilia to green light child abuse, which is the final
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:10.360]  revolution. Absolutely. And it's the it's the most anti human act that it looks at stealing the
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.960]  innocence of children. Absolutely. And it reduces their humanity and their individuality. They're
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.200]  just cattle. They're there for a purpose. Because again, you grow up your adults, your power to
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.040]  regenerate into the future is the prime drive. Men and women choose to come together in the
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.240]  greatest democracy the planet's ever seen to create new beings. They're jacking in and stealing
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.720]  that whole potentiality stealing that from them. Right. I mean, that's incredible. And there's a
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:38.280]  great degree of population replacement that's taking place here. So as we have fewer children,
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.960]  as abortion is increasingly incentivized, as as as we basically have American populations in the
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:49.720]  West, not reproducing at a rate that can replace our own population, that we become more and more
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.960]  dependent on foreign populations that they believe are more malleable, which is in the 1964
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.920]  Foundation documents, they said we will promote transhumanism, sexless society. That's a brave
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.920]  new world. 1932 is written about this has been a long term plan. Barnes, I love it when you get
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:07.320]  on every subject. You always cover law or this or that. You're a smart guy. We need to get to
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.720]  your own show. Oh, sure. That'd be fun. We need to do it. Absolutely. Let me get some of these
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.400]  headlines here just to show you how committed Procter and Gamble has lost $5 billion. Since
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.080]  six months ago, they ran that ad saying being men are bad. All men are rapist shaving is, you know,
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.400]  you're part of rape or something was totally bizarre. Procter and Gamble loses $5 billion
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:39.160]  following woke Gillette ad campaign. ACLU blames inaccurate stereotypes for opposition to male
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:44.680]  athletes in girl sports now ruining girl sports and taking over. No, you have double the size bones,
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.720]  way bigger muscles, more blood volume. I mean, this is insane. The ACLU says, Oh, it's a stereotype.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:53.240]  And again, Mario Lopez is being attacked for saying three year old children should be encouraged
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.600]  to be transgender. That is total robbing their future beyond pedophilia. But don't worry. This
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.080]  is also in Europe and the US, but in Australia, no more kisses from granny Aussie program from the
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.760]  government tells kids granny hugging you or kissing you is pedophilia. So your own granny
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:14.120]  touching you is bad. But going and sitting on a man in a clown suit and riding horsey while he
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:20.360]  grinds you in pedophilic delight. That's liberal and loving. Exactly. And that's what's happening.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.080]  And we're doing that in public school libraries, this sort of sanctified place for learning. The
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:30.600]  library is now a pedo breeding ground. Look at this, Australia sculpture of man's chest
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:36.120]  banned from art exhibit because Muslims don't like it. Exactly. I mean, the men's chest are bad.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:43.800]  Greek statues are bad. But pedophilia is okay. That's the new normal in the abnormal of the
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.720]  left today. And it shows a degree in the severity and the insanity of it. I mean,
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.440]  it's just what what just three years ago would be good. Well, when Obama's policies and platform
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.040]  is considered far right in the modern Democratic Party, they're pushing the envelope. Exactly.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.560]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.920]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.640]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't

[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.560]  is the number one silent killer in the US. What if I told you for just 54 95 a month,

[01:29:52.680 --> 01:30:00.440]  hbextract.com. Don't risk it when you can take charge of it. George Arwell said that in a time of
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.640]  universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that important to
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.120]  wear the American flag because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:15.080]  that actually hated it. But now they're trying to take it out of schools. They're taking it down
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.720]  off of government buildings. Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.920]  flags and running up Mexican flags. This is the bizarreness in America hating we're seeing.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.560]  So now it is a revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:35.560]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:41.480]  says on the back right there ladies and gentlemen America's back in full wars.com. So whatever you
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:47.400]  do take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all over not just the U.S.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.720]  but worldwide because more than ever the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:04.920]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history the globalists
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:11.080]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being broken
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:18.440]  and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes will likely
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:25.720]  be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The system is vulnerable.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:32.040]  Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days.

[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.960]  and we're very judicious about the money we spend we know what we're doing and we're promoting freedom
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:41.480]  so our one dollar to the enemy's million dollars is equivalent well they spend billions against us
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.440]  alone tens of billions against trump and they're failing but again we need to get that payload

[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.720]  really affecting change worldwide robert barnes the next two segments we're going to get into
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:36.040]  obviously the debates your overall view of the debates last night so i mean i thought i mean
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.440]  i going in a sort of my analysis for people who follow me on the sort of political betting markets
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.680]  is uh was that bernie was the one that was most likely to get a boost from a betting market
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:49.240]  perspective and he did his people who bet on bernie got a 35 percent rate of return profit
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:54.440]  overnight um so the i think from a betting perspective and i think from a sort of prognostication
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.120]  perspective and as we were talking about last night it's amazing how you have all these analysts
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.520]  who are so terrible at prognostication if you can't predict or forecast what's going to happen
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.840]  you really are out of touch with the world and really shouldn't be analyzing anything so the uh
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.760]  and many of them were sort of misplaced and as we also forecast maryon williamson would
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.160]  be the most searched candidate uh because she's the weirdest by far uh and she says the most
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.880]  interesting eclectic things uh even when it's completely nuts with by the way that's our biggest
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:27.560]  failing is that you and owen the last two times exactly forecast to a level i couldn't even do
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.760]  it and then we would have crew to go back where you said that where you did it right but you guys
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.320]  did it all before the debate and and you're all on record oh absolutely and also put it up on
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:41.240]  twitter so that uh so that people could see in live time in a real time here's the prediction
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:44.840]  now of course you can't find me on twitter because twitter has me if you look up barn's law i don't
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:48.760]  exist for shadow man but yeah but let's pull up your actual twitter because i mean you like in
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  fact you went on made the prediction a month ago too yes correct that maryon williamson will be the
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:57.720]  most searched for four person uh and then it was that tulsi gabard would get the biggest boost in the
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.080]  betting market so that's what happens in the polls and you want you're right in both in both cases
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.080]  that's what's and you guys called it again last night yep so i think going that's because owens
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.320]  the sports guys so are you i mean he just obsesses over it well it's also having objective there's
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:15.160]  a reason why the info wars is the only uh media brand of this scale and this scope in the world
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.920]  that's not dependent on billionaires it's not well sure let's be clear a media can make good
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:22.680]  predictions too they're told what to say exactly that's the problem and not only that why do they
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.240]  continue to promote losers because losers stay on script so the reason why this audience gets
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.520]  access to information and intel that nobody else does is because this audience makes it a reality
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.120]  by supporting it for and again scroll into some of his tweets where he predicted this all before
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:41.080]  it even started last night sorry yeah no problem the and so it's the audience that makes real
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.160]  their own access to intel and information that they get to share with their friends and family
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.920]  and people around the world and everything is about how accurate and authentic you are yeah
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:52.520]  exactly which the corporate media doesn't get they're all wanting a billionaire to fund them we all get
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:56.600]  funded by being authentic so we're fighting to be authentic exactly they have to have teleprompters
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.000]  and they have to have scripts because otherwise they might upset or offend some advertisers some
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.160]  donors some big corporate contributor some billionaire so the it's all been screened by 20
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.520]  lawyers exactly you would see it like a publication like the intercept which is actually a popular
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.840]  publication but it's and does do some anti-war stuff but they propagated a lot of the russia gate
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.520]  nonsense even though their editor said it was nonsense why because one of their billionaire
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.160]  backers is a big trumpeter so that so they have to we don't have to propagate anything so the
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.160]  the consequences people get to get independent insight information that's actually accurate
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:28.440]  and forecasting and foreshadowing what happened i'm whether you're talking about the new york fire
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.920]  commissioners talking about reopening 9 11 where you're talking about japan going into animal human
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.600]  hybrid experimentation or whether you're talking about last night's debate they're able to get
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.320]  intel tomorrow's news today literally because the audience makes it a functional reality so i think
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.120]  that what happened is you saw that last night uh i think buda judge uh fell in this in the betting
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.080]  markets i think buda judge is almost dead i mean he's only living off big donors at this point
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.280]  the you're seeing the and that's why he's coming up with more by the way speaking of buda judge
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:58.600]  let's play a quick clip it was we got a break where the the earth's now ending in 10 years he's out
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.760]  doing aoc here he had to ask yourself how somebody like donald trump ever gets within
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:10.360]  cheating distance of the oval office in the first place it doesn't happen unless america is already
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:16.680]  in a crisis an economy that's not working for everyone endless war climate change we have lived
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:22.440]  this in my industrial midwestern hometown my generation has lived this as long as we have
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:28.840]  been alive and it's only accelerating science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:35.080]  horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate by 2030 the average house in this country will
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.880]  cost half a million bucks and women's right to choose may not even exist we're not going to be
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:47.560]  able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments policies and politicians that have
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:53.400]  dominated washington for as long as i have been alive we've got to summon the courage to walk away
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.880]  from the i've got to do what he says because he he's gay last night i'm on info wars dot com
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:06.920]  and i read chris pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the shirt that i envisioned
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.200]  a betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all 50 stars with the gads and snake
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:17.480]  super imposed over and on the back america's back info wars dot com but what's better than just an
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:21.400]  american flag about a don't tread on me under the flag take don't trail the american flag it's a
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.160]  perfect combo so great minds think alike i mean whoever designed that shirt we'd already come up
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.920]  with the exact same similar design it is the don't tread on me american flag t-shirt inspired by
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:35.880]  the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by chris pratt but it's a you know battle tattered
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:41.320]  flag like the one that flew over fort sumpner and again on the back it says america's back info wars
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:47.400]  dot com four thousand of these babies and that's it so we've got the betsy ross version and the

[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.160]  info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:14.520]  elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex first started talking
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:21.000]  about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.480]  to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.560]  when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:36.840]  it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:42.680]  competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:49.480]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.880]  sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info

[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:57.320]  all you've done from the bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in the world
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:13.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:23.240]  get ready for rare retraction
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:31.000]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance lie from the info wars
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:39.080]  dot com studios it's alex jones and robert barnes uh beto roark has has in longer clips
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:44.360]  said the world's ending in 11 years aoc first order 12 years al gore said that all the sea level
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:52.040]  places you know he bought a house after that would be gone by 2017 and he said that 10 years
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.920]  before so they just copy the in 10 years we're all dead well now beto uh last time we were saying it
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:02.760]  was uh the judge of buda a buda judge uh our lord and savior our master our king our god
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:07.720]  actually he was saying 12 years going with a standard talking point but no no no roark says
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:14.360]  his 10 years here it is listen to scientists on this and they're very clear we don't have more than
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.040]  10 years to get this right and we won't meet that challenge with half steps or half measures
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:26.200]  you know i think he was the biggest loser he's unwatchable he's so flaming fake and the fact
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.400]  that all these fake texans that bought into him it's just mental illness well the betting
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.840]  markets agree he took a 35 drop in what was already very low odds i mean he's now beneath
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.280]  andrew yang way beneath andrew yang to be elected to the next democratic nominee for the presidency
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.920]  so at this point if he's smart i mean like the meme about him was uh b2o roark still can't get
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:51.720]  the message i mean that he needs to get out so i think the fact that he's even trying to and
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.360]  that's why he's taking these extreme positions he's like okay aoc said 12 years i'll say no
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.360]  more than 10 years maybe five years maybe next time i'll say two years uh something dramatic
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:04.520]  something drastic just to get attention they're all really bad at it now none of them are have
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.280]  the also said give illegal aliens everything for it exactly you know free healthcare for
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:14.040]  illegal aliens uh but not for american citizens so the free education in the end but he went back
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.880]  he reversed himself last night originally they all said they wanted to decriminalize crossing
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:22.440]  the border then they did polls and they found out that even democrats don't support that position
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.360]  so beto was reversing himself and saying oh no now i think we probably shouldn't decriminalize
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:31.320]  crossing the border so the uh so he goes back and forth on those the real globalist agenda is
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.680]  opening the border uh marianne williamson if you go to drudgereport.com it's a powerful image right
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:44.280]  there uh of her saying that trump is a dark force warns of dark days for dims trump psychic
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.880]  force in america that she want to say dark force is it that projection they're the ones that want
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.120]  pedophilia they're the ones that want open borders they're the ones that say america was never great
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:50:00.200]  will never be great they're the ones uh that are just just pushing all this constant poison
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:05.000]  let's go ahead and hear from her miss williamson what's your response on the flint water crisis
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.440]  my response on the flint water crisis is that flint is just the tip of the iceberg i was recently
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:15.720]  in denmark south carolina where it is there is a lot of talk about it being the next flint
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:21.000]  we we have an administration that has gutted the clean water act we have communities particularly
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.720]  communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.360]  environmental injustice i assure you i lived in gross point what happened in flint would not have
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:36.760]  happened in gross point this is part of the dark underbelly of american society the racism the
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.320]  bigotry and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight if you think any of this
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:47.240]  wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.480]  is bringing up in this country then i'm afraid that the democrats are going to see some very
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:56.760]  dark days we need to say it like it is it's bigger than flint it's all over this country it's particularly
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:01.240]  people of color it's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back and if the democrats
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:05.560]  don't start saying it then why would those people feel that they're there for us and if those people
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:11.080]  don't feel it why would anybody want to be this victim and say i live in la where it's toilet to
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:16.200]  tap where they take the sewage put it through all these expensive systems that the city bought
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:21.480]  billions a year folks who spent on this in la billions on the sewage and then you drink
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:28.360]  toilet water filtered by the city and then you wonder why everybody's got cancer i mean i i've
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:35.640]  tasted la water and it it literally makes me sick when i go to la i am a neat freak i take three
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:43.000]  showers a day at least okay i do not shower when i am in los angeles i take bottles of of uh
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:49.000]  of filter water and i take horror baths as they're called okay i take a horror bath
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:56.520]  with washcloths and that because i get sick and i'm tough i get sick when i take a shower in la
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:02.120]  or i i mean the place is a joke folks dallas is almost as bad houston's bad i grew up in dallas
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:05.400]  i didn't need anybody to tell me tap water's bad i was a kid playing football or whatever i'd really
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:09.800]  three glasses of water i feel sick after okay and i learned to drink in filter water i felt better
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.560]  and yeah i also sell water filters the best that are out there damn right in forestware.com but what
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:19.320]  i'm getting at is yeah one billion toilet to tap water program and i remember that years ago but
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.400]  that's just some some new they got a whole bunch of sewage that's just one facility they already
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:30.360]  put into old tap 20 years ago in some areas and so do you need the government to tell you you
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:35.000]  should filter your water or you should drink it out of something that is sewage with all the
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.120]  chemicals and all the runoff and all the drugs that's insane no filter can cut that out and then
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:44.600]  the government adds toxic fluoride to it i mean there well there's no doubt i mean there's serious
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.440]  problems across the board what's fascinating is well one this use of the phrase people of color
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.400]  is ironic it's like an old bluesberry uh comedic script where you know the the older person keeps
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.360]  for making references to colored people which is a term we got rid of correctly and now all of a
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:01.720]  sudden we're going back to it by just rephrasing in people of color so that whole but and they're
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.960]  pushing busting oh that's a wonderful thing oh it's a complete political debacle where
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:09.880]  harris reversed her position off script when she was when she's on stage she says one thing when
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:13.080]  she's off stage she says something completely different so reverse herself eight different
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:18.040]  times probably again tonight so but i think you saw with williamson is there was a large
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:23.000]  degree of projection the obsession with race is an obsession of the democrats on the left and they
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.600]  moved away from russia for now on the race exactly race is now the big mantra and it's it's purely
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.880]  moral virtue signaling it's people a new video service will have next segment elijah comings
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:38.840]  a decade ago on c span calling it rat infested oh i mean king elijah of baltimore that's trump
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.400]  called him as an accurate terminology and the reality is the democratic party has institutionally
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:49.160]  failed african-americans in this country over 40 50 60 years and the question only is how do they
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.320]  keep inducing african-americans to vote democratic when the democratic party continues to fail the
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:57.800]  african-american truth is everybody i know almost everybody that's black just black american white
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:04.840]  whatever who cares sick of these damn terms all of them don't like the democrats what they do is
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.160]  the democrats are so corrupt there's massive election fraud proven in inner-city areas whether
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:13.400]  it's poor white black we know that these are institutionalized criminal groups that are in
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.320]  control that people aren't actually supporting it the polls are all fake well i mean what was key
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:21.880]  to trump's election was african-american men in detroit in a light where the debates were
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:27.400]  were held tonight and were held uh last night the if you look at where uh it's in milwaukee same
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.720]  in philadelphia same in pittsburgh it was because they voted for trump in ways they did not vote
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:36.120]  for romany and did not vote for mccain they gave trump all each of those three states they know
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:42.600]  that and they think the appeal is to try to be like a bad rapper in their uh racializing of
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:47.160]  basic american politics which i mean i've seen this and and i've i've got family that's great but
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:53.480]  some family when we're ordering mexican food or something will will if hispanics doing the
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:59.320]  serving will be like hello how you they're like what the hell are you talking like or and then
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.080]  i've seen it some around we have a black cab driver or something somebody will be like
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:08.680]  just like literally virtue signaling it's not that people are bad they're just uncomfortable
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.360]  because the media has made it i'm not going to talk different in front of somebody i'm not going
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:16.840]  to go to new york city and talk with a yankee accent much less they'd come down here just be real
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.600]  oh exactly right well they've done studies on this and so white liberals historically will use
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.880]  different words and because there's three times more likely to done their language down exactly
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.720]  they're completely condescending when they this is across the board this is like my experience
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:33.000]  when i went to Yale in the 90s the you see people who think they're uh really they're about supporting
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.640]  their own moral superiority to everyone else oh oh oh here's an example i had a lake house this was
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:45.880]  like eight nine years ago and the neighbors were were were ut professors and they brought the gypsy
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.840]  king of the of the roman people or whatever to the lake and they were so uncomfortable to be
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.520]  shared a dock they were like we don't dislike gypsies you know like i didn't know those people
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.360]  were gypsies they have brown skin whatever i'm over here fishing with my son so she walks over
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:04.280]  like my five-year-old son who has a birthmark you know rex is like 16 now and she goes she goes
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:10.680]  what happened who hit you did he says this is liberal white woman and he goes i've got a birth
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:16.440]  march he said oh sorry they all knew i was alex joe's they were just flipping out and then soon
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.040]  the gypsies are over at my house asking for something and then they're digging in my yard for
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.600]  arrowheads and it's like they are the royal people you must let them and at first soon when i said
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.280]  them i just told you it was kind of rude and said f off they left me alone but it was literally this
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.680]  lepid thing like here are the gypsies you're racist you beat your son and it's just that it's like
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:37.160]  mind control these people are nuts but what they want is they want people in their local community
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.000]  well these were professors i later on got ripped off by the gypsies but they're in this cult like
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.560]  i'm with the gypsies oh god they're so cool gypsies are so wonderful you know just well these are the
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:48.440]  people that when they drive through an inner city lock their doors or don't drive through the inner
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:51.480]  city at all so these are people who are not connected or cared about that's what trump is
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:55.160]  exposing he's like here's someone who likes to grandstand and in the white media and though in
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:59.720]  the white left wants to grandstand pretending they support racial equality when it's trump
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:03.480]  who's delivered the lowest unemployment rate and for african-american men in the history of the
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.400]  unemployment rate even being tracked be while you look at what's happening in their communities
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.160]  they don't care about their communities instead congressman they totally exploited and want to
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.400]  keep them down exactly and you see his wife is involved in dubious practices with an ngo and
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:19.400]  non-governmental organ oh and trump knows all that and now the media is defending rats yeah
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:24.360]  defending collapse and and it just it's insane how they're hypocrisy and duplicity on issues of
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:28.040]  race they do not care about african-americans they do not care about improving the ordinary
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.320]  everyday lives of african-american i agree stay there i'm gonna play this logic coming's clip
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:34.520]  coming up that hit a few other things we have another guest coming on but i've got so much to
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:41.160]  get to i i want to play my 26 month old daughter singing twinkle twinkle little star she was singing

[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:53.560]  happening now right now all over the world humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist

[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:52.200]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey i just want to
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:56.840]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:01.560]  one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:06.440]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:11.320]  they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:15.000]  into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.840]  assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:23.080]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.560]  man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i would love to see what you're talking
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:33.000]  about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.800]  battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue we're
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:42.040]  going to keep fighting in the input war and even if something does happen to you or your show
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.000]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:53.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:06.360]  this is what you get Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer historian smart fella
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:13.720]  um let me ask you a question look at him obsessed with the smartphone he's over there
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:19.240]  sending a tweet out right now we're live on air trying to send it for the the forecasting
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.680]  though the forecasting one from uh well about 10 days ago that predicted bernie would make a
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:28.520]  substantial yeah you you should get with the crew and then come on the show tomorrow or
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:33.080]  something and really get with them and show how you and oh and forecasted exactly what would
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:37.080]  happen in the last debate i mean word for word yep and then you forecasted last night perfectly
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:42.040]  again yep we you should really meet with the producers today and get it done today yeah or
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:47.080]  even sit down and shoot a report because that's impressive like you know see the top political
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:51.160]  gambler who the you know even the newark times admits you are maybe you aren't because they say
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:56.360]  you are but the point is they're such liars but no me you are and show how you guys accurately did
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:02.280]  this like watch the top political uh sports gambler predict the last two debates perfectly
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.520]  i mean that's that's that's the headline that that's pretty powerful oh yeah and it shows the value of
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.360]  if you're good at what you do and you're giving honest objective analysis and you're really aware
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:14.200]  of what's happening in the country then you should be able to forecast these things doesn't mean you'll
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:18.360]  always be accurate but you should be above average in your accuracy sure but i see your own frustration
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:22.200]  the crew is awesome it's just hard for them with all your tweets to pull it up so you're like
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:27.240]  tweeting them into the next room hoping that there it is betting markets current forecast
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:31.640]  and then it just goes back so so let's not do this half-ass or catty wampus or half-cocked
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.320]  yeah i want you to meet with whoever you want got a great crew in there and we'll go back to
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:40.920]  owens prediction i remember owens prediction the day of the last debates with you on air
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:44.520]  and what he thought would come out of it and it was exactly what he said yep and last night
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:48.280]  when we were on air we said maryen williamson would be the most searched candidate very early
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.520]  on in the debates and that's precisely what happened most searched in 49 out of 50 states
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:57.560]  and she and she won the drudge poll but with ease almost half of the the vote so we'll just get
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:03.080]  those pieces together and we'll put them out as a report that's important wow our our pundits are
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:08.520]  like 100 dead on who's got that that's bragging rights baby meanwhile the entire corporate media
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:12.760]  said trump is gonna lose by 15 points exactly they had fake polls out who did i say was gonna win
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:17.880]  trump trump trump trump trump trump cnn had this completely bogus focus group last night
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:21.080]  where they had these people on there they were just repeating cnn talking points that were
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.320]  completely inconsistent and contradicted by the google searches by other polls that were taking
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.120]  place by the drudge poll by other items how long can this emperors new close thing go on i think i
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:33.480]  mean that's a good question i mean you're getting to the point where institutional media just continues
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.800]  to decline in their respect and credibility other than the white left that's the only party that's
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:42.280]  the only group most african-american democrats don't trust but his political pointed out trump
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:47.000]  weeds newspapers and watches mainstream he still believes it yeah to a certain degree i mean i think
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.720]  if there's a limitation trump needs to continue what he did really good in the buildup to 2016
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:55.800]  was he completely ignored the establishment press what he watched was in full wars what he watched
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:01.720]  was he listened to talk radio he went to do that then because it was also negative but i don't know
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:05.800]  why he's so obsessed with the lies they're telling about him i mean i know he likes to see what they're
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:11.000]  doing to then counteract him and manipulate him that's all a great show for us but i hope that
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.920]  he's only doing it for the political show i hope he doesn't think they have power because he's giving
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.160]  them power and their narrative is i mean like he gets frustrated when fox goes off script the what
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.920]  he should pay attention to is what is driving the national narrative is not establishment
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:27.880]  institutional press they're reacting to everything we cover one week or drudge covers one week they
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:32.360]  cover the next exactly so he's just stopped letting the tail wag the dog completely and if he wants
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:37.800]  to be ahead of the curve like he was in 2015 and 2016 against every other republican presidential
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:42.280]  candidate because he was watching info wars because there's a reason why the info wars audience
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:46.120]  and trump's early base completely overlap politically in the polling that we've done
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:51.000]  and that is because if he was he listened to the populist message he followed the populist message
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.080]  just like he did when he owns building she goes and knocks on doors exactly he did did real marketing
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:59.560]  real understanding of who his audience is so if he the new york times is not his audience and
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:03.160]  increasingly nobody who is part of his audience listens or cares about what the new and they're
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:06.600]  in their own desperate echo chamber completely and there's and that's what you're seeing that in
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:11.080]  the debates live you'll see it again tonight where they are so siloed from the rest of the world and
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:15.400]  their understanding of what ordinary people want i mean take their own audience take reparations
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:19.480]  the democrats themselves when they pulled reparations said we're not interested in reparations
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.440]  ten percent it was a very low number and ten and in the in the cross the board even msnbc
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:28.120]  steve cornacchi last night was saying by the way everything they're talking about is extremely
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:31.880]  unpopular including within the democratic party i know he would see it and said by the way this is
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.280]  very unpopular exactly david axelrod was admitting that he was telling us they're trying to bend our
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:40.920]  will exactly so everything is they're like we know it's unpopular gelet lost five billion telling
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:47.560]  us our dads suck no our dads were pretty freaking cool man even when they beat our ass yeah it's a
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:50.760]  complete disconnect that they're in and and they're trying to create a fake world that doesn't
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:53.880]  reflect the real world and that's why they get elections wrong that's why they get predictions

[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:22.680]  i'm gonna thirsty i'll be honest with you i've been out there on the streets all day you know if
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:27.320]  you feel like maybe giving your immune system a charge a nice good tap i feel it's live on
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:33.400]  the trick and i know how to make tap straight fresh you can make fresh tap totally for scratch
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:38.360]  what i like to start off with is a little bit of gunpowder cron on sd now charles are you being
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:43.000]  serious that this is how municipal tap water's made oh yeah if you ever go to uh what is it
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.680]  flint michigan or something you're gonna have sulfur water things light and on fire you got
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:51.400]  egg water you got all different kinds of stuff so you know people are really used to this flavor
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:56.440]  and you know what else they're used to they're used to taking it as in they pay taxes and they
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:01.560]  get that water and they do nothing about it they might scream a little bit and say our water's bad
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:07.560]  but they end up not doing very much so it doesn't really matter so i like to emulate that sort of
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:13.160]  that sentiment of paying taxes paying really high taxes and getting nothing in return not even clean
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:23.080]  water see it's got tissues in it half shower half bowl a little bit of toilet water not so
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:32.360]  bad it's not as bad as people think the creamy paste now it's not ready this is not ready you
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:37.800]  want to give it a little bit of like showmanship a showmanship yeah and a little bit more spice
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:42.760]  sometimes i'm feeling like really angry like i don't know if it's a testosterone thing but
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:48.920]  the problem with anger is that an angry population of people when their government doesn't even provide
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:53.240]  them with clean water or even like fix the streets potholes you know when the taxes get like that
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:57.640]  people with a lot of anger or testosterone usually flip cars over and sometimes even kill
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:04.280]  politicians i hate that you can't have that so i usually put birth control in every concoction i
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:09.640]  make it's gone from a tap water to a martini now so we're really just enjoying it but the original
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:20.760]  recipe still just as oh guys it's got this stuff came out so thick i was gonna spice yours up
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:28.360]  do you like it a lot okay guys thanks for thanks for enjoying this tap water we should all taste
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:36.040]  it here's to life here's to you guys this is monster this one's monster
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:42.440]  this williamson what's your response on the flint water crisis my response on the flint water
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.880]  crisis is that flint is just the tip of the iceberg i was recently in denmark south carolina
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:53.320]  where it is there is a lot of talk about it being the next flint we we have an administration that
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:58.840]  is gutted the clean water act we have communities particularly communities of color and disadvantaged
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:04.200]  communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice i assure you i lived
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:08.520]  in gross point what happened in flint would not have happened in gross point this is part of the
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:15.160]  dark underbelly of american society the racism the bigotry and the entire conversation that
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:20.280]  we're having here tonight if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:25.720]  force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country then i'm afraid
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:30.360]  that the democrats are going to see some very dark days we need to say it like it is it's bigger than
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:34.920]  flint it's all over this country it's particularly people of color it's particularly people who do
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:38.920]  not have the money to fight back and if the democrats don't start saying it then why would
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.920]  those people feel that they're there for us and if those people don't feel that they won't vote for
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:54.040]  us and donald trump will win i was stumbling from our gunnery guitar on my bar
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:10:09.320]  you know i talk faster and faster when barnes is on because everything he's saying i'm agreeing with
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.200]  and there's just more more more more more i've only scratched the surface of getting ready
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:20.360]  for this show since 5 30 a.m this morning and i couldn't turn away from the show last night
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:27.560]  i couldn't host it though i you know it's okay i'm the boss i walked out of here at about 945 i just
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:34.040]  said i cannot look at these people and barns and oh and everybody's like we're cool we can take over
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:39.240]  and i listened as i drove home and i listened to the end last night when the next host came on
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:46.360]  did a great job i listened like midnight i can listen to them but i can't look at them do you
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:51.480]  ever have that feeling looking at these plastic fake weirdos it's like something about looking at
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:58.280]  them like hillary i i mean i've gotten for years where i physically get upset just looking at her
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.480]  well yeah i mean i think that to a certain degree they're sort of artificial in in their
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.760]  artificiality and their uh their their hypocrisy comes through in their physical presentation
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:11.720]  in ways that the verbal is more manageable because you just hear the idea you don't see the duplicity
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:16.600]  that's evident in their in their physical manifestation of their other up their visual presence
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.280]  and i think that's what takes place and the and i think there's an there's aspects of that i mean
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.840]  clearly the last night i started hating myself and everyone around me and i was honest to the
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.760]  head producer i said i gotta go i never get depressed except looking at them well because
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:33.960]  there's such a evident fakeness and manifested in the way they're the interface they are very much
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:39.480]  so and and the and the uh the degree to which they are disconnected from ordinary reality
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.880]  and the sort of siloed fantasy that they want to bring people into in the democratic debate
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:49.080]  where they think normal is uh promoting health care for illegal uh aliens where they think
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:54.840]  normal is uh reparations that make no sense who's gonna pay i mean it does my family get a benefit
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:12:00.200]  because my family was in every study in actuary it will bankrupt us instantly oh it's like firing
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:05.240]  torpedoes into a ship it's completely unmanageable i mean in a world of true reparations the people
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:09.880]  that should be paying include kamala harris and brock obama her family one of the most powerful
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:15.160]  slave voting groups in in jamaica exactly brock obama who's illhan omar comes from an elite
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:20.600]  slavery family oh well in fact indeed the islamic world is where slavery originated and continued
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:26.520]  long path it was us in america leading the west and leading the world in ending slavery we didn't
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:31.720]  start slavery we ended it the uh we led the world in ending it so it doesn't even make sense there's
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:37.960]  so and do african immigrants not not be included uh for do do tribes have claims against one another
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:43.240]  because some tribes in a native american but again in law if my father which he didn't was a bank robber
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.720]  i'm not in trouble that he went to jail for 10 years for you know for that which my dad didn't
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:53.000]  but hypothetically so this idea only in soviet or nazi authoritarian systems is your neighbor
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.840]  does something wrong you get in trouble to well knowing that the we do have a history of blood
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:02.440]  libel and it led to the biggest uh purge and attacks and of anti-semitism and racial hatred
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:08.120]  in in the world oh this jew did this 100 years ago exactly or 2000 years ago i mean they were the
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.160]  that's right you killed christ exactly so oh that's the first reparations exactly oh my god you
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.160]  killed christ we're gonna kill you a thousand years later precisely the first reparations
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:23.640]  led to the worst onslaught ultimately penalized all the pogroms in spain and portugal all the purges
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:28.680]  all of the kicking out of the in isolation and segregation of jews in russia all the all the
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:33.560]  pogroms that took place all of this i mean the the israel was created because you killed jesus
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:37.880]  exactly no but they didn't kill jesus no there's nothing to do with it so i mean that that's what
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:43.240]  makes it we understand blood libels are dangerous blood libels are harmful then that also made a
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:47.560]  lot of the jews become leftists and then hate christians so just like saying whites are all
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:52.600]  racist and need reparations it'll make a lot of whites become racist the oh it was inevitably
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:58.200]  because they're asking people white identity politics is a reaction to left-wing identity
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:03.160]  politics they simply reincorporate they incorporate the same language so races like richard spencer
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.960]  propagate basically leftist politics at the behest and behalf of the leftist by just incorporating
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:13.160]  their terms into a different racial phraseology and by the way our great crew has been working a
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:17.400]  lot of them 15 16 hour straight as we have a limited crew to this 40 hour broadcast and i
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.600]  love to death so i'm not cracking the whip when i said don't go off half cocked it's because it was so
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.080]  powerful barns like i already had respect for it but it went way up when i started tracking your
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:32.600]  betting history and your predictions but i watched you guys you and i went a month ago oh and exactly
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.360]  predicted the top google search he exactly predicted who would win he exactly predicted who would win
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:40.120]  the poll and you did as well and you did it again last night and you're trying to send out your
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.040]  tweets and show folks we need to get the crew together and get those videos from a month ago
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:48.760]  and last night and show people how you guys nailed it because that is a major talking point for our
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.840]  coverage of news that you knocked that freaking thing out of the park grand slam baby oh exactly
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:57.080]  and i think what it shows is it shows we are far more on top of what's happening in the world how
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.640]  people think and how people react than the sort of fake artificial fantasy land that i mean the
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:05.160]  and you know when they're lawsuits against me they keep saying who's the secret group who who's
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:10.040]  the what's the agency telling you what to do it's called not being a slave it's called doing our own
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:13.880]  thinking it's in the more you do it the better you get at it never having anyone tell me what to do
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.600]  every day i made a lot of mistakes you get better oh absolutely and it's just being independent it's
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:23.800]  having an audience that allows this independence to thrive and survive by supporting info wars and

[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:40.520]  it i'll be here as well but i left halfway through it because i was just i couldn't handle it i mean
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:44.520]  i'll be on i couldn't look at them anymore uh that it was so horrible i couldn't watch it so please
[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:48.440]  tune in it's so horrible no but we've got to analyze it we've got to expose them they want us to give
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:52.600]  up you know that's part of it but the crew will be here i'll be here as well but so i said let me
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:57.560]  go to bing which microsoft owns and it's still censored but it's nothing like google and there
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:01.320]  was hundreds of articles i hadn't seen because i hadn't been i've been getting google alerts on
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:05.400]  my name and i thought you know it's so censored i better not get in articles except you know the
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:11.400]  the ones they want people to see on google sure enough gq new york times hundreds of articles
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:15.400]  literally that i saw i probably read 20 of them and here are some of them and again this isn't
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:21.400]  about alex jones this is about the control and the manipulation there's a whole new youtube scandal
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:26.440]  where somebody at the debate talked about the federal reserve so google ran and censored that
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:34.280]  that the whole point is censorship alex jones looks set to be brought down once and for all gq
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:40.680]  and they literally say that i'm this all-powerful demon that beat up children as a child and painted
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:45.400]  my tongue black none of this is true but they've learned outrageous lies must be true because
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:52.840]  they're so crazy uh you know all of it and but but what they say in here is that i've got to be
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:59.880]  destroyed but they say it's a consolation prize they can't get trump but they can get me and then he
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:05.320]  won't have his base as if if i went away the base would still support trump it's just pure idiocy
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:10.200]  so here's another one alex jones under oath is an antidote to post age truth new york times
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:18.360]  and it says he's a hashtag resistance consolation price so this is everywhere in the news that i'm
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:25.560]  a consolation prize and here's another one no alex jones is not a seer about sex abuse conspiracies
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:30.200]  and the national review criticized their own reporter for saying i was right and then i found
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:36.040]  all these articles that ever made the google feed of all the mainstream news saying people had souls
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:40.200]  well i guess alex is actually right i had no idea there were all these articles
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:43.560]  admitting that i was right about that so that's pretty big well yeah in fact what happened right
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:47.880]  after epstein is a writer wrote for the week which is a left-leaning publication which he said if
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:52.440]  you follow the fox news world or the mainstream media world you cannot understand epstein but if
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:57.000]  you followed alex jones in info wars you could fully predict and forecast exactly what was going
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.680]  to happen i was like i was watching the movie the whistleblower whereas like if you're watching the
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:04.440]  movies like if she had spent any time watching info wars she could have better defended those
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:08.440]  kids and what was happening in the human trafficking by dincourt and other related entities working
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:13.000]  with the un but because to her that world didn't exist her world was the new york times world
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.560]  she couldn't forecast how the what was really happening and that's it they live in the fantasy
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:21.880]  land of these high rises and these corporate constructs and they're telling us we live in
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:27.480]  fantasy land exactly because the reality is a reality that contradicts their fantasy world
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:32.120]  and that can't create or recreate the propagation of power that they're able to maintain and sustain
[02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:35.880]  with their fantasy world and so that's why there's this constant attack on you which is really a
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:40.360]  constant attack on the audience because this is such a powerful independent voice well it's like
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:47.240]  that line uh written by uh melis in pocalypse down where you got the army assassin he's about to go
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:51.480]  out meet with the general and you know try to go kill carnal curts and he's saying you know i'm here
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:55.560]  in the hotel drinking party and getting weaker charlie's out there in the general getting stronger
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:59.720]  we're in the jungle and as long as we stay in the fight resistance is victory we're getting
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:03.240]  stronger they're getting weaker absolutely and that's seen repeatedly and what they're obsessed with
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:07.880]  is they can't believe info wars his audience is willing to sustain info wars against this
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:12.120]  institutional onslaught and so the fact that people continue to back it continue to support it
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:15.560]  continue to find different products that they like that to support their lifestyles but also
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:20.520]  support info wars to keep the scale and scope expanding and deepening across the globe whether
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.840]  you have info wars as a broader audience now in australia and canada and europe and other places
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:29.000]  where the same populist message is spreading around the globe they're shocked that that's happened
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.400]  because in their fantasy land they could control people's thoughts and scare people and terrorize
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.120]  people into self-censorship which would then lead to censorship of info wars and by the way
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:42.120]  the great part about info wars worldview which they say in this s-square article is
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.240]  jones has shifted the whole paradigm no one no i haven't shifted any paradigm you're known liars
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:53.320]  you've been found out you've just chosen to think that i'm the one that did it but the truth is once
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.000]  you understand the globalist model then everything makes sense you know how to beat them and that's
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  why they're so pissed we've been in the dark the whole time they've got night vision killing us
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.800]  in the dark info wars is like night vision now you're on an even playing field now you can see
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:09.400]  what you saw yesterday in live time where millie weaver was debating this person who was following
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:13.400]  her around outside the democratic debates and what happened is and this person was like oh you know
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:17.160]  you're obsessed with the gay the frogs turning gay and she pointed out that in fact you were ahead
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:21.400]  of the curve talking about environmental pollution impacting species and that's what that entire thing
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:25.960]  is about and she was completely shocked she didn't even realize that so the any the the independent
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.200]  audience does their own independent investigation that supports the inquiries that info wars does
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:35.400]  that spreads knowledge in a way that helps predict and forecast how the entire world looks and that's
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:40.040]  why if you know if you've followed info wars you can forecast what's going to happen in the movie
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:44.280]  the whistleblower you can forecast what's going to happen with epstein you understand it you
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:48.520]  want you can put it into context because criminals follow a criminology more than the general public
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:54.040]  follows an ocd you think of someone ocd is following programs or being asperger's criminals in the
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:58.840]  type of criminality they are follow exact paradigms it's how cops can get maps and figure out when
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:02.840]  the next serial killing thing's going to happen six months from now and where it's because there's a
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:08.120]  weird pattern exactly it's patterns it's recognizing their mentality in their mindset the mindset of
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:14.120]  these elites is an anti-human pro authority mindset that wants to control and sees populations as
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:19.480]  cattle they see them as labor they see them as as sources of pleasure they see them as as sources
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:24.040]  and tools of they can have power over they don't see human beings they don't see individuals
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.040]  they're institutional and approach they don't see something valuable to interface with exactly and
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:31.640]  that's what the counter is if you understand they want to run you instead of interface i want to
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:37.160]  interface with you exactly and and and what you're uncloaking is this anti-humanitarian objective
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:42.600]  that for them sex trafficking is second nature because we're masters we traffic humans exactly
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.880]  they're just appropriate in their world because they just as it's appropriate to tell a three-year-old
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:53.480]  what gender they are the even against their own power exactly it's because they don't see humans
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.480]  they're anti-human they're pro-power they're pro-authoritarian they're pro-institutional
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.800]  they're not pro-individual they're not pro-human the truth is they're mentally ill oh completely mentally
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:05.640]  ill and they want to spread their mental illness to the rest of the world they want to pervert the
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.880]  entire they want to make our environment their environment exactly and because they're unable
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:13.800]  and unsuccessful to do so they go nuts at the people who pull back the curtains show that the
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:16.840]  emperor has no clothes and that's why they're obsessed with info wars that's why they're
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:20.440]  obsessed with alex jones but what they don't realize is they can't defeat the audience because
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.880]  the audience is what fuels info wars and the audience is and that's not a pat on the head
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:28.120]  folks without you we're doomed and that'll be okay we well and they that admit the article
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:33.720]  say well the disease is already spreading people are it's not a disease it's called victory exactly
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:37.400]  it's independent it's true and it's independence of thought independence of action independence of
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:41.400]  spirit independence of soul it's keeping the soul of humanitarianism alive against these
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:45.240]  institutional threats and these power-driven individuals and that's what is unique and
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:49.000]  exceptional about it the the american democratic experiment can only work with an independent
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  free press and the only truly independent free press in the world is info wars and that's why
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.760]  they see it as such a threat and that's why we're we are able to forecast and foreshadow what's
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:00.200]  going to happen to the democratic debates in ways they can't in ways and when are you going to
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:04.520]  forecast tomorrow you know let's do one more segment my catam's is coming up but he understands

[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:24.680]  of the mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:28.680]  location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:33.640]  a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory so here's what

[02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:08.600]  get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:12.520]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and then getting quality products the
[02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:17.640]  products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost
[02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:22.360]  weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:26.520]  these little uh sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[02:31:26.520 --> 02:31:31.400]  throat uh hello sir let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:36.120]  but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:40.840]  dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:45.160]  bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[02:31:45.160 --> 02:31:48.920]  of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 percent off because
[02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:53.080]  you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh where you have
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:58.680]  patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support i talk about this on the air and
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:02.920]  i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements
[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:07.000]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.760]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:14.680]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:18.520]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people
[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:21.640]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and
[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:27.560]  the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements he claims are supplements
[02:32:27.560 --> 02:32:33.720]  no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because
[02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:37.640]  they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:42.200]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:46.200]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:51.720]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or

[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:52.760]  patriot points we're trying to hit a million dollars gross to bring in about 300 000 extra
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:57.160]  than we would normally bring in during a week so that i can launch some covered operations
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:05.640]  that are all legal and awful uh that are let's just say um shouldn't say too much should i
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:13.560]  let's just say white house approved but this is all organic this is all completely of the people
[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:18.840]  okay and i should have done this a long time ago i had a lot of plans i haven't implemented
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:23.800]  but we're finally accelerating all of our operations but it's like when they say put on
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:29.800]  all sale when a ship wants to go the fastest we are spending every dime we've got on operations
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:35.080]  we've got going and we need more so get your coffee get your toothpaste get your non-gmo

[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:48.920]  dot com port slash showb to go where you can donate or link through and buy product we've
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:54.280]  raised four hundred and eleven thousand dollars uh since this uh 40 hour broadcast unless you
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:35:01.000]  yesterday morning at eight a.m but again most of that is product sales so i haven't done the math
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.040]  yet it's probably like a hundred and twenty thousand dollars or something which is great
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:08.440]  it's normally to have like twenty thirty thousand dollars extra money a day to actually try to fund
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:14.040]  things we we again vox and all these people get hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:17.960]  vice gets billions a year to spew all their left wing crap and it's not
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:22.360]  like a billion bucks but it's product sales so they get half of it it's all that money
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.120]  if you understand like if we bring in thirty million dollars a year it's like fifteen million we
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:31.560]  have to spend and we do our own servers we do our own bandwidth we have our own it i'm spending
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:37.480]  everything now and i'm not complaining but i haven't been paid this year and i'm living off money
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:43.000]  that i saved years ago which i've intended to spend if it gets down uh to have to fund this
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:49.800]  place but that would just run us a few months so it's very important that that that you financially
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:56.040]  support us sure i could dial back and go longer but my gut my instinct says full speed ahead
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:01.160]  launch everything i've got no strings attached to all these groups that are doing things and
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:08.040]  the incredible thing is everything we've launched has paid off in reaching people spectacularly
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:14.040]  because sure we've been blackballed but it wasn't alex jones a mildly face that made us so successful
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:19.400]  it was the information other people with the same info are even more successful and so we've really
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.120]  hit the event horizon but we've got to get up into orbit with these new secret payload that's why
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:27.960]  use the the space shuttle eighty percent of its missions for secret military missions
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:31.720]  which is a civilian mission of the people on organic resistance but we need to get up into
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:37.240]  orbit because i've got seven projects going a couple been launched five are about to be launched
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:40.280]  info or store.com now robert barnes constitutional lawyer a good friend of mine
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:46.200]  a month ago you you you would own a leather clip tonight when you're on it was we're getting them
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:50.440]  right now you laid out exactly who would win who would win the polls who'd be the most google
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:54.360]  searched how he even came up with what you thought you should look at was amazing because that ended
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:58.840]  up being the big issue of the night you predicted again last night exactly what would happen uh
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:05.480]  about uh barianne uh williamson uh about you know all of it and about who would be the loser so
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:09.640]  give us your new predictions for tonight we'll have reporters on the ground in detroit michigan
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:14.200]  covering it as well live coverage folks and again you're the missing element you're the
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:19.320]  fifth element you're the critical catalyst tell everybody you know an email on facebook on twitter
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:26.200]  in person don't tell them info or dot com that'll get censored tell them clownworld.us for the censored
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:32.280]  forbidden coverage of the most accurate analysis that they don't want you to have that you keep
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.160]  saying it do you understand when you move and take action it's all over they want me off the air
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:43.320]  so i'm not telling you how powerful you are you understand that you are everything you're not
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.400]  just part of the equation go ahead robert absolutely i mean the so i think tonight will be a couple
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:51.880]  things one what the expectation is of the median political establishment is that kamala harris will
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:56.920]  take out joe biden she did severe damage to him in the first debate but the she has not managed to
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.920]  take out his political support and any sufficient number he's still got double digit leads in most
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:05.960]  national polls big leads in south carolina older african the long knives are coming out exactly she
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:10.680]  needs to attack and attack and attack and reduce so repeatedly and the large portion of the donor
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:15.320]  establishment and the media establishment and the political establishment wants to see that happen
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:19.320]  so you're predicting it's going to be a bloodbath yes i think it will be and i think uh biden will
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:22.760]  try to defend himself aggressively we'll see whether or not there's a lot of rumors and
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:27.320]  ruminations that biden really didn't want to run that biden is second guessing the fact that he has
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:30.920]  well i've heard from folks that are around him like why am i doing this screw this absolutely
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:34.840]  he's just being embarrassed his legacy is being destroyed his kids are being put under investigation
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.880]  does he want this to continue so we'll see tonight how serious he is in two ways first can he drug
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:45.720]  himself up in such a way like hillary did in 2016 so that the health concerns dissipate because he
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:52.120]  did not maintain multiple sentences he's beyond sluggish it looked terrible it was it was a cognitive
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:57.480]  problem that could not even be covered up for two minutes and so will we see the same he can't go
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:01.080]  two minutes without just exactly i think we'll continue to see the same problem i think the
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:05.000]  problem is incurable i think whatever it is he can't even mask it for a short period of time i
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.360]  don't even think they can drug him up to keep him maintaining it if he's very aggressive and
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:12.920]  very neurological exactly if he's if he attacks everybody up there or he starts attacking hairs
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:17.720]  in particular this will be a sign that he really doesn't want to run but he wants to attack back
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.560]  for people trying to destroy his legacy for the fact that the big donors which he's threatened to do
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:25.480]  correct which could make tonight last night was slit your wrist boring i'll admit it yeah i mean
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.200]  i freaking left okay i'm not gonna lie to people right but tonight could be you talking about
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:34.200]  explosives you could see major drama i think the the political establishment is expecting major
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:38.600]  drama we'll find out what by biden's real intentions are by how he approaches the debate we'll find
[02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:42.840]  out what come on whether kamala harris really wants the presidency by how she approaches it
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.560]  and if she's smart the candidate who can once again win the drudge poll once again when the
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.120]  google search engines can be tulsi gabbard what she needs to do is there's talk that she'll talk
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:56.200]  about julie in the sanjus case that she'll talk about big tech censorship that she'll talk about
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:00.360]  things that are close to the trumpist base that challenge the democratic establishment narrative
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.920]  not great now those are easy predictions and i'm not poo pooing you know a month ago and last
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.400]  night you were like this will be the google search this will be the numbers it was exactly right so
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:13.400]  what it will give us your stunning analysis so i think right now the kamala harris is actually
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:19.320]  still leading uh in the uh in the betting markets she's got 27 28 percent i think if kamala harris
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:22.440]  doesn't deliver as much as she should i think kamala harris will take a hit i think she'll
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.600]  take probably like a five to ten percent hit in the markets um i think that joe biden could bounce
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:31.720]  back up if he's really counter aggressive um because she knows instinctively yeah he has to he
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:37.320]  needs to restore the credibility of the donor class in him uh he'll either do that or he'll
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:41.000]  sort of go out in a blaze of glory by being counterattacking so we'll see what happens in
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.320]  that regard but that would be my forecast and then i think and i think tulsi gabbard will be smart
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:51.720]  enough to at least be high to get a viral moment in the debates uh by pushing the jew the stories
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:55.560]  that the democratic debate doesn't want to talk about like what you'll see from our coverage
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:00.520]  that you won't see from the questioners is going into their individual scandals and other questions
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:05.240]  that need to be discussed in debate oh again it's ridiculously obvious that if you're gonna watch this
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:10.920]  debacle it needs to be enforced but you get that listeners what we're asking is to win the war of
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.320]  information is reach out to people and say hey you've heard of a alex jones you've heard of robert
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:20.040]  barnes you've probably heard about a lot of stuff why don't you tune in and see it for yourself what
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:24.360]  they don't want you to see so that we're doing live coverage tonight because that's how we get new
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.880]  people in and we found we get new people they stay that's why the system is so scared and doesn't
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:37.080]  want us going to 2020 but the good news is we're here we're together we're strong now let's let
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:41.080]  the enemy know what's really going on if i sell out all the product i have we can run for a year
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:46.280]  if i and i'm gonna make the decision the next month while i'm at it but if we don't reorder
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:53.240]  we'll we will shut down then so i can fund us for a year with the product we have the problem is
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:57.800]  if i don't reorder then in a year or less we won't have the product to keep going and we'll shut
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:01.480]  down which maybe that's our mission and though everybody here will get a new job and everything
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:06.760]  else but i mean we are to that point and and i've i'm maxed out and i've i've i've been begging
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:10.760]  for help and you've kept us there but it's always god just gives us like the widows might exactly
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:17.000]  what we need folks i need to make decisions i need extra capital to do these projects and i'm not
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:22.680]  complaining thank you you're amazing i'm just saying who has paid off like this what what system
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:27.000]  in your life if you bought products at walmart or target or wherever it had been politically
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.800]  save your future just go to info or short com make a straight donation or buy the products we

[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:55.080]  here as well stay with us something really important on the other side i'm alex jones
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:43:01.560]  it's happening now right now all over the world humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:07.000]  globalist world government mark of the beast agenda and the forces of evil are trying to

[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:19.480]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.400]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:27.800]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:31.720]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:35.880]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and

[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:02.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:14.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:20.680]  so does he lie from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:28.200]  so this morning i woke up about 5 30am
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:33.080]  first doing research right away a couple hours so my children are off at school woke up
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.880]  and i was sitting there this morning at about 7am as my daughter's woke up and came in i was
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:46.040]  cooking them breakfast and i just looked at him and i thought you know that's good right there
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:51.560]  innocence the whole future strength the purity that god's given us the the seed of the universe
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:56.600]  and i thought about the globalists now they target children and young people to rob their future
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:02.840]  to abuse them the terrible things they're doing i thought you know i never include my children on
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:07.960]  air my son wanted to be on air he's been on there since he was 10 years old rex is 16 almost 17 now
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:13.240]  but i thought about my three daughters one is 15 one's 11 ones 26 months old
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:18.120]  they thought well when the time's right i want to talk about good versus evil
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.960]  and then my youngest daughter this morning started singing twinkle twinkle little star
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:29.320]  and i came back over she usually won't do an encore or something
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:34.520]  everybody says their kids are smart they all are smart but i mean this this this girl won't
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:41.880]  say her name she's just beyond this is the next level and i went over to her and i said on cue
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:48.920]  to the nanny but also to the folks who are in my house i said she's in the right on cue she's
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:55.720]  singing a twinkle twinkle little star imagine the innocence and purity of this versus the new world
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:01.320]  order in satan and imagine if you love children you love your own daughter how much god loves us
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.760]  god loves the sparrow the field as the bible says imagine how much god loves you but we have to
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:11.320]  be given free will and so we have to be willing to have children in this corrupt evil environment
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:16.280]  and put them into this bad evil system to believe in god and to believe in their soul and to believe
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:20.360]  in their future and it's through them that we're given the strength to stand against the enemy
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.640]  that's why the enemy doesn't want you to have children because as stressful it is as hard as
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:31.560]  as hard as it is it's a metaphysical moment when you cross the level of creator and you begin
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:39.560]  to be that little g that the old testament talks about made in the image of god and then now you
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:43.720]  begin to understand what it's like for god to give us free will you know he loves us so much
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:48.440]  for his children and we could go bad we could die we could be taken to hell for eternity you think
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:54.520]  god likes that but god wants children god wants consciousness god wants to commune with us forever
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:59.800]  and so god has to roll the dice believing that if he creates new entities that have free will
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:04.760]  you create a whole new universe in their mind a whole new potential like god's created this universe
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:08.840]  a whole new potential think of that god has to do that it's perfect
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:15.320]  it's not just love it's gambling people say i'm gonna have children the world's too evil
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:19.640]  well but why did god give us consciousness you know that there's evil in the universe there's free
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:24.440]  will some will join evil and and they'll hurt the innocent i mean you can't do that you're a sadist
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:32.200]  so instead no one ever exists no but god is a hypocrite so god concentrated himself down to a
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:38.920]  human and sent himself here to be tortured to death to show everybody hey i'll anything i ask
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:44.840]  you to do i'll do it that's why you take that leap of faith towards god god's waiting with his hand
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:50.840]  out waiting right now for eternity but you've got the satan comes to take free will god will not
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:57.560]  possess anybody you've got to beg god to come into you and god's so powerful god's not just gonna
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:01.240]  come in all the way at first because you couldn't handle it i couldn't handle it god's gonna put
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:06.760]  weight on you and test you to make sure do you really want this while you're alive in this plane
[02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:10.600]  because when the next level will be a lot closer to god be able to handle it but you know for those
[02:51:10.600 --> 02:51:16.040]  of us that have really asked god to come into us are you really ready for that because these devil
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:21.480]  worshipers kill kids and do all this bad stuff so they can try to get close to darkness they could
[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:27.320]  never imagine the power i mean you mean real power of getting close to god i mean it's just
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:35.400]  humbling to even be in the presence you can't look at it because you're evil you're lower level
[02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:40.280]  you can't look at god because if you looked at god it would destroy you because you would kill
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:49.400]  yourself because you would be so ashamed of who you are here's my young sweet daughter i want
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:53.720]  you to hear the voice of purity that the enemy hates the seed of the universe that the world
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:58.680]  wants to corrupt so that we know the the pull star of good versus evil here it is
[02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:07.080]  so
[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:10.600]  that record it for the air just say say say twinkle twinkle sing the song for it
[02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:31.080]  you
[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:51.800]  Oh, you're so sweet you're such a good singer that was so pure
[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:06.200]  See the celebration of a child their potential
[02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:11.400]  So the global is trying to sterilize kids when they're three now openly satanic
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:15.960]  Because they're so empty the only energy they have is sucking it off a child
[02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:19.320]  These people will be damned to a black hole
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:26.600]  The absence of God now let's go ahead and start this into the next hour that Mike Adams is coming up
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:28.360]  I was on man cow
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:32.120]  Muller's show who was friends with Michael Jackson big friends with William Shatner. I mean
[02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:37.960]  At one point. He was as big as Howard Stern. He's a good guy. He's a Christian and I'm friends with Eric Mankow Muller
[02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:40.280]  But he was on air and offered to tell me about
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:45.480]  Experiences he's had they try to get him into Satanism and things but he was explaining all of this
[02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:48.920]  And I thought he was more powerful of things he was saying today than what I was saying
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:53.720]  So here he is on WLS out of Chicago a syndicated nationwide. Here's Mankow this morning
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:57.720]  I say he's the most controversial guy in America. I don't know if he is or not
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:01.080]  I think he is one of one of the most controversial guys. Alex. How are you?
[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:05.560]  Mankow good to be here with you. Do you like being controversial?
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:07.960]  Do you wish at this point you were just lovable?
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:11.240]  Alex Jones you could you could have taken the safe path
[02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:14.920]  Well, I could have here's a great example for your listeners
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:19.800]  23 years ago. I was simply reading a medical journal out of MIT
[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:25.720]  They were worried about Costa Rica and China and a few other places that were already creating animal human clones
[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:27.880]  Now that was in a major medical journal
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:29.560]  now
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:35.960]  Two years later it was on CBS news that there have spider apart goat creatures in upstate new york to create body armor
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:37.800]  That was CBS news
[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:40.840]  Well, yesterday ap and the London independent
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:45.080]  reported japan just legalized animal human clones
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:51.400]  They're already having china babies being born that has five parents. Those aren't humans. Those are humanoids
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:53.080]  so
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:55.080]  I'm not really controversial
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:55:00.440]  I point out stuff that's already going on and then the media makes the controversial. I talked about Jeffrey Epstein
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:02.840]  and robert moeller
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:06.840]  Using him as a confidential informant to blackmail people 10 years ago
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:10.440]  I had investigated vernalist on all about it now. It's all over the news
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:15.240]  So really that's why they hate me is because I have a big syndicated radio show
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:21.960]  Just like you have had and I'm able to put out things that are already out there 99% of what I cover is already public
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:28.120]  Information the other stuff the 1% was on drugsreport.com your stay. I know I know that's why you want to be on
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:32.360]  And that simply was showing tim cook of apple
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.360]  An Elon musk of tesla and all who wants everybody to have brain chips, you know, it's last week, but he says that's right
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:41.240]  You're that's right. I'll have tea off or you can go to the mall
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:44.760]  Alex, Alex, you got to hang on
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:47.880]  I got a break. I want to tease you. You know how it works. I got a tease and I'll bring you back
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.560]  But there is something going on with the tech giants eyes
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:56.680]  They're amazingly. Uh, well it's shark week. So let's use this reference. They're shark like
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:55:59.720]  They're all black and they're dead
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:04.040]  What's going on? Alex Jones has a theory. We'll speak with them next
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:06.680]  If you're easily offended
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:09.320]  Well, listen to another show for a few minutes
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:14.840]  Well, let's talk about the eyes creepy eyes of the tech leader stop right there
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:18.680]  We're going to come back and I'm going to air in the next two segments the rest of this
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:24.520]  And then we're going to go to Mike Adams, but then after I left him I I dialed in on my phone WLS is
[02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:29.240]  Link and I heard what he said because I knew he's going to say when I hung up he didn't get this from me
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:32.360]  He knows he's he was like inside Hollywood and got out of it
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.400]  And he said the children they don't kill they turn into servants to pick up more kids and are like these wrenfields
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:40.920]  and
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.760]  That's what that's what's going on folks. This is real. This is psychic energy being drained off children
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:49.800]  And if you don't fight this
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:52.360]  You don't go to hell
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:56.040]  What happens is you're you're damned you're separate from god as the bible explains
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:00.200]  These modern churches have all been taken over by satan because if you were going to be satan
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:03.320]  The first thing you do is take over the churches to make sure people understand
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:09.880]  By being damned it's separation from god. Can you imagine as an intergalactic spirit?
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:13.160]  It is in all these dimensions that can travel anywhere in the universe
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:15.160]  You don't want to be with god
[02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:19.400]  And so you're sent to a place because you decided that of your own people
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:26.520]  Can you imagine with bill clinton and hillary and jeffrey eppstein and hitler and mousetung and and and all the all the
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:28.520]  like enough
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:34.520]  With these people because here's the deal they could create a whole new universe. They could build something. They can't it's just
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:38.840]  Killing each other and flopping around and just there's no children to kill though
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.400]  You're all together burning in your own evil burning in hell
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:51.880]  There are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[02:57:53.080 --> 02:57:55.960]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:00.840]  That's what the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:03.080]  I went and researched the renaissance
[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:10.600]  Americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:14.680]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:19.160]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:25.240]  So whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products at info wars store.com
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:30.520]  By spreading the articles by spreading the videos and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation
[02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:35.080]  And the world for peace and discernment for myself and the whole info wars family
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:40.520]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars is nothing

[02:59:01.640 --> 02:59:11.160]  The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails
[02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:13.720]  The system is vulnerable
[02:59:13.880 --> 02:59:19.640]  Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days

[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:32.440]  Puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system

[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:49.160]  Well, listen to another show for a few minutes
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:01:00.600]  Well, let's talk about the eyes the creepy eyes of the tech leaders here in america

[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:07.080]  controversial kid
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:08.280]  alex uh
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:14.440]  Interesting stuff. What is going on with these tech giants eyes? First of all name the people and then say what you think's going on
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:19.320]  Well, it's just a three minute video. It's up on info wars dot-com
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:27.240]  Anybody just typed into a search engine. What's wrong with big tech's eyes or you'll probably post it to your site or you can even play it
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:29.640]  It's actually about the two minute total
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:35.000]  And we just show elan must eyes under white lights on tv. We show
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:42.120]  His two chief engineers eyes at the same event. We show tim cook in different interviews where he's under white lights
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:44.920]  And his his pupils are 90 percent
[03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:47.880]  dilated that only happens when you're dead
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:54.360]  Uh, and I mean, I mean, I mean, I've never was a big drug guy, but in college. I went to a few parties and raves
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:59.320]  I've seen people on lsd. Their eyes get half as big as that does people on ecstasy
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:01.960]  They get dilated about halfway
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:04.680]  90 percent
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:08.040]  Is just unprecedented. These are not dr. Videos anybody can go to
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:13.080]  Uh, any of the tim cook interviews with vice tv any of the elan must interviews
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:15.640]  And and it's a bunch of the other executives
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:21.240]  Have these giant giant pupils. We know that silicon valley is obsessed with
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:25.960]  Micro dosing on lsd. Payote is whole side of mushrooms
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:29.480]  But they've also elan must came out three weeks ago
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.920]  With his brain interface and it's it's not just a chip in the brain. It's six electrodes on the brain
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:38.840]  Oh with a cell phone transmitter behind the ear
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:43.640]  And then uh, he says that this is so ai can take you over
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:47.560]  So he says it won't happen right away, but the ai will take you over. That's a quote
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:52.520]  And he's been starting next year. They won't just have tesla kiosk at all the malls
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:58.120]  Uh, we can see a tesla car. You can go in and they'll have a robot. I'm not kidding. There's video of this
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:02:59.880]  um
[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:03.160]  Go in through your skull and put these electrodes in your brain
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:06.280]  And it just takes an hour and then now you are a wire head
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:13.080]  And so i'm asking are they on super hardcore drugs because they're sweating their eyes are just let me like they are on
[03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:19.000]  Yeah, the bastard might do this alex alex. Let me let me interrupt you. Uh, look, I know you're a god guy
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:24.120]  I know you falter as I do but uh, this sounds like the mark of the beast the micro chipping of all humanity
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:28.600]  This is frightening and then and then you and I have talked about my trip into the jungles of costa rica
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:32.680]  With a team of doctors. I wouldn't do without doctors and I did it with nurses
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:38.520]  I mean, I had the money to do it right. I did ayahuasca and I saw some of the clockwork elves and other things that these guys are into
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:42.600]  Uh, maybe they're tapping other dimensions. Um with these drugs
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:45.160]  Uh, I mean, I'm I've just opened up
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:49.240]  About four hours worth of talk for you. But uh, any thoughts on what I just said
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.200]  Well, that is exactly what they say they're doing and again, I was told this back when I was a kid
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:04:00.200]  Because my mom had a friend who uh worked for a private corporation that was really the cia
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:03.800]  And they had a psychedelic research institute in san francisco
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:10.920]  That was doing ivy drips of ayahuasca and they were going in and mapping these other dimensions that communicating with these aliens
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:14.200]  And so that's why when you went uh to where you went and did it
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:20.280]  You notice you all had a group hallucination. You saw them come from the edge of the forest. Yeah, you all saw it together
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:27.080]  Well, that's what that's called piercing the veil that all ancient religions understood
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:31.560]  There's a veil that keeps you from seeing the spirit world and that's what mark corny
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:34.520]  Who was the founder of the michigan militia?
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:39.240]  I used to go on his show 25 years ago and I thought he was a little wild. He said alex
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:44.440]  They're satanists. They've given over their souls folks. We're gonna be right back on the side to finish this up
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:46.440]  Then mike adams is taking over
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:52.120]  I'm back. It's tomorrow and then tonight. We've got coverage of the debates at 7 p.m.
[03:04:52.200 --> 03:04:55.960]  Kicking off live and continuous coverage before I started working at info wars
[03:04:56.040 --> 03:04:59.480]  I was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars dot com
[03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:03.080]  But also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product
[03:05:03.480 --> 03:05:06.280]  That's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite
[03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:09.560]  Of the supplements and that's dna force plus now
[03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:13.000]  I remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.760]  tele mirrors and tele mirror support with your dna
[03:05:17.080 --> 03:05:21.880]  And so I started to look into the science and what tele mirrors were and how it can improve
[03:05:22.200 --> 03:05:25.640]  Your health and longevity when you protect your tele mirrors
[03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:29.000]  So I started looking into dna force plus, but it's expensive
[03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:37.400]  Why because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for tele mirror support
[03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:42.120]  And they came and they went but dna force plus is still there
[03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:44.120]  It is the elite supplement
[03:05:44.120 --> 03:05:47.800]  I get excited when dna force plus is on sale because I know it's expensive
[03:05:47.800 --> 03:05:53.720]  So you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com
[03:05:59.720 --> 03:06:05.400]  Once at the bottom of the globalist rabbit hole child sacrifice, here's my report with man cow this morning
[03:06:06.120 --> 03:06:09.320]  They've given over their souls. He'd say look at janet reno
[03:06:09.320 --> 03:06:15.080]  He has shark eyes. I remember when I saw her and per a person that you can give a speech
[03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:18.040]  I actually confronted her and asked about the mass murder at waco a few years later
[03:06:18.680 --> 03:06:22.440]  Um, I remember being up close. I was in the front row like 15 feet from her
[03:06:22.440 --> 03:06:27.320]  And I remember her looking under the she was in lights. I remember looking and going there's no pupil
[03:06:27.640 --> 03:06:31.880]  It's pure shark eyes. So I haven't heard shark eyes since mark cornji said it
[03:06:31.960 --> 03:06:37.640]  You just finished the pieces earlier. Wow. He said they're soulless. They have shark eyes and cornji said
[03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:42.120]  When they're demon possessed and have gone over the veil, they don't need drugs
[03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:46.840]  They don't need wires that they are fully gone when you're totally demon possessed. Okay
[03:06:47.640 --> 03:06:51.800]  Alex jones, uh, michael jackson. I spent several days with michael jackson
[03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:56.520]  I before any of the pedophilia stuff came out. He was absolutely brilliant
[03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:58.680]  I met him a year later
[03:06:58.680 --> 03:07:02.440]  At a gavin convention that my producer loved cheese ran in san francisco
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.600]  And he remembered everything from a year earlier
[03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:08.600]  Well, wouldn't you think that I would remember more about the conversation to michael jackson not so
[03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:12.600]  But his eyes were like that. They were absolutely he had a charisma
[03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:15.080]  But his eyes were absolutely death
[03:07:15.880 --> 03:07:19.320]  It was uh, and I couldn't stop looking at him. Uh, and again, he was
[03:07:20.120 --> 03:07:22.120]  There was nothing bad about him in the news
[03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:25.080]  Uh, I just remember thinking the eyes are dead
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:27.480]  They're dead
[03:07:27.480 --> 03:07:30.760]  Alex has told me many things and I used to laugh them laugh at him
[03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:34.840]  Uh, I would make fun of him and then some of these things many of them came to pass
[03:07:34.840 --> 03:07:39.720]  I used to talk about the bluffs that were spying on us that you couldn't see they were so high up in the sky
[03:07:40.760 --> 03:07:45.000]  And uh, I just thought it was the funniest damn knee slapper cheese. Do you remember this? Yeah
[03:07:45.640 --> 03:07:49.480]  Come on. There's a network of bluffs so far up. We can't see them
[03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:55.800]  And then one crash and the government had to admit. Yeah, there's a network of bluffs all over so far up that we can't see them
[03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:57.800]  And they watch everything that we do
[03:07:57.800 --> 03:08:03.960]  Uh, I've also been on the sepsteam story for a long time and I used to chuckle it guys like alex and so many of you that would call me
[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:08.040]  And talk about pedophilia the royal family the vatican
[03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:10.920]  uh, children's stars
[03:08:10.920 --> 03:08:14.760]  Children's charities that are all about funneling children to rich
[03:08:15.640 --> 03:08:17.640]  child rapers
[03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:21.720]  And the satanic connection I I just thought it was the craziest thing
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:25.720]  And now it's true
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:27.720]  Epstein in the satanic temple
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:35.640]  Uh, I'm gonna ask alex jones about that next. This is the single biggest story on earth
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:41.320]  How biden is going to do tonight and all that it's all nonsense. It's all smokescreen. It doesn't matter
[03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:45.320]  There may be another gator in the lake. That's not the story
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:49.960]  The story is the rich and powerful both sides of the aisle
[03:08:51.800 --> 03:08:53.800]  Pedophilia
[03:08:53.800 --> 03:08:55.800]  Pedophilia and the satanic
[03:08:56.920 --> 03:08:58.920]  Connection
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:05.240]  That's next. I hope you can stay tuned. So alex jones, uh, you don't shy away from the controversial stuff
[03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:13.560]  What is the connection between all of these famous people the names? We've heard a supreme court justice and uh, and who else
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:19.240]  Stephen hawking and bill richardson and and top and clinton's of course and top democrats top republicans
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:21.640]  prince andrew is the name I've heard all
[03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:25.400]  Uh, the the catholic church children's charity sandusky
[03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:33.240]  What do they have and and that satanic temple with all the satanic art that epstein has what is the connection between rich
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:36.120]  pedophiles and satanism alex
[03:09:37.320 --> 03:09:39.320]  everyone knows that
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:41.400]  different mafias have different
[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:45.480]  Initiation rituals the crypts and blood you have to kill out of kripper blood
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:50.520]  Uh, and you know other gangs you got to go kill the innocent person the liquor store owner an old lady
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:53.080]  You have to do something bad. They have on you
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:57.000]  And so for thousands of years, you know, you read ancient text about how
[03:09:57.800 --> 03:10:00.520]  Certain corrupt societies would take over and the priest clash
[03:10:01.240 --> 03:10:06.520]  In every culture from the Aztecs to the ancient Babylonians. It happened everywhere would demand
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:13.080]  Children be sacrificed. I mean it's in every book of the bible. They talk about child sacrifice. Yes. Yes
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:15.880]  So this is history. And so what's happening is
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:18.600]  it is a spiritual vampirism
[03:10:18.600 --> 03:10:24.760]  Where they are stealing the energy and innocence of the children, but that's only step one
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:29.800]  That's how you get in the club is that you have to rape small children
[03:10:30.360 --> 03:10:34.520]  They start them out at 16 then it's 12 year olds and it's 10 year olds then it's five year olds
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:37.880]  And then you're strangling and murdering two year olds
[03:10:37.880 --> 03:10:42.680]  That's their favorite because they beg for mommy and are just in total horror and they will torture small child
[03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:45.240]  Up to three days until they use them up is what they call it
[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:48.840]  This has come out when psychopaths do this and the psychopaths always say
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:56.040]  Oh, actually, I do this for Satan Satan tortures me. I'm only happy when I'm torturing a tied up woman or a small child
[03:10:56.520 --> 03:10:58.120]  and then when I
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:03.720]  And then I use them up so they're the demon in them is psychically draining the energy
[03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:06.840]  And so we we hear the legends of vampires in every culture
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:12.120]  It's not that the vampire is real and lives forever. It's that the demonic spirit
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:16.520]  Uh, like the avatar like the movie avatar is jacking into the human body
[03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:22.600]  And it is interdimensionally sucking the energy out of the children. Now. This is what they believe. This isn't what
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:26.840]  I'm saying. This is what they believe and Elon Musk has taken them
[03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:30.440]  Taken the drugs. He's been part of these groups. Yeah, I don't I must say he's hurt kids
[03:11:30.680 --> 03:11:34.840]  But he's told people even in the Joe Rogan podcast that it's interdimensional
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:37.560]  Interdimensional demons are such the energy of children
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:43.560]  And he warned people about it and they tried to crash his company and then now he's come out and endorsed brain chieftain
[03:11:43.800 --> 03:11:46.600]  And world government. So that's what this is is Epstein
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:50.040]  Was an intelligence agency multinational
[03:11:51.080 --> 03:11:57.080]  Groomer who would bring people in for initiation. They knew they were being videotaped on the aircraft
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:01.720]  They knew they were being videotaped at the temple. Sure. And then the final initiation
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:04.360]  Uh is strangling children to death
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:10.120]  Hot dogs or little boys slices of pizza or little girls. Is that right?
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:15.320]  Yeah, cheese pizza just means child porn and that's in all the wiki leaks and so
[03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:19.720]  Uh, we covered that and they then spun it with some pizza place that we didn't even talk about
[03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:23.960]  Which was innocent so that the media would say, oh, look, there's no child pornography
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:30.760]  There's no spirit cooking and then they created that whole canard that. Oh, there's no pedophilia. It's all made up by alex jones
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:38.040]  They created a fake story. Yeah said that we were the ones reporting it kind of like remember how carl roe famously added
[03:12:39.480 --> 03:12:41.480]  Fake stuff in a dan rather's report
[03:12:41.880 --> 03:12:47.560]  About bush in the air national guard most of it was true that bush dodged the draft most of it was true that he was a bad
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:53.160]  Violet but they inserted fake documents into the real file to the discredit the rest of it
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:56.680]  Uh, man, um
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:13:01.880]  Brother there's so much in what you just said. It's uh, it's such horrific stuff and it is it's a dark energy
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:07.800]  They talked about it last night at uh at the democratic convention. It is a dark energy. It is a power
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:11.960]  Love and god and I believe christ beat it
[03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:17.320]  Christ wins. I've read the end of the book god wins good wins. It's tough for to stay on the good side
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:19.320]  I'm telling you it isn't easy
[03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:25.480]  Uh, but these people have taken the easy route and they do have uh money and power and fame in this
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:28.920]  lifetime, but boy, do they have to pay for it for an eternity
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:33.080]  I loved all the mainstream people looking at epstein's pedophile island
[03:13:33.640 --> 03:13:35.640]  Where clinton liked to hang out?
[03:13:36.120 --> 03:13:40.120]  And I don't believe that bill clinton's a pedophile by the way, I do think in my opinion
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:46.120]  He was dating the pimp that that rounded up the children the woman that lives in one of the trump buildings
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:49.080]  Thanks. He lives in trump tower in new york, but uh, uh
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:54.760]  You should see the artwork. I mean, it's all for satan. It's all demonic and and yeah, yeah
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:14:01.080]  Yeah, it's uh, it's also what a honey a honey trap. They call it. It's like the godfather where they blackmail that politician
[03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:04.840]  They get you in there. You want to go to the next level? There's the kid do it
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:07.640]  and um, but they're also
[03:14:08.600 --> 03:14:10.600]  Doing it for dark reasons
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:14.760]  Eyes wide shut is what these if you've ever seen the movie eyes wide shut. That's what these parties are like
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:17.640]  and um
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:24.920]  Yeah, it's it's all interconnected the giant owl. What's the owl that they worshiped the the demonic thing? Well, there's the goat head
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:31.560]  The goat headed figure. What else where else are they getting it's scalar waves? Listen, and how do you fight this dark energy?
[03:14:32.120 --> 03:14:36.440]  It's it's all scalar waves. It's so and I don't know how to explain it in the stupid radio show
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:43.560]  But you you can fight back with prayer. You can fight evil forces coming against you with prayer
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:50.280]  Uh, yes, they they use demonic things. Uh, but and it's an energy, but you can use a good energy
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:56.600]  Uh, Alex, I'm out of time. I got a break. Do you want to wrap it up for me? Put a nice little bow on it
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:01.880]  Well, man, tell I think you just put a bow on it and everybody knows there's good and evil
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:07.080]  Uh, the church has been taken over that's what people turned away from it because the devil's taken control of most the churches
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:09.800]  But you just said it there is dark energy. There is light energy
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:16.200]  There is god and there is the devil and children represent the potential of the universe and the potential of the human destiny
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:19.800]  And that's why satan wants to destroy that more than anything. That's what we must
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:25.080]  Check the children like christ said better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the ocean
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:26.520]  And to hurt one of mine
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:30.760]  And so you've said it we're covering it all at info wars dot com and news wars dot com

[03:20:28.520 --> 03:20:32.120]  London puts up signs telling islamicists don't defecate in the streets
[03:20:33.160 --> 03:20:38.040]  When you import the third world or the old world and don't encourage them to adopt the west
[03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:42.040]  Well, you get signs going up in london telling people not to crap in the streets
[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:46.600]  That's right ladies and gentlemen. We have signs up at the gas stations here in texas saying
[03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:49.960]  Put the toilet paper in the toilet not in the corner
[03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:51.960]  And they're calling those racists
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:58.120]  So this is what's happening ladies and gentlemen the suicide of the west mike Adams takes over the rest of the hour

[03:21:10.360 --> 03:21:15.640]  But tonight the long nights are out for joe biden mike Adams says two giant breaking stories at naturalnews.com
[03:21:15.640 --> 03:21:22.520]  Please spread the articles also in video at a link that isn't a censored clown world.us. We've got the
[03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:29.800]  Houston airport dumping sewage reportedly right into the gulf of mexico and we have glibis satan beer mike Adams takes over
[03:21:31.240 --> 03:21:36.440]  Thank you. Alex is great great to join you here today. Yeah, I've got an exclusive story breaking it right here on your show
[03:21:36.680 --> 03:21:41.400]  The article is not up yet on this. This is an exclusive info wars a breaking story
[03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:48.600]  The international airport in houston texas and we have confirmed now through our sources is dumping raw sewage
[03:21:49.240 --> 03:21:53.400]  Directly into the storm drains going into the gulf of mexico
[03:21:53.800 --> 03:22:00.840]  And this is raw sewage that is siphoned off the airplanes that arrive into houston from all over the world
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:02.200]  so
[03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:07.160]  You know how san francisco, of course is flushing raw human feces of san francisco
[03:22:07.720 --> 03:22:09.640]  into the san francisco bay
[03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:13.960]  But in houston texas the houston international airport again just to confirm
[03:22:14.680 --> 03:22:18.680]  Is dumping the raw feces of people from all over the world
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:21.160]  Into the storm drains
[03:22:21.640 --> 03:22:29.640]  Which are flushed directly into the gulf of mexico no wonder we have record cases in texas louisiana mississippi and florida flesh eating bacteria
[03:22:30.680 --> 03:22:36.120]  Yeah, exactly. This is exactly why it contaminates all the beaches along the entire gulf of mexico
[03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:43.720]  Now regulations of the city of houston require this airport waste, which is, you know, raw human feces
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:47.400]  Feminine hygiene products whatever you could imagine that people might flush
[03:22:48.040 --> 03:22:52.600]  Toilet on an international flight which could include, you know illicit drugs to whatever
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:58.120]  All of this is supposed to go into the sewage treatment system of the city of houston
[03:22:58.440 --> 03:23:03.480]  Instead it is being dumped directly into the storm drains. Well, this is intriguing. I appreciate you breaking this here
[03:23:03.480 --> 03:23:06.920]  I know you're meticulous with your sources. I'm gonna shut up now, but I'll be watching
[03:23:07.400 --> 03:23:11.080]  You I guess you obviously got sources confirming this is going on. This is wild
[03:23:12.600 --> 03:23:14.600]  Yeah, this is
[03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:20.040]  These are aware of this inside the airport and they are completely freaking out about it
[03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:25.560]  The media has not covered this no one has covered this story. That's why this is an exclusive for infowars
[03:23:25.560 --> 03:23:30.200]  So I guess they pull over you know, they pump it out in the trucks and then I guess they just go to a gutter and dump it in
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:36.920]  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening right these these trucks. They they come up to the airplanes after the planes land
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:44.840]  They siphon off all of the toilet waste and then they're they're supposed to take it and process it and dump it into the sewage system
[03:23:45.640 --> 03:23:50.600]  The city sewage system which has some treatment, of course, but instead they're dumping it into the storm drains
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:56.440]  And just like in san francisco and los angeles storm drains are not treated sewage systems
[03:23:56.440 --> 03:24:00.360]  So when those go out of local creeks, you name it. So bottom line here
[03:24:01.080 --> 03:24:07.480]  International bio waste is coming in obviously whoever's managing this the company that's doing it is cutting a corner
[03:24:07.880 --> 03:24:11.960]  And they're dumping it right into the storm drains. This is outrageous
[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:18.840]  Yes, and look, you know, alex. I've lived in south america. I lived in ecuador. I've lived in asia
[03:24:19.160 --> 03:24:24.040]  I've lived in third world countries and I've toured third world countries. I've seen extreme poverty
[03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:30.840]  I've never seen anything as insane as what I'm describing here with the houston international airport
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.320]  And also what's happening in the streets of san francisco
[03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:39.400]  It is beneath a third world country what liberals have done to their liberal cities in california
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:41.640]  Houston's one of the most liberal cities in the country
[03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:45.560]  They're they're they look at pedophiles that lead child events at public schools there
[03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:49.560]  And everywhere they go, they just cut out the basic services and they keep the money
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:56.120]  In fact, I was told by homeland security in a private meeting and others that houston now openly is a major pedophile destination
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:24:58.680]  It's been legalized there by the folks running things
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:01.080]  Well, i'm not surprised
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:05.400]  But here's the upshot of all of this alex if we want to save the environment
[03:25:05.800 --> 03:25:11.640]  We have to defeat democrats and put conservatives in charge because conservatives will
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:19.000]  Practice conservation of how does how does marianne wiliamson say trumps the one that caused flint?
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:23.080]  No, it's it's insane. You look at the liberal policies
[03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:29.080]  They're the one polluting the beaches and covering beaches with filth and feces to the point where we're going to have now the rise of
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:34.120]  Bubonic plague in los angeles even according to dr. Drew recently the celebrity doctor
[03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:37.080]  That's right, and you've got the rise of other diseases e. Coli
[03:25:37.080 --> 03:25:41.640]  And even cholera is likely to make a comeback in places like california
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:44.840]  And now even the beaches in texas because think about it
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:49.800]  You take the raw human sewage of people flying in from south america or flying in from europe
[03:25:50.200 --> 03:25:53.400]  Or even from asia direct flights to houston they go through customs there
[03:25:53.880 --> 03:25:57.160]  And that all that feces is being dumped directly into the gulf of me
[03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:01.160]  Oh, i won't go to the northern gulf of mexico or the northern part of texas
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:06.440]  The last time i was there i had a tiny cut on my leg and i got flush eating bacteria
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:11.960]  And it got inside and when i went the doctor finally pus was pouring out a week later. They said you could lose your whole leg
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:19.880]  Yeah, absolutely. It's not safe because of these practices and then we're we're lectured every day by democrats who say
[03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:26.440]  Oh, trump is destroying the world really have you democrats looked at your own filth infested rat infested
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:33.240]  Cities have you looked at the environmental impact of allowing people to just literally crap all over the streets of san francisco
[03:26:33.240 --> 03:26:39.640]  And have that flushed into the ocean. Have you looked at the level of e-coli and human feces on the beaches of california?
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:45.480]  I mean, it's it's the perfect metaphor for what liberals do to their cities. They destroy everything they run
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:49.640]  They do not because they siphon all the the services money office since you mentioned it
[03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:55.080]  Here's a lot of comings a decade ago saying that baltimore is infested, but now that's able to say
[03:26:56.360 --> 03:26:58.200]  morning
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:27:05.800]  I left my community of baltimore a drug infested area where a lot of the drugs that we're talking about today
[03:27:07.320 --> 03:27:10.360]  Have already taken the lives of so many children
[03:27:11.720 --> 03:27:14.200]  The same children that I watched
[03:27:15.400 --> 03:27:17.880]  14 or 15 years ago as they grew up
[03:27:19.320 --> 03:27:22.360]  Now walking around like zombies. This is only 40
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:25.880]  That's everything trump says. I said 10 years ago. That's 20 years ago. My god
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:28.280]  If you take over but I mean you're spying on about this
[03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:31.080]  Well, I've got another breaking story to cover here too
[03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:37.320]  I will go into detail on the other side of this upcoming break, which is the media hoax about glyphosate and beer
[03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:41.400]  Turns out alex check this out. You would have to drink. We did the math. We did the test
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:48.280]  You would have to drink 41 000 liters of beer to have the same level of exposure as just dropping a few drops
[03:27:48.600 --> 03:27:50.600]  Of glyphosate concentrate on your skin
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:51.800]  So
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:56.440]  The beer is a great distraction is a oats in your beer. Don't worry. It's you know, somebody also want my beer
[03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:02.280]  Yeah, it's probably it's we we've we've released the results. It's really not in your beer
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:08.120]  We tested 26 popular beers. We found almost zero glyphosate in all the beers
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:13.720]  And again, we did the math you'd have to drink 41 000 liters of beer to have the same exposure
[03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:17.720]  As so they're baiting and switching with this huge ruling against them
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:23.240]  Uh, exactly exactly. I'm going to give you the details to your audience here on the other side of this coming break

[03:31:58.680 --> 03:32:05.000]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades
[03:32:05.080 --> 03:32:05.960]  And because of that
[03:32:05.960 --> 03:32:11.400]  That's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members of
[03:32:11.400 --> 03:32:16.040]  The public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social political economic consequence
[03:32:16.040 --> 03:32:19.800]  To their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never change and they will become the big tech
[03:32:19.880 --> 03:32:25.000]  Oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran american economy
[03:32:25.080 --> 03:32:30.680]  Almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames
[03:32:31.240 --> 03:32:38.920]  The light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:44.440]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections
[03:32:44.440 --> 03:32:47.800]  To try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[03:32:47.960 --> 03:32:53.720]  It's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what what you just saw
[03:32:57.000 --> 03:32:59.640]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:59.640 --> 03:33:01.640]  You
[03:33:13.400 --> 03:33:20.920]  Found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:30.040]  I want to emphasize how insane it is that we have confirmed again
[03:33:30.600 --> 03:33:36.440]  That the international airport in houston texas is dumping raw sewage into the storm drains
[03:33:36.920 --> 03:33:38.920]  That empty into the Gulf of mexico
[03:33:39.480 --> 03:33:45.560]  And we have it from a number of high-level sources with security access
[03:33:46.440 --> 03:33:48.440]  There in the airport on the tarmac
[03:33:48.440 --> 03:33:55.080]  And what we're asking for those of you who are listening who may work at the houston airport. This is the iah
[03:33:55.640 --> 03:33:59.560]  International airport. I think it's called the george bush intercontinental airport
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:04.680]  We need some photos of what's happening
[03:34:05.080 --> 03:34:11.080]  And so if you are on the ground there and you have any ability to get additional photos
[03:34:11.640 --> 03:34:15.160]  That we can add to our sources that are confirming this
[03:34:15.160 --> 03:34:21.800]  This could be a huge bombshell breaking story. So if you work at that airport and can
[03:34:22.440 --> 03:34:27.960]  Take photos there without risking your job, which may be difficult. Maybe impossible
[03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:34.760]  We need your help to blow the lid on this story and stop the mass pollution of the Gulf of mexico
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:40.840]  This explains why there's so much feces on the beaches of texas
[03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:45.080]  Beaches all around the Gulf of mexico. This will be impacting beaches
[03:34:45.560 --> 03:34:51.640]  In louisiana and even the west coast of florida to some extent and of course parts of mexico as well
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:54.200]  This practice must be stopped
[03:34:54.600 --> 03:35:00.600]  The media is not reporting this. There is there's zero coverage from any other source. This is exclusively here
[03:35:01.160 --> 03:35:06.040]  Mike Adams bringing you this news from info wars dot com and it is real
[03:35:06.040 --> 03:35:11.160]  It is happening and it must be stopped and it shows the ecological devastation
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:17.880]  That's being allowed to take place by liberal cities with liberal mayors all across our country
[03:35:18.280 --> 03:35:22.520]  And you ask why is baltimore collapsing? Why is san francisco collapsing?
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:24.840]  And why is it overrun with human feces?
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:32.040]  Why is los angeles overrun with homelessness and seattle overrun with drug addiction and homelessness and and also
[03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:36.840]  So filthy conditions on the streets. It's because liberals they promote these policies
[03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:43.880]  Liberals destroy the environment because they allow feces to just run rampant across their cities
[03:35:44.200 --> 03:35:50.760]  Across their oceans and across their beaches and this is exactly what's happening and it has arrived in texas
[03:35:51.240 --> 03:35:55.160]  So i'm i'm curious to see what other evidence comes out about this
[03:35:55.960 --> 03:35:59.400]  Because i know for a fact that many other people are very much aware of this problem
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:05.080]  But there has been a very concerted effort to try to keep the lid on this problem with the houston
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:09.560]  The iah international airport. Uh, they are
[03:36:10.200 --> 03:36:12.920]  Again, what's happening is they're taking a shortcut
[03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:17.960]  It's easier to just dump all that sewage into the storm drains rather than put it into the correct location
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:24.040]  Which is the city sewage treatment system. So for whatever reason the workers they there's a big truck there
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:31.160]  They siphon off all of the feces in this truck and this truck has a grinder in it and it's supposed to grind up all of this sewage
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:34.680]  Into you know more of a homogenized
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:40.040]  You know sewage liquid and so these trucks are just dumping it into storm drinks. That's what's happening
[03:36:40.520 --> 03:36:46.680]  All right now moving on to the next story here another exclusive we have i have covered this
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:50.280]  On natural news, but you will only hear this from the independent media
[03:36:50.280 --> 03:36:57.720]  Glyphazate in beer the media is running a massive hoax about glyphazate concentrations in beer
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:02.040]  The media is trying to scare you to tell you that if you drink beer you're going to be
[03:37:02.840 --> 03:37:05.080]  harmed or even given cancer by glyphazate
[03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:07.960]  So they will report
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:11.240]  That beer has tested positive for glyphazate
[03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:16.200]  Well, i'm here to tell you as a practicing food scientist running an accredited laboratory
[03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:22.040]  That the term testing positive for glyphazate is scientifically meaningless doesn't mean anything
[03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:25.880]  Because if you just have one molecule of glyphazate then it tests positive for it
[03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:28.120]  What matters is the concentration
[03:37:28.280 --> 03:37:35.560]  And we purchased 26 off the shelf beer products all the popular beers that you can think of plus some other
[03:37:35.960 --> 03:37:37.960]  Sort of off the wall beers
[03:37:38.360 --> 03:37:41.480]  And we tested them for glyphazate using a triple quad mass spec instrument
[03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:44.280]  It's chromatography combined with mass spectrometer
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:46.280]  In our lab
[03:37:46.360 --> 03:37:50.360]  And we have published the results now in in the article that's on natural news
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:55.800]  Those results show that most of the beers have zero or near zero glyphazate
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:38:00.840]  And the highest level we found is only 10 parts per billion actually 10.08
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:07.400]  That is a nanogram per milliliter if you're curious about the correct units a nanogram
[03:38:07.400 --> 03:38:13.560]  Is a billionth of a gram and a milliliter, you know, it's about 20 drops roughly 20 drops of a liquid
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:18.200]  So we're talking about 10 billions of a gram in a few drops
[03:38:18.680 --> 03:38:21.880]  That is so low that most food scientists would consider to be zero
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:28.200]  And yet the mainstream media is trying to scare you into thinking that it's unsafe to drink beer because of glyphazate contamination
[03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:33.160]  I've been outspoken about glyphazate as a toxic cancer causing weed killer
[03:38:33.480 --> 03:38:36.520]  And it is if you drink it or you get a lot of it on your skin
[03:38:36.520 --> 03:38:41.560]  But we did the math on beer and glyphazate and it turns out
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:47.720]  You'd have to drink 41 000 liters of beer to get the same amount of glyphazate exposure
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:52.200]  That you would experience from spilling just one milliliter on your skin
[03:38:52.760 --> 03:39:00.440]  Of a glyphazate concentrate weed killer product that you might purchase at a farm supply store or you know like home depot
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:05.160]  Or wherever you go by lawn care or groundskeeping types of weed killer
[03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:10.920]  So your number one exposure to glyphazate is going to be if you're using it to spray weeds
[03:39:11.320 --> 03:39:15.880]  Around your house or lawn or if schools are using it as they do around
[03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:18.440]  playgrounds for children
[03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:20.440]  Or cities are using it in city parks
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:25.000]  But drinking beer will expose you to virtually zero
[03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:26.920]  glyphazate
[03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:30.680]  And again, we tested 26 beers which is statistically significant
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:35.000]  We did not find any level of glyphazate that would even be considered non zero
[03:39:35.720 --> 03:39:40.360]  That's that's what's amazing about this is all all the glyphazate that we found is basically zero
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:47.080]  So the media once again is lying to you about this issue. They're trying to alert you
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:53.000]  Even as those journalists are scientifically illiterate. They don't know what they're talking about. They have no idea
[03:39:53.240 --> 03:39:57.320]  Oh, yeah, they're showing right now for those of you watching and showing my video in the lab
[03:39:57.320 --> 03:40:04.040]  Where we I walk you through this with our triple quad mass spec instrument testing all the beers looking at the results and
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:08.040]  concluding that there's no there's no problem from beer
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:10.040]  so
[03:40:10.040 --> 03:40:14.920]  We are going to be investigating orange juice and we're going to be investigating wine and some other products as well
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:20.680]  But I suspect strongly right now that we're going to find roughly the same conclusion here
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:27.240]  Which is that there are not levels of glyphazate in these products that would pass any long-term health risk to you
[03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:29.480]  So instead of being afraid
[03:40:30.280 --> 03:40:36.600]  Of glyphazate in beer. Just have a beer. Just enjoy a beer on a friday. Wave the american flag
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:43.080]  Drink a beer, you know salute our veterans and don't freak out because the media is trying to scare you to death about everything
[03:40:43.080 --> 03:40:45.080]  Which is the way the media operates
[03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:50.680]  Uh, but also don't use glyphazate as a weed killer around your house. That's where you're going to get all the exposure
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:57.640]  And in fact, if you look at the court cases where monsanto has been found to be complicit in causing cancer in people
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:02.920]  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That's because of topical exposure on their skin
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:05.400]  That's where you get the big exposure
[03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:10.760]  And so I just say all this because I want you to be informed about this. Of course, I support organic
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:15.800]  Products, of course, I support avoiding pesticides and avoiding glyphazate
[03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:21.080]  But I also support honesty and integrity in science and I don't want you to be artificially
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:27.000]  Made to fear something when there's no risk involved in it. And that's what the media is doing
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:31.480]  Same way the media tries to scare all these leftists about russians everywhere
[03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:36.920]  Where they try to say there are concentration camps on the border. That's the same media that says oh
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:40.520]  Take your vaccine shots because mercury is safe. They say but then
[03:41:41.320 --> 03:41:46.440]  A few picograms or nanograms of glyphazate. They say might kill you. That's it's absurd
[03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:50.680]  You're not going to die from the glyphazate in beer
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:54.680]  Now sure you might die from trying to drink 41 000 liters of beer
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:59.800]  If you're trying to match that number and you're doing that on a friday night, you know
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:05.880]  You might kill yourself with cirrhosis of the liver or drunk driving or what have you so of course drink responsibly
[03:42:05.880 --> 03:42:09.000]  If you do drink but you're not going to die from the glyphazate in beer
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:15.240]  That's I mean aren't you glad that we're doing this lab science the FDA is not doing this the EPA isn't doing this
[03:42:15.480 --> 03:42:18.680]  The federal government with all its funding is not doing this science
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:21.880]  We're doing it without using a dime of taxpayer money
[03:42:22.280 --> 03:42:27.240]  Sharing the results here with you for free publicly right here on info wars.com natural news
[03:42:27.480 --> 03:42:30.280]  This is what we do science in the public interest
[03:42:30.920 --> 03:42:34.520]  So I've got more stories ahead on the other side of this
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:41.720]  Stay with us. We'll be right back after this coming break with more analysis of california's election fraud
[03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:47.400]  And much more straight ahead you're watching the info wars alex jones show. We'll be right back
[03:42:52.760 --> 03:42:54.920]  Before I started working at info wars
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  I was not only a fan of alex jones and enforce.com, but also the products at info wars store.com
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:05.240]  And there's one product that's offered at info wars store.com that is the elite
[03:43:05.800 --> 03:43:08.520]  Of the supplements and that's dna force plus now
[03:43:08.520 --> 03:43:11.960]  I remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:15.720]  telomeres and telomeres support with your dna
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:22.760]  And so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity
[03:43:23.160 --> 03:43:27.960]  When you protect your telomeres, so I started looking into dna force plus, but it's expensive
[03:43:27.960 --> 03:43:36.360]  Why because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomeres support
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:42.680]  And they came and they went but dna force plus is still there. It is the elite supplement
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:46.680]  I get excited when dna force plus is on sale because I know it's expensive
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:52.680]  So you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at infowar store.com

[03:43:56.120 --> 03:43:58.520]  But I still need my morning coffee

[03:44:50.200 --> 03:44:52.200]  Um
[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:55.560]  It's happening now
[03:44:55.560 --> 03:44:56.600]  Right now
[03:44:56.600 --> 03:45:03.320]  All over the world humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist globalist world government mark of the beast agenda
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:09.080]  And the forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear info wars more than ever
[03:45:09.640 --> 03:45:12.280]  Well, we're doing a special 40 hour broadcast
[03:45:12.760 --> 03:45:16.280]  To get new projects we've developed up and into orbit
[03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:18.920]  And to take action at the next level
[03:45:18.920 --> 03:45:25.000]  The globalists now we've already devastated them and they hope that you don't take action because when you support info wars
[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:26.680]  You change the world
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:31.160]  Find coverage at clown world dot us and at info wars dot com forward slash show

[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:41.640]  That's happening right now and spread the word because that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech sensors
[03:45:41.640 --> 03:45:48.760]  Again info wars dot com forward slash show our clown world dot us. Please take action
[03:45:54.040 --> 03:45:59.400]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[03:45:59.960 --> 03:46:02.440]  And so used to it wasn't that important to wear the american flag
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:06.840]  Because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it
[03:46:06.840 --> 03:46:11.880]  But now they're trying to take it out of schools. They're taking it down off of government buildings
[03:46:12.360 --> 03:46:17.320]  Weird white leftist that when a virtue singular pulling down american flags and running up mexican flags
[03:46:17.880 --> 03:46:20.280]  This is the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing
[03:46:20.760 --> 03:46:27.080]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american flag
[03:46:27.160 --> 03:46:32.120]  Particularly the betsy ross anti slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back
[03:46:32.120 --> 03:46:36.280]  Right there ladies and gentlemen america's back info wars dot com
[03:46:36.840 --> 03:46:41.800]  So whatever you do take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face
[03:46:42.120 --> 03:46:47.640]  All over not just the u.s. But worldwide because more than ever the american flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism
[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:59.240]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:21.960]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones and now your host mike adams
[03:47:21.960 --> 03:47:32.440]  In the greatest hypocrisy moment of the debates last night democrat candidate marianne williamson called for a quote moral uprising
[03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:34.840]  To defeat trump
[03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:40.840]  Apparently she is not at all aware that her party the democrat party is the party of satanism
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:49.160]  Infanticide the murder of human children that her party is the party of immorality election fraud
[03:47:49.160 --> 03:47:56.360]  censorship taking away the human right of freedom of speech that her party is the party of
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:48:04.440]  Transgenderism indoctrination of children drag queen story our brainwashing of children the chemical castration
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:11.400]  Of children to change their gender and every other sicko twisted wicked demonic satanic
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:14.440]  violation of morality that you can imagine
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:22.920]  Apparently she has no clue she should be calling for a moral uprising to defeat the radical left and their satanism
[03:48:23.320 --> 03:48:30.760]  And their incredible immorality. In fact, I would agree with the premise that we do need a moral uprising in america
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:33.400]  But it would defeat the radical left
[03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:37.800]  It wouldn't defeat trump. Are you kidding me trump would support
[03:48:37.800 --> 03:48:47.560]  A return of morality to america. We need to have a moral uprising to stop the netflix indoctrination of children with sicko
[03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:49.720]  teenage
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:55.720]  Orgy scenes that are now broadcast by netflix and even amazon prime while they ban
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:49:04.120]  Documentaries that expose the truth about vaccines or the truth about gmo's to think about the real morality issues in this country
[03:49:04.120 --> 03:49:09.880]  A country that at least for the radical left part has embraced satanism and communism
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:13.240]  And they want to lecture us about morality. Give me a break
[03:49:13.880 --> 03:49:15.880]  Speaking of california
[03:49:16.120 --> 03:49:20.360]  Now there are many wonderful californians listening to this show right now
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:26.280]  Many of you are patriots. Many of you are very sickened by what's happening to your state and we get that
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:30.120]  And yet I think you would agree that we've reached a point
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:38.280]  Where california now trying to remove president trump from ballot in fact according to reports governor newson is
[03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:44.680]  That bill into law and I believe it would remove president trump from the at least the primaries
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:49.240]  Maybe an attempt to remove him from the general election in 2020
[03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:52.520]  If that's true, this is such a violation of law
[03:49:52.520 --> 03:49:59.480]  It's total fraud on the part of california legislature and the governor that I think it's time that we the american people
[03:49:59.480 --> 03:50:05.640]  Call for california's electoral college votes to be removed from the nationwide tally
[03:50:06.040 --> 03:50:11.080]  If they won't let people vote for president trump, then well their electoral college shouldn't count
[03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:17.080]  In fact, there are so many illegals voting in california with the really the permission
[03:50:17.640 --> 03:50:24.200]  Of the governor and the advocacy of state lawmakers that we really have to probably
[03:50:24.200 --> 03:50:32.520]  Nullify california's senators and members of congress because they were illegally voted into office by illegal aliens
[03:50:32.840 --> 03:50:37.160]  Who should never have the right to vote in u.s elections, but it would be right
[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:46.840]  Fraudulently by the con artist politicians who run the state of california even as the good people of california stand opposed to that corruption
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:52.200]  So we need to really rethink if they're going to play this kind of game and say well trump can't be on the ballot
[03:50:52.200 --> 03:50:58.840]  They're trying to de-platform trump from the election and you see the game. They're playing is then they'll say well gosh
[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:04.680]  Trump didn't win the national popular vote. He didn't get any votes in california. That's amazing
[03:51:04.760 --> 03:51:11.400]  So the other candidate won the popular vote and then they'll try to invoke the national popular vote compact to say well
[03:51:11.720 --> 03:51:13.160]  Trump should lose the election
[03:51:13.160 --> 03:51:18.200]  He didn't win the national popular vote and they'll try to have the other states rig their electoral votes
[03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:25.080]  To give trump a defeat and put whoever the democrat candidate is into office whoever that may be
[03:51:25.720 --> 03:51:31.240]  Probably elizabeth warren or kamala harris is my guess with a wild card. Maybe
[03:51:32.120 --> 03:51:35.720]  michelle obama jumps into the race at the very last minute because
[03:51:36.360 --> 03:51:42.040]  It will be realized that no one else can beat trump in any case. That's that's a wild card a scenario. We'll see what happens
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:47.080]  But the truth is that liberals and radical democrats will not play by the rules
[03:51:47.080 --> 03:51:49.480]  They will always commit fraud
[03:51:50.680 --> 03:51:53.560]  Now one final thought for this show today
[03:51:54.680 --> 03:51:55.480]  liberalism
[03:51:55.480 --> 03:51:57.480]  Functions like a cancer tumor
[03:51:57.960 --> 03:51:59.960]  I want to explain something
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:03.400]  You may not be familiar with the term angiogenesis
[03:52:03.960 --> 03:52:06.440]  The term used in physiology and oncology
[03:52:06.440 --> 03:52:09.880]  It means when a cancer tumor builds new blood supply to itself
[03:52:10.120 --> 03:52:16.040]  The syphon off resources from the rest of the host so that it the tumor can grow bigger and bigger and bigger
[03:52:16.040 --> 03:52:18.760]  And cause more damage and destroy more things
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:21.320]  This is exactly how liberalism works
[03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:28.840]  Liberalism wants to raise taxes and syphon off resources from the rest of the country while growing its tumor like
[03:52:29.640 --> 03:52:32.600]  authoritarian tyranny and censorship and
[03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:42.280]  horrifically bad economic policies that lead to for example feces rolling in the streets of san francisco and feces all over the beaches of texas
[03:52:42.680 --> 03:52:44.680]  and california as well
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:46.520]  Liberalism is a tumor
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:53.400]  But it functions through a process of angiogenesis. That is stealing more resources to grow itself and make itself bigger
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:52:58.840]  We the people are the immune system of america. We're the immune system
[03:52:59.560 --> 03:53:03.880]  We are the cells that are supposed to run around and stop the tumors from getting bigger
[03:53:04.440 --> 03:53:10.680]  We're supposed to cut off the supply of resources to the tumors so that the tumors don't kill the host in other words
[03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:17.560]  So that liberalism doesn't destroy america, which is exactly what it's trying to do. You could even say communism is like a cancer tumor
[03:53:17.880 --> 03:53:19.640]  you know communism
[03:53:19.640 --> 03:53:24.840]  Will destroy our country if we allow it to continue to expand its influence
[03:53:25.400 --> 03:53:31.800]  So think about you and think about also the second amendment rights of the american people
[03:53:31.960 --> 03:53:39.080]  Why did the founding fathers grant the american people the power and the right to defend your nation
[03:53:39.080 --> 03:53:45.640]  Against all enemies foreign and domestic. Why was the second amendment written as the second amendment?
[03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:48.440]  Not the ninth or tenth. It's the second amendment
[03:53:48.760 --> 03:53:53.000]  It's the second most important right after freedom of speech freedom of religious expression and so on
[03:53:53.480 --> 03:53:55.720]  because the second amendment is
[03:53:56.360 --> 03:53:59.160]  the people's immune system against tyranny
[03:53:59.960 --> 03:54:03.000]  and note that the same people in california
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:10.200]  Gavin Newsom and others who are absolutely trying to rig the election to steal this democracy to overthrow the presidency
[03:54:10.360 --> 03:54:13.560]  And to destroy this country. Those are the very same people
[03:54:14.040 --> 03:54:16.280]  Who are trying to take away your second amendment rights?
[03:54:17.080 --> 03:54:18.920]  All over the country now even in florida
[03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:24.520]  We're seeing these bureaucrats trying to say that an ar-15 is not needed for self-defense
[03:54:25.240 --> 03:54:28.920]  They're saying that ar-15s are weapons of war which is nonsense
[03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:31.880]  And by the way an ar-15 is a great self-defense weapon
[03:54:31.880 --> 03:54:35.960]  I would certainly like a 30 round magazine if someone breaks into my home
[03:54:36.360 --> 03:54:42.680]  In fact, I wouldn't mind a 60 round magazine in that ar and an ar-15 gives you some range
[03:54:42.840 --> 03:54:45.800]  You could put rounds down range with accuracy
[03:54:46.600 --> 03:54:52.360]  300 400 yards even with an ar and you can't do that with a shotgun and you can't do that with a pistol
[03:54:52.760 --> 03:54:54.920]  So an ar-15 is a great self-defense weapon
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:54:59.400]  Which is exactly why the cancer tumor democrats are trying to take it away from everybody
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:03.800]  And why do you think what do you think they have in mind after they take your weapons away?
[03:55:04.120 --> 03:55:06.120]  After they take away your first amendment rights
[03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:13.960]  After they criminalize Christianity and and bibles and de-platform you and rig the election and take away your guns
[03:55:14.280 --> 03:55:16.600]  What do you think happens next? Of course?
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:26.040]  Well, I gotta say it. It's just like the Maoist revolution the cultural revolution mass executions of the political enemies of the left
[03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:32.280]  They will run door to door town to town county to county. They will try to execute Christians
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:34.280]  They will try to execute Trump supporters
[03:55:34.280 --> 03:55:37.320]  They will try to execute anybody who is unwilling to turn in their guns
[03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:42.600]  If they can take your guns first and disarm you and that makes their their invasion
[03:55:43.080 --> 03:55:49.160]  Makes their fraud makes their cancer tumor like activity so much easier to carry out and that is why
[03:55:49.880 --> 03:55:52.520]  I urge all of you all across the country
[03:55:52.520 --> 03:55:56.920]  Even if your state passes a law that says you can't own an ar-15
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:04.520]  Guess what a higher law the constitution of the united states the bill of rights says that you can own that ar-15
[03:56:04.920 --> 03:56:07.800]  And that's based on divine law the law of god
[03:56:07.960 --> 03:56:11.720]  Which says that you have a divine right to defend yourself against tyranny
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:16.840]  A divine right to defend your nation against these enemies and a divine right to defend
[03:56:16.840 --> 03:56:22.360]  Your families and your communities against the onslaught communism socialism authoritarian
[03:56:22.920 --> 03:56:28.840]  authoritarian tyranny that's being pushed by the radical left which functions as a giant deadly cancer tumor
[03:56:29.320 --> 03:56:35.800]  Trying to overtake this body. You are america's immune system be prepared to activate your immunology
[03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:38.680]  So to speak so that you can defend this country

[03:58:47.080 --> 03:58:49.800]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air
[03:58:49.880 --> 03:58:52.120]  I talked to a lot of people here out in new york city
[03:58:52.120 --> 03:58:55.880]  And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars
[03:58:55.960 --> 03:59:01.800]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way
[03:59:01.800 --> 03:59:05.400]  That they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[03:59:05.480 --> 03:59:08.680]  That's it. I mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency
[03:59:08.680 --> 03:59:11.400]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[03:59:11.400 --> 03:59:12.760]  It's a time to be praying my friend
[03:59:12.840 --> 03:59:16.840]  I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say alex is I know they're trying to shut you down
[03:59:16.840 --> 03:59:21.880]  But the reinforcements have arrived man. I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old
[03:59:21.880 --> 03:59:25.400]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80, but if they do shut you down
[03:59:25.560 --> 03:59:27.160]  No, you've gone into this war
[03:59:27.240 --> 03:59:33.080]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue
