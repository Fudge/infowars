[00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:06.895]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:08.676]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:10.437]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:12.017]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:13.938]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:17.739]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.801]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:26.816]  It's Tuesday, December 21st, 2010.
[00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:29.917]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:32.058]  I'll be your host for the first hour.
[00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:36.940]  Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:47.345]  Of course, Alex is taking a well-deserved break, but we've got some excellent on-court presentation interviews coming up in the second and third hours with
[00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.828]  John Young of Krypton talking about Wikileaks, of course.
[00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:56.431]  Professor Donald Light, as well as Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.713]  That's in the final two hours of the broadcast today.
[00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:03.655]  But in this first hour, we're going to be taking your calls at 800-259-9231, so get them lined up.
[00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:31.708]  And, uh, basically you heard yesterday about how threat fusion centres across the country were basically recording and databasing your every email, phone conversation, instant message, and every little tattletale report that the local busybody provides to the authorities for them, of course, to hunt for terrorists.
[00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:36.495]  And of course, we know precisely who those terrorists are.
[00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:44.570]  But if we didn't, then Attorney General Eric Holder was gracious enough to remind us today when speaking to ABC News.
[00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.252]  Play the clip.
[00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:50.788]  Terrorist attack here at home has also been the top priority of officials in the United States.
[00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:57.672]  So we want to bring in our senior justice correspondent, Pierre Thomas, who just sat down for an exclusive interview with Attorney General Eric Holder.
[00:01:57.672 --> 00:02:03.935]  And Pierre, the Attorney General is a pretty circumspect man, but on this subject, he doesn't seem to be pulling any punches.
[00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:13.861]  George, I've known and covered the Attorney General more than a decade, and I can tell you, he was remarkably candid and quite blunt about the relentless nature of the terror threat the U.S.
[00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:14.441]  is combating.
[00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:17.465]  What keeps you up at night?
[00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.468]  The concern that perhaps we might have missed something.
[00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:21.789]  The threat is real.
[00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:23.570]  The threat is different.
[00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.811]  The threat is constant.
[00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:29.555]  In a rare interview, the Attorney General laid out the most pressing terror threats.
[00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:32.758]  Dangers, he said, that are more diverse and increasing.
[00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:37.582]  Among them, the new rapidly evolving threat posed by homegrown radicals.
[00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:42.646]  The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here
[00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:50.711]  To worrying about people in the United States, American citizens, raised here, born here.
[00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.753]  You didn't worry about this even two years ago.
[00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:58.537]  In the last 18 months, at least 50 Americans... That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:58.537 --> 00:03:05.342]  Obama, Holder, and Big Sis have identified the terrorists, and you knew it, you are one of them.
[00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:07.003]  And if you doubt
[00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:12.787]  That you've now been identified as a terrorist by the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:29.800]  And we've compiled at PrisonPlanet.com a handy list of behaviors, actions or interests that anti-terror agencies and other federal and state authorities have all identified as signs of terrorism.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.742]  And this is the behavior that the
[00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:44.826]  Local starzy informant Tattletail is being encouraged to report as suspicious activity under the See Something Say Something campaign.
[00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:51.407]  Now, we've heard about the fusion centres, we've heard about the Washington Post, the Top Secret America.
[00:03:53.522 --> 00:04:00.652]  And now, we really begin to see who is being defined as the domestic terrorist.
[00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:02.194]  We've compiled this handy list.
[00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:06.981]  Now, under the MIAC report, the following things are all signs of terrorism.
[00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:09.545]  See if you can relate any of these to yourself.
[00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:19.331]  Displaying bumper stickers and other paraphernalia associated with the constitutional campaign for liberty and libertarian parties.
[00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:24.034]  That, according to the Mayak Report, is a sign of domestic terror.
[00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:25.915]  Supporting Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:28.496]  You're a possible terrorist.
[00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:32.978]  Supporting former presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin, another sign of terror.
[00:04:32.978 --> 00:04:35.920]  Supporting former congressman Bob Barr.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.842]  Opposing the implementation of a North American union.
[00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:41.303]  Owning gold bullion.
[00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:45.346]  Displaying historical US flags.
[00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:47.829]  And of course, opposing abortion.
[00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:52.514]  All under the Mike report, signs of being a suspected terrorist.
[00:04:52.514 --> 00:04:59.140]  And this is the information that is now going to these federal fusion centres to identify you as the new Al-Qaeda's.
[00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:02.745]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:06.108]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:08:04.198 --> 00:08:06.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.733 --> 00:08:14.956]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, December 21st.
[00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:34.205]  Well, Attorney General Eric Holder has identified people born and raised in America as the primary terror threat, and just before the break we were running through a list of definitions contained in state and federal literature of what characterizes a suspected terrorist.
[00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:36.907]  Now of course, supporting Congressman Ron Paul,
[00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:45.354]  Owning gold bullion, flying historical US flags, all indications that you are a suspected terrorist.
[00:08:45.354 --> 00:08:47.937]  And that was out of the MIAC report.
[00:08:47.937 --> 00:08:50.459]  This is in their own literature.
[00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:53.401]  Joint Terrorism Task Force document released.
[00:08:54.651 --> 00:09:09.368]  A couple of years before the Mayak Report, being interested in animal rights, being a lone individual, making numerous references to the US Constitution, refusing to identify yourself to an authority figure, all
[00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:13.011]  are signs of potential terrorism.
[00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:18.255]  I'm sure you're starting to fit into one of these categories if you haven't already.
[00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:21.418]  Now it gets even more out of hand.
[00:09:21.418 --> 00:09:27.022]  This is a Texas Department of Public Safety criminal law enforcement pamphlet.
[00:09:27.022 --> 00:09:29.584]  This came out in 2006.
[00:09:29.584 --> 00:09:38.392]  Now listen to the following behaviors, actions or interests that are also potential signs of being a domestic terrorist.
[00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:50.718]  This is the behaviour that will get you put in one of these centralised federal fusion centres that they're now admitting contain every shred of data about the American people.
[00:09:50.718 --> 00:09:51.198]  Right.
[00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:56.861]  These are definitions of being a suspected terrorist, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.
[00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:58.862]  Being a nice guy!
[00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:00.022]  That's right!
[00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:02.123]  Terrorists are nice guys too!
[00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:03.964]  So, being a nice guy.
[00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:05.925]  That's a direct quote, by the way.
[00:10:05.925 --> 00:10:06.706]  Nice guy.
[00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:10.369]  is a sign of a potential terrorist, okay?
[00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:15.214]  Wearing Levi jeans, also a sign of being a potential terrorist.
[00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:20.280]  You can probably, um, start to see yourself fitting into some of these categories.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:27.447]  Communicating predominantly by cell phone, email or text message is a sign of suspected terrorism.
[00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:32.572]  And wait for it, looking normal in appearance.
[00:10:32.572 --> 00:10:45.243]  That's right, the Texas Department of Public Safety, in its own document, specifically lists looking normal in appearance as a possible sign of being a domestic terrorist.
[00:10:47.045 --> 00:11:12.359]  Now of course we've had other similar documents, such as the Virginia Training Manual, which lists being a property right activist, trying to influence government or social policy, or even, quote, undermining confidence in the government, which basically means not joining this bandwagon of government cult worship, all according to state and federal authorities, signs of domestic terror.
[00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:16.361]  So when Attorney General Eric Holder says that the threat is homegrown,
[00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:20.223]  From people born and raised in America.
[00:11:20.223 --> 00:11:23.644]  This is the list of definitions that he is working off.
[00:11:23.644 --> 00:11:29.787]  This is being communicated out to law enforcement, to these federal fusion threat centers.
[00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:35.210]  This is what Big Sis is encouraging the Stasi Informant Society to pick up on.
[00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:46.655]  See something, say something, and, uh, you know, if you've got a map, if you use binoculars, scuba equipment is listed in one of these documents.
[00:11:46.655 --> 00:11:50.838]  All this is suspicious activity now, uh, in the new America.
[00:11:51.698 --> 00:12:00.726]  Now, of course, we have the FBI training 10,000 garbage collectors across the country to look for this exact kind of suspicious behaviour.
[00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:16.479]  And now, according to Peter King, this is on InfoWars.com, soon to be chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, questioning the official story of 9-11 is, quote, a vile remark and could make you subject to investigation.
[00:12:17.594 --> 00:12:33.933]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is why, as the FBI is busy entrapping all those mentally deficient Muslim patsies by directly giving them the explosives and then arresting them, and labelling it an ominous sign of the terror threat,
[00:12:34.634 --> 00:12:52.217]  Homeland Security, big sis, is fighting the terrorists by spying on Tea Party groups, you know, liberals, conservatives, anti-drilling activists, Second Amendment groups, and even state reps as we recently saw in Pennsylvania.
[00:12:52.217 --> 00:13:02.679]  So the real threat has been identified as politically aware Americans who actually try to exercise their constitutional rights, and failing that, even worse,
[00:13:03.359 --> 00:13:12.746]  You know, nice guys who appear normal are also now domestic terrorists according to these state and federal documents and literature.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:27.688]  And let's not forget that the Department of Defense lists low-level terrorism in their own documents, lists protest, I should say, as low-level terrorism in their own documents.
[00:13:27.688 --> 00:13:37.194]  So, directly identifying any organization, any demonstration, any political protest as an act of low-level terrorism.
[00:13:37.194 --> 00:13:38.535]  This is the new definition.
[00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:49.089]  These are the signs that people will be reporting on under Big Sis' new See Something Say Something campaign.
[00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:54.511]  And what's the outcome of this starzy informant society that they're now creating?
[00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:58.632]  Well, we're starting to find out, Associated Press today.
[00:13:58.632 --> 00:13:59.272]  Headline!
[00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:00.412]  Police!
[00:14:00.412 --> 00:14:03.433]  Flyer wrongly accuses Philly man in deaths!
[00:14:04.648 --> 00:14:08.153]  Uh, some locals had some grudge against this man.
[00:14:08.153 --> 00:14:18.246]  So they, uh, plastered up his photo, his name and address on a flyer, accusing him of being behind all these rapes and murders in the area.
[00:14:18.246 --> 00:14:20.969]  Again, precisely as I was talking about yesterday.
[00:14:22.314 --> 00:14:33.598]  The very thing that's being encouraged by government, and it's exactly what happened in Nazi Germany and Soviet-controlled East Germany, the tattletale tips are completely useless.
[00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:36.559]  They've got nothing to do with security.
[00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:48.804]  This is about self-serving people who have been brainwashed to feed on each other, turning in their neighbour for something they didn't do, you know, merely just to get even.
[00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:58.487]  And it harks back to Robert Galately's Florida University study which we also briefly mentioned yesterday.
[00:14:58.487 --> 00:15:10.456]  People did it for reasons of personal grandeur, for career prospects, there was even one example of somebody who lived with another couple and they were
[00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:15.221]  Not the cleanest individuals when using a shared bathroom.
[00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:21.688]  So they reported them to the local Gestapo as being, you know, a political subversive and they were carted off to the work camp.
[00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:36.798]  And now we're starting to see this filter into America where people are reporting their neighbours for rapes and murders which they had nothing to do with, simply to get back at them for a grudge.
[00:15:36.798 --> 00:15:38.880]  So it's already unfolding.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:52.189]  And all this information that they report, remember, is being sent directly to these federal fusion threat centres where they then use it to identify suspected terrorists.
[00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:53.230]  And what's the purpose?
[00:15:55.566 --> 00:16:08.189]  It's to make Americans rigidly conform their behaviour, their every action, everything they say, to what's expected of them by their rulers.
[00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:13.610]  You know, if you don't get on the bandwagon of government cult worship, then you will be reported on by your neighbours.
[00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.211]  That's the fear they're trying to instil.
[00:16:16.462 --> 00:16:27.866]  You know, you will not exercise any of your constitutional rights, you will not own firearms, you'll not speak out against the state, and you will not organize a demonstration or protest.
[00:16:27.866 --> 00:16:30.467]  It's about chilling free speech.
[00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:39.691]  It's got nothing to do with the terrorist patsies that the FBI gives the bombs to and then says, look, they were going to conduct a bombing after we gave them the explosives.
[00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:51.039]  So it's about creating this chilling atmosphere, this environment where everyone is petrified of big sis knocking at the door.
[00:16:51.039 --> 00:17:08.384]  It's about Americans becoming obsessed about every potential minor transgression, scared that their neighbor might misconstrue their behavior as suspicious and inform on them as the
[00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:15.566]  Message from Janet Napolitano, Big Sis Plays at the Walmart Checkout Report.
[00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:17.467]  Suspicious activity.
[00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:23.348]  Again, the nature of that activity is never defined in the message.
[00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:39.192]  But then you look at the information that's being put out by these authorities, and it's Ron Paul supporters owning gold bullion, organising a political rally, organising a meeting, just any behaviour whatsoever, even banal things.
[00:17:40.287 --> 00:17:43.009]  The Texas Department of Public Safety, you know.
[00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:47.853]  Being a nice guy, they say, is a potential sign of terror.
[00:17:47.853 --> 00:17:53.498]  Appearing normal in the way you dress, your appearance, potential sign of terror.
[00:17:53.498 --> 00:17:56.500]  So it's a catch net to include everyone.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.062]  It's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:17:59.062 --> 00:18:07.229]  And when everybody's a terrorist, then they can use that justification to collect information about the entire population.
[00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:24.439]  So it's about creating this fear factor, where people are afraid to exercise their rights for fear that it would be misconstrued as terror, now that everything, every political activity has been characterized as potential terrorism.
[00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:28.182]  So what's, you know, what's the solution?
[00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:29.202]  Well, as the old
[00:18:30.223 --> 00:18:34.266]  Cheesy saying goes, you know, feel the fear and do it anyway.
[00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:51.799]  I mean, the only way you can combat a flagrant attempt to carry out what is an end run around the Bill of Rights by making people afraid to exercise those rights is just to exercise them more strongly and proudly than ever before.
[00:18:53.499 --> 00:19:04.568]  And because we've become so fractured as a society, and people are trained to be suspicious of one another, then they're exploiting that
[00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:11.917]  To its maximum degree, to try and make people not exercise their rights for fear that that might happen.
[00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:19.764]  That their neighbour might become one of the local tattletales under this big cis Stasi campaign.
[00:19:19.764 --> 00:19:29.754]  So you've just got to explain to people, you've got to explain to your friends and neighbours that distrust of government is the highest form of patriotism.
[00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.398]  You know, they've tried to define it as a mental disorder.
[00:19:34.398 --> 00:19:38.961]  Now they're trying to define it as a sign of potential terrorism.
[00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:44.805]  But the fact is that the only terrorists are a government that would try to destroy dissent.
[00:19:44.805 --> 00:19:47.787]  Because that's what the Founding Fathers embraced.
[00:19:47.787 --> 00:19:55.172]  And now they're trying to destroy everything that America stands for under this onslaught against the Constitution.
[00:19:55.172 --> 00:19:56.613]  We'll be back with The Ukul.
[00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:57.194]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:05.540]  Part world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.501]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.

[00:20:31.025 --> 00:20:32.266]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:36.829]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.829 --> 00:20:42.633]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:42.633 --> 00:20:46.275]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:46.275 --> 00:20:48.997]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:54.060]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.301]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.301 --> 00:20:55.702]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.045 --> 00:21:04.009]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:04.009 --> 00:21:08.153]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:21:08.153 --> 00:21:10.436]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:15.601]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:17.403]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:17.403 --> 00:21:18.725]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.427]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:20.427 --> 00:21:23.790]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.175]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:29.175 --> 00:21:38.524]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:21:38.524 --> 00:21:40.846]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:43.689 --> 00:21:47.171]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:51.074]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.074 --> 00:21:53.115]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[00:21:53.115 --> 00:21:53.255]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:02.741]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:05.043]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:05.043 --> 00:22:08.265]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:13.369]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.369 --> 00:22:17.573]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.873 --> 00:22:20.214]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:23.095]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:23.095 --> 00:22:26.017]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:26.017 --> 00:22:33.620]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:33.962 --> 00:22:39.346]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.346 --> 00:22:42.208]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:42.208 --> 00:22:45.891]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.891 --> 00:22:46.972]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:46.972 --> 00:22:48.312]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.312 --> 00:22:49.794]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:08.902 --> 00:23:10.222]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:13.163]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:13.163 --> 00:23:17.125]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:21.086]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:21.246 --> 00:23:22.087]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:26.052]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:32.459]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:32.459 --> 00:23:36.023]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:35.123]  So, how does it feel to be characterised as a terrorist by your own government for merely engaging in a political demonstration or organising a rally, or worse yet,
[00:24:36.127 --> 00:24:55.134]  Merely engaging in banal behaviour like using a large amount of cash, or wearing Levi jeans, or God forbid, appearing normal and being a nice guy, which is now a sign of being a terrorist, apparently, according to Big Sis and the Federal and State Fusion Threat Centres.
[00:24:55.134 --> 00:24:57.875]  800-259-9231 will be going to your calls in the next segment.
[00:25:02.938 --> 00:25:23.606]  Now, running parallel to this new purge against the American people by trying to define everyone as an Al-Qaeda member, we've got them trying to craft this new version of the Espionage Act to identify people who use the internet to criticise government as traitors and spies, and now of course today
[00:25:24.406 --> 00:25:37.549]  Jenna Chowski at the FCC is about to pass this so-called net neutrality bill which will basically turn the internet into a cable TV style controlled and regulated domain.
[00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:43.170]  And you know it's just like they called it the Patriot Act when it was the most unpatriotic thing imaginable.
[00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.791]  This is the exact opposite of net neutrality.
[00:25:47.711 --> 00:26:04.403]  And as Senator Al Franken writes on an article which we posted today at PrisonPlanet.com, quote, mobile networks like AT&T and Verizon Wireless would be able to shut off your access to content or applications for any reason.
[00:26:04.403 --> 00:26:13.150]  For instance, Verizon could prevent you from accessing Google Maps on your phone, forcing you to use their own mapping program, Verizon Navigator.
[00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.593]  Even if it costs money to use and isn't nearly as good.
[00:26:17.593 --> 00:26:29.642]  Or a mobile provider with a political agenda could prevent you from downloading an app that connects you with the Obama campaign, or for that matter, a Tea Party group in your area.
[00:26:30.402 --> 00:26:32.683]  It gets worse, writes Franken.
[00:26:32.683 --> 00:26:37.984]  The FCC has never before explicitly allowed discrimination on the internet.
[00:26:37.984 --> 00:26:52.428]  But the draft order takes a step backwards, merely stating that so-called paid prioritisation, the creation of a fast lane for big corporations who can afford to pay for it, is cause for concern.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:06.045]  Now in the name of protecting net neutrality, Jenna Chowsky at the FCC is personally calling up the CEOs of these top corporations to craft this bill.
[00:27:06.045 --> 00:27:10.507]  So it's just like Obamacare being written by the insurance companies.
[00:27:10.507 --> 00:27:19.671]  You know, the very corporations that these rules about the internet are supposed to curtail are being written by the same corporations.
[00:27:21.471 --> 00:27:28.814]  And basically it gives major internet backbone hubs the power to block access to websites they don't like.
[00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:33.836]  We've had a taste of it with things like Level 3 Communications.
[00:27:33.836 --> 00:27:41.200]  You know, if they fall out with one of the other backbone hubs, millions of people can't access Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:51.503]  This is what this new system will create because what they're doing is calling it net neutrality when it's the exact opposite.
[00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:55.344]  It will allow corporations to create fast lanes and slow lanes.
[00:27:55.344 --> 00:28:00.305]  It will allow them to block certain content that they don't want on their network.
[00:28:00.305 --> 00:28:07.427]  And so if this is really properly implemented, you can say bye-bye to Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[00:28:09.417 --> 00:28:19.003]  I mean, it's like going to a newsstand and expecting to see dozens of publications and newspapers to choose from and being met with only one or two.
[00:28:19.003 --> 00:28:23.606]  It's about controlling, restricting the flow of information.
[00:28:23.606 --> 00:28:27.709]  And of course, the first thing they're going to do is use it politically.
[00:28:29.113 --> 00:28:32.734]  And the vote on this is actually taking place right now.
[00:28:32.734 --> 00:28:35.075]  It might have already happened.
[00:28:35.075 --> 00:28:39.317]  There's an article on the website where you can get the phone number to call the FCC.
[00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:43.458]  But most people say that this is just going to sail through.
[00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:49.880]  And even the Liberals are screaming mad about it, calling Obama a sellout.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:57.743]  Because Obama campaigned on the fact that he would, quote, take a back seat to no one in his commitment to net neutrality.
[00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:26.698]  And now, as the Huffington Post is warning about, his FCC chairman, Jenna Chowski, is trying to spin this so-called net neutrality bill as mission accomplished, when, as the Huffington Post writes today, the reality is that reform is just a rhetorical front for industry compromises that reward the biggest players and K Street lobbyists while giving the public nothing.
[00:29:27.498 --> 00:29:30.259]  So the left, the right, everybody's aware of what's going on.
[00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:32.140]  The bomb has sold out again.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:40.804]  And the creation of this internet regulation control system that will drown out independent voices is sailing right through.
[00:29:40.804 --> 00:29:44.346]  We'll be talking about it after the break on the Alex Jones Show and going to your calls.
[00:29:44.346 --> 00:29:45.386]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:45.386 --> 00:29:51.389]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:52.790]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.291]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.302 --> 00:29:57.989]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.055 --> 00:30:04.897]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:30:04.897 --> 00:30:09.178]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:30:09.178 --> 00:30:14.260]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:19.823]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:19.823 --> 00:30:23.484]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:30:23.484 --> 00:30:26.765]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:35.140]  I'm looking for America.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.762]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:30:36.762 --> 00:30:39.365]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:39.365 --> 00:30:43.990]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.895]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:30:55.546 --> 00:31:00.753]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:31:00.753 --> 00:31:05.299]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:09.645]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:10.246]  Number two, our
[00:31:10.486 --> 00:31:15.367]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.367 --> 00:31:16.108]  It's true.
[00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:21.809]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:21.809 --> 00:31:25.410]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:30.111]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:30.111 --> 00:31:32.872]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.872 --> 00:31:36.213]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.553 --> 00:31:41.494]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.494 --> 00:31:46.536]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.536 --> 00:31:50.717]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.717 --> 00:31:52.497]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:01.479 --> 00:32:16.955]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.955 --> 00:32:20.639]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:21.638 --> 00:32:34.410]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:41.677]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:42.358 --> 00:32:52.727]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:52.727 --> 00:32:56.651]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:56.651 --> 00:32:59.774]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:26.674 --> 00:33:30.915]  Rome's suspected bomb could not explode, say police.
[00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:39.078]  A suspected explosive device found in an empty underground train carriage in Rome today could not have blown up because it lacked a detonator, police said.
[00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:44.383]  AFP reports UN evacuated over suspicious odour.
[00:33:44.383 --> 00:33:51.451]  The UN Security Council and General Assembly were evacuated Tuesday because of a suspicious odour, a spokesman said.
[00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:53.693]  And the hysteria continues.
[00:33:53.693 --> 00:34:01.341]  They particularly like to push it at this time of year when everybody's travelling, just to remind them of who their masters are.
[00:34:02.102 --> 00:34:03.624]  We'll be going to your calls in a minute.
[00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:15.199]  Briefly, I want to mention what we've got on offer at PrisonPlanet.tv because 2011 is going to be the launch of Alex's new TV show for members.
[00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:16.521]  Exclusively for members.
[00:34:17.782 --> 00:34:24.766]  And if you're not aware of it, PrisonPlanet.TV, it's really taken off in the past couple of months.
[00:34:24.766 --> 00:34:30.809]  People who are already members will tell you, and a lot of them post on the Prison Planet forum.
[00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:33.411]  We've just added a ton of new material.
[00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:37.033]  We're adding new videos several times a week.
[00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:40.575]  These are exclusive video interviews for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:34:41.515 --> 00:34:49.880]  Of course, you've got the daily audio and video archive streams which are posted first at PrisonPlanet.tv in full at the end of the show.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.383]  You've got searchable archives of every Alex Jones Show on there.
[00:34:55.383 --> 00:34:58.445]  Every Alex Jones movie, a plethora of others.
[00:35:00.046 --> 00:35:10.552]  And just go and look on the front page of PrisonPlanet.tv right now and just take a look at some of the excellent video interviews we've posted in the past few weeks.
[00:35:10.552 --> 00:35:17.717]  And I know that the information's powerful because I personally watched every single one of them, because I write articles about most of them.
[00:35:18.277 --> 00:35:23.522]  So we've got Alex Abella talking about the RAND Corporation, their agenda for World War 3.
[00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:35.432]  We've got clinical psychologist Bruce Levine talking about learned helplessness and how the establishment is trying to define distrust of authority as a mental disorder.
[00:35:35.432 --> 00:35:44.719]  We've got Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch talking about her research into what chemtrails contain and how they end up in our water supply.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.061]  And there's lots more.
[00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:49.283]  It's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:49.283 --> 00:35:57.549]  This is what funds the operation and it's still the same price as it was when we introduced it six and a half years ago.
[00:35:57.549 --> 00:36:06.517]  It's Â£5.95 a month and for a limited time you can get the equivalent of five months free by getting a yearly subscription for just Â£39.95.
[00:36:09.779 --> 00:36:15.121]  I really encourage people to take advantage of that, especially now when we've got the discount running.
[00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:17.742]  And that's prisonplanet.tv.
[00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:18.643]  Subscribe today.
[00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:21.464]  Okay, we're gonna go to the calls.
[00:36:21.464 --> 00:36:23.044]  First up, Julio in Illinois.
[00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:24.345]  Julio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:36:25.402 --> 00:36:32.369]  Hey Paul, Merry Christmas to you across the pond, and Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to all those freedom lovers worldwide.
[00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:41.918]  I knew last year as the CIA was getting set for their fake Christmas Day underwear bomber down in Amsterdam going to Detroit, that 2010 was going to be a pivotal year.
[00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:55.485]  I mean, as we've seen, it's turned out that way, and they're getting set for 2011 being one of the most crucial years in the coming of the second American Revolution and revolution worldwide.
[00:36:55.485 --> 00:37:02.228]  Quickly, you're talking about homeland security and calling us all domestic terrorists.
[00:37:02.228 --> 00:37:10.192]  I mean, what else are they going to say, knowing that we constantly, with your awesome work, your brother's awesome work, and everyone at InfoWars, and everyone worldwide,
[00:37:10.732 --> 00:37:24.726]  Revealing the truth, what else are these, you know, scum going to say, you know, other than, you know, pointing the finger at us and calling us domestic terrorists, saying that those who believe in the Constitution, those who are against global warming, you know, are right wing nuts.
[00:37:24.726 --> 00:37:25.587]  It's a quick trend.
[00:37:27.625 --> 00:37:32.889]  There's going to be man-made, you talk about man-made global warming all the time, what's going to happen this year?
[00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:33.969]  And this is what I mean.
[00:37:33.969 --> 00:37:43.075]  In terms of weather modification, I just recently landed on a new document from the National Intelligence Council, September 2010, Global Governance 2025.
[00:37:43.075 --> 00:37:46.438]  Paul, if you can look that up, it's crazy.
[00:37:46.438 --> 00:37:56.384]  Even on the cover, it shows the G20, and we've heard Herman Van Rompuy, European Union President, talk about global governance with the G20, established by the G20.
[00:37:57.305 --> 00:38:04.328]  It has the IMF, the International Monetary Fund right on the front, the United Nations right on the front.
[00:38:04.328 --> 00:38:10.910]  September 2010, and it talks about climate change as a way to bring about global government.
[00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:18.033]  Now, you talked about yesterday how in England, with, you know, the record snowstorm all around England and Europe, that, you know, they're blaming it on man.
[00:38:18.033 --> 00:38:22.255]  Yesterday on CNS News, I saw in the George report, Janet Napolitano's
[00:38:22.975 --> 00:38:26.236]  Having a Climate Change Council with the Coast Guard.
[00:38:26.236 --> 00:38:29.016]  We've seen Ready.gov all throughout the country.
[00:38:29.016 --> 00:38:31.517]  Bill Gates was at Bilderberg.
[00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:34.077]  Bill Gates has weather modification patents.
[00:38:34.077 --> 00:38:38.278]  There was the Owning the Weather in 2025 from the U.S.
[00:38:38.278 --> 00:38:39.418]  Army, U.S.
[00:38:39.418 --> 00:38:48.620]  Air Force War College white paper talking about how a weather modification weapon would be so powerful because no one would know if storms
[00:38:49.269 --> 00:38:52.251]  Were man-made or were they just natural occurrence?
[00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:57.115]  So I think 2011, as Lindsey Williams said, that we're going to be too poor to protest.
[00:38:57.699 --> 00:39:00.100]  With major storms, it damages infrastructure.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.721]  Of course, we the people, the peasants, the sheeple, are going to have to pay for this.
[00:39:03.721 --> 00:39:09.363]  So I think there is going to be man-made global warming in terms of weather modification.
[00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:19.166]  And another thing about the FCC, people need to know that the FCC, I'm a broadcasting major, the FCC has no regulations over cable, satellite, or the internet.
[00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:20.287]  Yet they say they can do this.
[00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:24.550]  And it boggles my mind that this is happening in Christmas.
[00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:35.761]  We remember 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act passing on Christmas Day, on Christmas Eve, you have the Obama death care bill passing last year, or a portion of it on Christmas Eve, and here we go again.
[00:39:35.761 --> 00:39:39.926]  We're right around Christmas, and what is the FCC and Big Brother talking about?
[00:39:39.926 --> 00:39:41.607]  Silencing the Internet.
[00:39:41.607 --> 00:39:44.911]  Paul, Merry Christmas to you, and Merry Christmas, and Happy Hanukkah to everybody.
[00:39:46.072 --> 00:39:47.373]  Thanks for the call.
[00:39:47.373 --> 00:39:49.334]  Yeah, I mean, it's a sneak attack.
[00:39:49.334 --> 00:40:00.459]  I mean, they just snuck through, the Senate did, on Sunday night, this so-called food safety bill, which is basically just a big agribusiness assault on local and small farmers.
[00:40:00.459 --> 00:40:08.502]  Anybody who has a turnover of more than a million dollars a year, not a profit, just a turnover, which includes anybody with, you know, 20 acres of land.
[00:40:10.003 --> 00:40:12.104]  They're gonna put them out of business, basically.
[00:40:12.104 --> 00:40:12.864]  That's what it's about.
[00:40:12.864 --> 00:40:15.385]  They snuck that through on Sunday night.
[00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:17.145]  Congress is set to vote on that.
[00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:21.187]  They'll probably try and get that done before Christmas when everybody's not watching.
[00:40:21.187 --> 00:40:23.227]  So again, criminals work in the dark.
[00:40:23.227 --> 00:40:27.168]  They like to sneak their evil deeds through the back door.
[00:40:27.168 --> 00:40:31.390]  And you were just talking about the UN approach to climate change.
[00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:45.382]  Global Governments 2025 and in fact we wrote an article a few months ago where the UN directly orders its alarmists and administrators to change the propaganda.
[00:40:45.382 --> 00:40:56.051]  They've been completely discredited on man-made global warming and climate change with Britain now experiencing its coldest December on record, record low temperatures.
[00:40:56.992 --> 00:41:04.056]  They've said we need to get out of this kind of rhetoric, we need to replace it with something else, something which seems more genuine.
[00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:15.103]  And they've resolved to replace the threat of climate change with the threat of overpopulation, which many, particularly statists and liberals, subscribe to.
[00:41:15.103 --> 00:41:25.128]  When in fact, as we have vehemently documented time after time, the UN Population Fund's own figures show that global population will
[00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:35.574]  Rise will peak at 9 billion in around 2050, after which it will rapidly fall.
[00:41:35.574 --> 00:41:42.038]  The global replacement rate for human beings is already below the level of 2 in Europe.
[00:41:42.038 --> 00:41:44.039]  We're already dying out.
[00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:51.643]  And in countries such as even India and Brazil, the replacement rate is slowly starting to come back into line.
[00:41:53.644 --> 00:42:02.392]  The only thing that will cause overpopulation is if you don't allow third world countries to develop, which of course is what the climate alarmists are all about.
[00:42:02.392 --> 00:42:09.498]  They want to keep the third world in poverty because of course becoming a developed nation means emitting CO2.
[00:42:09.498 --> 00:42:16.604]  As Lord Monckton, who is coming on in the third hour I believe, says many times, CO2 is the lifeblood of
[00:42:17.816 --> 00:42:19.097]  A developing country.
[00:42:19.097 --> 00:42:22.221]  You cannot develop without emitting CO2.
[00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.945]  And so they're going to try and restrict third world nations from doing that.
[00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:37.417]  But they've resolved to replace climate change with overpopulation because they know they've been completely discredited on man-made global warming, especially after Climategate.
[00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:46.184]  And the recent Cancun Summit, again, was a total failure, just as the Copenhagen one was before that.
[00:42:46.184 --> 00:42:48.125]  Greg in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:48.125 --> 00:42:52.528]  Hi Paul, thanks for taking my call.
[00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:53.609]  I just wanted to call in.
[00:42:53.609 --> 00:43:01.955]  The first thing I saw when I went on the internet today, I check NPR News a lot, just to see what the state is saying what's going on.
[00:43:03.604 --> 00:43:09.627]  Interesting article, first caught my eye, it says, Human Factor Provides Key Obstacles to Terrorism.
[00:43:09.627 --> 00:43:18.811]  Uh, this article is just talking about how the reason why all the plots in 2010 have fallen is because of, well, the people were idiots.
[00:43:18.811 --> 00:43:23.253]  And it mentions nothing of FCI involvement with any of them.
[00:43:23.253 --> 00:43:32.317]  Uh, it says, uh, here, um, there's an interesting quote, When you are trying to recruit individuals,
[00:43:32.748 --> 00:43:35.911]  You may not always get the individual you want.
[00:43:35.911 --> 00:43:40.074]  You may get the person who is most convenient.
[00:43:40.074 --> 00:43:49.621]  And, uh, that's almost like saying the FBI hasn't found a smart enough person to actually terrorize us enough yet.
[00:43:49.621 --> 00:43:50.502]  I don't know.
[00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:51.803]  I was hoping on your thoughts on that.
[00:43:53.846 --> 00:44:07.230]  Every single terror bust that has made big headlines in the news in the US or the UK has been either provocateured or directly created by the federal authorities.
[00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.991]  I mean you had this latest one where they directly gave him the bomb.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:25.983]  Uh, we posted a video a few days ago on PrisonPlanet.com and it was an Irish gentleman and he went, it's in the multimedia section if you want to go and watch it, and he went through every single case where it's deliberate entrapment every time.
[00:44:25.983 --> 00:44:31.265]  So they need to create these incidents, you know, they need to have dud bombs in Rome
[00:44:32.205 --> 00:44:39.110]  Like any self-respecting terrorist would plant a bomb without a detonator.
[00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:50.577]  They need to have strange odors in the UN building to create this hysteria to make everyone continue to buy into the terror threat, which of course is completely contrived.
[00:44:50.577 --> 00:44:54.800]  The Christmas Day bomber being the perfect example of that.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.202]  He was allowed to board the plane by order of the US State Department.
[00:44:58.202 --> 00:45:02.005]  That's never mentioned when we're getting propagandized about bodies
[00:45:02.005 --> 00:45:02.825]  We're good to go.
[00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:41.304]  They're loathe to mention the fact that he was meeting with Pentagon top brass after 9-11, months after 9-11, having been a so-called spiritual leader for the 9-11 hijackers and meeting directly with the ones who supposedly flew the plane into the Pentagon.
[00:45:42.245 --> 00:45:59.336]  He was dining with Pentagon top brass two months after 9-11 and now we're supposed to believe that he's the new grand boogeyman when he's behind all these terror plots, the Hassan shooting at Fort Hood, the Times Square fizzle bomb.
[00:45:59.336 --> 00:46:06.641]  Every single time he's been the patsy handler and he's a double agent as Tarpley has exhaustively documented.
[00:46:06.641 --> 00:46:08.923]  He's clearly working for the CIA.
[00:46:08.923 --> 00:46:10.604]  That's why he was at the Pentagon after 9-11.
[00:46:12.265 --> 00:46:25.111]  But, you know, they think that as long as they can throw these dud bombs in Rome at us and strange odours in the UN that they're going to keep the hysteria at a decent enough level to where people will just blindly accept all this.
[00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:33.954]  And again, it comes back to making people being afraid to express their constitutional rights because they fear that anything might be a sign of terrorism.
[00:46:33.954 --> 00:46:36.235]  So it's about chilling free speech and chilling
[00:46:37.876 --> 00:46:40.977]  The mere behaviour of a free person.
[00:46:40.977 --> 00:46:43.579]  They need you to behave like a slave.
[00:46:43.579 --> 00:46:45.199]  That's what they're trying to do.
[00:46:45.199 --> 00:46:59.706]  They're trying to enforce this subservience to government so that everybody needs to self-regulate their own behaviour and be a complete slave and be worried about having any independent thought or engaging in any criticism against the state.
[00:46:59.706 --> 00:47:03.548]  That's what it's all directed towards, as we spoke about yesterday.
[00:47:04.128 --> 00:47:19.504]  It's this psychological Berlin Wall that's being erected in the minds of people that they can't even imagine to escape across the other side for fear of being considered domestic extremists, as the Feds now call them.
[00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:21.687]  Thanks for the call, Greg.
[00:47:21.687 --> 00:47:23.829]  Braun in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:26.352]  Hi, yeah, good morning.
[00:47:27.619 --> 00:47:28.719]  I'm a loyalist.
[00:47:28.719 --> 00:47:30.680]  I'm glad you guys do this program.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:37.062]  I have kind of an abstract question, so forgive me if I wander a little bit.
[00:47:37.062 --> 00:47:41.403]  I don't watch a lot of TV anymore, just for the simple nature of the garbage that comes on.
[00:47:41.403 --> 00:47:44.985]  So what I do is, I sometimes look on YouTube at a lot of different videos.
[00:47:44.985 --> 00:47:50.346]  Now, I was watching a particular video, a fellow by the name of Taj Tariq Bey.
[00:47:50.346 --> 00:47:53.467]  He is a Moorish American.
[00:47:53.467 --> 00:47:56.048]  I don't know if you're familiar with the Moorish Empire.
[00:47:56.806 --> 00:47:59.048]  But he said something that really stuck out in my head.
[00:47:59.048 --> 00:48:03.932]  He mentioned, he talked a lot about Masonic science and cosmology.
[00:48:03.932 --> 00:48:16.241]  I'm not very well versed on it, so I won't get into any details, but he mentioned that something to do with Uranus and Saturn, as far as secrets being unveiled and things like that.
[00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:23.247]  Now the basic, the basic thought was that if the powers that be, you talk about Masons, Illuminati, whoever,
[00:48:23.675 --> 00:48:32.261]  If they're aware of all these Masonic Sciences that were actually created by the Moorish Empire, then they're very well aware of the timetable as well.
[00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:38.566]  So, you know, on here you speak about a lot of times they're speeding up their program, and he was saying the same thing.
[00:48:38.566 --> 00:48:41.728]  He was saying that basically the people are waking up too fast.
[00:48:41.728 --> 00:48:51.495]  And it's almost like you can see it in... Once you know what you're looking for, things start to stand out to you a little bit more.
[00:48:52.168 --> 00:48:57.792]  And in the same way that your brain is just subconsciously tuned into it a little bit better.
[00:48:57.792 --> 00:49:03.857]  So, I was wondering if you thought that... You talked about Lindsey Williams on here the other day.
[00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:08.101]  He was mentioning about oil spiking.
[00:49:08.101 --> 00:49:17.568]  Now, I watch the markets a lot, and I cannot envision a scenario where oil actually gets suppressed in any significant way.
[00:49:17.568 --> 00:49:19.389]  Right now, it's trading at about $89 a barrel.
[00:49:20.894 --> 00:49:27.916]  And I really think that that's going to be the one that squeezes really the whole world economy.
[00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:38.479]  And I wanted to know what you thought about that, whether you thought 2011 may be the year that they actually really speed it up and start to hit things a little bit harder.
[00:49:38.479 --> 00:49:40.760]  And I wanted to make a suggestion.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.341]  Maybe when Alex comes back in, you get him on here.
[00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:48.422]  If anyone wants to follow at home, his name is spelled T-A-J-T-A-R-I-K.
[00:49:51.670 --> 00:50:13.631]  You speak a lot about exactly what's going on, that they're trying to shield you from, and I thought maybe that would be a good connection, get him on here, kind of have Alex Jones talk to him a little bit more, some of the stuff can get figured out, because we're turning towards a really dangerous predicament right now.
[00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:15.978]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:50:15.978 --> 00:50:17.339]  We'll look into it.
[00:50:17.339 --> 00:50:23.403]  Send me an email, Watson at PrisonPlanet.com, and we'll look into getting him on as a guest.
[00:50:23.403 --> 00:50:42.638]  On the subject of oil, we all know that it went above $150 a barrel back in 2008, and that was primarily because of a decrepitly weak dollar, and of course the dollar's still got a long way to go down, but all currencies are now depreciating when compared to gold, so
[00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:47.764]  Oil at $89, I think it's got a lot higher to go, certainly in 2011.
[00:50:47.764 --> 00:50:58.437]  We'll be back after the break with your calls, Omar, Davey, and stay tuned, it's the Alex Jones Show live, PrisonPlanet.tv, don't go away.
[00:51:01.411 --> 00:51:02.711]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.711 --> 00:51:08.313]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:08.313 --> 00:51:13.315]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:13.315 --> 00:51:18.357]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:18.897 --> 00:51:24.121]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:24.121 --> 00:51:26.442]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:26.442 --> 00:51:31.245]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:31.245 --> 00:51:32.346]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:32.346 --> 00:51:35.428]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:35.428 --> 00:51:39.051]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:42.233]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:44.454]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:44.454 --> 00:51:45.375]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:49.017 --> 00:51:51.979]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:51.979 --> 00:51:58.083]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:58.083 --> 00:52:00.465]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.334]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.334 --> 00:52:09.597]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.597 --> 00:52:14.381]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:20.787]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.787 --> 00:52:23.010]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:23.850]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:24.110]  Bernanke?
[00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:24.731]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.731 --> 00:52:25.491]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.491 --> 00:52:27.812]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:44.600]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:49.725]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.725 --> 00:52:58.855]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.161 --> 00:53:05.845]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:53:05.845 --> 00:53:14.712]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey Water Filtration Systems.
[00:53:14.712 --> 00:53:28.603]  The Berkey Light Systems include a set of self-sterilizing and recleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:56.933]  No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes
[00:54:16.266 --> 00:54:21.850]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, December 21st.
[00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.751]  Alex will be back at the end of the week.
[00:54:23.751 --> 00:54:30.856]  We've got some great encore presentations coming up around Christmas, so I hope you'll take the time to tune into those.
[00:54:30.856 --> 00:54:32.557]  Alright, quick fire through the callers.
[00:54:32.557 --> 00:54:33.978]  Omar in Toronto, go ahead.
[00:54:33.978 --> 00:54:38.261]  Hey, Paul, how you making out with the global warming over there?
[00:54:39.508 --> 00:54:40.748]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:54:40.748 --> 00:54:44.290]  Just, uh, minus 26, you know, two feet of snow.
[00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:45.250]  We're enjoying it.
[00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:47.111]  All the flights cancelled.
[00:54:47.111 --> 00:54:48.051]  Yeah.
[00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:52.492]  Yeah, it's, uh... I guess we just need to pay Al Gore some more carbon taxes.
[00:54:52.492 --> 00:54:54.293]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[00:54:54.293 --> 00:54:57.834]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about this, you know, this culture of fear.
[00:54:57.834 --> 00:55:03.296]  I was at the airport when George Galloway came to town, and I wasn't really affiliated with any of the groups there.
[00:55:03.296 --> 00:55:06.337]  There was the anti-war and the pro-Palestinian groups.
[00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:08.598]  Nobody really wanted to talk to the media, so...
[00:55:09.264 --> 00:55:12.567]  You know, I had to sort of talk for them.
[00:55:12.567 --> 00:55:20.454]  I mean, I don't blame them, but it seems like, you know, people really are concerned about, you know, I mean, look at those people in Chicago.
[00:55:20.454 --> 00:55:26.199]  Uh, you know, FBI comes and kicks your door down just cause you're a peace activist.
[00:55:26.199 --> 00:55:36.668]  So I think, uh, I think some of it is, you know, working and we just have to keep, keep on, you know, just stand up and, and speak our minds because if not, uh,
[00:55:37.908 --> 00:55:40.789]  There was a story about Rachel Ray.
[00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:43.970]  I don't know if you've ever heard about it.
[00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:52.492]  She was wearing a Palestinian scarf in some commercial and they made them take the commercial down because she's wearing a scarf.
[00:55:52.492 --> 00:55:53.813]  It's just insane.
[00:55:53.813 --> 00:55:58.474]  The first thing I went out and did was bought myself a Palestinian scarf and I bought some for presents.
[00:55:59.614 --> 00:56:02.036]  Everybody should go out and buy a Palestinian scarf.
[00:56:02.036 --> 00:56:06.238]  Don't buy a pair of Levi jeans, though, because that means you're a terrorist.
[00:56:06.238 --> 00:56:09.280]  Don't act like a nice guy or appear normal.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:14.424]  According to the Texas Department of Health, that's a terrorist act.
[00:56:14.424 --> 00:56:15.985]  Thanks for the call, Omar.
[00:56:15.985 --> 00:56:17.325]  Dave in New York, go ahead.
[00:56:17.325 --> 00:56:20.407]  Hello?
[00:56:20.407 --> 00:56:23.449]  Yes, you're on the air, Dave.
[00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:25.471]  Well, I think my son's a terrorist.
[00:56:25.471 --> 00:56:27.032]  He's two years old and he appears normal.
[00:56:29.914 --> 00:56:34.836]  Yeah, I'm worried about him.
[00:56:34.836 --> 00:56:36.697]  But, uh, I just wanted to thank you guys.
[00:56:36.697 --> 00:56:41.219]  You know, I wear blue diamond gussets, Bayou Foods Direct.
[00:56:41.219 --> 00:56:41.559]  Terrorist.
[00:56:41.559 --> 00:56:43.319]  Terrorist.
[00:56:43.319 --> 00:56:45.480]  Silver.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.100]  Silver?
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.821]  Oh my God.
[00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:48.401]  I know.
[00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:50.762]  You probably fly a flag as well, don't you?
[00:56:50.762 --> 00:56:51.202]  I do, I do.
[00:56:51.202 --> 00:56:53.303]  Support Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:56:53.303 --> 00:56:54.364]  Oh my God, I got his books.
[00:56:56.047 --> 00:56:58.509]  Oh my god, terrorist literature.
[00:56:58.509 --> 00:56:59.229]  I know, I know.
[00:56:59.229 --> 00:57:01.090]  Call Big Sis.
[00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:06.393]  But, uh, yeah, I live right by the Niagara Falls Air Force Base.
[00:57:06.393 --> 00:57:10.196]  And, uh, I've noticed, you know, it increasing in size.
[00:57:10.196 --> 00:57:17.280]  But mainly, what I've been noticing, is there, uh, security police, what they call them, I guess.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.562]  Is that they, you know, first they were patrolling more.
[00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:23.064]  Well now, I'm starting to see them pull over vehicles.
[00:57:23.812 --> 00:57:25.153]  In conducting traffic duty.
[00:57:25.153 --> 00:57:31.518]  So, you know, it's just kind of a police state thing that I've been noticing.
[00:57:31.518 --> 00:57:36.161]  It's all part of the harmonization between military and law enforcement.
[00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:43.026]  Getting people used to living in a decrepit, decaying, banana republic, third world country.
[00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:48.510]  And that's what they need to do when they implement that kind of militarized police state.
[00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:49.851]  Thanks for the call, Dave.
[00:57:49.851 --> 00:57:51.072]  Ian in England.
[00:57:51.072 --> 00:57:52.493]  Last caller, Ian, go ahead.
[00:57:56.775 --> 00:57:57.296]  Yeah.
[00:57:57.296 --> 00:57:58.677]  Excellent.
[00:57:58.677 --> 00:58:03.561]  Um, yeah, uh, good to hear you.
[00:58:03.561 --> 00:58:09.507]  Um, just, um, a little call to, um, you know, sort of make people aware that come the new year, um,
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:18.946]  April time, March, April, May, is going to be a really serious situation from that point on.
[00:58:18.946 --> 00:58:22.589]  The first year's accounts are going to be released, which are obviously going to be dismal.
[00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:28.894]  They're already announcing the lowest pre-Christmas sales ever.
[00:58:28.894 --> 00:58:30.575]  Yeah, we're out of time, sorry.
[00:58:30.575 --> 00:58:32.417]  The economy's in trouble.
[00:58:32.417 --> 00:58:34.018]  Rebroadcast coming up.
[00:58:34.018 --> 00:58:35.499]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:35.499 --> 00:58:37.921]  I've been your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:58:37.921 --> 00:58:38.862]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.058]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.058 --> 00:58:48.283]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.461]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:55.461 --> 00:59:01.862]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:59:01.862 --> 00:59:09.244]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:09.244 --> 00:59:14.125]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:16.866 --> 00:59:19.250]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:37.694]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:59:37.694 --> 00:59:50.044]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:59:50.044 --> 00:59:54.227]  Thank you.
[00:59:54.227 --> 00:59:56.609]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.609 --> 00:59:59.372]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.885 --> 01:00:10.729]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.729 --> 01:00:12.310]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:13.851]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:18.034]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.034 --> 01:00:22.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.478 --> 01:00:35.383]  Well, this whole Wikileaks situation is very complex, but bottom line, it's the pretext to bring in censorship control of the web, with the whole cyber security system being built up.
[01:00:35.383 --> 01:00:38.464]  And John Young of Cryptome.org predicted this.
[01:00:38.464 --> 01:00:41.446]  He's, again, the original Wikileaker.
[01:00:41.446 --> 01:00:46.968]  He's the guy that set up the website originally for them, but then he pulled out very quickly.
[01:00:47.668 --> 01:00:50.751]  Now he said years ago, looks like a Soros type operation.
[01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:54.914]  Now we have clear connections to that, that's even mainstream media.
[01:00:54.914 --> 01:00:58.858]  Now I want to, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, John, but I want to give you the floor.
[01:00:58.858 --> 01:01:01.159]  You talk about this, you know, this being foggy.
[01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:01.900]  Bring clarity.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:08.205]  I mean, as somebody who probably knows more about this than anybody else, in the next four minutes, you've got the floor.
[01:01:08.205 --> 01:01:09.907]  What do you want to say to folks about this?
[01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:11.048]  What do you think is most important?
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:20.196]  Well, follow the money is, of course, a clichÃ©, but true here is that for two and a half years, Wikileaks was on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:01:20.196 --> 01:01:25.819]  They shut down for a few months and came back with bombshells, and suddenly in the morning, the money started pouring in.
[01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:34.405]  This is a well-known business model to hand out free cigarettes and then sell them after the addiction started.
[01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:37.927]  And so it's also a well-known government technique to create a crisis
[01:01:40.017 --> 01:01:40.337]  I don't
[01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:01.424]  We're good to go.
[01:02:27.364 --> 01:02:34.750]  So I think that's a lesson we've learned running our site, that there are all sorts of threats imputed to crypto.
[01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:35.851]  None of that has come to pass.
[01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:40.274]  It was just a shell game to make it seem like there's a threat, but there wasn't.
[01:02:40.274 --> 01:02:44.518]  We've never been shot at except by one time by Microsoft, which then withdrew it.
[01:02:46.465 --> 01:02:50.428]  WikiLeaks was shut down once by a court, but then that was withdrawn.
[01:02:50.428 --> 01:02:53.611]  As far as I know, no officials have ever approached WikiLeaks with a threat.
[01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:55.892]  Now, maybe they have and they've kept it quiet.
[01:02:55.892 --> 01:03:02.397]  We always publicize when we're approached by officials to let them know that this is something of a show game.
[01:03:02.397 --> 01:03:12.185]  So we'd like to see more attention paid to how often this occurs, not by WikiLeaks, but by others who are rushing to their support, but also rushing to oppose them.
[01:03:12.185 --> 01:03:13.286]  There's money to be made in this.
[01:03:14.338 --> 01:03:15.200]  I'm talking about the media.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.308]  I'm talking about the so-called outlaws, the so-called dissidents.
[01:03:20.308 --> 01:03:21.830]  This is a big-time operation.
[01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:22.912]  Everyone's getting in on this.
[01:03:22.912 --> 01:03:25.275]  So I'm admiring this taking place.
[01:03:25.275 --> 01:03:27.619]  It'll be kept going for quite a while.
[01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:29.021]  Money's pouring in from all sides.
[01:03:29.822 --> 01:03:36.325]  Yeah, when I talk about info war, I mean getting people talking, saying no to tyranny.
[01:03:36.325 --> 01:03:40.727]  Their info war, they're talking about hacking and more the Pentagon version of that.
[01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:02.649]  And so that's what Cybercom is now doing.
[01:04:02.649 --> 01:04:07.432]  They're going to mill cyber threats as much as they can over the next several years.
[01:04:07.432 --> 01:04:10.715]  And that's why I think that the Bradley Manning thing was a steam.
[01:04:10.715 --> 01:04:18.120]  You know they teach this stuff at Fort Hugo, Alex, how people like Bradley Manning can do this and set up these steam operations.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.162]  And so he was trained there.
[01:04:22.603 --> 01:04:25.286]  Uh, this smells like that to me.
[01:04:25.286 --> 01:04:26.967]  And there'll be more coming, though.
[01:04:26.967 --> 01:04:33.193]  Uh, and, uh, because right now they're just testing the public's reaction with this low-level secrecy revelation, but the other stuff will come.
[01:04:34.048 --> 01:04:35.069]  All right, stay there.
[01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:36.849]  We're going to come back in three minutes, John.
[01:04:36.849 --> 01:04:38.130]  Long segment.
[01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.752]  And I want to continue to drill down into WikiLeaks.
[01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:46.714]  I mean, obviously, you've got all these Soros CIA connections, Cass Sunstein.
[01:04:46.714 --> 01:04:57.539]  Sunstein writing two years ago, two and a half years ago, that they would infiltrate the web, pose as activists, create crisis, then bring in censorship legislation.
[01:04:57.539 --> 01:04:58.500]  That's now happening.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.140]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.312 --> 01:05:09.416]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:09.416 --> 01:05:11.957]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.957 --> 01:05:17.340]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.381]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:22.462]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.702 --> 01:05:28.945]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.945 --> 01:05:32.327]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:32.327 --> 01:05:38.110]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.750]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.051]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:43.732]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.133]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:05:45.413 --> 01:05:47.936]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.936 --> 01:05:52.581]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.164]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:55.164 --> 01:05:59.028]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:59.028 --> 01:06:00.049]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:03.066 --> 01:06:04.827]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:10.550]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:15.292]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:19.054]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:06:37.262 --> 01:06:44.323]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.

[01:06:48.544 --> 01:06:50.945]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:01.969 --> 01:07:05.993]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.993 --> 01:07:09.237]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:14.042]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:20.428]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:20.428 --> 01:07:22.671]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:23.191 --> 01:07:23.511]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:24.011]  Bernanke?
[01:07:24.011 --> 01:07:24.391]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:24.391 --> 01:07:25.132]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:25.132 --> 01:07:26.772]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:42.096 --> 01:07:43.956]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.956 --> 01:07:49.378]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.378 --> 01:08:02.281]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:07.882]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:25.348]  John Young of Cryptome.org, the original Wikilaker.
[01:08:25.348 --> 01:08:28.731]  That's the New York Observer headline.
[01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:34.616]  He set up the site for them originally, but then immediately got suspicious of it.
[01:08:36.085 --> 01:08:37.646]  And this is the pretext.
[01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:48.791]  Just like they set up Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, they're now setting this up, and now they've got thousands of hackers attacking MasterCard, Visa, Sarah Palin for calling Assange un-American.
[01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.913]  You know, I don't want to hate Sarah Palin, but give me a break.
[01:08:52.913 --> 01:08:58.696]  She said that the South shouldn't have attacked North Korea, and that we've got to stand with North Korea.
[01:08:58.696 --> 01:09:01.077]  She doesn't know that North Korea is the Stalinist state.
[01:09:02.277 --> 01:09:06.022]  Uh, she's now come out and said that Assange is un-American.
[01:09:06.022 --> 01:09:07.524]  Assange is Australian, honey.
[01:09:07.524 --> 01:09:14.332]  Uh, but this is just getting crazier and crazier, uh, by the minute.
[01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:21.200]  And now they've released cables, uh, dealing with Dyncor, uh, running little kidnapped boys.
[01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:27.183]  Which you see in the news all the time, but there is some pretty bombshell stuff in here.
[01:09:27.183 --> 01:09:32.726]  But could that be that the mainstream media is going through this and only covering what they want to go over?
[01:09:32.726 --> 01:09:42.491]  Because so much of what I've read, and I've tried to go through a lot of it, and so much of what the media has picked up on, really reinforces the whole war on terror propaganda.
[01:09:42.491 --> 01:09:47.394]  And anybody who knows the basics understands just because some document's secret doesn't mean it's true.
[01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:53.298]  I mean, they had the Office of Special Plans saying they knew where the WMDs were and that was secret.
[01:09:53.298 --> 01:09:59.842]  So some of the biggest propaganda you see is inside government because it's an echo chamber of brainwashing.
[01:09:59.842 --> 01:10:03.165]  John Young of Cryptome.org, what's your view on what I just said?
[01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:09.789]  Well, all classification is used to exaggerate the importance of information.
[01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:13.372]  And so you shouldn't believe something because it's secret, top secret, whatever these are.
[01:10:13.372 --> 01:10:14.893]  These are glamorizing terms.
[01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:20.566]  Uh, and so that, um, uh, other people inside Secret Keeping know this, and that's why they...
[01:10:21.596 --> 01:10:22.257]  We're good to go.
[01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:52.639]  Yeah, they've got a file report, so they sit there with a Word document open, cutting clips out.
[01:10:52.639 --> 01:10:58.402]  In fact, that's already been pointed out, that a lot of this stuff was excised right out of newspapers and not even changed.
[01:10:58.402 --> 01:11:01.924]  So, it's a bunch of neocon propaganda.
[01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:07.747]  That's right, but that's what the media, sorry to say, that's what most of the media does for a living.
[01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:23.634]  Uh, either quote each other or, uh, most of them quote one or two other stories, uh, do almost no original reporting, uh, because that takes time and they've got a deadline to meet, they always say, and we have limited space, they always say, and so we've gotta go with what everyone else is doing.
[01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:34.782]  Well, I mean, they get a government press release, and they put that in the article, and then the embassy takes the article that's a boiled-down government press release, and then puts it out as secret.
[01:11:34.782 --> 01:11:40.386]  That's like, a few months ago, they made all the TSA workers top-secret or secret clearances.
[01:11:40.386 --> 01:11:43.248]  That way, they can't protect themselves with a union.
[01:11:43.248 --> 01:11:46.130]  That way, they can be lied to about the terror threat.
[01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:49.172]  That way, they can feel like they're old James Bonds.
[01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:54.155]  It's kind of like giving somebody the newspaper associate editor title in lieu of pay.
[01:11:55.856 --> 01:11:57.396]  You hit it right on the head.
[01:11:57.396 --> 01:12:02.898]  These are often ways to boost morale within an organization is to declare something secret and let you in on it.
[01:12:02.898 --> 01:12:05.719]  By the way, they do this to presidents, too.
[01:12:05.719 --> 01:12:07.900]  They read them into the secrecy world and
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.161]  Shall I go on with this?
[01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.041]  Yeah, continue.
[01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:21.164]  Yeah, is that, you know, we have all these people outside government saying, we gotta do this, we gotta do that, and then they go inside and suddenly they don't say that anymore.
[01:12:21.164 --> 01:12:29.226]  It's huge because they've been read into the secrecy pearl where they're under lifetime threat to never disclose it, and they suddenly shut up.
[01:12:29.226 --> 01:12:32.007]  It's a one-way street, and you can never back out once you're in.
[01:12:32.007 --> 01:12:33.588]  That's why there are no ex-spies.
[01:12:33.588 --> 01:12:36.469]  Every spy has lifelong secrecy built into their blood.
[01:12:37.651 --> 01:12:42.393]  And that's why some of them are out there talking about what they're revealing, because they're unconstrained.
[01:12:42.393 --> 01:12:47.514]  But mainly is that it's a good way to make a living.
[01:12:47.514 --> 01:12:49.855]  Being inside the secrecy world is an awfully good thing.
[01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:53.977]  Of course, it started when the first church was set up, when the first kingdom was set up.
[01:12:53.977 --> 01:12:55.737]  So it's been around for a while, Alex.
[01:12:55.737 --> 01:13:00.819]  It's secrecy is a narcotic against them.
[01:13:00.819 --> 01:13:02.680]  And the biggest threat to the secret keepers
[01:13:03.684 --> 01:13:10.666]  Well, I have to agree with you on this because overall it allows the dominant media that's being supplanted by alternative media to
[01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:46.845]  Demonize the internet to begin to grow the surveillance grid towards the original incremental Shutdown of the web all of this happens the web as we know it all of this happens with the backdrop of the FCC Commissioner saying Freedom of speech is an aberration in the media.
[01:13:46.845 --> 01:13:50.146]  We're going to shut it down government approved all of this comes out
[01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:56.873]  With a backdrop of the cyber security legislation, which has legalized what's already in place.
[01:13:56.873 --> 01:14:03.218]  The Cyber Command admits, two years ago, they've been launching, quote, attacks against themselves to test systems.
[01:14:03.218 --> 01:14:04.899]  We know they hire most of the hackers.
[01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:09.443]  We know that Assange got in trouble many years ago and was kind of brought into that world.
[01:14:10.103 --> 01:14:23.169]  But I think like Lee Harvey Oswald there's a good chance they're again setting him up or this could be all part of a big pageant kind of like Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers where they tried to prosecute him but then the case fell apart to give him street cred.
[01:14:23.169 --> 01:14:34.955]  We know the naval intelligence operative Woodward was with Deep Throat, Alexander Haig and Kissinger, Deep Throat we know is a composite, to burn Kissinger, I mean to burn Nixon.
[01:14:36.716 --> 01:14:46.863]  So the whole way this is going, it's very, very clear, but then you've almost got to support Julian Assange because the charges against him are clearly false.
[01:14:46.863 --> 01:14:53.507]  I mean, not wearing a condom and consensual sex by some feminist who writes articles about how to set men up in the legal system.
[01:14:53.507 --> 01:14:54.488]  You can't make that up.
[01:14:56.449 --> 01:15:11.165]  So you've got to support Assange because if they're able to nail him for no reason, then I can be arrested for the secret documents that I've put out that are real, that they did not want people to get, like the MIAC and Homeland Security reports.
[01:15:11.165 --> 01:15:15.851]  I happen to know that one of the people that leaked me stuff, they found out about other things he was doing and he got
[01:15:16.491 --> 01:15:18.232]  In a lot of trouble.
[01:15:18.232 --> 01:15:22.155]  But I mean, this is all just incredible stuff that's going on.
[01:15:22.155 --> 01:15:25.658]  John, you just heard me rant about, you know, the point about Assange.
[01:15:25.658 --> 01:15:36.986]  I mean, if we don't support him in free speech, even though this is all basically a setup, then doesn't it set the precedent for them to come throw John Young or Alex Jones in the Huskow?
[01:15:38.729 --> 01:15:44.733]  It's a good point because, in fact, someone said on the mail list, hey, why is John Young not being charged with rape?
[01:15:44.733 --> 01:15:54.980]  And I had to laugh at that because you see me compared to Assange, you know, that charge would never stand up.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.963]  But my point is that don't be lulled by this rape charge in Sweden.
[01:15:58.963 --> 01:16:01.164]  There's more coming along that line.
[01:16:01.164 --> 01:16:03.406]  This is just a tip of what's coming out of Sweden.
[01:16:04.692 --> 01:16:09.914]  And so, don't forget, we're on a bombshell campaign, Alex, and every day something unexpected happens.
[01:16:09.914 --> 01:16:14.956]  So something in a series of unexpected things will happen on that strand while other things are happening on this strand.
[01:16:14.956 --> 01:16:17.737]  So this is a multi-stranded operation.
[01:16:17.737 --> 01:16:23.119]  And we're actually being teased with the easy stuff right now to set us up for more interesting stuff.
[01:16:24.304 --> 01:16:25.525]  Well, we've seen that pattern.
[01:16:25.525 --> 01:16:33.591]  It's building, building, as you said, and I gotta hand it to you, over a year ago, you laid it out with precision.
[01:16:33.591 --> 01:16:38.314]  Let's go back, though, because you've been an insider in this entire world.
[01:16:38.314 --> 01:16:45.039]  What are your WikiLeaks sources, or other hacker insiders, what are they telling you, John, that you can relay to us?
[01:16:45.039 --> 01:16:48.341]  What bombshells can you give us?
[01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:52.204]  Well, let me tell you who they are, and where you can find their names.
[01:16:52.204 --> 01:16:53.645]  You can find them on Wikipedia.
[01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:57.745]  Uh, look up the term slapper poke.
[01:16:57.745 --> 01:16:59.607]  And I'll spell that for you if you haven't heard of it.
[01:16:59.607 --> 01:17:00.669]  That's a PKD term!
[01:17:02.948 --> 01:17:06.609]  Uh, Cypher spelled with a Y. C-Y-P-H-P-U-N-K.
[01:17:06.609 --> 01:17:07.549]  Cypherpunk, got it.
[01:17:07.549 --> 01:17:08.070]  That's right.
[01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:19.733]  Look there and scroll down to the bottom and you'll see my name, Assange's name, several dozen names of people who all plotted all this and are still very active in this.
[01:17:19.733 --> 01:17:21.454]  And I've started pointing to this now.
[01:17:21.454 --> 01:17:25.355]  If you want to know what's behind WikiLeaks, go to this one site and you'll see the entire gang.
[01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:33.350]  You'll see a whole bunch of links to other sources and you'll see how long this has been going on and why you're not going to be able to contain it.
[01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:52.371]  Uh, and so, uh, that's the first thing I can tell you, is that this is public information that's been out there for years, but no one did the slightest amount of research on this, um, and so that beyond this Wikipedia entry, uh, I've got the archives of the Cypherpunks mail list that went on for several years, where all these issues were discussed, were thoroughly discussed.
[01:17:52.371 --> 01:17:57.415]  This is very high-level technical material, and these are not young people like Assange.
[01:17:58.436 --> 01:18:02.357]  Some of these people are extremely wealthy, and they're not George Soros, who's clueless, technically.
[01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:04.858]  And he thinks his billions makes him all-powerful, but it doesn't.
[01:18:04.858 --> 01:18:09.519]  It makes him rather stupid, like the CIA is stupid because of their alleged power.
[01:18:09.519 --> 01:18:15.901]  So these are people who are much crafter than that, but I'd recommend that people take a look at the Cyberpunk's Wikipedia page.
[01:18:17.602 --> 01:18:21.564]  Okay, I'm looking at the Cypher... John, I'm looking at the Cypherpunks on Wikipedia.
[01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:22.945]  Scroll up for me.
[01:18:22.945 --> 01:18:24.827]  Guys, scroll down to the bottom.
[01:18:24.827 --> 01:18:26.288]  Okay, but I want to make sure I've got the right entry.
[01:18:26.288 --> 01:18:28.089]  Go to the top for me real quick.
[01:18:28.089 --> 01:18:37.796]  It's the Cypherpunk entry on Wikipedia, and not to be confused with the PKD Cyberpunk.
[01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.397]  Okay, let's scroll to the bottom now.
[01:18:39.397 --> 01:18:39.677]  Go ahead.
[01:18:40.217 --> 01:18:46.103]  Well, don't go down the bottom, you'll see there's a list, a number of people who are involved in this.
[01:18:46.103 --> 01:18:57.413]  I'll be there, Assange is there, a number of people there that you may not have heard of, but the founder of EFF, the founder of a number of other... John Gilmore of Sun Microsystems.
[01:18:58.609 --> 01:18:58.969]  We're good to go.
[01:19:20.077 --> 01:19:22.698]  Well, I'm going to try to give you an answer that may be a little hard to understand.
[01:19:22.698 --> 01:19:23.398]  It is none of those.
[01:19:35.948 --> 01:19:38.590]  The intent was to have nothing that can be attacked easily.
[01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:39.931]  So it's not an organization.
[01:19:39.931 --> 01:19:41.553]  It's not an entity.
[01:19:41.553 --> 01:19:42.553]  It's a concept.
[01:19:42.553 --> 01:19:43.975]  It's a aspiration.
[01:19:43.975 --> 01:19:44.815]  It's a goal.
[01:19:44.815 --> 01:19:48.058]  It is not anything you're going to be able to take down by the usual means.
[01:19:48.058 --> 01:19:50.059]  That's the very purpose of it, is to not make it.
[01:19:50.059 --> 01:19:52.101]  And that's why I say WikiLeaks will not be taken down.
[01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:53.082]  It'll pop up some other way.
[01:19:54.426 --> 01:20:01.308]  So you're saying it's almost like the internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other and can't be taken down.
[01:20:01.308 --> 01:20:12.632]  This is just basically hackers and computer experts that built a system that anybody in the group can pump info out and nobody can stop it.
[01:20:12.632 --> 01:20:19.174]  And that's why WikiLeaks people told the news yesterday, to take us down, you'll have to shut the web down.
[01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:23.839]  That's why it was set up.
[01:20:23.839 --> 01:20:28.100]  It was set up as a spying machine, as I told you on your last show.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.001]  But now it's being used for reverse spying.
[01:20:32.001 --> 01:20:41.043]  But the people who set it up, as you know, was the military, and they set it up to induce people to join up, because it's a very good way to surveil an entire population around the world.
[01:20:41.043 --> 01:20:47.604]  But now the people who are actually running it, that they hired to run it, are now reversing the Panopticon.
[01:20:48.154 --> 01:20:49.735]  Well, that's, I mean, that's what I've always said.
[01:20:49.735 --> 01:21:03.341]  They use Google to spy on us, we use Google to spy on them with the massive group collective brain that they're not ever going to be able to stop because they might even have the intelligence, but they don't have the personnel to deploy operations.
[01:21:03.341 --> 01:21:08.003]  But as long as we're an idea, a manifesto of human liberty, it's unstoppable.
[01:21:08.003 --> 01:21:09.724]  Yep, that's right.
[01:21:09.724 --> 01:21:16.467]  Because they'll have to stop themselves if they do, because they set this up in order to control things and they're gradually losing control.
[01:21:18.004 --> 01:21:21.729]  So it's kind of like the Lord of the Rings analogy of Sauron.
[01:21:21.729 --> 01:21:29.518]  He makes the ring, but the ring actually controls him, so somebody can get the ring and throw it into the crack of doom.
[01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:32.482]  This is always the outcome of imperialism.
[01:21:32.482 --> 01:21:34.184]  It eventually destroys itself.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.300]  Unbelievable.
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:42.802]  And again, you've had piercing understanding of this because you were involved from the start.
[01:21:42.802 --> 01:21:50.164]  And you're telling, I mean, you're talking just like government people I've talked to, like Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars.
[01:21:50.164 --> 01:21:55.325]  He'll always say, well, I can give you what's open source, or they declassified this by mistake.
[01:21:55.325 --> 01:21:56.445]  I can tell you this.
[01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.386]  Now, go look at that.
[01:21:58.386 --> 01:22:00.707]  And so you're saying, look at this list.
[01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.467]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:22:02.467 --> 01:22:04.688]  This is a system, a door that swings both ways.
[01:22:08.109 --> 01:22:12.611]  What I'm getting from what you're saying, John, is that this is out of control.
[01:22:12.611 --> 01:22:13.131]  Well, it is.
[01:22:13.131 --> 01:22:16.013]  However, you know, it's smart people all around.
[01:22:16.013 --> 01:22:22.356]  One of the things we always have to keep in mind is that every time you think you've got a clear understanding, someone else smarts you.
[01:22:23.559 --> 01:22:29.202]  And so one of the things that I admire about the cypherpunks, they never got completely arrogant and said that we are going to run things.
[01:22:29.202 --> 01:22:33.084]  A few tried and they got shot down by critics who were smarter than they were.
[01:22:33.084 --> 01:22:36.006]  So what I'd like to caution is don't think that you're going to get this easily.
[01:22:36.006 --> 01:22:42.069]  To say it's out of control, I'm saying it's going to take some work because you'll be set up repeatedly and trapped.
[01:22:42.069 --> 01:22:46.992]  And as with Wikileaks, now they've got Wikileaks redacting documents.
[01:22:46.992 --> 01:22:48.253]  So that means the fix is in.
[01:22:53.749 --> 01:22:57.890]  Well, that shows that they're coming to him and saying, don't give out our agents' names.
[01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.430]  We'll go easier on you.
[01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:01.450]  They're already being co-opted.
[01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:03.271]  Yeah, because of the money.
[01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:05.371]  The money is fabulous.
[01:23:05.371 --> 01:23:07.891]  Because they were not making money being out there on their own.
[01:23:07.891 --> 01:23:11.012]  So now they've raised millions by being on the inside.
[01:23:11.012 --> 01:23:12.192]  So why not?
[01:23:12.192 --> 01:23:14.193]  Well, what is your inside scoop?
[01:23:14.193 --> 01:23:22.474]  If you were offered a billion dollar bribe, and you were 39 years old and had no other income, think about it.
[01:23:25.202 --> 01:23:28.884]  It's called a government contract.
[01:23:28.884 --> 01:23:33.366]  Well, what's your inside intel or your gut if you don't have the inside intel?
[01:23:33.366 --> 01:23:36.208]  Is this a big theater with Assange?
[01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:39.849]  Or are they burning him for the theater?
[01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:42.131]  It's a theater operation.
[01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:46.533]  Partly entertaining, partly lulling, partly testing systems.
[01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:49.030]  Testing public reaction.
[01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:52.711]  Are we going to get traction out of cyber threats or not?
[01:23:52.711 --> 01:23:53.491]  Will this work or not?
[01:23:53.491 --> 01:23:56.132]  Because so far, you know, they've not actually caused any harm.
[01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:57.232]  That's why they haven't been charged.
[01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.633]  Yeah, this is the beta testing.
[01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.453]  Now they're going to start releasing even more.
[01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:00.953]  That's right.
[01:24:00.953 --> 01:24:04.734]  And then there'll be some lives lost or something will happen.
[01:24:04.734 --> 01:24:07.655]  Because don't forget, these are cheap operations to run.
[01:24:09.565 --> 01:24:16.029]  And so, somewhere, because this is still a fictional war, it's not a real war, it's a cyber war, which is all imaginary.
[01:24:16.029 --> 01:24:20.752]  And when that becomes really harmful, we'll see, because the law will be ready.
[01:24:20.752 --> 01:24:30.978]  What is your idea, John Young from Kryptom.org, the original Wikileaker, what is your view, your idea, and I should have you back for a full hour soon, this is incredible.
[01:24:30.978 --> 01:24:34.861]  I want liberty, I want freedom, I want my private property, I don't want to be a slave,
[01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:36.942]  I would imagine that's your view.
[01:24:36.942 --> 01:24:39.144]  You know, I don't want to be part of an empire.
[01:24:39.144 --> 01:24:41.967]  I don't want to support all these wars in my name.
[01:24:41.967 --> 01:24:43.007]  So that's my view.
[01:24:43.007 --> 01:24:55.458]  I know I'm a good guy, but I know in ways I've been used as well, because this is such a complex world, and you can't be looking at everything at every time so nobody's perfect, but I know I'm good, and I know I want to do good.
[01:24:55.458 --> 01:25:02.944]  I mean, what should I be doing from your view, and what should you be doing to somehow stop this from being used to
[01:25:04.636 --> 01:25:10.317]  Well, it's what I was told as a kid.
[01:25:10.317 --> 01:25:15.318]  Trust no one but yourself and warn people not to trust you.
[01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:18.139]  We say on Krypton, do not trust us.
[01:25:18.139 --> 01:25:20.360]  Through our ignorance we may deceive you or betray you.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.160]  Do not trust anyone who speaks with a voice of authority.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.221]  Do not trust anyone who sells you protection.
[01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:26.921]  Do not trust anyone who sells you trust.
[01:25:28.095 --> 01:25:29.056]  I don't think so.
[01:25:49.662 --> 01:25:50.263]  We're good to go.
[01:26:11.018 --> 01:26:17.543]  Well, when you say you lie, what, you've put out little disinfo involving where you live or your name?
[01:26:17.543 --> 01:26:20.686]  I mean, you don't lie about the overall truth, sir.
[01:26:20.686 --> 01:26:26.770]  I mean, are you saying you lie as like you take the address numbers off your apartment door?
[01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:31.814]  No, I lie with true ignorance, and I don't know any better, and will not admit it.
[01:26:31.814 --> 01:26:36.158]  I'll pretend that I've got access to truth by the tail, and I'm delivering it to you.
[01:26:37.355 --> 01:26:42.676]  And so the reason I'm lying is because I don't know how else to convey what I'm doing in an honest way.
[01:26:42.676 --> 01:26:44.576]  We need to work on that.
[01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:46.557]  Everyone exaggerates.
[01:26:46.557 --> 01:26:47.917]  You know what?
[01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:55.879]  No one is perfect, and I think the second guess, yourself, I mean, I'm not delivering pure truth, so I'm lying to you.
[01:26:55.879 --> 01:27:01.140]  I think it's, if you consciously try to dead reckon as best you can, I think
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:11.628]  Veritas, the proof of Veritas is, on the balance, does 80 plus percent of what you talk about come true, or 90 percent?
[01:27:11.628 --> 01:27:15.130]  Or does, you know, everything you do turn out to be wrong?
[01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:18.113]  And I watch mainstream media, they're lying on purpose.
[01:27:18.113 --> 01:27:21.155]  We're here trying to tell the truth, we get some things wrong.
[01:27:21.155 --> 01:27:23.457]  But, I mean, I know there's good people, John.
[01:27:23.457 --> 01:27:31.443]  I mean, my whole issue is, I think part of getting into this whole world that you've been part of so long, is that you're so in with all these other snakes,
[01:27:32.203 --> 01:27:37.287]  Then it starts blinding you to the fact that there are a lot of good people.
[01:27:37.287 --> 01:27:42.832]  Well, and it turns out that one of the best things is to get out of your bunker and meet all these other people.
[01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:49.997]  So I'll say the best thing about Krypton is how many people I've met, how many different views I would never have known had I not opened myself up to other people's viewpoints.
[01:27:49.997 --> 01:27:53.660]  So if I say I lie, is it only counter to lying is to have
[01:27:58.135 --> 01:28:10.302]  Yeah, we've got to stop being passive.
[01:28:10.302 --> 01:28:11.903]  We've got to stop being afraid.
[01:28:11.903 --> 01:28:13.264]  We've got to stop conforming.
[01:28:13.264 --> 01:28:13.945]  That's right.
[01:28:13.945 --> 01:28:15.265]  Well, we've got to be individuals.
[01:28:15.265 --> 01:28:16.966]  I mean, that is the biggest solution overall.
[01:28:16.966 --> 01:28:18.787]  And we've got to be willing... And the Internet is great for that.
[01:28:18.787 --> 01:28:19.448]  Pardon me?
[01:28:19.448 --> 01:28:21.069]  And the Internet is great for that.
[01:28:21.069 --> 01:28:22.830]  And we've got to be willing to go through pain, folks.
[01:28:26.636 --> 01:28:29.737]  Well, the best things in life come from breaking your own bones.
[01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:31.458]  I certainly understand what you're saying there.
[01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:36.381]  No, it's true.
[01:28:36.381 --> 01:28:40.522]  Well, I'm not into that anymore, but let them try to accommodate.
[01:28:40.522 --> 01:28:45.165]  I'll accommodate them.
[01:28:45.165 --> 01:28:45.585]  Same here.
[01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:47.466]  I grew up, same thing, Texas.
[01:28:47.466 --> 01:28:50.727]  Up where I came from in Dallas, it was people going to the hospital every weekend.
[01:28:50.727 --> 01:28:51.608]  I love living in Austin.
[01:28:51.608 --> 01:28:52.228]  It's not like that.
[01:28:55.168 --> 01:28:58.730]  That was a form of argument that I've gradually moved away from.
[01:28:58.730 --> 01:28:59.230]  Yep.
[01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:00.110]  Because that's a pattern.
[01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:03.672]  Everyone that WikiLeaks has put out has been followed by another one, so I'm a lot more shocking.
[01:29:25.329 --> 01:29:27.551]  As you know, this is a well-known technique boxers use.
[01:29:27.551 --> 01:29:33.217]  They slowly build up and just start overwhelming you with unexpected greater attacks.
[01:29:33.217 --> 01:29:36.500]  Are there any other big tidbits that you can give us today?
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.381]  Yeah, I think they're going to come out with some bank stuff.
[01:29:38.381 --> 01:29:40.283]  I think they're going to come out... Tell you what, stay there.
[01:29:40.283 --> 01:29:41.304]  I've got another guest coming up.
[01:29:41.304 --> 01:29:42.625]  We're going to push him back five minutes.
[01:29:42.625 --> 01:29:44.547]  I want you to talk about what you see coming up next.
[01:29:44.547 --> 01:29:45.708]  Then we're going to get our next guest on.
[01:29:45.708 --> 01:29:47.189]  We're holding five minutes to the next hour.
[01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:48.731]  We'll get Lord Monckton on right after.
[01:29:51.772 --> 01:29:55.693]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.693 --> 01:30:01.434]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:22.762 --> 01:30:25.424]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:31.929]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:30:53.813 --> 01:30:54.634]  Thank you!
[01:31:01.018 --> 01:31:05.562]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.562 --> 01:31:06.482]  Number one.
[01:31:06.482 --> 01:31:09.905]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.905 --> 01:31:10.766]  Number two.
[01:31:10.766 --> 01:31:15.649]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:16.390]  It's true.
[01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:21.274]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.274 --> 01:31:22.094]  Number three.
[01:31:22.094 --> 01:31:25.677]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.677 --> 01:31:29.380]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.381]  Number 4.
[01:31:30.381 --> 01:31:33.143]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.143 --> 01:31:36.826]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.826 --> 01:31:37.607]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.607 --> 01:31:41.751]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.751 --> 01:31:46.515]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.795 --> 01:31:50.978]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.978 --> 01:31:52.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.002]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:55.002 --> 01:32:00.786]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.786 --> 01:32:04.629]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:08.912]  They're offering a free CD, T-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:32:08.912 --> 01:32:13.596]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:32:13.596 --> 01:32:15.458]  I'm looking for a factory
[01:32:16.278 --> 01:32:18.599]  We're American and be proud.
[01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:24.460]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:42.434 --> 01:32:50.141]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:33:02.935 --> 01:33:08.968]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:08.968 --> 01:33:11.513]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:14.438 --> 01:33:19.322]  According to this deep university research, prescription drugs are the leading cause of death in the U.S.
[01:33:19.322 --> 01:33:22.885]  We're going to talk to Professor Donald Light, coming up here in about five minutes.
[01:33:22.885 --> 01:33:35.096]  Then Christopher Monckton will be joining us from Mexico, down in Cancun, with incredible intel for us on the big megabanks trying to set up a planetary feudal serf system.
[01:33:35.096 --> 01:33:40.720]  Finishing up with the original Wikileaker, the cypher punk insider,
[01:33:42.061 --> 01:33:48.786]  I've seen invaluable information come out that we know that Microsoft and Yahoo don't like how they just spy and steal everything.
[01:33:58.934 --> 01:33:59.434]  Yep, here it is.
[01:33:59.434 --> 01:33:59.975]  Here's a list.
[01:33:59.975 --> 01:34:01.475]  And it may offend some of your listeners.
[01:34:01.475 --> 01:34:03.777]  You're the sacred cow, don't you come out.
[01:34:27.899 --> 01:34:34.147]  Files on weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological.
[01:34:34.147 --> 01:34:39.653]  Files on global WMT research laboratories and the status of research docks.
[01:34:39.653 --> 01:34:42.337]  War plans of all nations, for and against one another.
[01:34:43.288 --> 01:34:47.370]  Reports and training literature on black prisons and torture chambers.
[01:34:47.370 --> 01:34:51.993]  Held by and shared among the world's military and spy agencies.
[01:34:51.993 --> 01:34:55.314]  Files of clandestine spy agencies and their operatives.
[01:34:55.314 --> 01:34:57.175]  Files on human rights abuses.
[01:34:57.175 --> 01:35:01.277]  For example, the secret Red Cross reports on the world's prisons.
[01:35:01.277 --> 01:35:04.379]  Files of billionaire political meddlers.
[01:35:04.379 --> 01:35:06.280]  Files of the major banks and their attorneys.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.842]  And most crucially, files of all the nation's tax agencies.
[01:35:09.842 --> 01:35:11.743]  The one key thing that keeps governments going.
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:14.841]  Unbelievable.
[01:35:38.891 --> 01:35:42.154]  Wow, now let's go back to this Vatican situation.
[01:35:42.154 --> 01:35:46.957]  We know the Vatican was involved, that's Open Intelligence, founding the Euro.
[01:35:46.957 --> 01:35:49.279]  We know it loves to hide itself.
[01:35:49.279 --> 01:35:56.545]  We know that now Lord Blackheath and others are talking about a Foundation X, richer than any government, you know, on Earth.
[01:35:56.545 --> 01:36:01.549]  I mean, more and more stuff that was so secretive that we'd talk about 15, 20 years ago, 30, 40 years ago, it's now coming out.
[01:36:07.246 --> 01:36:16.589]  It all points towards an overall attack on the internet, using the internet to cause such havoc that it rushes the world towards some type of collapse.
[01:36:16.589 --> 01:36:19.450]  I mean, but briefly, go back to the Vatican here.
[01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:21.370]  That's incredible.
[01:36:21.370 --> 01:36:30.033]  Specifically, from insiders at WikiLeaks, and you're an insider, you're saying that you've been told Vatican dirt's about to come out.
[01:36:31.226 --> 01:36:37.617]  Well, I'm saying that all the world's spy agencies are based on Vatican techniques and skills.
[01:36:37.617 --> 01:36:40.842]  They are the keeper of secrets beyond all others.
[01:36:40.842 --> 01:36:42.545]  They are the spy beyond all others.
[01:36:42.545 --> 01:36:43.446]  That's what Hitler said.
[01:36:43.446 --> 01:36:44.729]  He said it was the Jesuit model.
[01:36:46.932 --> 01:36:47.653]  We're good to go.
[01:37:09.525 --> 01:37:15.568]  Okay, in order, in closing, in the order you went is when this is going to be coming out or is it a mix and match?
[01:37:37.092 --> 01:37:42.674]  Next one will be a... They claim they got a hard disk from a major bank.
[01:37:42.674 --> 01:37:44.134]  Some people are saying it's Bank of America.
[01:37:44.134 --> 01:37:49.836]  Now, there are a lot of these hard disks floating around because banks use these as sting operations, as does FBI.
[01:37:49.836 --> 01:37:53.497]  So, WikiLeaks is not sure they got a real one, but they say they've got one.
[01:37:53.497 --> 01:37:55.798]  And they've been trying to authenticate it.
[01:37:55.798 --> 01:37:59.960]  And since banks are a popular target now, that's probably something like that will come out.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.981]  But don't forget, they always hit us with a bombshell we didn't expect, so it could be a ploy.
[01:38:05.903 --> 01:38:09.929]  Uh, it's possible that something will come out of, say, like the Clinton Foundation or something.
[01:38:09.929 --> 01:38:14.175]  Uh, you know, they're very astute picking something that will be popular.
[01:38:14.175 --> 01:38:16.258]  Alright.
[01:38:16.258 --> 01:38:18.260]  That's why they play the anti-American card.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.804]  Because that's very popular outside the U.S.
[01:38:21.305 --> 01:38:22.205]  I don't know.
[01:38:42.091 --> 01:38:42.672]  Have you on?
[01:38:42.672 --> 01:38:47.395]  And you can just use the acronym, you know, baloney.
[01:38:47.395 --> 01:38:50.577]  But thank you so much coming on from Cryptome.org.
[01:38:50.577 --> 01:38:53.179]  Amazing information there on the site.
[01:38:53.179 --> 01:38:56.161]  And I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[01:38:56.161 --> 01:39:04.928]  I'm going to have my producer calling in about five minutes to see if I can get you on for a full hour coming up Sunday to really go over the bombshells you just dropped on us.
[01:39:04.928 --> 01:39:05.768]  Thank you.
[01:39:05.768 --> 01:39:06.609]  Take care, Alex.
[01:39:06.609 --> 01:39:06.849]  All right.
[01:39:06.849 --> 01:39:09.231]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:09.231 --> 01:39:10.051]  Wow.
[01:39:11.752 --> 01:39:14.257]  That'll make your head hurt.
[01:39:14.257 --> 01:39:15.399]  Says it makes you think, it's...
[01:39:16.468 --> 01:39:19.949]  So many things going on, so many things happening.
[01:39:19.949 --> 01:39:23.910]  For the next 25 minutes, we're gonna have Donald Light.
[01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:33.992]  He is a low-key visiting professor at Stanford University and professor of comparative healthcare at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
[01:39:33.992 --> 01:39:40.833]  He is an economic and organizational sociologist who compares health care systems and pharmacological policy.
[01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:43.954]  As a founding fellow of the Center for Bioethics,
[01:39:44.614 --> 01:39:52.716]  He has become concerned about how few new drugs are clinically much better than existing ones, yet causing substantial risk to patients.
[01:39:52.716 --> 01:40:00.577]  Prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death, from the numbers I've seen it can be the leading cause, and result in 2.2 million hospitalizations a year.
[01:40:00.577 --> 01:40:06.058]  Professor Light is a co-author and editor of the Risk of Prescription Drugs 2010.
[01:40:06.058 --> 01:40:12.860]  His research has appeared in leading medical and social science journals, and I've got
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:25.122]  The book right here, The Risk of Prescription Drugs, Columbia University Press, Social Science Research Council Series on Privatization of Risk, and it's got the boil down here.
[01:40:25.122 --> 01:40:28.563]  How do prescription drugs become a leading cause of death?
[01:40:28.563 --> 01:40:34.163]  The risk of prescription drugs, and the numbers I've seen in the news are 300,000 drug-related deaths.
[01:40:34.163 --> 01:40:39.164]  That's almost rivaling heart attack, cancer, and automobile accident.
[01:40:39.164 --> 01:40:42.545]  So is it the fourth, the third, the second, the first?
[01:40:43.385 --> 01:40:44.046]  Does it matter?
[01:40:44.046 --> 01:40:48.929]  I mean, it's, it's, you hear these drug ads and, oh, having trouble needing to urinate a lot?
[01:40:48.929 --> 01:40:49.630]  Well, take this.
[01:40:49.630 --> 01:40:58.436]  Now, it'll give you brain cancer, have a heart attack, you may go insane, make you suicidal, blood clots, and, but doesn't matter, call your physician if you think this is right for you, because you're a doctor.
[01:40:58.436 --> 01:40:59.037]  It's incredible.
[01:40:59.037 --> 01:41:05.602]  So we've got him on with us for the next 25 minutes, and we'll certainly have him back up again for a full hour in the future.
[01:41:05.602 --> 01:41:07.183]  Professor Light, thank you for joining us.
[01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:15.316]  Well, it's a pleasure, and I've been reading about all the great things that you've been doing, these wonderful documentary films and interviews.
[01:41:15.316 --> 01:41:16.797]  It's very impressive.
[01:41:16.797 --> 01:41:19.259]  I'm really delighted to be talking with you.
[01:41:19.259 --> 01:41:21.181]  Well, I'm delighted to have you on with us, sir.
[01:41:21.181 --> 01:41:24.444]  We've got limited time, so I'm going to try to sit back and shut up.
[01:41:24.444 --> 01:41:32.731]  If you were talking to an auditorium at a city council and you had 25 minutes to talk to them, what would you say?
[01:41:34.325 --> 01:41:44.550]  Well, you've summarized the main finding that we had in this little book that's only the size of a 5x7 photograph and only 160 pages long.
[01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:54.534]  It was written for general lay audiences with short, easy-to-read chapters, and it describes, as you say, that most of the new drugs
[01:41:55.454 --> 01:41:56.534]  I have a table here.
[01:41:56.534 --> 01:42:02.796]  Out of the 980 drugs that were approved in the last decade, only 40 were regarded as important therapeutic advances.
[01:42:02.796 --> 01:42:03.657]  So that's about 4%.
[01:42:03.657 --> 01:42:04.097]  And another 106.
[01:42:15.402 --> 01:42:24.990]  We're judged clinically to be superior to existing drugs, and all the rest were judged to add little value.
[01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:26.051]  Now, why is that?
[01:42:26.051 --> 01:42:42.285]  Well, that's because the FDA approves drugs against placebo, placebo meaning a pill that is inert, and you don't know whether you're taking the active new drug or the placebo, and that's what is done in a clinical trial.
[01:42:42.945 --> 01:42:52.672]  And then you see whether the people who took the active drug got better against some criterion that the trial is for.
[01:42:52.672 --> 01:43:03.639]  But that means that when the FDA approves new drugs as more effective and better, and drug companies talk about it as being more effective, what they really mean is more effective than an inert pill.
[01:43:04.834 --> 01:43:11.180]  In fact, the FDA is prohibited from ruling whether new drugs are better than existing drugs.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:21.790]  And on the safety side, they approve them as safe with very little evidence about their safety because the trials are designed to minimize evidence of safety.
[01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:28.716]  And so the actual evidence they have about whether these drugs are safe for you is pretty minimal.
[01:43:30.981 --> 01:43:35.349]  Well, an example I would use, Professor, is I know how to read the insert of a drug.
[01:43:35.349 --> 01:43:37.754]  I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can read it.
[01:43:37.754 --> 01:43:39.036]  And Gardasil...
[01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:45.130]  Vaccines, they admitted in the trials, killed quite a few people.
[01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:47.211]  It caused autoimmune responses.
[01:43:47.211 --> 01:43:57.980]  And then of the hundreds of different papillomaviruses, they admitted it only covered six or so, and then it said, this may not even stop you from getting cervical cancer.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:05.066]  And then the literature went on to admit that it's only killing a few thousand people a year, and that's normally treatable.
[01:44:05.066 --> 01:44:07.367]  And so the benefits
[01:44:08.328 --> 01:44:22.116]  Are far outweighed by the dangers, but Merck just comes into Texas, gives a bunch of money to the politicians, and they come out and say, hey little girls, and now they're saying little boys, you gotta take this so you don't get this cancer virus.
[01:44:22.116 --> 01:44:24.478]  I mean, right there, it's just incredible.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.440]  Right.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.642]  I was told that doing the interview with you was like quickly going 60 miles an hour.
[01:44:31.642 --> 01:44:33.663]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:44:33.663 --> 01:44:40.526]  I'm not an expert on Gardasil, but you've put your finger on the new blockbuster era.
[01:44:40.526 --> 01:44:49.310]  So the companies have figured out that they can make vaccines or vaccine-like things that they will call vaccines because the definition is being broadened.
[01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.270]  I think?
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:26.210]  The vaccine advocates and the companies sort of market to the public officials in the Department of Public Health or the Centers for Disease Control simply to get these things on a list.
[01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:38.440]  So it's easy, cheap marketing, then it becomes part of the requirements for what children should take, and you're right that it's a real worry.
[01:45:39.687 --> 01:45:54.420]  Well it just builds it in that the business model of these companies is to come lobby government to push something on you, but your book, I mean it goes over the real evidence of how much harm these drugs are causing and more and more of
[01:45:55.788 --> 01:46:02.470]  Okay, well, one thing I think is worth saying is that drug companies are amongst our most enlightened and sophisticated corporations.
[01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:24.277]  And they do a lot of serious good science, and I live in an area where there are a lot of people who work for drug companies, and there are lots of wonderful employees at those companies.
[01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:37.940]  But what I find disturbing are what must be executive decisions that are being made, you know, many layers above by the people pulling down several million dollars a year in salaries and bonuses.
[01:46:38.713 --> 01:46:39.954]  We're good to go.
[01:47:01.089 --> 01:47:16.200]  Drug companies have paid six billion dollars in fines from prosecutions by attorney generals for illegal marketing and getting people to take drugs for reasons that are not approved.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.981]  This includes Johnson & Johnson.
[01:47:17.981 --> 01:47:22.184]  Pfizer is the biggest, 2.3 billion dollars in fines.
[01:47:22.184 --> 01:47:24.646]  In the last two years, Eli Lilly, 1.4 billion.
[01:47:24.646 --> 01:47:25.747]  GlaxoSmithKline, 400 million.
[01:47:28.911 --> 01:47:29.271]  I think so.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:48:02.717]  promoting to your doctors and to all of us through advertising which by the way you know we're one of only two countries in the world that allow direct-to-consumer advertising because the whole idea behind prescription drugs was for 50 years that it was your doctor who decided whether you
[01:48:04.108 --> 01:48:20.542]  Needed a certain drug and and it was the doctors whose job it was to stay on top of Development now this direct advertising They're getting patients to go and tell the doctor what to prescribe and often for a condition that's not been tested for
[01:48:23.632 --> 01:48:27.855]  Well, I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:48:27.855 --> 01:48:28.796]  Yeah.
[01:48:28.796 --> 01:48:42.806]  So, I mean, one simple thing that we recommend at the end of this little book, which is only $15, I think it's the cheapest book that Columbia Press has ever published, and it was... I make no money on it.
[01:48:42.806 --> 01:48:46.329]  It was funded by the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago.
[01:48:47.529 --> 01:48:53.072]  And they just paid us fees to do the writing that we did, so we get no royalties.
[01:48:53.072 --> 01:49:00.457]  But I just think people need to read this little book and learn about this issue and talk about it and protect themselves.
[01:49:00.457 --> 01:49:08.161]  So one thing that's recommended in the last short chapter is that whenever a drug is prescribed for an unapproved use,
[01:49:08.801 --> 01:49:14.628]  Which is called off-label, but I think unapproved use really puts it on the, you know, on the table clearly.
[01:49:14.628 --> 01:49:17.271]  Is assigned consent.
[01:49:17.271 --> 01:49:25.200]  So your doctor should hand you a piece of paper, might have one sentence saying, I understand that this prescription is being given to me by my doctor.
[01:49:26.110 --> 01:49:29.411]  For a condition for which it has not been approved.
[01:49:29.411 --> 01:49:30.132]  And I agree.
[01:49:30.132 --> 01:49:36.934]  You know, I think if most of your listeners were handed a piece of paper like that, they'd say, well, doctor, what's going on?
[01:49:36.934 --> 01:49:38.194]  Why are you doing this?
[01:49:38.194 --> 01:49:44.897]  I mean, we see doctors and clinics that aren't even checking to see what other medications you're on.
[01:49:44.897 --> 01:49:47.298]  And I see even young people now with big
[01:49:47.938 --> 01:49:51.361]  You know, tables just full of different pills they're taking.
[01:49:51.361 --> 01:49:51.861]  Right.
[01:49:51.861 --> 01:49:54.424]  I mean, and then all these weird drug interactions.
[01:49:54.424 --> 01:49:55.384]  What are the numbers?
[01:49:55.384 --> 01:49:56.405]  What do we know?
[01:49:56.405 --> 01:49:59.168]  I mean, how many people a year die from these drug interactions?
[01:50:00.796 --> 01:50:13.122]  Well, the total estimated deaths from hospitalized patients is 111,000, but as you said so well at the beginning, it was a wonderful introduction you gave to this talk.
[01:50:13.122 --> 01:50:23.026]  We don't know how many more, because that doesn't count all the people who die at home, at work, driving, walking, and so forth.
[01:50:23.026 --> 01:50:26.068]  So, it's a very limited measure that we have.
[01:50:26.647 --> 01:50:36.210]  And there's one of the things that really appalls me is here is the, roughly, the fourth, or as you say it might be the third, leading cause of death.
[01:50:36.210 --> 01:50:42.091]  And there are relatively few tracking, efforts to track and detail studies.
[01:50:42.091 --> 01:50:48.313]  So when you ask, well, how many people die from drug interactions, from what's called polypharmacy taking?
[01:50:59.161 --> 01:51:03.024]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.024 --> 01:51:08.608]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.608 --> 01:51:13.632]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.632 --> 01:51:18.676]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:19.196 --> 01:51:24.420]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:31.526]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.526 --> 01:51:32.647]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.647 --> 01:51:39.012]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.332 --> 01:51:42.514]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.514 --> 01:51:44.736]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:52.281 --> 01:51:58.385]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.385 --> 01:52:01.407]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:01.407 --> 01:52:02.547]  Pure water.
[01:52:02.547 --> 01:52:05.249]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:52:05.249 --> 01:52:06.630]  And who better to help you give the gift
[01:52:13.353 --> 01:52:14.093]  I think so.

[01:53:12.435 --> 01:53:17.379]  This one superfood in nature comes from unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:17.699 --> 01:53:23.365]  Of all the whey protein powders on the market, there is only one that is both unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:23.365 --> 01:53:25.147]  It is called One World Whey.
[01:53:25.147 --> 01:53:33.757]  It is well known that the support of your entire body's repair from whey protein powder is superior to milk, eggs, meat, or any vegetarian protein.

[01:54:10.573 --> 01:54:29.367]  We have a video up on PrisonBlooded.com of Ron Paul and Fox Business last night with Napolitano, judge, saying that he's been verbally told that he would be the new committee chairman of the key subcommittee over the private Federal Reserve.
[01:54:30.408 --> 01:54:34.872]  And of course the Constitution says Congress will control the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:54:34.872 --> 01:54:39.095]  The Fed has absconded with that power.
[01:54:39.095 --> 01:54:40.456]  And here's the Bloomberg headline.
[01:54:40.456 --> 01:54:41.677]  It's now official.
[01:54:41.677 --> 01:54:45.940]  Ron Paul, author of In the Fed to Lead, Fed Oversight Panel.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:54.426]  That was in question last week and we made it the number one search term to stop Boehner from blocking it and to call Boehner's office the presumptive
[01:54:56.243 --> 01:54:57.105]  New Speaker of the House.
[01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:09.295]  I don't
[01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:33.803]  A few people dying from terrorism, but more people die from bee stings every year.
[01:55:33.803 --> 01:55:37.204]  But then meanwhile, you've got one of the major causes of death.
[01:55:37.204 --> 01:55:44.807]  And I see wilder and wilder ads for drugs where it sounds like the side effects are a thousand times worse than what it's treating.
[01:55:44.807 --> 01:55:49.628]  So I'm glad your book is really trying to bring some light to this, Professor Light.
[01:55:49.628 --> 01:55:51.249]  And tell folks where they can get the book.
[01:55:51.929 --> 01:55:58.654]  Oh, well the best place is Amazon, and you just put in the risks of prescription drugs.
[01:55:58.654 --> 01:56:02.057]  My website is PharmaMyths.net.
[01:56:02.057 --> 01:56:07.601]  That's P-H-A-R-M-A-M-Y-T-H-S dot net.
[01:56:07.601 --> 01:56:17.528]  Because I've also been looking into the claims by companies that it costs an average of $1.3 billion in research and development to bring a new drug to market.
[01:56:17.528 --> 01:56:18.789]  Extremely expensive.
[01:56:19.569 --> 01:56:34.220]  And when you break down their numbers, and all the numbers are created by economists who are retained by the companies, it comes out to be a small fraction of that, because they use all kinds of inflators to puff the number up.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:34.600]  Wow!
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:38.442]  I look forward to having you back on for a full hour in the near future.
[01:56:38.442 --> 01:56:40.864]  Professor, give us that website one more time.
[01:56:40.864 --> 01:56:43.186]  It's pharmamyths.com.
[01:56:46.901 --> 01:56:49.343]  Net, and it's the risk of prescription drugs.
[01:56:49.343 --> 01:56:52.005]  And I thought I'd give you one example if we have a minute.
[01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:52.585]  Sure.
[01:56:52.585 --> 01:56:53.606]  Of a misleading ad.
[01:56:53.606 --> 01:56:57.068]  So, this is an ad for Lipitor about a few days ago.
[01:56:57.068 --> 01:57:03.112]  It starts with saying, did you know more than 80% of people who have heart attacks have high cholesterol?
[01:57:03.112 --> 01:57:04.793]  Now, how is that misleading?
[01:57:04.793 --> 01:57:11.958]  Well, because although it's true, 90% of the people who have cholesterol don't have heart attacks.
[01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.259]  It's a different denominator.
[01:57:13.259 --> 01:57:14.920]  If you start with all the people with heart attacks,
[01:57:15.646 --> 01:57:18.454]  Most of them have ten fingers and 80% of them have cholesterol.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:20.640]  Okay.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.763]  But if you start with the millions and millions of people with high cholesterol, very few of them have heart attacks.
[01:57:25.763 --> 01:57:37.989]  And the evidence is quite clear now that taking statins to lower cholesterol in people who do not already have a risk of heart disease does not reduce the probability of dying.
[01:57:37.989 --> 01:57:39.090]  It does not decrease it.
[01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:41.091]  Well, now they want to put statins in the water.
[01:57:41.091 --> 01:57:42.552]  Have you seen those announcements?
[01:57:42.552 --> 01:57:43.432]  Yeah.
[01:57:43.432 --> 01:57:47.975]  I mean, is Big Pharma just going to take over our total, you know,
[01:57:48.915 --> 01:57:49.656]  Economy?
[01:57:49.656 --> 01:57:54.498]  I mean, it's like GMO, closely allied with Big Pharma, basically the same group.
[01:57:54.498 --> 01:57:58.921]  You know, oh, we don't want you to know this is a GMO salmon that's part insect or part eel.
[01:57:58.921 --> 01:58:01.742]  Oh, we don't want you to know this goat's part insect.
[01:58:01.742 --> 01:58:05.825]  Oh, we don't want you to know that corn in studies caused all sorts of birth defects.
[01:58:05.825 --> 01:58:07.605]  Oh, I mean, just on and on and on.
[01:58:07.605 --> 01:58:09.467]  Professor, great having you on.
[01:58:09.467 --> 01:58:11.868]  I look forward to talking to you again in the future when I've had a chance to read the book.
[01:58:12.268 --> 01:58:13.188]  See you next week.
[01:58:13.188 --> 01:58:13.529]  You bet.
[01:58:13.529 --> 01:58:13.889]  Take care.
[01:58:13.889 --> 01:58:14.689]  See you next Thursday.
[01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:15.249]  All right.
[01:58:15.249 --> 01:58:15.750]  All right, buddy.
[01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:18.511]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:23.933]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this break.
[01:58:23.933 --> 01:58:31.677]  And then at 8 after, we've got Chris Vermonten with Key Intel coming up from what's going on down in Mexico with the U.N.
[01:58:31.677 --> 01:58:32.217]  meeting.
[01:58:32.217 --> 01:58:35.738]  I've got some other important news I want to hit on in the brief segment coming up.
[01:58:35.738 --> 01:58:38.179]  Hour number 3 is 70 seconds away.

[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:56.962]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.962 --> 02:00:05.647]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.647 --> 02:00:06.948]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.948 --> 02:00:08.709]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:10.470]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.071]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:13.612]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.612 --> 02:00:17.794]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.794 --> 02:00:21.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.647 --> 02:00:33.690]  You're watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:33.690 --> 02:00:36.593]  We punched up Fox News Live.
[02:00:36.593 --> 02:00:37.674]  And it makes no sense.
[02:00:37.674 --> 02:00:38.995]  We've been watching it for a while.
[02:00:38.995 --> 02:00:42.419]  This is police burning down a California bomb home.
[02:00:44.383 --> 02:00:45.884]  I mean, what does that mean?
[02:00:45.884 --> 02:00:53.788]  I mean, if they think there's a bomb in there, why would they burn it down instead of going in and defusing it or using a robot?
[02:00:53.788 --> 02:01:05.813]  Authorities have set fire to a suburban San Diego home, they say, was so packed with homemade explosives, they had no choice but to burn it to the ground.
[02:01:05.813 --> 02:01:07.134]  Okay.
[02:01:07.134 --> 02:01:08.434]  Who knows if that's even true now?
[02:01:08.434 --> 02:01:10.175]  I mean, they're burning the evidence down?
[02:01:10.175 --> 02:01:11.116]  Authorities are using
[02:01:13.134 --> 02:01:13.854]  Blow that up for me.
[02:01:13.854 --> 02:01:15.956]  I can't read it across the room, thanks.
[02:01:15.956 --> 02:01:18.578]  Again, I'm reading it off a telescreen across the room here.
[02:01:18.578 --> 02:01:27.203]  Authorities are using helicopters and air pollution sensors to monitor the controlled burn for potential health problems.
[02:01:27.203 --> 02:01:37.330]  The house was rented by an out-of-work software consultant who allegedly assembled an astonishing quantity of bomb-making material that included chemicals used by Middle Eastern suicide bombers.
[02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:40.752]  Investigators are still trying to understand his motivation.
[02:01:40.752 --> 02:01:43.753]  Authorities say the fire should be over within a few hours.
[02:01:43.753 --> 02:01:50.197]  Well, obviously it's a type of explosive they believe isn't going to blow up, but I mean, will they show up at my house?
[02:01:50.197 --> 02:01:56.360]  That I guess I might have a bag of black cats and smoke bombs left over from 4th of July.
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:59.202]  I mean, are they going to, uh,
[02:02:02.216 --> 02:02:03.537]  This is crazy.
[02:02:03.537 --> 02:02:08.061]  I mean, are they going to blow my house up and say, oh, there were bombs in there.
[02:02:08.061 --> 02:02:09.522]  We had to burn it up, though.
[02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:16.147]  You know, they did that to get rid of the witnesses that the government had staged the Madrid bombings, what, six, seven years ago.
[02:02:16.147 --> 02:02:19.450]  And it came out that that was staged in the Spanish news.
[02:02:19.450 --> 02:02:24.254]  And so they just went and blew up the entire apartment building that the terrorists were supposedly in.
[02:02:24.254 --> 02:02:25.455]  That's how you get rid of your witnesses.
[02:02:25.455 --> 02:02:27.056]  You just blow the whole building up.
[02:02:27.056 --> 02:02:29.959]  That is very suspicious, what you're seeing right there.
[02:02:30.239 --> 02:02:32.880]  How are they going to prosecute this supposed person in court?
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.321]  I mean, how do we know anything?
[02:02:34.321 --> 02:02:39.163]  I don't believe a word they say, especially the San Diego PD.
[02:02:39.163 --> 02:02:39.563]  Who knows?
[02:02:39.563 --> 02:02:40.243]  It might be true.
[02:02:40.243 --> 02:02:42.104]  It's just insane.
[02:02:42.104 --> 02:02:52.068]  Eight police officers seriously injured in battle with a mob of anarchists, probably their own officers, outside Parliament as the MPs vote through the rise in student fees.
[02:02:52.768 --> 02:02:58.169]  We're going to come back with Lord Monckton here in just a moment, but first I want to tell you about an amazing Christmas gift.
[02:02:58.169 --> 02:03:01.570]  I know that'll make those that are waging war against Christmas mad, but I will say it.
[02:03:01.570 --> 02:03:04.030]  Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
[02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:09.811]  Continuing, Renew Tech Solutions is offering the ultimate knife at the ultimate price, the Fox Karambit.

[02:05:01.673 --> 02:05:09.756]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:09.756 --> 02:05:12.317]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:12.317 --> 02:05:17.699]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:17.699 --> 02:05:20.740]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:22.801]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:23.041 --> 02:05:29.306]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:29.306 --> 02:05:32.688]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:32.688 --> 02:05:38.472]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:38.472 --> 02:05:40.113]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:40.113 --> 02:05:41.414]  I can't stress this enough.

[02:05:44.076 --> 02:05:48.299]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[02:07:00.728 --> 02:07:05.271]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.271 --> 02:07:06.192]  Number 1.
[02:07:06.192 --> 02:07:09.615]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.615 --> 02:07:10.475]  Number 2.
[02:07:10.475 --> 02:07:15.359]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.359 --> 02:07:16.099]  It's true.
[02:07:16.099 --> 02:07:20.983]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.983 --> 02:07:21.804]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.804 --> 02:07:25.386]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.386 --> 02:07:29.109]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.289 --> 02:07:30.090]  Number 4.
[02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:32.852]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.852 --> 02:07:36.535]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.535 --> 02:07:37.315]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.315 --> 02:07:41.478]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.478 --> 02:07:46.222]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.522 --> 02:07:50.689]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:06.397 --> 02:08:11.179]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:11.179 --> 02:08:12.739]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.739 --> 02:08:14.280]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:18.441]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.441 --> 02:08:22.463]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.247 --> 02:08:26.288]  Well, the headlines are everywhere.
[02:08:26.288 --> 02:08:34.331]  Record cold temperatures in Cancun for the Global Government Summit that Laura Christopher Moncton is attending and covering.
[02:08:34.331 --> 02:08:38.673]  And we're going to be going to him in just a moment from the Yucatan Peninsula in Cancun.
[02:08:40.091 --> 02:08:42.273]  Southern Mexico.
[02:08:42.273 --> 02:08:55.344]  Here's this week news reporting irony alert the unusually chilly global warming summit in Cancun the reporting record low temperatures areas of Europe are reporting the coldest temperature since the 1560s the 1650s 1670s
[02:08:59.548 --> 02:09:09.717]  Mrs. Monckton, the wife of the third Viscount of Brinchley and Monckton, she can't get out of the house in Scotland for 14 days because they're snowed in.
[02:09:09.717 --> 02:09:14.981]  I talked to Paul Watson, who's over in England, it's just the coldest in his lifetime he's seen.
[02:09:14.981 --> 02:09:18.324]  Now that doesn't mean the earth is necessarily getting colder.
[02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:21.807]  Every time there's a hot summer, they say it means we're getting warmer.
[02:09:21.807 --> 02:09:25.109]  You have to go through long periods, you have to study it.
[02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:27.931]  There's always micro-climates that are having extreme weather.
[02:09:27.931 --> 02:09:33.376]  But it does illustrate that we know in the last 15 years, the warming trend stopped.
[02:09:34.036 --> 02:09:36.557]  And it's now going down.
[02:09:36.557 --> 02:09:39.078]  But we hope for a warming trend.
[02:09:39.078 --> 02:09:41.179]  We hope for more carbon dioxide.
[02:09:41.179 --> 02:09:42.059]  That's the science.
[02:09:42.059 --> 02:09:45.280]  We've gone over that with Lord Monckton at Nauseam.
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:53.843]  His website, scienceandpublicpolicy.org, really is the preeminent site to really get the true research.
[02:09:53.843 --> 02:09:58.745]  But instead of going over just the background, I want to talk about what they're politically trying.
[02:09:58.745 --> 02:10:01.286]  They've shifted from saying the sky is falling warming to
[02:10:02.046 --> 02:10:12.212]  Overpopulation, Ted Turner saying get rid of people, they've got TV ads running showing children being blown up by explosives if they don't agree to cut their carbon footprint.
[02:10:12.212 --> 02:10:19.897]  They're calling for eco-fascism and calling it fascism and saying green fascism is good, not about the environment.
[02:10:19.897 --> 02:10:22.118]  None of us who have children want a bad environment.
[02:10:22.478 --> 02:10:33.708]  It's about power grabs and collectivism, and Lord Monckton, to give us a rundown for the next 50 minutes, graciously just got to his hotel out of a storm there with the police escorting him.
[02:10:33.708 --> 02:10:37.931]  It sounded like a tornado or a tempest was going on around him.
[02:10:37.931 --> 02:10:49.861]  He's now gotten to cover, and we're going to talk to him via cell phone from Cancun, Mexico, with so much happening as a global freeze hits much of the planet.
[02:10:49.861 --> 02:10:50.462]  Good to have you, sir.
[02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.578]  Well, it's very good to be with you, Alex.
[02:10:53.578 --> 02:10:58.580]  I'm now actually in the Security Centre at the Cancun Conference Centre.
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:03.222]  I've finally managed to get in, and there was quite a wind blowing outside.
[02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:08.204]  It's just a terrain which is colder than it's been since we've been here.
[02:11:08.204 --> 02:11:18.329]  In fact, now five days, they have had colder temperatures here in Cancun than have ever been recorded at this time of year since records began.
[02:11:18.789 --> 02:11:20.109]  So this is very exceptional.
[02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:22.150]  You've heard about my lovely wife, Lady Monckton.
[02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:23.970]  She has snowed up at home.
[02:11:23.970 --> 02:11:30.771]  The Central England temperature record showing the coldest first week of December since 1659.
[02:11:30.771 --> 02:11:40.393]  And you're quite right, Alex, to put in that cautionary note about how this doesn't mean there's no such thing as global warming or we can't be having an effect on the planet.
[02:11:40.393 --> 02:11:47.414]  What it does mean, and again you're quite right about this, is that the rate at which this global warming is supposed to be occurring
[02:11:47.834 --> 02:12:09.719]  Simply isn't happening, and in fact, truth of the matter is that in the last 15 years, as Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia was recently compelled to admit when I got BBC to ask him a question about it, there has been no statistically significant global warming at all for 15 years.
[02:12:09.719 --> 02:12:15.901]  This is beginning to be long a period to be altogether ignored as simply a blip.
[02:12:16.281 --> 02:12:27.364]  It is beginning very much to look as though, exactly as the likes of me have been saying all along, we- yes, we may get some warming, but it will be very slow, and it will be very harmless.
[02:12:27.364 --> 02:12:28.905]  It's not going to be a problem.
[02:12:28.905 --> 02:12:43.409]  However, the delegates here in Cancun are exactly the usual kind of robotic crowd of enviro-zombies that you would expect to find at these things, and they are getting around saying the planet's doomed, as you've rightly pointed out.
[02:12:44.409 --> 02:13:08.130]  Ted Turner is beginning to say what we've got to have is a global one-child policy and that dreadful movie made in the UK by one of these taxpayer-funded pressure groups showing children being blown up and their blood spattered over their classmates because they had not been willing to agree with their teacher that global warming was the worstest problem ever.
[02:13:08.770 --> 02:13:20.043]  That is the kind of hysteria that you always get when those who have been peddling a lie realize that they're not going to be able to get away with it for very much longer.
[02:13:20.043 --> 02:13:21.805]  And, are you still there?
[02:13:22.978 --> 02:13:36.826]  And one delegate recently said to one of my colleagues here, he said, oh yes, and of course my colleague up there on the rostrum is talking about how terrible global warming is privately there, he said, we know perfectly well that it isn't.
[02:13:36.826 --> 02:13:46.211]  But our government has told us to say this because it sees an advantage to itself against its taxpayers and against the people of the world in pretending that there is a problem.
[02:13:46.571 --> 02:13:53.897]  So there is a growing willingness on the part of solar delegates here to admit that they personally don't believe a word of this nonsense.
[02:13:53.897 --> 02:14:01.684]  Of course you have all the extremist groups here, the Marxists, the Greenies, and the two are virtually indistinguishable in the policies they advocate these days.
[02:14:01.684 --> 02:14:03.805]  They are all here in profusion.
[02:14:03.805 --> 02:14:05.847]  Every sort of weird organisation.
[02:14:05.847 --> 02:14:09.830]  There are gender-sensitive women against climate change.
[02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:12.653]  There are people dressed up as polar bears.
[02:14:12.653 --> 02:14:14.835]  All this kind of stupidity goes on.
[02:14:15.695 --> 02:14:22.157]  But behind it all, Alex, I think there is a considerable change in tone.
[02:14:22.157 --> 02:14:43.122]  What is beginning to happen is, compared with the triumphalism of Copenhagen and Poznan and Bali the previous three years, the annual jamborees of taxpayers' expense all round the world at exotic locations, what we're getting here is a much more sullen, sober, even somber mood.
[02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:49.107]  People here are beginning to realize they aren't going to get away with this for very much longer.
[02:14:49.107 --> 02:15:09.566]  And so, contrary to the reports that you have seen in the newspapers about how nothing very much is going to happen here in Cancun, the bureaucracy, which is trying desperately to turn itself into a world government, having failed to do so when the World Government Treaty at Copenhagen was simply thrown out,
[02:15:10.206 --> 02:15:19.679]  Now they're trying to do it by stealth with a series of decisions at this conference which the chairman of the conference, I've seen her note on this, thinks they're going to get away with.
[02:15:19.679 --> 02:15:26.989]  Creating several hundred new bureaucracies, a hundred billion dollars per year from now and forever.
[02:15:27.509 --> 02:15:33.972]  from the wealthier nations of the West to be paid to the new world government.
[02:15:33.972 --> 02:15:46.538]  And this will go up to 1.5% of GDP if one of the options on the paper is stopped, which it may well be, giving this new world government a permanent revenue which will permanently grow as GDP grows.
[02:15:46.538 --> 02:15:52.981]  So we're looking at a really ambitious power grab by the nasty people who are behind this scam.
[02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:54.862]  I'm quite worried they may yet
[02:15:55.282 --> 02:15:56.063]  Get away with it.
[02:15:56.063 --> 02:15:59.645]  I think they are going to get away with most of what I've just described here.
[02:15:59.645 --> 02:16:02.207]  And once they've got it, it'll be like the EU.
[02:16:02.207 --> 02:16:09.092]  Give them the money and give them the power, and then they become unstoppable, and they'll get more money and more power until they run anything.
[02:16:09.092 --> 02:16:09.713]  And, of course...
[02:16:10.693 --> 02:16:15.574]  Not one of these people is elected by us, the peoples of the world.
[02:16:15.574 --> 02:16:33.079]  It is all a dictatorship which is gradually taking power from democratic nations and from the leaders and elected representatives of those nations and putting it into the hands of faithless bureaucrats who we cannot elect, cannot question, cannot hold to account, cannot remove, and cannot reflect.
[02:16:33.079 --> 02:16:38.061]  Okay, now going back in past years, they were arrogant, they were celebratory,
[02:16:39.582 --> 02:16:42.364]  They would have these huge parties.
[02:16:42.364 --> 02:16:43.905]  They were the saviors of the earth.
[02:16:43.905 --> 02:16:47.809]  Now, they're becoming a global laughingstock.
[02:16:47.809 --> 02:16:56.356]  But as you said, they're now burrowing down, realizing their time is short, everything that's invested in this, and they're trying to get it through.
[02:16:56.356 --> 02:17:02.681]  But last year, you were instrumental in helping distribute the Danish text and analyzing it.
[02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:06.884]  The third world learned that it would basically double the amount of taxes
[02:17:07.816 --> 02:17:09.978]  that they had to pay versus the West.
[02:17:09.978 --> 02:17:17.323]  It wasn't the freebie giveaway, that it was a death sentence to over a billion people cutting their energy.
[02:17:17.323 --> 02:17:21.106]  It's now admitted this is about shutting down industrialized societies.
[02:17:21.106 --> 02:17:25.109]  So, how are they trying to ram this through?
[02:17:25.109 --> 02:17:28.471]  What is in the different texts that you've been able to see?
[02:17:28.471 --> 02:17:31.633]  Are there any secret treaties, like last time?
[02:17:31.633 --> 02:17:33.335]  Give us the intel, Lord Monckton.
[02:17:34.278 --> 02:17:43.325]  Uh, what they've done this time is they've done what one of the senior officials here, who also doesn't believe a word of this, as I say, there's a growing kind of rift in the loot now.
[02:17:43.325 --> 02:17:49.751]  You can see more and more people getting ready to jump ship as they see it going glug glug glug down beneath the waves.
[02:17:49.751 --> 02:17:53.334]  One of them said, he said, what they're going for is an approach called
[02:17:53.974 --> 02:17:56.296]  Transparent impenetrability.
[02:17:56.296 --> 02:18:10.066]  And what this means is that everything I've just described to you, this extra money and the extra bureaucracies, they're all listed, they're all specified in the documents which are openly available and which nobody, including the delegates, actually reads.
[02:18:10.066 --> 02:18:14.189]  The notes by the chair on the expected outcome of this conference.
[02:18:14.489 --> 02:18:14.910]  We're good to go.
[02:18:33.005 --> 02:18:35.407]  It's 33 pages long.
[02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:42.971]  It's written in the most obscurantist, obfuscatory, obnubilating style, which is enough to send anybody to sleep.
[02:18:42.971 --> 02:18:52.916]  And unless you know what the code words mean, you'd never realise just how much of an expansion of centralised, undemocratic power this whole exercise is.
[02:18:52.916 --> 02:18:54.717]  For instance, let me give you an example.
[02:18:54.717 --> 02:18:57.079]  You want a bit of a quote from these documents.
[02:18:57.079 --> 02:19:00.521]  They use a phrase called improving capacity building.
[02:19:01.041 --> 02:19:04.505]  In the least developed and less well-developed countries.
[02:19:04.505 --> 02:19:06.867]  And you think, that sounds wonderful.
[02:19:06.867 --> 02:19:13.374]  So you go and you talk to a few of the UN officials who draw up this garbage and you say, what does capacity building mean?
[02:19:13.374 --> 02:19:22.223]  And it's nothing to do with industrial capacity or economic capacity or the capacity to live a civilized life or educational capacity or health capacity.
[02:19:22.223 --> 02:19:22.343]  No.
[02:19:23.064 --> 02:19:24.926]  It's bureaucratic capacity.
[02:19:24.926 --> 02:19:42.159]  What capacity building means in these documents is that there are going to be vast bureaucracies established in these less developed countries, which will come directly under the control of our new masters, the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[02:19:42.159 --> 02:19:44.301]  That's what capacity building means.
[02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:46.062]  It occurs all the way through the treaties.
[02:19:46.062 --> 02:19:47.743]  It sounds wonderful when you read it.
[02:19:47.743 --> 02:19:51.226]  You think, oh, I'm really doing some good for the third world here.
[02:19:51.226 --> 02:19:51.747]  All they're doing
[02:19:52.467 --> 02:19:54.209]  He's putting in bureaucracies to govern them.
[02:19:54.209 --> 02:19:59.053]  You've got to rule them under the new neo-feudalism of the environmental iron fist.
[02:19:59.053 --> 02:20:00.394]  Stay with us, Lord Monckton.
[02:20:00.394 --> 02:20:01.435]  Back after this quick break.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.104]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:20:06.104 --> 02:20:10.608]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:20:10.608 --> 02:20:16.774]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:20:16.774 --> 02:20:19.196]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:20:19.196 --> 02:20:25.182]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:20:25.282 --> 02:20:28.685]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:20:28.685 --> 02:20:30.567]  There is no other program of its kind.

[02:22:00.971 --> 02:22:02.152]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:22:02.152 --> 02:22:09.120]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.683]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:22:11.683 --> 02:22:17.108]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:22:17.108 --> 02:22:20.051]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:22:20.051 --> 02:22:21.373]  The crazy part is, he's
[02:22:21.493 --> 02:22:22.353]  That's usually right.
[02:22:22.353 --> 02:22:28.655]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:22:28.655 --> 02:22:32.036]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:22:32.036 --> 02:22:37.858]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:22:37.858 --> 02:22:39.498]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:22:39.498 --> 02:22:40.818]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:22:40.818 --> 02:22:43.499]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:22:43.499 --> 02:22:47.740]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:50.321]  You can find the video at www.gm.com.

[02:22:52.282 --> 02:22:53.423]  That's End of America.

[02:23:45.069 --> 02:23:46.750]  We're sending out an S.O.S.
[02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:47.410]  against tyranny.
[02:23:47.410 --> 02:23:47.830]  Ted Turner,
[02:24:12.508 --> 02:24:18.129]  Third biggest landowner in the world, behind the Queen of England and Dutch royalty.
[02:24:18.129 --> 02:24:20.110]  He owns two million acres in the US.
[02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:21.370]  He has five children.
[02:24:21.370 --> 02:24:25.831]  He has more than 20 aircraft, more than a dozen homes.
[02:24:25.831 --> 02:24:34.513]  He flies in on his private jet, and then lectures us we shouldn't take a hot shower, we shouldn't have more than one child, we shouldn't take a hot bath.
[02:24:34.513 --> 02:24:39.974]  People all over England, old people being cut off their gas allowance, are having to ride around in buses to stay warm.
[02:24:39.974 --> 02:24:41.014]  The Guardian reports.
[02:24:41.014 --> 02:24:41.274]  But!
[02:24:42.134 --> 02:24:47.639]  There's plenty of gas and power for all the rich people in the U.S.
[02:24:47.639 --> 02:24:51.342]  and England that stand to make money off the carbon tax.
[02:24:51.342 --> 02:25:01.790]  Lord Monckton, I heard that you've been trying to track down Mr. Eugenics, Mr. Green, Green, Himmler, Hare, Ted Turner.
[02:25:03.126 --> 02:25:04.246]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:25:04.246 --> 02:25:22.171]  The Graf von Unto Turner, he was attending a business conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel a couple of days ago, here on the Sandy Strip at Cancun, and I gatecrashed the conference and went around it for a bit, until eventually the organisers came along and chased me out.
[02:25:22.171 --> 02:25:30.473]  And they said, you're not allowed in here, the only people who are allowed into this conference are people who believe that global warming is the worstest possible problem ever in the world.
[02:25:31.053 --> 02:25:31.954]  And you're not allowed in.
[02:25:31.954 --> 02:25:33.835]  It was sort of baby talk they used.
[02:25:33.835 --> 02:25:35.636]  And I said, but I want to meet Mr. Turner.
[02:25:35.636 --> 02:25:37.097]  I'd like to issue a challenge to him.
[02:25:37.097 --> 02:25:43.280]  I'd like to provide some entertainment for the delegates here by having a one-to-one debate with him in front of them.
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.862]  Or is he going to run away and are you going to run away?
[02:25:45.862 --> 02:25:47.583]  He said, no sir, you're going to run away.
[02:25:47.583 --> 02:25:49.784]  We don't want your sort here.
[02:25:49.784 --> 02:25:54.547]  So clearly there is a reluctance on the part of Mr. Turner to face
[02:25:55.487 --> 02:25:59.749]  The amiable peer of the realm, Lord Monckton, on a debate about the climate.
[02:25:59.749 --> 02:26:00.909]  And why might that be?
[02:26:00.909 --> 02:26:07.752]  Well, I suspect it's the same reason, Ted, baby, as Al, baby, when I threatened to debate him.
[02:26:07.752 --> 02:26:09.573]  I sent a challenge to Al Gore.
[02:26:09.573 --> 02:26:10.953]  He also backed off.
[02:26:10.953 --> 02:26:15.075]  In fact, he's been backing off and running away for nearly four years now.
[02:26:15.075 --> 02:26:23.418]  So, Ted, if you're going to join the run, join the panic, join the escape, then you just avoid debating with me face to face.
[02:26:23.418 --> 02:26:24.959]  I'll debate with you, Ted, baby.
[02:26:25.419 --> 02:26:40.034]  Anywhere in the world, on international television, and we'll take any format of debate that you like, as long as it's reasonably fair, and then you and I will go head-to-head, and we'll argue this thing out, and let's see who prevails.
[02:26:40.034 --> 02:26:45.260]  Now, uh, Alex, what I would advise is whatever you do, don't hold your breath.
[02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:52.184]  Waiting for a reply from Ted Turner any more than you would have done if you've waited for a reply from Al Gore.
[02:26:52.184 --> 02:27:10.377]  I'm getting to run out of white feathers on my estate to send to these people who are backing out of this debate because they know perfectly well, just as the delegates here, many of them privately are now admitting they know perfectly well, that there is no global warming problem.
[02:27:10.377 --> 02:27:12.018]  It is simply a chimera.
[02:27:12.018 --> 02:27:15.380]  It is simply a device used by people who have
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:19.041]  Other agendas which are extremely nasty.
[02:27:19.041 --> 02:27:26.283]  Here we are effectively trying to reinstall global fascism, having just got rid of it in Europe.
[02:27:26.283 --> 02:27:32.645]  Now here we are reinstalling global fascism in the name of saving the planet.
[02:27:32.645 --> 02:27:40.847]  And as you and I know, Alex, the planet was triumphantly saved 2,000 years ago, and it doesn't need to be saved again.
[02:27:41.147 --> 02:27:52.113]  Expanding on that, James Cameron issued challenges to leading global warming skeptics, and then when leading one stepped forward, he chickened out.
[02:27:52.113 --> 02:27:57.796]  They will not debate it, and they know deep down it's an excuse to have a managed takeover economy.
[02:27:57.796 --> 02:28:00.237]  A lot of them are on record admitting that.
[02:28:00.237 --> 02:28:04.059]  What percentage of the higher-ups know it's a complete fraud?
[02:28:04.059 --> 02:28:07.021]  I mean, we know from their internal emails they know it's a fraud.
[02:28:07.301 --> 02:28:16.248]  And that they've got to hide the truth, but I mean, what percentage of them know it's a fraud, and then you've got the people in polar bear outfits, you know, running around?
[02:28:16.248 --> 02:28:23.013]  I mean, I see more and more of the camp followers realizing they were on some type of Jim Jones cult compound.
[02:28:24.911 --> 02:28:26.972]  That's a very good description of this place, I must say.
[02:28:26.972 --> 02:28:28.972]  It is a very curious religion.
[02:28:28.972 --> 02:28:36.014]  Let's start with your point about whether the higher-ups know what's really going on, that they know that there isn't a problem.
[02:28:36.014 --> 02:28:37.234]  Let me give you an example.
[02:28:37.234 --> 02:28:51.778]  At last year's Copenhagen conference, one of my colleagues here, Wolfgang MÃ¼ller, from the German division of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which I represent here at this conference, he was standing next to one of the two
[02:28:52.618 --> 02:28:53.078]  Delegates.
[02:28:53.078 --> 02:28:57.540]  Official delegates from Pakistan, which is one of the state's parties to the convention.
[02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:00.581]  And the other delegate was up on the stage speaking about how terrible it all was.
[02:29:00.581 --> 02:29:03.503]  We were having floods, we were having droughts, and we were having this, we were having that.
[02:29:03.503 --> 02:29:05.844]  It was all ghastly, and it was all because of our fault.
[02:29:05.844 --> 02:29:19.609]  And quietly the other delegate said, he knows, and I know, that there's not a word of truth in any of that, and that the whole of this thing is just nonsense that we've been told by our government to say.
[02:29:19.609 --> 02:29:21.190]  And so that's what we have to say.
[02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:27.611]  Lord Monckton, Lord Monckton, we've got to go to break and that's just as well because you just covered some key info.
[02:29:27.611 --> 02:29:30.252]  Your phone for the first time was breaking up.
[02:29:30.252 --> 02:29:34.892]  Let's perhaps re-establish the line or see if it clears up during the break.
[02:29:34.892 --> 02:29:44.454]  I want you to come back because that takes us to the WikiLeaks cable, which the State Department admits is real, which you covered without having the secret documents that the U.S.
[02:29:44.454 --> 02:29:49.435]  and England were in their twisting arms last year and promising people payoffs if they went along.
[02:29:52.082 --> 02:29:55.092]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.092 --> 02:29:58.684]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.961 --> 02:30:06.985]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.985 --> 02:30:10.229]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:10.229 --> 02:30:15.034]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:15.034 --> 02:30:21.421]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:21.421 --> 02:30:23.644]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:24.184 --> 02:30:24.484]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:24.484 --> 02:30:25.004]  Bernanke?
[02:30:25.004 --> 02:30:25.664]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:25.664 --> 02:30:26.765]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.765 --> 02:30:29.185]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:43.089 --> 02:30:50.358]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:30:50.358 --> 02:30:59.489]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:03.442 --> 02:31:07.403]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:07.403 --> 02:31:16.264]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:16.264 --> 02:31:20.885]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.885 --> 02:31:31.707]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:32.347 --> 02:31:41.849]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.849 --> 02:31:47.291]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:47.291 --> 02:31:54.772]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.772 --> 02:31:57.513]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.541]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:02.541 --> 02:32:09.484]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:09.484 --> 02:32:12.026]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:12.026 --> 02:32:17.408]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:17.408 --> 02:32:20.450]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:22.511]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.771 --> 02:32:29.016]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:29.016 --> 02:32:32.398]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:32.398 --> 02:32:38.182]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:39.823]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.823 --> 02:32:41.124]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:41.124 --> 02:32:43.806]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.806 --> 02:32:48.029]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:48.029 --> 02:32:50.051]  You can find the video at www.
[02:32:50.811 --> 02:32:52.632]  End of America 3.com.
[02:32:52.632 --> 02:32:55.214]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:55.214 --> 02:32:59.077]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:59.077 --> 02:33:00.057]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:33:01.971 --> 02:33:16.478]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:33:16.478 --> 02:33:25.463]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:33:25.463 --> 02:33:27.784]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:31.527 --> 02:33:37.052]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:37.052 --> 02:33:42.196]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:42.196 --> 02:33:45.098]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:33:45.098 --> 02:33:47.641]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:33:47.641 --> 02:33:50.143]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:33:52.245 --> 02:33:58.590]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:33:58.590 --> 02:34:05.455]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:34:05.455 --> 02:34:10.439]  Chloride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:34:10.439 --> 02:34:13.321]  Turns out the government has the right, under U.S.
[02:34:13.321 --> 02:34:17.584]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:34:17.584 --> 02:34:20.567]  We have to work the dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:34:21.858 --> 02:34:25.840]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.161]  Well, join me.
[02:34:27.161 --> 02:34:29.522]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:34:29.522 --> 02:34:32.864]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:34:32.864 --> 02:34:39.168]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:34:49.525 --> 02:34:53.189]  Lord Christopher Monckton joins us.
[02:34:53.189 --> 02:35:04.020]  His website and organization is the leading think tank really laying out the facts of this global takeover and we are beginning to win battles and the war.
[02:35:04.961 --> 02:35:07.642]  Science and public policy dot o-r-g.
[02:35:07.642 --> 02:35:12.685]  Our sites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:12.685 --> 02:35:17.488]  We are fighting the prison planet, the collectivist and their elitist owners.
[02:35:17.488 --> 02:35:19.629]  See, the ultra-rich, many of them are in a camp.
[02:35:20.029 --> 02:35:21.110]  Not liking free market.
[02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:25.274]  They want to use government to shut everybody else down because they can't compete.
[02:35:25.274 --> 02:35:31.919]  And Lord Monckton is fighting them and routing them to the ends of the earth and they run from him in literal fear.
[02:35:31.919 --> 02:35:33.861]  I've seen video activists have shot.
[02:35:33.861 --> 02:35:43.670]  It is as if the mild-mannered Lord is Darth Vader or something or a giant bucket of holy water to a vampire.
[02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:45.551]  Now, I had the London Guardian
[02:35:46.292 --> 02:36:00.595]  Report here, Lord Monckton, where they admit, and the State Department admits this in its anger, they admit it's a real cable, that other governments were all freaked out by the threats, the bribes, the promises of money, the arm-twisting.
[02:36:00.595 --> 02:36:11.398]  We see the United States at the center, along with Gordon Brown, the disgraced Prime Minister, former Prime Minister, spearheading this, trying to ram it through on people.
[02:36:11.398 --> 02:36:14.979]  And you knew that at the time, but now that's all come out.
[02:36:15.339 --> 02:36:25.706]  And that was mirroring what you were talking about, the Pakistani minister who's been promised money, up there spewing all this, it's the end of the world, oh my gosh, the West did it because they've been promised money.
[02:36:25.706 --> 02:36:26.947]  This is now confirmed.
[02:36:26.947 --> 02:36:29.449]  It just shows what incredible fraud this is.
[02:36:30.998 --> 02:36:36.261]  The whole thing is nonsense, but let's be nice to the bedwetters.
[02:36:36.261 --> 02:36:53.770]  Let's make this Be Nice to Bedwetters Week, and let us pretend, just for the sake of argument, Alex, that in fact there is every bit as much of a global warming problem as the United Nations would like to imagine.
[02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:57.332]  It is, of course, imaginary, but it is... Let's just pretend.
[02:36:58.072 --> 02:37:00.055]  Just for the sake of a game.
[02:37:00.055 --> 02:37:00.835]  All right.
[02:37:00.835 --> 02:37:16.253]  Now we know that at this conference they are going to try to bully the countries of the West, who are all too eager, most of them, to comply, to hand over a hundred billion dollars of Western taxpayers' money
[02:37:17.034 --> 02:37:18.335]  To the UN.
[02:37:18.335 --> 02:37:33.285]  Of course, the name of the game is this is supposed to go to third world countries to help them to adapt to the consequences of the terrible global warming that we in the West have caused by our emissions of carbon dioxide.
[02:37:33.285 --> 02:37:36.588]  But, let's just pretend for a moment that they're right.
[02:37:36.588 --> 02:37:42.091]  A hundred billion dollars a year is a trillion dollars every ten years.
[02:37:44.853 --> 02:38:04.012]  Now the thing is this, that in order to forestall just one Celsius degree of warming, if the US government was right in its figures for how much the Waxman-Markey bill would cost, which had a fairly typical lot of range of measures like cap and trade and regulations on emissions and all that kind of thing,
[02:38:04.592 --> 02:38:19.563]  Then you would need to spend a hundred billion dollars a year for three hundred and forty years in order to forestall just one Celsius degree of warming.
[02:38:19.563 --> 02:38:24.347]  That Al Gore says is going to make all the coastal cities disappear within seven years.
[02:38:24.347 --> 02:38:28.090]  So, a three hundred year solution to a seven year problem.
[02:38:29.701 --> 02:38:47.095]  That's right, and not only that, but if you wanted to forestall all 3.4 degrees Celsius, which is about 6 Fahrenheit of warming, which the UN says might happen on the globe by 2100 in the next hundred years, then it would take you 1000 years of spending
[02:38:50.317 --> 02:38:51.157]  We're good to go.
[02:39:13.866 --> 02:39:19.113]  Supposing we spend all this money, how much global warming will we actually forestall?
[02:39:19.113 --> 02:39:23.258]  It's all been done on the basis that if we spend the money, maybe it will make a contribution.
[02:39:23.258 --> 02:39:27.683]  Nobody has worked out that in fact it makes practically no difference at all.
[02:39:27.683 --> 02:39:31.949]  So even if there were a problem as big as these nitwits here, there is,
[02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:43.653]  The fact is that all the spending that they are proposing to make, and it's critically expensive spending, would not make anything like enough difference even to begin to show the problem.
[02:39:43.653 --> 02:39:56.957]  And this leads to the obvious conclusion that if there were to be any problems arising from warmer weather, and frankly if you find any global warming, send us some in Scotland, my lovely wife could do it pretty badly, then if there really were,
[02:39:57.797 --> 02:40:16.362]  What we would simply do is to say, look, we'd be better off adapting to the warmer weather and its consequences in a focused way, as and only when necessary, rather than squandering all these billions and trillions now on what is an entirely futile exercise.
[02:40:18.544 --> 02:40:21.206]  Lord Monckton, you got cut off by the break earlier.
[02:40:21.206 --> 02:40:30.954]  You were trying to tell the story of the Pakistani minister telling you that the other Pakistani minister was just saying it because they've been promised money.
[02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:36.097]  That's now confirmed by the cables that this secret arm-twisting was going on.
[02:40:36.097 --> 02:40:39.200]  Recap that because your phone was breaking up at that time.
[02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:40.740]  Yes, certainly.
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:44.242]  This, in fact, I think I mistakenly said this was in Copenhagen last year.
[02:40:44.242 --> 02:40:57.747]  In fact, it was Bonn this year, at which one of my colleagues, Wolfgang MÃ¼ller, who is from the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which I also belong to, is an environmental group that believes in looking after the environment rather than worrying about global warming.
[02:40:59.568 --> 02:41:01.290]  We're here under their aegis.
[02:41:01.290 --> 02:41:10.638]  He was sitting next to one of the two Pakistani delegates at the discussions in Bonn, which were leading up to this conference here in Cancun.
[02:41:10.638 --> 02:41:18.886]  And the other delegate was up on the platform speaking and saying, oh, it's all terrible, we're doomed unless we shut down the economy to the West, all this kind of rubbish.
[02:41:19.526 --> 02:41:32.898]  And his colleague was sitting, talking to Wolfgang Muller, not really realising that we were on the other side of the face, and saying, could we both actually, none of us, believe a word of this nonsense, but our government has told us to say it.
[02:41:32.898 --> 02:41:35.641]  And of course we've seen this time and time again.
[02:41:36.081 --> 02:41:41.606]  Before, governments spinning in vehicles into changing their view and becoming alarmist.
[02:41:41.606 --> 02:41:50.334]  India has just decided it's going to change its view and start accepting compulsory caps on the amount of carbon dioxide it emits.
[02:41:50.334 --> 02:41:56.640]  And it's doing this, but almost certainly because somebody has obviously the very large sum of brine to do that.
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.944]  We had it in Russia when the Russian Academy of Sciences got a report from
[02:42:02.845 --> 02:42:22.776]  Dr. Andrei Illarionov, who was one of its key scientists, in 2004, saying, look, we've had a conference at which we invited sceptics and we invited the British government to send its chief scientist to tell us why there was a problem, and we had the sceptics as well, and the chief scientist, on realising the sceptics were there, walked out.
[02:42:22.776 --> 02:42:24.097]  He couldn't answer our questions.
[02:42:24.537 --> 02:42:37.747]  So, Ilarionov then made an impassioned speech saying that Sir David King, who was then the Chief Scientist, had let down the name of Britain, let down the name of Sir, and had certainly convinced him that there was no problem at all with global warming.
[02:42:37.747 --> 02:42:40.549]  Of course, King was trying to say the exact opposite.
[02:42:40.549 --> 02:42:50.397]  So, then six months later, Tony Blair went to see Gazputin, the new Tsar of all the Russians at that time, and said to him, look, if you want to get
[02:42:50.897 --> 02:42:59.459]  Entry into the World Trade Organization on highly favorable terms, we want you to shut Dr. Ilarionov and the Russian Academy of Sciences up.
[02:42:59.459 --> 02:43:03.540]  Get them to change their view and become a true believer in the new religion of global warming.
[02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:11.963]  Because that way, all of us in the governing class can, and I'm going to use a rude word here, can screw the ordinary people of the world.
[02:43:11.963 --> 02:43:17.024]  And of course, Putin changed his mind, ordered the Russian Academy to do the same.
[02:43:17.384 --> 02:43:19.165]  And so they then leak info.
[02:43:41.152 --> 02:43:52.689]  I stand up and say so, and that's how we get the WikiLeaks, that's how we get the Climategate emails, that's how we get the story from the Pakistan minister, that's how I got Andrei Illarionov to tell me personally what I've just told you.
[02:43:54.059 --> 02:43:54.680]  Unbelievable!
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:58.643]  So you were told directly by the head of the Russian Academy of Sciences that this went on.
[02:43:58.643 --> 02:44:04.108]  That is a huge news story in and of itself, showing how they do this by hook and by crook.
[02:44:04.108 --> 02:44:09.292]  Now, shifting gears, we know these people love to play the part of savior of the earth.
[02:44:09.292 --> 02:44:10.653]  They're also control freaks.
[02:44:11.574 --> 02:44:20.846]  The White House science czar agrees with Ted Turner in writings that he wants to sterilize us with chemicals in the water and he wants one-child policies.
[02:44:20.846 --> 02:44:28.535]  He's also told the Associated Press in the first press conference he gave almost two years ago that he wants to geoengineer the planet
[02:44:29.116 --> 02:44:33.342]  to save us from environmental degradation.
[02:44:33.342 --> 02:44:36.927]  And we know Bill Gates, who's pushing this, has bought the patents for it.
[02:44:36.927 --> 02:44:44.919]  So another way they want to tax us is for the world having to pay them to, quote, save us from the global warming
[02:44:45.219 --> 02:44:55.988]  Then they get to play the part of Superman, a savior of the world from Lex Luthor, the Boogeyman, Bizarro, and the rest of Superman's enemies.
[02:44:55.988 --> 02:44:57.970]  We have an Activist Post article.
[02:44:57.970 --> 02:45:02.594]  UN climate concern morphs into chemtrail glee club.
[02:45:03.314 --> 02:45:12.081]  And I've got all the different articles here where they're hopping around at the meeting trying to get rid of the UN treaty on geoengineering from decades ago.
[02:45:12.081 --> 02:45:13.782]  So what else?
[02:45:13.782 --> 02:45:20.427]  I mean, we cover the other official documents where they call for force relocating populations.
[02:45:20.427 --> 02:45:24.290]  I mean, what types of bizarre craziness are you hearing from these people?
[02:45:25.649 --> 02:45:33.455]  Well, of course they are talking of forced relocations because of the imagined sea level rise, which also, incidentally, isn't happening.
[02:45:33.455 --> 02:45:40.921]  Sea level is rising at around 8 inches to 1 foot per century, as it has done as best we can work it out for the last century and a half.
[02:45:40.921 --> 02:45:43.023]  Before that, the records aren't too good.
[02:45:43.023 --> 02:45:47.507]  But we can tell from ice cores and geological records that over the last
[02:45:48.848 --> 02:45:53.673]  Uh, 11,400 years, sea level has risen by more than 400 feet.
[02:45:53.673 --> 02:45:55.915]  That's close to four feet per century.
[02:45:55.915 --> 02:45:58.338]  Now we're down to less than one foot per century.
[02:45:58.338 --> 02:46:01.301]  Ooh, I'm not very terrified, are you?
[02:46:01.301 --> 02:46:08.309]  So yes, they then propose all these monstrous geoengineering programs, putting giant umbrellas made of aluminum
[02:46:08.769 --> 02:46:09.430]  We're good to go.
[02:46:24.893 --> 02:46:43.304]  They had overestimated the amount of cooling caused by that kind of pollution, and the figures were corrected last year in a paper by Gunnar Meyri, which is about to yet again change all the science, because it means that the warming effect of CO2, paradoxically, is a lot less than the UN had formerly thought.
[02:46:43.304 --> 02:46:50.128]  So we're getting all these people advocating more and more extreme, absurd, and above all expensive solutions.
[02:46:50.128 --> 02:46:52.349]  And also, of course, very immoral solutions.
[02:46:52.349 --> 02:46:53.790]  You know, the idea of saying to people,
[02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:57.754]  You could only have one child because we say so.
[02:46:57.754 --> 02:46:59.736]  It's outrageous.
[02:46:59.736 --> 02:47:07.905]  What they should be doing, but of course they won't do because they don't want to share their riches, is to make the poor people of the world richer.
[02:47:07.905 --> 02:47:09.146]  Because as populations
[02:47:09.366 --> 02:47:10.087]  I don't know.
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:32.061]  But all you have to do is make people more prosperous.
[02:47:32.061 --> 02:47:40.064]  That's the kind of geoengineering that the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow is in favour of, and so is the Science and Public Policy Institute.
[02:47:40.064 --> 02:47:56.009]  We visited just yesterday a village only 10 miles from where I'm standing in the conference hall, and that village had no electricity, no sanitation, no water, no school until a Catholic charity came and gave it one, and no healthcare.
[02:47:56.009 --> 02:47:58.230]  They have absolutely nothing except each other.
[02:47:58.930 --> 02:48:09.802]  And the Mexican government is spending all this money on airfare and conferences while its own people are starving because they don't have basic amenities like electricity.
[02:48:09.802 --> 02:48:12.345]  That's the kind of geoengineering I want to see.
[02:48:12.345 --> 02:48:14.167]  Electricity for everyone.
[02:48:14.167 --> 02:48:17.611]  Clean water and safe sewage disposal for everyone.
[02:48:19.633 --> 02:48:38.298]  That's the kind of geoengineering I want to see, but you won't hear much of that among the lunatics at this conference here in Cancun, and I hope you're getting the flavour, Alex, that I'm becoming very angry at this unwillingness of the world's governing class to listen to the needs of ordinary people around the world.
[02:48:38.638 --> 02:48:42.261]  It's bad enough that they spit in the face of democracy and try and take it away.
[02:48:42.261 --> 02:48:45.785]  It's bad enough that our freedom and our money are being taken away.
[02:48:45.785 --> 02:48:50.088]  But that they also kick the poor in the teeth while pretending to help them.
[02:48:50.088 --> 02:48:57.275]  That seems to me to be something they ought to fry for a very long time somewhere uncomfortable after this life is not in it.
[02:48:57.475 --> 02:48:58.515]  Well, that was my next point.
[02:48:58.515 --> 02:49:06.237]  I mean, Ted Turner, all of them, just write books, give speeches, dripping with venom, hating the third world.
[02:49:06.237 --> 02:49:18.780]  But even the Royal Commission in 49 in England found, if the third world was industrialized, they would get a negative population growth, just like has happened in Japan, Italy, England, the United States.
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:20.261]  Not only does it stabilize,
[02:49:21.181 --> 02:49:37.674]  For every two adults, man and woman, they start having 1.3, 1.4 children, that the West is actually dying, and the UN admits the third world's going to stabilize 2020 at about 8,200,000,000.
[02:49:37.674 --> 02:49:50.083]  So they know, they know by de-industrializing the first world, by freezing industrialization in the developing world, that it's a death sentence, and it will hurt the environment.
[02:49:50.083 --> 02:49:50.724]  They don't care.
[02:49:51.264 --> 02:49:58.530]  Well, I'm afraid you're understating it, Alex.
[02:49:58.530 --> 02:50:09.178]  I don't often say this to you, but really, I am so angry with these people because of their utter lack of concern, lack of thought, and lack of use of reason.
[02:50:09.178 --> 02:50:15.403]  What is it that differentiates us from all the other creatures in the visible creation?
[02:50:15.783 --> 02:50:20.084]  It is that we have the ability to use reason.
[02:50:20.084 --> 02:50:35.609]  And the entire governing class of the world, certainly, that part of it, which is assembled in large numbers here in Cancun, they are all as though they are in a lunatic asylum, as though they are simply, totally unable to use their minds at all.
[02:50:36.189 --> 02:50:43.213]  And of course, this is because they know, increasingly they know, that this whole climate rubbish is nonsense.
[02:50:43.213 --> 02:50:57.540]  But what they're doing is, they are exploiting it, they are profiting by it, they are making billions out of it, and they're making billions at our expense, and, worst of all, at the expense of the third world.
[02:50:57.540 --> 02:50:58.240]  They have no conscience.
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:50:59.881]  Stay there, stay there, final segment.
[02:50:59.881 --> 02:51:01.762]  We're going to talk about how we stop these monsters.
[02:51:02.182 --> 02:51:06.264]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:06.264 --> 02:51:10.766]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.766 --> 02:51:16.928]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.928 --> 02:51:19.369]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:19.369 --> 02:51:25.332]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.452 --> 02:51:28.855]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.855 --> 02:51:30.737]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.737 --> 02:51:32.919]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:52:09.543 --> 02:52:12.344]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:12.344 --> 02:52:16.746]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and
[02:52:16.766 --> 02:52:17.746]  And your own family.
[02:52:17.746 --> 02:52:20.688]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:20.688 --> 02:52:23.029]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:52:23.029 --> 02:52:29.312]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:29.312 --> 02:52:32.713]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:32.713 --> 02:52:38.516]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:38.516 --> 02:52:40.176]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:40.176 --> 02:52:41.477]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:52:41.477 --> 02:52:44.158]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:52:44.158 --> 02:52:45.599]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:52:45.859 --> 02:52:48.400]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:52.943]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:52:52.943 --> 02:52:55.564]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:50.061]  We're good to go.
[02:54:06.676 --> 02:54:16.621]  Yeah, there's a woman in the night starving to death and it's well documented these carbon cuts of energy will kill over a million people in the next decade.
[02:54:16.621 --> 02:54:21.584]  We're going back to Lord Crest, Vermont to talk about how we stop these people and
[02:54:22.344 --> 02:54:31.134]  Hopefully in the next few weeks or after Christmas we can get him on to talk about briefly the aftermath of this criminal consortium meeting down in Cancun.
[02:54:31.134 --> 02:54:36.581]  They're routed but they're dangerous and they're still taking over our societies at the local level.
[02:54:36.581 --> 02:54:37.842]  Before we go back to Lord Monckton...
[02:54:38.923 --> 02:54:39.844]  Silver's way up.
[02:54:39.844 --> 02:54:41.345]  Gold's way up.
[02:54:41.345 --> 02:54:44.348]  Midas Resources bought the silver and gold when it was lower.
[02:54:44.348 --> 02:54:47.511]  They're selling it to you when it's higher at the old low price.
[02:54:47.511 --> 02:54:53.576]  But Ted is running out of those silver dollars and silver half dollars and the francs and sovereigns at the lower price.
[02:54:53.576 --> 02:54:55.678]  You've got to tell them it's the radio special.
[02:54:55.678 --> 02:54:57.339]  I don't have time to get into all of it.
[02:54:57.339 --> 02:54:58.480]  Give them a call.
[02:54:58.480 --> 02:54:59.882]  Get into silver and gold today.
[02:55:00.282 --> 02:55:01.042]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:01.042 --> 02:55:07.244]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:07.244 --> 02:55:08.324]  My job's easy.
[02:55:08.324 --> 02:55:10.265]  I promote what I believe in.
[02:55:10.265 --> 02:55:13.005]  I've been telling you buy gold and silver for over a decade.
[02:55:13.005 --> 02:55:16.906]  When silver was $5 an ounce, when gold was $260 an ounce, did I steer you right?
[02:55:19.187 --> 02:55:20.588]  Get into Silver and Gold today.
[02:55:20.588 --> 02:55:20.829]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:20.829 --> 02:55:26.334]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Special to get the lower prices.
[02:55:26.334 --> 02:55:27.755]  The regular prices are great.
[02:55:27.755 --> 02:55:31.059]  We got about four minutes left, Lord Monckton, down there at the conference.
[02:55:31.059 --> 02:55:32.660]  Any other observations?
[02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:34.322]  How do we stop these people?
[02:55:34.322 --> 02:55:39.247]  What's the time frame on when we'll know if they were successful at this larcenous meeting?
[02:55:40.959 --> 02:55:41.660]  Right.
[02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:49.545]  In the next two days, we should hear whether or not they've come to the agreement I expect them to come to, and I've outlined the main points of that.
[02:55:49.545 --> 02:56:02.634]  Huge expansion of bureaucracy, huge expansion of taxation of the West by the UN, huge growth in the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention, which now has its own army, it has its own troops, effectively.
[02:56:02.634 --> 02:56:08.758]  You see them now wherever you go, these UN security people who are pretty nasty types.
[02:56:08.758 --> 02:56:10.619]  They're all ex-merceries as far as I'm concerned.
[02:56:11.159 --> 02:56:19.704]  This is growing into a kind of super state which exists wherever it decides to land and hold a conference.
[02:56:19.704 --> 02:56:20.945]  The way we stop it, I think...
[02:56:22.066 --> 02:56:23.486]  Well, he's not our president.
[02:56:23.486 --> 02:56:25.927]  He's a total globalist miscreant, but go ahead.
[02:56:25.927 --> 02:56:29.368]  Well, what I'm saying is I think that what we now need to do is for America needs to leave the UN.
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:57:09.692]  Leave the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, leave the IPCC, on the ground that they are all fraudulent, corrupt, and unduly expensive, and that American taxpayers can no longer have the money taken from them, and the UN be trusted to spend it.
[02:57:09.692 --> 02:57:19.598]  I think we've got to take that all away, leave it, we've got to found a new organisation called the United Democracies, in which only democratic countries will be allowed to participate,
[02:57:19.958 --> 02:57:31.384]  And the only people who will be allowed to speak for various nations at the United Democracies and its meetings will be people whom we, the people of the democratic world, have elected to represent us.
[02:57:31.384 --> 02:57:42.830]  Because one of the big dangers, Alex, as the supranational organisations like this grim, secretive Secretariat of the UN's UN Framework Convention, the danger is not one of these
[02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:44.691]  Absolutely, Lord Monckton!
[02:58:13.851 --> 02:58:17.593]  You've been very gracious.
[02:58:17.593 --> 02:58:22.797]  Hopefully you can join us right before Christmas in the aftermath or after Christmas or in the new year.
[02:58:22.797 --> 02:58:23.738]  Let us know what happened.
[02:58:23.738 --> 02:58:25.760]  We're blessed to have you there.
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:27.761]  And I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:58:27.761 --> 02:58:28.482]  Good luck down there.
[02:58:28.482 --> 02:58:29.923]  Be safe.
[02:58:29.923 --> 02:58:31.624]  Real pleasure and God bless America.
[02:58:31.624 --> 02:58:32.225]  All right.
[02:58:32.225 --> 02:58:32.805]  God bless you.
[02:58:32.805 --> 02:58:34.566]  Back live tomorrow with Rand Paul.
