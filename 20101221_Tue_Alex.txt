[00:00.000 --> 00:10.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.500 --> 00:11.500]  You want answers?
[00:11.500 --> 00:13.500]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.500 --> 00:23.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.100 --> 00:32.100]  It's Tuesday, December 21st, 2010. It's the Alex Jones show. I'll be your host for the first hour.
[00:32.100 --> 00:40.100]  Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for prisonplanet.com. Of course, Alex is taking a well-deserved break,
[00:40.100 --> 00:47.100]  but we've got some excellent on-court presentation interviews coming up in at the second and third hours
[00:47.100 --> 00:56.100]  with John Young of Crypto, talking about WikiLeaks, of course, Professor Donald Light, as well as Lord Christopher Moncton.
[00:56.100 --> 00:59.100]  That's in the final two hours of the broadcast today.
[00:59.100 --> 01:08.100]  But in this first hour, we're going to be taking your calls at 800-259-9231, so get them lined up.
[01:08.100 --> 01:16.100]  And basically, you heard yesterday about how threat fusion centers across the country were basically recording
[01:16.100 --> 01:25.100]  and databaseing your every email phone conversation, instant message, and every little tattletail report
[01:25.100 --> 01:32.100]  that the local busybody provides to the authorities, for them, of course, to hunt for terrorists.
[01:32.100 --> 01:39.100]  And of course, we know precisely who those terrorists are, but if we didn't, then Attorney General Eric Holder
[01:39.100 --> 01:46.100]  was gracious enough to remind us today when speaking to ABC News play the clip.
[01:46.100 --> 01:50.100]  A terrorist attack here at home has also been the top priority of officials in the United States,
[01:50.100 --> 01:54.100]  so we want to bring in our senior justice correspondent, Pierre Thomas, who just sat down
[01:54.100 --> 01:58.100]  for an exclusive interview with Attorney General Eric Holder and Pierre.
[01:58.100 --> 02:03.100]  The Attorney General is a pretty circumspect man, but on this subject, he doesn't seem to be pulling any punches.
[02:03.100 --> 02:08.100]  George I've known and covered the Attorney General more than a decade, and I can tell you,
[02:08.100 --> 02:15.100]  he was remarkably candid and quite blunt about the relentless nature of the terror threat the U.S. has combated.
[02:15.100 --> 02:17.100]  What keeps you up at night?
[02:17.100 --> 02:20.100]  The concern that perhaps that we might have missed something.
[02:20.100 --> 02:24.100]  The threat is real. The threat is different. The threat is constant.
[02:24.100 --> 02:29.100]  In a rare interview, the Attorney General laid out the most pressing terror threats.
[02:29.100 --> 02:32.100]  Dangers, he said, that are more diverse and increasing.
[02:32.100 --> 02:37.100]  Among them, the new rapidly evolving threat posed by homegrown radicals.
[02:37.100 --> 02:44.100]  The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here to worrying about people
[02:44.100 --> 02:50.100]  in the United States, American citizens, raised here, born here.
[02:50.100 --> 02:53.100]  You didn't worry about this even two years ago.
[02:53.100 --> 02:56.100]  In the last 18 months, at least 50 Americans have been killed.
[02:56.100 --> 02:58.100]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58.100 --> 03:04.100]  Obama, Holder and Big Sis have identified the terrorists, and you knew it.
[03:04.100 --> 03:05.100]  You are one of them.
[03:05.100 --> 03:12.100]  And if you doubt that you've now been identified as a terrorist by the Department of Homeland Security,
[03:12.100 --> 03:20.100]  then we've compiled at prisonplanet.com a handy list of behaviors, actions, or interests
[03:20.100 --> 03:29.100]  that anti-terror agencies and other federal and state authorities have all identified as signs of terrorism.
[03:29.100 --> 03:37.100]  And this is the behavior that the local Starzy Informant Tattletail is being encouraged to report
[03:37.100 --> 03:44.100]  as suspicious activity under the See Something, Say Something campaign.
[03:44.100 --> 03:53.100]  Now, we've heard about the fusion centers, we've heard about the Washington Post, the top secret America.
[03:53.100 --> 04:00.100]  And now, we really begin to see who is being defined as the domestic terrorist.
[04:00.100 --> 04:02.100]  We've compiled this handy list.
[04:02.100 --> 04:07.100]  Now, under the Mayak report, the following things are all signs of terrorism.
[04:07.100 --> 04:10.100]  See if you can relate any of these to yourself.
[04:10.100 --> 04:19.100]  Displaying bumper stickers and other paraphernalia associated with the constitutional campaign for liberty and libertarian parties.
[04:19.100 --> 04:23.100]  That, according to the Mayak report, is a sign of domestic terror.
[04:23.100 --> 04:26.100]  Supporting Congressman Ron Paul.
[04:26.100 --> 04:28.100]  You're a possible terrorist.
[04:28.100 --> 04:32.100]  Supporting former presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin and other sign of terror.
[04:32.100 --> 04:35.100]  Supporting former Congressman Bob Barr.
[04:35.100 --> 04:40.100]  Opposing the implementation of a North American Union.
[04:40.100 --> 04:42.100]  Owning gold bullion.
[04:42.100 --> 04:45.100]  Displaying historical US flags.
[04:45.100 --> 04:47.100]  And of course, opposing abortion.
[04:47.100 --> 04:52.100]  All under the Mayak report, signs of being a suspected terrorist.
[04:52.100 --> 05:00.100]  And this is the information that is now going to these federal fusion centers to identify you as the new al-Qaeda's.
[05:00.100 --> 05:02.100]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[05:02.100 --> 05:06.100]  You've heard me talk about Calvin five-star soaps for years.

[07:57.100 --> 08:04.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, December 21st.
[08:04.100 --> 08:13.100]  Well, Attorney General Eric Holder has identified people born and raised in America as the primary terror threat.
[08:13.100 --> 08:21.100]  And just before the break, we were running through a list of definitions contained in the report.
[08:21.100 --> 08:28.100]  The state and federal literature of what characterizes a suspected terrorist.
[08:28.100 --> 08:39.100]  Now, of course, supporting Congressman Ron Paul, owning Gold Bullion, flying historical US flags, all indications that you are a suspected terrorist.
[08:39.100 --> 08:44.100]  And that was out of the MIAC report. This is in their own literature.
[08:44.100 --> 08:51.100]  Joint Terrorism Task Force document released a couple of years before the MIAC report.
[08:51.100 --> 09:02.100]  Being interested in animal rights, being a lone individual, making numerous references to the US Constitution, refusing to identify yourself to an authority figure.
[09:02.100 --> 09:06.100]  All are signs of potential terrorism.
[09:06.100 --> 09:15.100]  I'm sure you're starting to fit into one of these categories if you haven't already.
[09:15.100 --> 09:18.100]  Now, it gets even more out of hand.
[09:18.100 --> 09:24.100]  This is the Texas Department of Public Safety Criminal Law Enforcement pamphlet.
[09:24.100 --> 09:26.100]  This came out in 2006.
[09:26.100 --> 09:36.100]  Now, listen to the following behaviors, actions or interests that are also potential signs of being a domestic terrorist.
[09:36.100 --> 09:48.100]  This is the behavior that will get you put in one of these centralized federal fusion centers that they're now admitting contain every shred of data about the American people.
[09:48.100 --> 09:57.100]  These are definitions of being a suspected terrorist, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.
[09:57.100 --> 10:02.100]  Being a nice guy. That's right. Terrorists are nice guys too.
[10:02.100 --> 10:10.100]  So being a nice guy, that's a direct quote, by the way, nice guy, is a sign of a potential terrorist.
[10:10.100 --> 10:20.100]  Wearing Levi jeans, also a sign of being a potential terrorist. You can probably start to see yourself fitting into some of these categories.
[10:20.100 --> 10:28.100]  Communicating predominantly by cell phone, email or text message is a sign of suspected terrorism.
[10:28.100 --> 10:32.100]  And wait for it. Looking normal in appearance.
[10:32.100 --> 10:46.100]  That's right. The Texas Department of Public Safety, in its own document, specifically lists looking normal in appearance as a possible sign of being a domestic terrorist.
[10:46.100 --> 10:58.100]  Now, of course, we've had other similar documents such as the Virginia Training Manual, which lists being a property right activist, trying to influence government or social policy,
[10:58.100 --> 11:07.100]  or even, quote, undermining confidence in the government, which basically means not joining this bandwagon of government cult worship,
[11:07.100 --> 11:12.100]  all according to state and federal authorities, signs of domestic terror.
[11:12.100 --> 11:20.100]  So when Attorney General Eric Holder says that the threat is homegrown from people born and raised in America,
[11:20.100 --> 11:30.100]  this is the list of definitions that he is working off. This has been communicated out to law enforcement to these federal fusion threat centers.
[11:30.100 --> 11:36.100]  This is what Big Sis is encouraging the Stasi Informant Society to pick up on.
[11:36.100 --> 11:46.100]  See something, say something, and, you know, if you've got a map, if you use binoculars, scuba equipment is listed in one of these documents.
[11:46.100 --> 11:51.100]  All this is suspicious activity now in the new America.
[11:51.100 --> 12:00.100]  Now, of course, we have the FBI training 10,000 garbage collectors across the country to look for this exact kind of suspicious behavior.
[12:00.100 --> 12:17.100]  And now, according to Peter King, this is on infohorse.com, soon to be chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, questioning the official story of 9-11 is, quote, a vile remark and could make you subject to investigation.
[12:17.100 --> 12:34.100]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is why, as the FBI is busy and trapping all those mentally deficient Muslim patsies by directly giving them the explosives and then arresting them and labeling it an ominous sign of the terror threat.
[12:34.100 --> 12:52.100]  Homeland Security Big Sis is fighting the terrorists by spying on tea party groups, you know, liberals, conservatives, anti-drilling activists, second amendment groups, and even state reps, as we recently saw in Pennsylvania.
[12:52.100 --> 13:14.100]  So the real threat has been identified as politically aware Americans who actually try to exercise their constitutional rights and failing that even worse, you know, nice guys who appear normal are also now domestic terrorists according to these state and federal documents and literature.
[13:14.100 --> 13:28.100]  And let's not forget that the Department of Defense lists low-level terrorism in their own documents, lists protest, I should say, as low-level terrorism in their own documents.
[13:28.100 --> 13:40.100]  So directly identifying any organization, any demonstration, any political protest as an act of low-level terrorism. This is the new definition.
[13:40.100 --> 13:49.100]  These are the signs that people will be reporting on under Big Sis as new, see something, say something, campaign.
[13:49.100 --> 13:58.100]  And what's the outcome of this starzy informant society that they're now creating? Well, we're starting to find out, associate press today.
[13:58.100 --> 14:17.100]  Headline, police, flyer wrongly accuses Philly man in deaths. Some locals had some grudge against this man. So they plastered up his photo, his name and address on a flyer accusing him of being behind all these rapes and murders in the area.
[14:17.100 --> 14:30.100]  Again, precisely, as I was talking about yesterday, the very thing that's being encouraged by government and it's exactly what happened in Nazi Germany and Soviet-controlled East Germany.
[14:30.100 --> 14:36.100]  The title-tailed tips are completely useless. They've got nothing to do with security.
[14:36.100 --> 14:50.100]  This is about self-serving people who have been brainwashed to feed on each other, turning in their neighbor for something they didn't do, you know, merely just to get even.
[14:50.100 --> 14:58.100]  And it harks back to Robert Galatly's Florida University study, which we also briefly mentioned yesterday.
[14:58.100 --> 15:15.100]  People did it for reasons of personal grandeur for career prospects. There was even one example of somebody who lived with another couple and they were not the cleanest individuals when using a shared bathroom.
[15:15.100 --> 15:24.100]  So they reported them to the local Gestapo as being, you know, a political subversive and they were carted off to the work camp.
[15:24.100 --> 15:36.100]  And now we're starting to see this filter into America where people are reporting their neighbors for rapes and murders, which they had nothing to do with simply to get back at them for a grudge.
[15:36.100 --> 15:51.100]  So it's already unfolding. And all this information that they report, remember, is being sent directly to these federal fusion threat centers where they then use it to identify suspected terrorists.
[15:51.100 --> 16:07.100]  And what's the purpose? It's to make Americans rigidly conform their behavior, their every action, everything they say to what's expected of them by their rulers.
[16:07.100 --> 16:16.100]  You know, if you don't get on the bandwagon of government cult worship, then you will be reported on by your neighbors. That's the fear they're trying to instill.
[16:16.100 --> 16:27.100]  You know, you will not exercise any of your constitutional rights, you will not own firearms, you'll not speak out against the state, and you will not organize a demonstration or protest.
[16:27.100 --> 16:41.100]  It's about chilling free speech. It's got nothing to do with the terrorist patsies that the FBI gives the bombs to and then says, look, they were going to conduct a bombing after we gave them the explosives.
[16:41.100 --> 16:50.100]  So it's about creating this chilling atmosphere, this environment where everyone is petrified of big sis knocking at the door.
[16:50.100 --> 16:59.100]  It's about Americans becoming obsessed about every potential minor transgression.
[16:59.100 --> 17:17.100]  Scared that their neighbor might misconstrue their behavior as suspicious and inform on them as the message from Janet and Napolitano, big sis plays at the Walmart checkout, report suspicious activity.
[17:17.100 --> 17:35.100]  Again, the nature of that activity is never defined in the message, but then you look at the information that's being put out by these authorities, and it's Ron Paul supporters owning gold bullion, organizing a political rally, organizing a meeting,
[17:35.100 --> 17:53.100]  just any behavior whatsoever, even banal things, the Texas Department of Public Safety, you know, being a nice guy they say is a potential sign of terror, appearing normal in the way you dress, your appearance, potential sign of terror.
[17:53.100 --> 18:09.100]  So it's catch net to include everyone. It's guilty until proven innocent. And when everybody's a terrorist, then they can use that justification to collect information about the entire population.
[18:09.100 --> 18:24.100]  So it's about creating this fear factor where people are afraid to exercise their rights for fear that it would be misconstrued as terror, now that everything, every political activity, activity has been characterized as potential terrorism.
[18:24.100 --> 18:28.100]  So what's, you know, what's the solution?
[18:28.100 --> 18:50.100]  Well, as the old cheesy saying goes, you know, feel the fear and do it anyway. I mean, the only way you can combat a flagrant attempt to carry out what is an end run around the Bill of Rights by making people afraid to exercise those rights is just to exercise them more strongly and
[18:50.100 --> 19:10.100]  proudly than ever before. And because we've become so fractured as a society, and people are trained to be suspicious of one another, then they're exploiting that to its maximum degree to try and make people not exercise their rights for fear that
[19:10.100 --> 19:31.100]  that might happen, that their neighbor might become one of the local tattletales under this big sis starsy campaign. So you've just got to explain to people, you've got to explain to your friends and neighbors that distrust of government is the highest form of patriotism.
[19:31.100 --> 19:47.100]  You know, they've tried to define it as a mental disorder. Now they're trying to define it as a sign of potential terrorism. But the fact is that the only terrorists are a government that would try to destroy dissent, because that's what the founding fathers embraced.
[19:47.100 --> 20:01.100]  And now they're trying to destroy everything that America stands for under this onslaught in the Constitution. We'll be back with your call. Stay tuned.
[20:17.100 --> 20:42.100]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[20:42.100 --> 20:51.100]  retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[21:01.100 --> 21:15.100]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst depression. Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[21:15.100 --> 21:28.100]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasures are a safe haven. But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[21:28.100 --> 21:43.100]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures. The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[21:43.100 --> 22:00.100]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold 6000 year history. Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237. Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free. Call 800-686-2237.
[22:13.100 --> 22:26.100]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[22:26.100 --> 22:39.100]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[22:39.100 --> 22:48.100]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[23:09.100 --> 23:21.100]  My name is Crystal. I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas. I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago. My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[23:21.100 --> 23:32.100]  What did Crystal do? I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006. When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[24:01.100 --> 24:24.100]  So, how does it feel to be characterised as a terrorist by your own government for merely engaging in a political, social, and social work?
[24:24.100 --> 24:42.100]  How does it feel to be characterised as a terrorist by your own government for merely engaging in a political demonstration or organising a rally? Or worse yet, merely engaging in banal behaviour like using a large amount of cash or wearing Levi jeans?
[24:42.100 --> 24:55.100]  Or God forbid, appearing normal and being a nice guy, which is now a sign of being a terrorist apparently, according to Big Sis and the federal and state fusion threat centres.
[24:55.100 --> 25:02.100]  800-259-9231 will be going to your calls in the next segment.
[25:02.100 --> 25:22.100]  Now, running parallel to this new purge against the American people by trying to define everyone as an al-Qaeda member, we've got them trying to craft this new version of the Espionage Act to identify people who use the internet to criticise government as traitors and spies.
[25:22.100 --> 25:37.100]  And now, of course, today, Jenna Czowski at the FCC is about to pass this so-called Net Neutrality Bill, which will basically turn the internet into a cable TV-style controlled and regulated domain.
[25:37.100 --> 25:55.100]  And you know, it's just like they called it the Patriot Act when it was the most dumb patriotic thing imaginable. This is the exact opposite of Net Neutrality. And as Senator Al Franken writes on an article which we posted today at Prismplanet.com,
[25:55.100 --> 26:13.100]  quote, mobile networks like AT&T and Verizon Wireless would be able to shut off your access to content or applications for any reason. For instance, Verizon could prevent you from accessing Google Maps on your phone, forcing you to use their own mapping programme, Verizon Navigator.
[26:13.100 --> 26:30.100]  Even if it costs money to use it and isn't nearly as good, or a mobile provider with a political agenda could prevent you from downloading an app that connects you with the Obama campaign, or for that matter, a tea party group in your area.
[26:30.100 --> 26:53.100]  It gets worse, writes Franken. The FCC has never before explicitly allowed discrimination on the internet, but the draft order takes a step backwards, merely stating that so-called paid prioritisation, the creation of a fast lane for big corporations who can afford to pay for it, is cause for concern.
[26:53.100 --> 27:10.100]  Now in the name of protecting Net Neutrality, Jenna Chowsky at the FCC is personally calling up the CEOs of these top corporations to craft this bill. So it's just like Obamacare being written by the insurance companies.
[27:10.100 --> 27:28.100]  The very corporations that these rules about the internet are supposed to curtail are being written by the same corporations. And basically it gives major internet backbone hubs the power to block access to websites they don't like.
[27:28.100 --> 27:41.100]  We've had a taste of it with things like level three communications. You know, if they fall out with one of the other backbone hubs, millions of people can't access prison plan and info wars.
[27:41.100 --> 27:59.100]  This is what this new system will create, because what they're doing is calling it Net Neutrality when it's the exact opposite. It will allow corporations to create fast lanes and slow lanes. It will allow them to block certain content that they don't want on their network.
[27:59.100 --> 28:18.100]  And so if this is really properly implemented, you can say bye bye to prison plan and info wars. I mean, it's like going to a newsstand and expecting to see dozens of publications and newspapers to choose from and being met with only one or two.
[28:18.100 --> 28:34.100]  It's about controlling, restricting the flow of information. And of course, the first thing they're going to do is use it politically. And the vote on this is actually taking place right now. It might have already happened.
[28:34.100 --> 28:42.100]  There's an article on the website where you can get the phone number to call the FCC, but most people say that this is just going to sail through.
[28:42.100 --> 28:58.100]  And even the liberals are screaming mad about it, calling Obama a sellout, because Obama campaigned on the fact that he would quote, take a backseat to no one in his commitment to Net Neutrality.
[28:58.100 --> 29:15.100]  And now, as the Huffington Post is warning about, his FCC chairman, Jenna Chowsky, is trying to spin this so-called Net Neutrality Bill as mission accomplished when, as the Huffington Post writes today,
[29:15.100 --> 29:27.100]  the reality is that reform is just a rhetorical front for industry compromises that reward the biggest players in K Street lobbyists while giving the public nothing.
[29:27.100 --> 29:45.100]  So the left, the right, everybody's aware of what's going on. Obama's sold out again. And the creation of this Internet regulation control system that will drown out independent voices is sailing right through. We'll be talking about it after the break on the Alex Jones show and going to your calls. Stay tuned.
[29:45.100 --> 30:01.100]  Prismplanet.tv.
[30:16.100 --> 30:28.100]  Where a man can feed his family, not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[30:28.100 --> 30:34.100]  I'm looking for America.
[30:34.100 --> 30:49.100]  Where American and be proud. Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[30:49.100 --> 31:15.100]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[31:15.100 --> 31:25.100]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:25.100 --> 31:36.100]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[31:36.100 --> 31:46.100]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[31:46.100 --> 32:00.100]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[32:00.100 --> 32:16.100]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lunges Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lunges System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[32:16.100 --> 32:34.100]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lunges Generator. Not only does the Silver Lunges System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[32:34.100 --> 32:52.100]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lunges System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lunges System works.
[32:52.100 --> 33:08.100]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:22.100 --> 33:40.100]  Rome's suspected bomb could not explode, say police. A suspected explosive device found in an empty underground train carriage in Rome today could not have blown up because it lacked a detonator police said.
[33:40.100 --> 33:54.100]  AFP reports, UN evacuated over suspicious odor. The UN Security Council and General Assembly were evacuated Tuesday because of a suspicious odor, a spokesman said, and the hysteria continues.
[33:54.100 --> 34:02.100]  They particularly like to push it at this time of the year when everybody's travelling, just to remind them of who their masters are.
[34:02.100 --> 34:17.100]  We'll go into your calls in a minute. Briefly, I want to mention what we've got on offer at prismplanet.tv because 2011 is going to be the launch of Alex's new TV show for members, exclusively for members.
[34:17.100 --> 34:30.100]  And if you're not aware of it, prismplanet.tv, it's really taken off in the past couple of months. People who are already members will tell you, and a lot of them post on the prismplanet forum.
[34:30.100 --> 34:41.100]  We've just added a ton of new material where adding new videos several times a week. These are exclusive video interviews for prismplanet.tv members.
[34:41.100 --> 34:50.100]  Of course, you've got the daily audio and video archive streams which are posted first at prismplanet.tv in full at the end of the show.
[34:50.100 --> 35:08.100]  You've got searchable archives of every Alex Jones show on there, every Alex Jones movie, a plethora of others, and just go and look on the front page of prismplanet.tv right now and just take a look at some of the excellent video interviews
[35:08.100 --> 35:18.100]  who posted in the past few weeks. And I know that the information is powerful because I personally watched every single one of them because I write articles about most of them.
[35:18.100 --> 35:35.100]  So we've got Alex Abela talking about the Rand Corporation, their agenda for World War III. We've got clinical psychologist Bruce Levine talking about learned helplessness and how the establishment is trying to define distrust of authority as a mental disorder.
[35:35.100 --> 35:45.100]  We've got Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch talking about her research into what chemtrails contain and how they end up in our water supply.
[35:45.100 --> 35:57.100]  And there's lots more. It's prismplanet.tv. This is what funds the operation and it's still the same price as it was when we introduced it six and a half years ago.
[35:57.100 --> 36:09.100]  It's $5.95 a month and for a limited time you can get the equivalent of five months free by getting a yearly subscription for just $39.95.
[36:09.100 --> 36:19.100]  So I really encourage people to take advantage of that, especially now when we've got the discount running. That's prismplanet.tv. Subscribe today.
[36:19.100 --> 36:25.100]  Okay, we're going to go to the calls. First up, Julio in Illinois. Julio, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[36:25.100 --> 36:32.100]  Hey Paul, Merry Christmas to you across the pond and Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah Levels, Freedom Lovers worldwide.
[36:32.100 --> 36:42.100]  I knew last year as the CIA was getting set for their fake Christmas Day underwear bomber down in Amsterdam going to Detroit that 2010 was going to be a pivotal year.
[36:42.100 --> 36:55.100]  I mean, as we've seen, it's turned out that way and they're getting set for 2011 being one of the most crucial years in the coming of the second American Revolution worldwide.
[36:55.100 --> 37:02.100]  Quickly, you're talking about Homeland Security and calling us all domestic terrorists.
[37:02.100 --> 37:12.100]  I mean, what else are they going to say knowing that we're constantly with your awesome work, your brother's awesome work and everyone at InfoWars and everyone worldwide revealing the truth?
[37:12.100 --> 37:25.100]  What else are these scum going to say other than pointing the finger at Austin calling us domestic terrorists saying that those who believe in the Constitution, those who are against global warming are white wing nuts?
[37:25.100 --> 37:33.100]  That's a great trend. There's going to be man-made, they talk about man-made global warming all the time. What's going to happen this year?
[37:33.100 --> 37:44.100]  And this is what I mean in terms of weather modification. I just recently landed on a new document from the National Intelligence Council September 2010, Global Governance 2025.
[37:44.100 --> 37:57.100]  If you can look that up, it's crazy. Even on the cover, it shows the G20, and we've heard Herman Van Rompuy, our European Union President, talk about global governance with the G20 established by the G20.
[37:57.100 --> 38:11.100]  It has the IMF, the International Monetary Fund right on the front, the United Nations right on the front, September 2010, and it talks about climate change as a way to bring about global governance.
[38:11.100 --> 38:18.100]  You talked about yesterday how in England, the record snowstorm all around England and Europe, they're blaming it on man.
[38:18.100 --> 38:26.100]  Yesterday on CNS News, I saw on the George Report, Janet Napolitano is having a climate change council with the Coast Guard.
[38:26.100 --> 38:34.100]  We've seen Ready.gov all throughout the country. Bill Gates was at Bilderberg. Bill Gates has weather modification patents.
[38:34.100 --> 38:52.100]  It was owning the weather in 2025 from the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force War College, white paper talking about how a weather modification weapon would be so powerful because no one would know if storms were man-made or were they just natural occurrence.
[38:52.100 --> 39:04.100]  So I think 2011, as Lindsay Williams said, that we're going to be too poor to protest. With major storms, it damages infrastructure. Of course, we, the people, the peasants, the sheeple, are going to have to pay for this.
[39:04.100 --> 39:09.100]  So I think there is going to be man-made global warming in terms of weather modification.
[39:09.100 --> 39:22.100]  And another thing about the FCC, people need to know that the FCC, I'm a broadcasting major, the FCC has no regulations over cable, satellite, or the Internet. Yet they say they can do this.
[39:22.100 --> 39:30.100]  And it bothers my mind that this is happening in Christmas. We remember 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act passing on Christmas Day, on Christmas Eve.
[39:30.100 --> 39:40.100]  It was the Obama death care bill passing last year or a portion of it on Christmas Eve. And here we go again. We're right around Christmas. And what is the FCC and Big Brother talking about?
[39:40.100 --> 39:46.100]  Silencing the Internet. Paul, Merry Christmas to you and Merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah to everyone.
[39:46.100 --> 40:00.100]  Thanks for the call. Yeah, I mean, it's a sneak attack. I mean, they just snuck through the Senate did on Sunday night, the so-called food safety bill, which is basically just a big agribusiness assault on local and small farmers.
[40:00.100 --> 40:11.100]  Anybody who has a turnover of more than a million dollars a year, not a profit, just a turnover, which includes anybody with, you know, 20 acres of land, they're going to put them out of business.
[40:11.100 --> 40:21.100]  Basically, that's what it's about. They snuck that through on Sunday night. Congress has set to vote on that. They'll probably try and get that done before Christmas when everybody's not watching.
[40:21.100 --> 40:32.100]  So again, the criminals work in the dark. They like to sneak their evil deeds through the back door. And you were just talking about the UN approach to climate change.
[40:32.100 --> 40:45.100]  Global governments 2025. And in fact, we wrote an article a few months ago where the UN directly orders its alarmists and administrators to change the propaganda.
[40:45.100 --> 40:56.100]  They've been completely discredited on manmade global warming and climate change with Britain now experiencing its coldest December on record, record low temperatures.
[40:56.100 --> 41:10.100]  They've said we need to get out of this kind of rhetoric. We need to replace it with something else, something which seems more genuine, and they've resolved to replace the threat of climate change with the threat of overpopulation,
[41:10.100 --> 41:35.100]  which many particularly status and liberals subscribe to, when in fact, as we have vehemently documented time after time, the UN population funds own figures show that global population will rise, will peak at 9 billion in around 2050, after which it will rapidly fall.
[41:35.100 --> 41:53.100]  The global replacement rate for human beings is already below the level of two in Europe. We're already dying out. And in countries such as even India and Brazil, the replacement rate is slowly starting to come back into line.
[41:53.100 --> 42:09.100]  The only thing that will cause overpopulation is if you don't allow third world countries to develop, which of course is what the climate alarmists are all about. They want to keep the third world in poverty because of course becoming a developed nation means emitting CO2.
[42:09.100 --> 42:25.100]  As Lord Moncton, who is coming on in the third hour, I believe, says many times, CO2 is the lifeblood of a developing country. You cannot develop without emitting CO2. And so they're going to try and restrict third world nations from doing that.
[42:25.100 --> 42:45.100]  But they've resolved to replace climate change with overpopulation because they know they've been completely discredited on manmade global warming, especially after Climate Gate and the recent Cancun summit again was a total failure, just as the Copenhagen one was before that.
[42:45.100 --> 42:49.100]  Greg in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[42:49.100 --> 43:02.100]  Hi Paul. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to call in the first thing I saw when I went on the Internet today. I checked NPR News a lot just to see what the state is saying what's going on.
[43:02.100 --> 43:18.100]  And an interesting article first caught my eye is this human factor provides key obstacles to terrorism. This article is just talking about how the reason why all the plots in 2010 have fallen is because of, well, the people were idiots.
[43:18.100 --> 43:35.100]  And it mentions nothing of FCI involvement with any of them. It says here, there's an interesting quote, when you are trying to recruit individuals, you may not always get the individual you want.
[43:35.100 --> 43:53.100]  You may get the person who is most convenient. And that's almost like saying the FBI hasn't found a smart enough person to actually terrorize us enough yet. I don't know. I was hoping on your thoughts on that.
[43:53.100 --> 44:12.100]  Every single terror bus that has made big headlines in the US or the UK has been either provocateur or directly created by the federal authorities. I mean, you had this latest one where they directly gave him the bomb.
[44:12.100 --> 44:26.100]  We posted a video a few days ago on prisonplanet.com and it was an Irish gentleman and he went, it's in the multimedia section if you want to go and watch it. And he went through every single case where it's deliberate entrapment every time.
[44:26.100 --> 44:50.100]  So they need to create these incidents. They need to have dud bombs in Rome that lack a detonator, like any self-respecting terrorist would plant a bomb without a detonator. They need to have strange orders in the UN building to create this hysteria to make everyone continue to buy into the terror threat, which of course is completely contrived.
[44:50.100 --> 45:04.100]  The Christmas Day bomber being the perfect example of that. He was allowed to board the plane by order of the US State Department. That's never mentioned when we're getting propagandized about body scanners by the corporate media.
[45:04.100 --> 45:21.100]  And now the ABC news clip we played at the start of the show. If you watch that in full, it goes on to state that Anwar Alalaki, the CIA Laki, is now the new bin Laden. They've dispensed with bin Laden and he's now the new primary target.
[45:21.100 --> 45:42.100]  Of course, they're loath to mention the fact that he was meeting with Pentagon top brass after 9-11, months after 9-11, having been a so-called spiritual leader for the 9-11 hijackers and meeting directly with the ones who supposedly flew the plane into the Pentagon.
[45:42.100 --> 45:59.100]  He was dining with Pentagon top brass two months after 9-11 and now we're supposed to believe that he's the new grand boogeyman when he's behind all these terror plots, the Hassan shooting at Fort Hood, the Times Square fizzle bomb.
[45:59.100 --> 46:12.100]  Every single time he's been the Patsy Handler and he's a double agent as Tarpley is exhaustively documented. He's clearly working for the CIA. That's why he was at the Pentagon after 9-11.
[46:12.100 --> 46:33.100]  But, you know, they think that as long as they can throw these dud bombs in Rome matters and strange odors in the UN that they're going to keep the hysteria a decent enough level to where people will just blindly accept all this. And again, it comes back to making people being afraid to express their constitutional rights because they fear that anything might be a sign of terrorism.
[46:33.100 --> 46:59.100]  So it's about chilling free speech and chilling the mere behavior of a free person. They need you to behave like a slave. That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to enforce this subservience to government so that everybody needs to self-regulate their own behavior and be a complete slave and be worried about having any independence or engaging in any criticism against the state.
[46:59.100 --> 47:19.100]  That's what it's all directed towards as we spoke about yesterday. It's this psychological Berlin Wall that's being erected in the minds of people that they can't even imagine to escape across the other side for fear of being considered domestic extremists, as the feds now call them.
[47:19.100 --> 47:24.100]  Thanks for the call, Greg. Braun in New York. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[47:24.100 --> 47:41.100]  Yeah, good morning. I'm a loyalist. I'm glad you got to do this program. I have kind of an abstract question. So forgive me if I wander a little bit. I don't watch all on TV anymore just for the simple nature of the garbage that comes on.
[47:41.100 --> 47:59.100]  So what I do is I sometimes look on YouTube with a lot of different videos. Now, I was watching a particular video, a friend by the name of Taj Tariq Bey. He is a Moorish American. I don't know if you're familiar with the Moorish Empire, but he said something that really stuck out in my head.
[47:59.100 --> 48:16.100]  He talks a lot about Masonic science and cosmology. I'm not very well versed on it, so I won't get into any details, but he mentioned that something can do with Uranus and Saturn as far as secrets being unveiled and things like that.
[48:16.100 --> 48:32.100]  Now, the basic thought was that if the powers that be, you talk about Masons, Lumaia, whoever, if they're aware of all these Masonic sciences that were actually created by the Moorish Empire, then they're very well aware of the timetable as well.
[48:32.100 --> 48:47.100]  So, you know, on here you speak about, a lot of times they're speeding up their program, and he was saying the same thing. He was saying that basically the people are waking up too fast, and it's almost like you can see it.
[48:47.100 --> 48:58.100]  Once you know what you're looking for, things start to stand out to you a little bit more, and in the same way that your brain is just subconsciously tuned into it a little bit better.
[48:58.100 --> 49:08.100]  So, I was wondering if you thought that, you talked about Lindsay Williams on here the other day, he was mentioning that oil spiking.
[49:08.100 --> 49:27.100]  Now, I watched The Market's Love. I came out envision a scenario where oil actually gets suppressed in any significant way. Right now it's trading at about $89 a barrel, and I really think that that's going to be the one that squeezes really the whole world economy.
[49:27.100 --> 49:38.100]  And I wanted to know what you thought about that, whether you thought 2011 may be the year that they actually really speeded up and started to hit things a little bit harder.
[49:38.100 --> 49:52.100]  And I wanted to make a suggestion, maybe when Alex comes back in, you get him on here. If anyone wants to follow at home, his name is spelled T-A-J-T-A-R-I-K-B-E-Y.
[49:52.100 --> 50:02.100]  But you speak a lot about exactly what's going on, that they're trying to shield you from, and I thought maybe that would be a good connection.
[50:02.100 --> 50:14.100]  Get him on here, kind of have Alex Jones talking to him a little bit more, so more of the stuff can get figured out, because we're turning towards a really dangerous, dangerous predicament right now.
[50:14.100 --> 50:23.100]  Yeah, definitely. Look into it. Send me an email, Watsonappprisonplanet.com, and we're looking to getting him on as a guest.
[50:23.100 --> 50:35.100]  On the subject of oil, we all know that it went above $150 a barrel back in 2008, and that was primarily because of a decrepidly weak dollar.
[50:35.100 --> 50:42.100]  And of course, the dollar's still got a long way to go down, but all currencies are now depreciating when compared to gold.
[50:42.100 --> 50:49.100]  So oil at $89, I think it's got a lot higher to go, certainly in 2011.
[50:49.100 --> 51:12.100]  We'll be back after the break with your calls, Omar Davion. Stay tuned, it's the Alex Jones Show Live, Prisonplanet.tv. Don't go away.
[51:19.100 --> 51:24.100]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[51:24.100 --> 51:31.100]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[51:31.100 --> 51:39.100]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[51:39.100 --> 51:49.100]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[51:49.100 --> 51:58.100]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[51:58.100 --> 52:02.100]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[52:02.100 --> 52:06.100]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:06.100 --> 52:09.100]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:09.100 --> 52:14.100]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[52:14.100 --> 52:20.100]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[52:20.100 --> 52:25.100]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:25.100 --> 52:36.100]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[52:36.100 --> 52:42.100]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[52:42.100 --> 52:49.100]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[52:49.100 --> 53:00.100]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[53:00.100 --> 53:05.100]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[53:05.100 --> 53:10.100]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,
[53:10.100 --> 53:14.100]  the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[53:22.100 --> 53:28.100]  cyst and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[54:16.100 --> 54:21.100]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, December 21st.
[54:21.100 --> 54:27.100]  Alex will be back at the end of the week. We've got some great encore presentations coming up around Christmas,
[54:27.100 --> 54:30.100]  so I hope you'll take the time to tune into those.
[54:30.100 --> 54:34.100]  All right, quick fire through the callers. Omar in Toronto, go ahead.
[54:34.100 --> 54:39.100]  Hey, Paul, how are you making up the global warming over there?
[54:39.100 --> 54:47.100]  Yeah, it's pretty good. Just minus 26, you know, two feet of snow. We're enjoying it. All the fly is cancelled.
[54:47.100 --> 54:52.100]  I guess we just need to pay Al Gore some more carbon taxes.
[54:52.100 --> 54:58.100]  Yeah, that's what it's all about. Yeah, I just wanted to talk about this, you know, this culture of fear.
[54:58.100 --> 55:03.100]  I was at the airport when George Galloway came to town and I wasn't really affiliated with any of the groups there.
[55:03.100 --> 55:08.100]  There was the anti-war and the pro-Palestinian groups. Nobody really wanted to talk to the media,
[55:08.100 --> 55:18.100]  so, you know, I had to sort of talk for them. I mean, I don't blame them, but it seems like, you know, people really are concerned about, you know,
[55:18.100 --> 55:25.100]  I mean, look at those people in Chicago. You know, FBI comes and kicks your door down just because you're a peace activist.
[55:25.100 --> 55:35.100]  So I think some of it is, you know, working and we just have to keep on, you know, just stand up and speak our minds,
[55:35.100 --> 55:40.100]  because if not, they're just going to shut everything down.
[55:40.100 --> 55:43.100]  There was this story about Rachel Ray. I don't know if you ever heard about it.
[55:43.100 --> 55:51.100]  She was wearing a Palestinian scarf and some commercial and they made them take the commercial down because she's wearing a scarf.
[55:51.100 --> 55:58.100]  It's just insane. So, of course, you know, the first thing I went out and did was bought myself a Palestinian scarf and I bought some for presents,
[55:58.100 --> 56:02.100]  so everybody should go out and buy a Palestinian scarf.
[56:02.100 --> 56:06.100]  Don't buy a pair of Levi jeans, though, because that means you're a terrorist.
[56:06.100 --> 56:14.100]  Don't act like a nice guy or appear normal according to the Texas Department of Health. That's the terrorist act.
[56:14.100 --> 56:19.100]  Thanks for the call, Omar. Dave in New York, go ahead.
[56:19.100 --> 56:20.100]  Hello?
[56:20.100 --> 56:23.100]  Yes, you're on the air, Dave.
[56:23.100 --> 56:29.100]  Well, I think my son's a terrorist. He's two years old and he appears normal.
[56:29.100 --> 56:32.100]  Al Qaeda, I'm going to report him to Jonathan Paul Town.
[56:32.100 --> 56:40.100]  Yeah, I'm worried about him, but I just wanted to thank you guys. You know, I wear blue diamond gussets,
[56:40.100 --> 56:41.100]  buy you food direct.
[56:41.100 --> 56:42.100]  Terrorist.
[56:42.100 --> 56:44.100]  Oh, my God. Silver.
[56:44.100 --> 56:47.100]  Silver? Oh, my God.
[56:47.100 --> 56:48.100]  I know.
[56:48.100 --> 56:50.100]  Probably fly a flag as well, don't you?
[56:50.100 --> 56:51.100]  I do.
[56:51.100 --> 56:53.100]  Support Congressman Ron Paul.
[56:53.100 --> 56:55.100]  Oh, my God. I got his books.
[56:55.100 --> 56:58.100]  Oh, my God. Terrorist literature.
[56:58.100 --> 57:01.100]  I know. I don't fix this.
[57:01.100 --> 57:06.100]  But, uh, yeah, I live, I live right by the Niagara Falls Air Force Base.
[57:06.100 --> 57:10.100]  And, uh, I've noticed, you know, it increasing in size.
[57:10.100 --> 57:17.100]  But mainly what I've been noticing is their security police, what they call them, I guess,
[57:17.100 --> 57:20.100]  is that they, you know, first they were patrolling more.
[57:20.100 --> 57:27.100]  Well, now I'm starting to see them pull over vehicles and conducting traffic duty.
[57:27.100 --> 57:31.100]  So, you know, it's just kind of a police state thing that I've been noticing.
[57:31.100 --> 57:35.100]  It's all part of the harmonization between military and law enforcement,
[57:35.100 --> 57:43.100]  getting people used to living in a decrepit, decaying, banana, republic, third world country.
[57:43.100 --> 57:48.100]  And that's what they need to do when they implement that kind of militarized police state.
[57:48.100 --> 57:51.100]  Thanks for the call, Dave. Ian in England.
[57:51.100 --> 57:56.100]  Last caller Ian, go ahead.
[57:56.100 --> 58:00.100]  Ian, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[58:00.100 --> 58:03.100]  Excellent. Um, yeah, good to hear you.
[58:03.100 --> 58:09.100]  Um, just, um, a little call to, um, you know, make people aware that it's coming in year.
[58:09.100 --> 58:18.100]  Um, April time, March, April, May is going to be a really serious situation from that point on.
[58:18.100 --> 58:23.100]  The first year's accounts are going to be released, which are obviously going to be dismal.
[58:23.100 --> 58:29.100]  They're already, um, announcing the lowest, uh, pre-Christmas sales ever.
[58:29.100 --> 58:32.100]  Yeah, we're out of time. Sorry. The economy's in trouble.
[58:32.100 --> 58:34.100]  Uh, re-broadcast coming up.
[58:34.100 --> 58:38.100]  This is the Alex Jones show. I've been your host, Paul Joseph Watson,
[58:38.100 --> 58:43.100]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[58:43.100 --> 58:46.100]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:46.100 --> 58:51.100]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.100 --> 58:55.100]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[58:55.100 --> 58:59.100]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company,
[58:59.100 --> 59:01.100]  a family owned and operated American company.
[59:01.100 --> 59:09.100]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[59:09.100 --> 59:14.100]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[59:14.100 --> 59:23.100]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[59:23.100 --> 59:27.100]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[59:27.100 --> 59:34.100]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[59:34.100 --> 59:38.100]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[59:38.100 --> 59:46.100]  Visit our website at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website at 5starsoap.com
[59:46.100 --> 01:00:12.100]  for buying a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:23.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:32.100]  Well, this whole WikiLeaks situation is very complex, but bottom line, it's the pretext to bring in censorship control of the web.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:38.100]  The whole cybersecurity system being built up, and John Young of Cryptome.org predicted this.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:47.100]  He's, again, the original WikiLeaker. He's the guy that set up the website originally for them, but then he pulled out very quickly.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.100]  Now, he said years ago, looks like a Soros-type operation.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.100]  Now, we have clear connections to that. That's even mainstream media.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.100]  Now, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, John, but I want to give you the floor.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.100]  You talk about this being foggy, bring clarity.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.100]  I mean, as somebody who probably knows more about this than anybody else, in the next four minutes, you've got the floor.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:11.100]  What do you want to say to folks about this? What do you think is most important?
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.100]  Well, I'll follow the money. It's, of course, a big cliche, but true here.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:19.100]  For two and a half years, WikiLeaks is on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:25.100]  They shut down for a few months and came back with bombshells, and suddenly the money started pouring in.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:33.100]  This is a well-known business model to hand out free cigarettes and then sell them after you get the addiction started.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:42.100]  And so it's also a well-known government technique to create a crisis plane that we can't survive without it
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.100]  and then demand more taxes and more budget increases.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.100]  And so just watch how this unfolds.
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:54.100]  So I expect that there will be continuing crises raised by the WikiLeaks model
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:59.100]  and that from low-level secrecy documents, we'll start getting triples of higher secrecy documents.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:03.100]  It'll be tripled out over time as they're not ripping out the secret stuff,
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.100]  and so we'll get some more bombshells because it's proving to be extremely effective.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:11.100]  Now, you know that we've kept the war on terrorism going exactly the same way.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:16.100]  And so that these imaginary wars are very lucrative, particularly the governments and contractors
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:20.100]  who service governments as well as individuals who seem to oppose governments.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:27.100]  So I'm down on anti-war people as well as pro-war people because they seem to be working hand in hand.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:34.100]  So I think that that's the lesson we've learned running our side, that there are all sorts of threats imputed to crypto.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.100]  None of that has come to pass.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.100]  It was just a shell game to make it seem like there's a threat, but there wasn't.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:46.100]  We've never been, we've got that except one time by Microsoft, which then withdrew it.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.100]  WikiLeaks was shut down once by a court, but then that was withdrawn.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.100]  As far as I know, no officials have ever approached WikiLeaks with a threat.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.100]  Now, maybe they have and they've kept it quiet.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:02.100]  We always publicize when we're approached by officials to let them know that this is something of a shell game.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:08.100]  So we'd like to see more attention paid to how often this occurs, not by WikiLeaks,
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.100]  but by others who are rushing to their support, but also rushing to oppose them.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.100]  There's money to be made in this.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.100]  And I'm talking about the media.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.100]  I'm talking about the so-called outlaws, the so-called dissidents.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.100]  This is a big time operation. Everyone's getting in on this.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.100]  So I'm admiring this taking place. So it'll be kept going for quite a while.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:31.100]  Money's pouring in from all sides to both sides of the fight.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:37.100]  And so the use of the word cyber war is exactly part of that, our info war.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:42.100]  Now, I'm not attacking your use of it, Alex, because you started this long ago,
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:48.100]  but right now they're actually trying to escalate this into war-like crisis because it's bringing out the money.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:53.100]  Yeah, when I talk about info war, I mean getting people talking, saying no to tyranny.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:58.100]  They're info war. They're talking about hacking and more the Pentagon version of that.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.100]  That's right. And so that's what Cybercom is now doing.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:07.100]  They're going to milk cyber threats as much as they can over the next several years.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:10.100]  And that's why I think that the Bradley Manning thing was esteemed,
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.100]  that they teach this stuff at Fort Wachukow, Alex,
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:18.100]  how people like Bradley Manning can do this and set up these steaming operations.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:24.100]  And so he was trained there. And so this smells like that to me.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.100]  And there'll be more coming, though.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:32.100]  Because right now they're just testing the public's reaction with this low-level secrecy revelation,
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.100]  but the other stuff will come.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.100]  All right, stay there. We're going to come back in three minutes, John, long segment.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.100]  And I want to continue to drill down into WikiLeaks.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:46.100]  I mean, obviously you've got all these Soros CIA connections cast Sunstein,
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.100]  Sunstein riding two years ago, two and a half years ago,
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.100]  that they would infiltrate the web, pose as activists, create crisis,
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:20.100]  then bring in censorship legislation. That's now happening. We'll be right back.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.100]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, at America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:32.100]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.100]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:39.100]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.100]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.100]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:52.100]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.100]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.100]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.100]  That's End of America 3.com.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.100]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:10.100]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:15.100]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.100]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.100]  They have two holiday-priced packs for you to put into your reserves
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.100]  for a secure future or to share with others.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.100]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in tin cans,
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:34.100]  and the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals,
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.100]  including delicious bakery items, shipped in heavy tote bags.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:42.100]  Now for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs,
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.100]  you'll get free shipping on your entire order.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:51.100]  Call now 800-409-5633 or visit them at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:58.100]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:06.100]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.100]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:14.100]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.100]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.100]  and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:25.100]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.100]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:33.100]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.100]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.100]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:42.100]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.100]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:49.100]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:54.100]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:08:09.100]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.100]  That's the New York Observer headline.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:35.100]  He set up the site for him originally, but then immediately got suspicious of it.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:40.100]  And this is the pretext, just like they set up Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:46.100]  They're now setting this up, and now they've got thousands of hackers attacking MasterCard, Visa,
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.100]  Sarah Palin for calling Assange an American.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:53.100]  You know, I don't want to hate Sarah Palin, but give me a break.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.100]  She said that the South shouldn't have attacked North Korea,
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.100]  and that we've got to stand with North Korea.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:02.100]  She doesn't know that North Korea is the Stalinist state.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.100]  She's now come out and said that Assange is un-American.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.100]  Assange is Australian, honey.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:14.100]  But this is just getting crazier and crazier by the minute,
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:22.100]  and now they've released cables dealing with Dincor running little kidnapped boys,
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:27.100]  which you see in the news all the time, but there is some pretty bombshell stuff in here.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.100]  But could that be that the mainstream media is going through this
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.100]  and only covering what they want to go over?
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.100]  Because so much of what I've read, and I've tried to go through a lot of it,
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:42.100]  and so much of what the media has picked up on really reinforces the whole war on terror propaganda.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:48.100]  And anybody who knows the basics understands just because some documents secret doesn't mean it's true.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:53.100]  They had the Office of Special Plans saying they knew where the WMDs were, and that was secret.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:56.100]  So some of the biggest propaganda you see is inside government,
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.100]  because it's an echo chamber of brainwashing.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.100]  John Young of Cryptom.org, what's your view on what I just said?
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:09.100]  Well, all classifications are used to exaggerate the importance of information.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:15.100]  And so you shouldn't believe something because it's secret, toxic, or whatever these are, these are glamorizing terms.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:20.100]  And so that, and by the way, people inside secret keep you know this,
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:27.100]  and that's why the stuff that leaks out is the really important information is not classified.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.100]  In fact, you can't even, you don't even know it exists.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.100]  So these known classifications are more subject to futures to make it seem it's important stuff.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:40.100]  Secondly, these cables look like they were written from reading the press rather than the other way around.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:47.100]  And as we know, that's a common way that embassies gather information to read the press and quote it as their own views.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:52.100]  Yeah, they've got a file report, so they sit there with the word document open, cutting clips out.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:58.100]  In fact, that's already been pointed out that a lot of this stuff was excised right out of newspapers and not even changed.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.100]  So it's a bunch of neocon propaganda.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:08.100]  That's right, and but that's what the media sort of say, that's what most of the media does for a living.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:13.100]  Either quote each other or most of them quote one or two other stories.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:18.100]  They're almost no original reporting because that takes time and they've got a deadline to meet, they always say,
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:23.100]  and we have limited space, they always say, and so we've got to go with what everyone else is doing.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.100]  Well, look, I mean, they get a government press release and they put that in the article,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:34.100]  and then the embassy takes the article that's a boiled down government press release and then puts it out as secret.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:40.100]  That's like a few months ago, they made all the TSA workers top secret or secret clearances.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.100]  That way they can't protect themselves with a union.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:46.100]  That way they can be lied to about the terror threat.
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.100]  That way they can feel like they're all James Bond's.
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:55.100]  It's kind of like giving somebody the newspaper associate editor title in lieu of pay.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.100]  You hit it right on the head.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:03.100]  These are often ways to boost morale within an organization and declare something secret and let you in on it.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.100]  They do this to presidents too.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:12.100]  They read them into the secrecy parole and shall I go on with this?
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.100]  Yeah, continue.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.100]  Yeah, is that, you know, we have all these people outside government saying,
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.100]  we got to do this, we got to do that, and then they go inside and suddenly they don't say that anymore
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:27.100]  because they've been read into the secrecy parole where they're under lifetime threat to never disclose it
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.100]  and they suddenly shut up.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:33.100]  It's a one-way street and you can never back out once you're in. That's why there are no ex-pies.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.100]  Every spy has lifelong secrecy built into their blood.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:42.100]  And that's why some of them are out there thinking about what they're revealing because they're unconstrained.
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:47.100]  But mainly is that it's a good way to make a living.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.100]  Being inside the secrecy world is an awfully good thing.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:54.100]  Of course it started when the first church was set up for the first kingdom was set up.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:00.100]  It's been around for a while. Alex's secrecy is a narcotic against them.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:05.100]  And the biggest threat to the secret keepers are people who are outside that world,
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.100]  not the other secret keepers in other countries or other churches,
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:14.100]  but those who are outside who might build a whistle on this.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:21.100]  Well, I have to agree with you on this because overall it allows the dominant media
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:29.100]  that's being supplanted by alternative media to demonize the Internet,
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:37.100]  to begin to grow the surveillance grid towards the original incremental shutdown of the web.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:43.100]  All of this happens, the web as we know it, all of this happens with the backdrop of the FCC commissioner
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:47.100]  saying freedom of speech is an aberration in the media.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:54.100]  We're going to shut it down, government approved, all of this comes out with a backdrop of the cybersecurity legislation,
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:59.100]  which just legalizes what's already in place that Cyber Command admits two years ago
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.100]  they've been launching, quote, attacks against themselves to test systems.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.100]  We know they hire most of the hackers.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:10.100]  We know that Assange got in trouble many years ago and was kind of brought into that world.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:14.100]  But I think like Lee Harvey Oswald, there's a good chance they're again setting him up,
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.100]  this could be all part of a big pageant, kind of like Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:23.100]  where they tried to prosecute him, but then the case fell apart to give him street cred.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:30.100]  We know the Naval Intelligence Operative Woodward was with Deep Throat, Alexander Haig and Kissinger,
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:36.100]  Deep Throat we know is a composite, to burn Kissinger, I mean to burn Nixon.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:43.100]  So the whole way this is going, it's very, very clear, but then you almost got to support Julian Assange
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:49.100]  because the charges against him are clearly false, I mean not wearing a condom and consensual sex
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:53.100]  by some feminist who writes articles about how to set men up in the legal system.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.100]  You can't make that up.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:01.100]  And so you've got to support Assange because if they're able to nail him for no reason,
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.100]  then I can be arrested for the secret documents that I've put out that are real
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:10.100]  that they did not want people to get like the Mayak and Homeland Security reports.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:15.100]  I happen to know one of the people that leaked me stuff, they found out about other things he was doing
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:22.100]  and he got in a lot of trouble, but I mean this is all just incredible stuff that's going on.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.100]  John, you just heard me rant about, you know, the point about Assange.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:31.100]  I mean if we don't support him in free speech, even though this is all basically a setup,
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:37.100]  then doesn't it set the precedent for them to come throw John Young or Alex Jones in the huskow?
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.100]  Well, it's a good point because in fact someone said on the mail this,
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.100]  hey, why has John Young not been charged with rape?
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:49.100]  And I had to laugh at that because you see me compared to Assange, you know,
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:54.100]  that charge would never stand up.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:59.100]  But my point is that don't be low about this rape charge in Sweden.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.100]  There's more coming along that line.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.100]  This is just the tip of what's coming out of Sweden.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:08.100]  And so don't forget, we're on a bombshell campaign, Alex,
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.100]  and every day something unexpected happens.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:15.100]  So something in a series of unexpected things will happen on that strand while other things are happening on this strand.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:21.100]  So this is a multi-stranded operation and we're actually being teased with the easy stuff right now
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.100]  to set us up for more interesting stuff.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.100]  Well, we've seen that pattern. It's building, building, as you said,
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:33.100]  and I got to hand it to you, over a year ago you laid it out with precision.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:38.100]  Let's go back, though, because you've been an insider in this entire world.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.100]  What are your WikiLeaks sources or other hacker insiders?
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.100]  What are they telling you, John, that you can relate to us?
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.100]  What bombshells can you give us?
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.100]  Well, let me tell you who they are and where you can find their names.
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.100]  You can find them on Wikipedia.
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:59.100]  Look up the term Sapperpunk, and I'll spell that for you if you haven't heard of it.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:02.100]  That's a PKD term.
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:06.100]  Uh, Cypher spell with a Y. C-Y-P-H-P-U-N-K.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.100]  Cypherpunk, got it.
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:12.100]  I tried. Look there and scroll down the bottom and you'll see my name,
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:17.100]  Sonja's name, several dozen names of people who all plotted all this
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.100]  and are still very active in this.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.100]  And I've started pointing to this now.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.100]  Well, you want to know what's behind WikiLeaks?
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:26.100]  Go to this one side and you'll see the entire gang.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.100]  You'll see a whole bunch of links to other sources,
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:34.100]  and you'll see how long this has been going on and why you're not going to be able to contain it.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.100]  Uh, and so, uh, that's the first thing I can tell you.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.100]  It's just public information that's been out there for years,
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.100]  but no one did the slightest amount of research on this.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:45.100]  And so that beyond this Wikipedia entry,
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.100]  I've got the archives of the Cypherpunk's mail list,
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.100]  but went on for several years, and for all these issues,
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.100]  we're just, we're thoroughly discussed.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:55.100]  This is very high-level technical material,
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.100]  and these are not young people like Assange.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.100]  Some of these people are extremely wealthy,
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.100]  and they're not George Soros, who's clueless, technically.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.100]  And he thinks his billions makes him all powerful,
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.100]  but it doesn't make him rather stupid,
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.100]  like the CIA is stupid because of their alleged power.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.100]  So these are people who are much crafter than that,
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:17.100]  but I'd recommend that people take a look at the Cypherpunk's Wikipedia entry and study it.
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.100]  Okay, I'm looking at the Cypherpunk's...
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.100]  John, I'm looking at the Cypherpunk's on Wikipedia.
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.100]  Scroll up for me, guys.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.100]  Scroll down to the bottom.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.100]  Okay, but I want to make sure I've got the right entry.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.100]  Go to the top for me real quick.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.100]  It's the Cypherpunk entry on Wikipedia,
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:38.100]  and not to be confused with the PKD Cypherpunk.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:40.100]  Okay, let's scroll to the bottom now. Go ahead.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.100]  Well, go down the bottom.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:46.100]  You'll see a list, a number of people who are involved in this.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:50.100]  I'll be there, Assange is there, a number of people there
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:54.100]  that you may not have heard of, but the founder of EFF,
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.100]  the founder of a number of other...
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.100]  John Gilmore of Sun Microsystems.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.100]  So look down there. There's some very notable people there,
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.100]  and they got this started in the early 90s,
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.100]  and I got on the board in 1994.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.100]  I was amazed that there was such a group like this,
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.100]  extremely intelligent, highly capable engineers,
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:15.100]  scientists, cryptographers, highly political astute people.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.100]  Assange came on board in 1995,
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.100]  and there were several thousand people on this list.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.100]  It's an amazing place.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.100]  Okay, so it's a wide spectrum,
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:26.100]  overall political kernel to this.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.100]  Is this truly independent, or is this a government agency,
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.100]  or is this a combine?
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.100]  Well, I'm going to try to give you an answer
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.100]  that may be a little hard to understand.
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.100]  It is none of those.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.100]  The intent was to have nothing that can be attacked easily.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:41.100]  So it's not an organization. It's not an entity.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.100]  It's a concept. It's a aspiration. It's a goal.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.100]  It is not anything you're going to be able to take down
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.100]  by the usual means.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.100]  That's the very purpose of it is to not make it,
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.100]  and that's why I say weekly leaks will not be taken down.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.100]  It'll pop up some of the way.
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:57.100]  So you're saying it's almost like the Internet
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.100]  is a bunch of computers connected to each other
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:02.100]  and can't be taken down.
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:06.100]  This is just basically hackers and computer experts
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:09.100]  that built a system that anybody in the group
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.100]  can pump info out and nobody can stop it,
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:16.100]  and that's why WikiLeaks people told the news yesterday
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:20.100]  to take us down, you'll have to shut the web down.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.100]  That's right.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.100]  That's why it was set up.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.100]  It was set up as a spying machine, as I told you on your last show.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.100]  But that's being used for reverse spying.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.100]  The people who set it up, as you know, was the military,
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.100]  and they set it up to induce people to join up
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.100]  because it's a very good way to surveil
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.100]  an entire population around the world.
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.100]  But now the people who are actually running it,
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:48.100]  that they hired to run it, are now reversing the Panopticon.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.100]  Well, that's what I've always said.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.100]  They use Google to spy on us.
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:56.100]  We use Google to spy on them with the massive group collective brain
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.100]  that they're not ever going to be able to stop
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.100]  because they might even have the intelligence,
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.100]  but they don't have the personnel to deploy operations.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.100]  But as long as we're an idea, a manifesto of human liberty,
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:08.100]  it's unstoppable.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.100]  That's right.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.100]  Because they'll have to stop themselves if they do
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.100]  because they set this up in order to control things
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:18.100]  and they're gradually losing control.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:21.100]  So it's kind of like the Lord of the Rings analogy of Sauron.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:25.100]  He makes the ring, but the ring actually controls him,
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:30.100]  so somebody can get the ring and throw it into the crack of doom.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.100]  This is always the outcome of imperialism.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:36.100]  It eventually destroys itself.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.100]  Unbelievable.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:40.100]  Again, you've had piercing understanding of this
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.100]  because you were involved from the start,
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:47.100]  and you're talking just like government people I've talked to,
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.100]  like Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.100]  He'll always say, well, I can give you what's open source,
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:55.100]  or they declassified this by mistake.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.100]  I can tell you this.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.100]  Now, go look at that.
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.100]  And so you're saying, look at this list.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.100]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.100]  This is a system, a door that swings both ways.
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.100]  And what I'm getting from what you're saying, John,
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:12.100]  is that this is out of control.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.100]  Well, it is.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:17.100]  However, you know, it's smart people all around.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.100]  One of the things we always have to keep in mind
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.100]  that every time you think you've got a clear understanding
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.100]  of someone else, smart you.
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:25.100]  And so one of the things that I admire about the Cypherpunks,
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.100]  they never got completely arrogant and said
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.100]  that we are going to run things.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.100]  A few tried, and they got shot down by critics
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.100]  who were smarter than they were.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.100]  So what I'd like to caution is don't think
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.100]  that you're going to get this easily.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.100]  It's out of control.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.100]  I'm saying you're going to take some work
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.100]  because you'll be set up repeatedly and entrapped.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.100]  And as with WikiLeaks now,
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.100]  they've got WikiLeaks redacting documents.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.100]  So that means the fix is in.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:53.100]  Because redaction is a control mechanism.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100]  Well, that shows that they're coming to them
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.100]  and saying, don't give out our agents' names.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100]  We'll go easier on you.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.100]  They're already being co-opted.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.100]  Yeah, because of the money.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.100]  The money is fabulous.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.100]  Because they were not making money
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.100]  being out there on their own.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.100]  So now they've raised millions by being on the inside.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.100]  So why not?
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.100]  Well, what is your inside scoop?
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.100]  If you were offered a billion-dollar bribe
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.100]  and you were 39 years old
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.100]  and had no other income,
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100]  think about it.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.100]  It's called a government contract.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.100]  Well, what's your inside intel
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.100]  or your gut if you don't have the inside intel?
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.100]  Is this a big theater with Assange?
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.100]  Or are they
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.100]  burning him for the theater?
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.100]  It's a theater operation.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.100]  Partly entertaining.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.100]  Partly lawling.
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.100]  Partly testing systems.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.100]  Testing public reaction.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.100]  We're going to get traction out of
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.100]  cyber threats or not.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.100]  Will this work or not?
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.100]  They've not actually caused any harm.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.100]  This is the beta testing.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.100]  Now they're going to start releasing even more.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.100]  Then they'll be able to have some last lost
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.100]  or something will happen.
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.100]  Don't forget, these are cheap operations to run.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.100]  And so somewhere,
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.100]  because this is still a fictional war,
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.100]  it's not a real war.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.100]  It's a cyber war, which is all imaginary.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.100]  Let me ask you this.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.100]  We'll see because the law will be ready.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.100]  What is your idea, John Young,
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.100]  from krypton.org, the original WikiLeaker?
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.100]  What is your view, your idea,
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.100]  and I should have you back for a full hour soon.
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.100]  That's incredible.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.100]  I want liberty. I want freedom.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.100]  I want my private property.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.100]  I don't want to be a slave.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.100]  I would imagine that's your view.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.100]  I don't want to be part of an empire.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.100]  I don't want to support all these wars in my name.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.100]  So that's my view.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.100]  I know I'm a good guy,
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.100]  but I know in ways I've been used as well
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.100]  because this is such a complex world.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.100]  And you can't be looking at everything
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.100]  at every time, so nobody's perfect.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.100]  But I know I'm good.
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.100]  I'm not good.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.100]  I don't love this world.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.100]  I don't want to tell you what I'm here for.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.100]  I want my private property.
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.100]  I don't want this world to send me
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.100]  a letter from your view.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.100]  And what should you be doing
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.100]  to somehow stop this from being used
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:15.100]  to start curtailing
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.100]  our speech, and then the globalists,
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.100]  they'll still be able to do what they want.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.100]  Well it's what I was told as a kid,
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.100]  trust no one but yourself
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.100]  and warn people not to trust you.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:31.100]  do not trust anyone who sells you trust, because their own ignorance and finality will betray
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:32.100]  you.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.300]  And so that WikiLeaks will betray Bradley Manning because they've got a million reasons
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.300]  to do so.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.100]  Well, that was a WikiLeaker that did rat him out.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:44.100]  Well, we actually don't know what happened.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:49.100]  I'll just say watching all this with considerable interest, it's still not clear what happened.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.600]  We have our various kinds of trade deals in the media.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.600]  We haven't seen much evidence.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:58.100]  We've got a lot of people who are well-known liars and most hackers are liars because
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.100]  it's up to social engineers.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.100]  Most people on the Internet lie.
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:03.100]  I lie.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.600]  Are you hearing me?
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.600]  I lie.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.100]  I'm lying to you right now.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.100]  Keep that in mind.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.100]  Everyone's got their agenda.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:16.800]  Well, when you say you lie, what you've put out, little disinfo involving where you live
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.800]  or your name.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.100]  I mean, you don't lie about the overall truths.
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:26.300]  I mean, you're saying you lie as like you take the address numbers off your apartment
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.300]  door?
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:32.100]  No, I lie to ignorance that I don't know any better and will not admit it.
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:37.100]  I'll pretend that I've got access to truth by the tail and I'm delivering it to you.
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:42.100]  And so the reason I'm lying is because I don't know how else to convey what I'm doing in
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.100]  an honest way.
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.100]  We need to work on that.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.100]  Everyone exaggerates.
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:53.100]  You know what, no one is perfect and I think the second guess yourself, I mean, I'm not
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.800]  delivering pure truth, so I'm lying to you.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:03.740]  I think if you consciously try to dead reckon as best you can, I think veritas, the proof
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:10.100]  of veritas is on the balance, does 80 plus percent of what you talk about come true or
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:16.540]  90 percent or does everything you do turn out to be wrong and I watch mainstream media.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.260]  They're lying on purpose.
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:19.700]  We're here trying to tell the truth.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:23.460]  We get some things wrong, but I mean, I know there's good people, John.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:28.020]  I mean, my whole issue is I think part of getting into this whole world that you've been part
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:33.460]  of so long is that you're so in with all these other snakes that then it starts blinding
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.580]  you to the fact that there are a lot of good people.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:42.100]  Well, it turns out that one of the best things is to get out of your bunker and meet all
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.100]  these other people.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.380]  I'll say the best thing about crypto is how many people I've met, how many different views
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:49.900]  I would never have known had I not opened myself up to other people's viewpoints.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:55.060]  So when I say I lie, is it the only counter to lying is to have discourse with other people
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:28:00.580]  and stop preaching at them and listen to them closely, let them attack you and don't be
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:04.860]  afraid of that because it's the only way we're going to get out of the, because you know,
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:08.740]  we're taught by education to, to mislead people in our own.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.340]  Yeah, we've got to stop being passive.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.980]  We got to stop being afraid.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.980]  We've got to stop conforming.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:13.980]  That's right.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:14.980]  Well, we've got to be individuals.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:16.980]  I mean, that is the biggest solution overall.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:17.980]  And we've got to be willing...
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:18.980]  And the internet is great for that.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:19.980]  Pardon me?
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.980]  And the internet is great for that.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.980]  And we've got to be willing to go through pain, folks.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.980]  That's right.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.980]  Break your bone bones.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.500]  Well, the best things in life come from breaking your own bones.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500]  I certainly understand what you're saying there.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]  No, it's true.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:41.500]  I'm not into that anymore, but I let him try it to accommodate him.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:45.180]  I grew up in Odessa where bones are broken every night for fun.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.180]  Same here.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.180]  I grew up, same thing.
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.180]  Texas.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.180]  Up where I came from in Dallas, it was people going to the hospital every weekend.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.660]  I love living in Austin.
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.660]  It's not like that.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.660]  It was crazy.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:58.420]  That was the problem for you that I moved away from.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.020]  No, I, believe me, I've certainly moved away from it as well.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.020]  I've probably got a lot fewer brain cells, and now I'm a little bit older, and it hurts
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:05.420]  when I've got a compound fracture.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.260]  It hurts when I broke my hand over and over again.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:12.580]  Now, I want to get you back very, very soon, but in 30 seconds, John Young, you're saying
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.260]  big bombshells coming soon?
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.260]  Yep.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:19.260]  Because that's a pattern.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:23.260]  Everyone that we think is put out has been followed by another one, somewhat more shocking.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:27.260]  And this is, as you know, this is a well-known technique boxers use.
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:31.860]  They slowly build up and just started overwhelming you with unexpected, greater attacks.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:36.460]  Are there any other, are there any other big tidbits that you can give us today?
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.460]  Yeah, I think they're going to come out with some back stuff.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.460]  I think they're going to come out with some...
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.460]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.460]  I've got another guest coming up, and we're going to push him back five minutes.
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.460]  I want you to talk about what you see coming up next.
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:47.460]  Then we're going to get our next guest home, holding five minutes for the next hour.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:51.860]  We'll get Lord Monson on eight after.
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.180]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.660]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:30:01.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460]  Hello, friends.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.460]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:06.560]  You've heard me talk about Calvin five-star soaps for years.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:10.860]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.860]  in stores.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:15.260]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:22.780]  Take my word for it.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:25.780]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:29.920]  Since 1947, Calvin's soap company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.940]  dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.460]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.980]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.100]  Thank you.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:05.700]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:10.060]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:14.380]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.700]  allows you to have.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:16.700]  It's true.
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:21.460]  There's no government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:25.780]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.780]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:33.260]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.980]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:41.700]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.860]  to my old sponsors.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:51.100]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.700]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:32:00.780]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:04.700]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:08.900]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:13.500]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:19.500]  We're looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:28.500]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:34.500]  I'm looking for America.
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.500]  We're American and be proud.
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.500]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.500]  Land on a free and my home of the brave.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:49.500]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.500]  Long gone.
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.500]  But I know in my heart it's still there.
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:14.500]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:19.500]  According to this deep university research, prescription drugs are the leading cause of death in the U.S.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:28.500]  We're going to talk to Professor Donald Light, coming up here in about five minutes, then Christopher Monkton will be joining us from Mexico down in Cancun
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:35.500]  with incredible intel for us on the big mega banks trying to set up a planetary feudal surf system.
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:46.500]  Finishing up with the original wiki leaker, the cypher punk insider, Krypton's lead individual, John Young.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.500]  We've got about four minutes left with you, John, and obviously we appreciate you coming on.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:58.500]  I've seen invaluable information come out that we know that Microsoft and Yahoo don't like how they just spy and steal everything,
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.500]  basically and sell it to the government.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.500]  That was in Wired Magazine now last week.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:09.500]  You know, the fact is we live in a system where the law is being broken by the government every millisecond,
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.500]  but you've been covering this stuff for decades and it's invaluable.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:16.500]  In closing, what are your sources telling you is coming out next?
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.500]  What do you see happening? Any other key tidbits?
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500]  Yep, here it is. Here's a list.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:24.500]  And it may offend some of your listeners.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500]  Here are the sacred cows that come out.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:33.500]  Files on weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:39.500]  Files on global WMT research laboratories and the status of research stocks.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:42.500]  Warplans of all nations, foreign against one another.
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:47.500]  Reports from training literature on black prisons and torture chambers.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.500]  Helped by and chaired among the world's military and spy agencies.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:54.500]  Files of penicides by agencies and their operatives.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.500]  Files on human rights abuses.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.500]  For example, the secret Rick Cross reports on the world's prisons.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.500]  Files of billionaire political meddlers.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.500]  Files of the major banks and their attorneys, and most crucially,
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.500]  the files of all the nations' tax agencies.
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500]  The one key thing that keeps the government going.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:14.500]  Unbelievable.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:18.500]  Here's the one that I think is probably the model for all of us.
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:22.500]  What I call the crown jewels of secret information.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:29.500]  Of the 2,000 year history of the Vatican's meddling in the world's governments.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.500]  And working with the most evil empire the earth has ever seen.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:38.500]  Second to that is the economic version of those files.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:41.500]  Wow, now let's go back to this Vatican situation.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500]  We know the Vatican was involved.
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.500]  That's open intelligence.
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.500]  Founding the Euro.
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.500]  We know it loves to hide itself.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:52.500]  We know that now Lord Blackheath and others are talking about a foundation X.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.500]  Richer than any government on earth.
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:36:00.500]  I mean, more and more stuff that was so secretive that we'd talk about 15, 20 years ago,
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.500]  30, 40 years ago.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.500]  It's now coming out.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:10.500]  And it all points towards an overall attack on the internet.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:16.500]  Using the internet to cause such havoc that it rushes the world towards some type of collapse.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.500]  But briefly, go back to the Vatican here.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500]  That's incredible.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.500]  Specifically from insiders at WikiLeaks.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:30.500]  And you're an insider, you're saying that you've been told Vatican dirt's about to come out.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:37.500]  Well, I'm saying that all the world's spy agencies are based on Vatican techniques and skills.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.500]  They are the keeper of secrets beyond all others.
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.500]  They are the spy beyond all others.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.500]  That's what Hitler said.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500]  He said it was the Jesuit model.
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.500]  Well, but there was stuff before the Jesuits because it's older than that.
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:53.500]  And so the Jesuits is almost a popular version of what they actually do.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:56.500]  So what they do and have with their files is what we want to see.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.500]  Not these popular versions that we see on novels and so forth, is that we need to see the files.
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.500]  I.e. I'm a believer in documents, not in fairy tales.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:09.500]  And that's how we need to see the files of the national tax agencies, not their PR.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:14.500]  They're derived from the Vatican, or Vatican-like operations.
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.500]  It's how you extort money from the people.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:21.500]  But scaring a man and offering salvation.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.500]  So that's what's coming.
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.500]  Okay.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:31.500]  In order, in closing, in the order you went, is when this is going to be coming out?
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:35.500]  Or is it a mix and match?
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.500]  Well, according to WikiLeaks, the next one will be a...
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:42.500]  They claim they got a hard disk from a major bank.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.500]  Some people say it's a bank from America.
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:49.500]  Now, there's a lot of these hard disks floating around because banks use these stinging operations as does FBI.
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:53.500]  So WikiLeaks is not sure they got a real one, but they say they got one.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500]  And they've been trying to authenticate it.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:59.500]  Since banks are a popular target now, that's probably something like that will come out.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:05.500]  But don't forget, they always hit us with a bombshell we didn't expect, so it could be a ploy.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:11.500]  It's possible that something won't come out, I'd say, like the Clinton Foundation, or something, you know...
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:15.500]  They're very astute taking something that will be popular.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:18.500]  That's why they played the anti-American card.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.500]  But that's very popular outside the U.S.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.500]  John, I want to get you on the Sunday show to do a full hour if we can.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:30.500]  We've had to... I understand... This is a big syndicated show. I've had to delay you twice.
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.500]  I don't care if you use, you know, mild cuss words, but we have to delay those out.
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:40.500]  So hopefully... I don't want to thank you for coming on, but hopefully I can get you on the Sunday show.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:47.500]  And have you on, and you can just use the acronym Bologna.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:52.500]  Thank you so much coming on from Cryptom.org. Amazing information there on the site.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.500]  And I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:01.500]  I'm going to have my producer call you in about five minutes to see if I can get you on for a full hour coming up Sunday
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:05.500]  to really go over the bombshells you just dropped on us. Thank you.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.500]  Take care, Alex.
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.500]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:13.500]  Wow, that'll make your head hurt.
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:19.500]  It makes you think it's so many things going on, so many things happening.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.500]  For the next 25 minutes, we're going to have Donald Light.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:30.500]  He is a low-key visiting professor at Stanford University and professor of comparative health care,
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.500]  the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:40.500]  He is an economic and organizational sociologist who compares health care systems and pharmacological policy
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:44.500]  as a founding fellow of the Center for Bioethics.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:49.500]  He has become concerned about how few new drugs are clinically much better than existing ones,
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.500]  yet causing substantial risk to patients.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:57.500]  Prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death, from the numbers I've seen it could be the leading cause,
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:00.500]  and result in 2.2 million hospitalizations a year.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:05.500]  Professor Light is a co-author and editor of the Risk of Prescription Drugs 2010.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:11.500]  His research has appeared in leading medical and social science journals,
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:15.500]  and I've got the book right here, The Risk of Prescription Drugs,
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:22.500]  Columbia University Press, Social Science Research Council series on privatization of risk,
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.500]  and it's got the boil down here.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:29.500]  How do prescription drugs become a leading cause of death of the risk of prescription drugs?
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:33.500]  And the numbers I've seen in the news are 300,000 drug-related deaths.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:38.500]  That's almost rivaling heart attack, cancer, and auto bill accident.
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:42.500]  So is it the fourth, the third, the second, the first?
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.500]  Does it matter?
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:48.500]  I mean, you hear these drug ads, and oh, having trouble needing to urinate a lot?
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.500]  Well, take this.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500]  Now it'll give you brain cancer, have a heart attack, you may go insane,
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.500]  make you suicidal, blood clots, but it doesn't matter.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:57.500]  Call your physician if you think this is right for you, because you're a doctor.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.500]  It's incredible.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.500]  So we've got him on with this for the next 25 minutes,
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.500]  and we'll certainly have him back up again for a full hour in the future.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.500]  Professor Light, thank you for joining us.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.500]  Well, it's a pleasure.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.500]  And I've been reading about all the great things that you've been doing,
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:15.500]  these wonderful documentary films and interviews.
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:16.500]  It's very impressive.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.500]  I'm really delighted to be talking with you.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.500]  Well, I'm delighted to have you on with us, sir.
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.500]  We've got limited time, so I'm going to try to sit back and shut up.
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:28.500]  If you were talking to an auditorium at a city council,
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:33.500]  and you had 25 minutes to talk to them, what would you say?
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:39.500]  Well, you've summarized the main finding that we had in this little book.
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:44.500]  It's only the size of a 5x7 photograph and only 160 pages long.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:49.500]  It was written for general lay audiences with short, easy to read chapters.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:57.500]  And it describes, as you say, that most of the new drugs are little better than existing drugs.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.500]  I have a table here.
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:04.500]  Out of the 980 drugs that were approved in the last decade,
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:10.500]  only 40 were regarded as important therapeutic advances.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.500]  So that's about 4%.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:19.500]  And another 106 were judged clinically to be superior to existing drugs.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:24.500]  And all the rest were judged to add little value.
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.500]  Now, why is that?
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:30.500]  Well, that's because the FDA approves drugs against placebo,
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:34.500]  a placebo meaning a pill that is inert.
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:39.500]  And you don't know whether you're taking the active new drug or the placebo,
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.500]  and that's what is done in a clinical trial.
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:47.500]  And then you see whether the people who took the active drug got better
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:51.500]  against some criterion that the trial is for.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:57.500]  But that means that when the FDA approves new drugs as more effective and better
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:00.500]  and drug companies talk about as being more effective,
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:04.500]  what they really mean is more effective than inert pill.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.500]  In fact, the FDA is prohibited from ruling whether new drugs are better than existing drugs.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:16.500]  And on the safety side, they approve them as safe with very little evidence about their safety
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:21.500]  because the trials are designed to minimize evidence of safety.
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:30.500]  And so the actual evidence they have about whether these drugs are safe for you is pretty minimal.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:35.500]  Well, an example I would use, Professor, is I know how to read the insert of a drug.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can read it.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:45.500]  And Gardasil vaccines, they admitted in the trials, killed quite a few people.
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500]  They had autoimmune responses.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:52.500]  And then of the hundreds of different papillomaviruses, they admitted it only covered six or so.
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:57.500]  And then it said this may not even stop you from getting cervical cancer.
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:02.500]  And then the literature went on to admit that it's only killing a few thousand people a year,
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.500]  and that's normally a treatable.
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:10.500]  And so the benefits are far outweighed by the dangers,
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:14.500]  but Merck just comes into Texas, gives a bunch of money to the politicians,
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.500]  and they don't say, hey, little girls, and now they're saying, little boys,
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.500]  you got to take this so you don't get this cancer virus.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:25.500]  I mean, right there, it's just incredible.
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:31.500]  Right. I was told that doing the interview with you was like quickly going 60 miles an hour.
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:40.500]  I'm not an expert on Gardasil, but you've put your finger on the new blockbuster era.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.500]  So the companies have figured out that they can make vaccines or vaccine-like things
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.500]  that they will call vaccines because the definition is being broadened
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.500]  for a wide number of conditions.
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:56.500]  And about every half year, we will see a new vaccine.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:01.500]  Well, for the last 25 years, you didn't see a new vaccine very often.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:07.500]  And the prices will be about $70 a dose, or often you need two or three of those.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.500]  They'll be like $200, $300, $400.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:16.500]  And you're right that the vaccine advocates and the companies
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:21.500]  sort of market to the public officials in the Department of Public Health
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:26.500]  or the Centers for Disease Control simply to get these things on a list.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:29.500]  So it's easy, cheap marketing.
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:36.500]  Then it becomes part of the requirements for what children should take.
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:39.500]  And you're right that it's a real worry.
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:43.500]  Well, it just builds it in that the business model of these companies
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.500]  is to come lobby government to push something on you.
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:52.500]  But your book, I mean, it goes over the real evidence of how much harm these drugs are causing.
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:59.500]  And more and more of medicine is just here to take these drugs.
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:04.500]  So continue going through the serious risks that we're looking at here.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:09.500]  Okay, well, one thing I think is worth saying is that drug companies
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:13.500]  are most enlightened and sophisticated corporations,
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.500]  and they do a lot of serious good science.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:20.500]  And I live in an area where there are a lot of people who work for drug companies,
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:24.500]  and there are lots of wonderful employees at those companies.
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:30.500]  But what I find disturbing are what must be executive decisions that are being made,
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:36.500]  many layers above by the people pulling down several million dollars a year
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:42.500]  in salaries and bonuses, above all the good staff people at drug companies.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:51.500]  And one of the main things is that they repeatedly are heavily advertising to people
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:56.500]  to take drugs for things that they were not tested for or approved.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:04.500]  In the last two years, Alex, drug companies have paid $6 billion in fines
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:11.500]  from prosecutions by attorney generals for illegal marketing
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:16.500]  and getting people to take drugs for reasons that are not approved.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.500]  This includes Johnson & Johnson.
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:22.500]  Pfizer's the biggest $2.3 billion in fines.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:26.500]  In the last two years, Eli Lilly, $1.4 billion.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.500]  Blacksmith's applying $400 million.
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:33.500]  Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly, every one you've ever heard of Abbott,
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:36.500]  and then ones that you probably haven't heard of,
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:38.500]  listeners may not have heard of,
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:47.500]  all aggressively promoting to your doctors and to all of us through advertising,
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.500]  which by the way, we're one of only two countries in the world
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:56.500]  now direct to consumer advertising because the whole idea behind prescription drugs
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:05.500]  was for 50 years that it was your doctor who decided whether you needed a certain drug
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.500]  and it was the doctor whose job it was to stay on top of development.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:17.500]  Now with this direct advertising, they're getting patients to go and tell the doctor what to prescribe
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:23.500]  and often for a condition that's not been tested for.
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:27.500]  Well, I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:33.500]  Yeah, so I mean one simple thing that we recommend at the end of this little book,
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:40.500]  which is only $15, I think it's the cheapest book that Columbia Press has ever published
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:46.500]  and it was, I make no money on it, it was funded by the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:53.500]  and they just paid us fees to do the writing that we did, so we got no royalties.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:57.500]  But I just think people need to read this little book and learn about this issue
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:00.500]  and talk about it and protect themselves.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:06.500]  So one thing that's recommended in the last short chapter is that whenever a drug is prescribed
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:14.500]  for an unapproved use, which is called off-label, but I think unapproved use really puts it on the table, clearly,
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:20.500]  is assigned consent. So your doctor should hand you a piece of paper, might have one sentence saying,
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:26.500]  I understand that this prescription is being given to me by my doctor for a condition
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.500]  for which it has not been approved and I agree.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:34.500]  I mean, you know, I think if most of your listeners were handed a piece of paper like that,
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:38.500]  they'd say, well, doctor, what's going on? Why are you doing this?
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:44.500]  I mean, we see doctors and clinics that aren't even checking to see what other medications you're on
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:51.500]  and I see even young people now with big tables just full of different pills they're taking.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:55.500]  I mean, and then all these weird drug interactions, what are the numbers?
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:00.500]  What do we know? I mean, how many people a year die from these drug interactions?
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:06.500]  Well, the total estimated deaths from hospitalized patients is 111,000,
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:12.500]  but as you said so well at the beginning, it was a wonderful introduction you gave to this talk.
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:21.500]  We don't know how many more because that doesn't count all the people who die at home, at work, driving, walking,
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:26.500]  and so forth, so it's a very limited measure that we have.
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:33.500]  And one of the things that really appalls me is here is roughly the fourth,
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:39.500]  you say it might be the third leading cause of death, and there are relatively few
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:46.500]  efforts to track and detail studies. So when you ask, well, how many people die from drug interactions
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:51.500]  from what's called polypharmacy taking two, three, four, five drugs?
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:57.500]  I can't think of a study that actually does more than just guess what that is.
[01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:01.500]  So we only know about the surface of the tip of the iceberg. Stay there, Professor.
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:06.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.500]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.500]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:16.500]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country,
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:21.500]  and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:26.500]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank,
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:31.500]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.500]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.500]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:44.500]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:53.500]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:58.500]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:27.500]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:05.500]  What one food can help you to lose fat, build lean muscle, improve immune function,
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:09.500]  improve blood sugar and mood, support normal blood pressure, detoxify,
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:12.500]  reduce inflammation, and increase endurance.
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:17.500]  This one superfood in nature comes from unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.500]  Of all the whey protein powders on the market,
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:22.500]  there is only one that is both unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.500]  It is called One World Whey.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:28.500]  It is well known that the support of your entire body's repair from whey protein powder
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:33.500]  is superior to milk, eggs, meat, or any vegetarian protein.
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.500]  One World Whey can offer you a real boost in your health and well-being.
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:39.500]  If you'd like more energy or want to lose fat or gain muscle,
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.500]  or if you want to feel better or have more endurance for work or play,
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.500]  then try One World Whey.
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.500]  It comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:50.500]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.500]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:56.500]  Or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:18.500]  One World Whey.com.
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:29.500]  Thank you very much.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.500]  Thank you very much.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:31.500]  The government freaks out about a few people dying from terrorism,
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.500]  but more people die from bee stings every year.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.500]  But then meanwhile, you've got one of the major causes of death,
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:41.500]  and I see wilder and wilder ads for drugs where it sounds like
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:44.500]  the side effects are a thousand times worse than what it's treating.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:48.500]  So I'm glad your book is really trying to bring some light to this,
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:51.500]  Professor Light, and tell folks where they can get the book.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:58.500]  Oh, well, the best place is Amazon, and you just put in the risks of prescription drugs.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:02.500]  My website is pharma-mits.net.
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:07.500]  That's P-H-A-R-M-A-M-I-T-H-S.net.
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:11.500]  Because I've also been looking into the claims by companies
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:15.500]  that it costs an average of $1.3 billion in research and development
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:19.500]  to bring a new drug to market, extremely expensive.
[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:22.500]  And when you break down their numbers,
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:26.500]  and all the numbers are created by economists who are retained by the companies,
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:29.500]  it comes out to be a small fraction of that,
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:34.500]  because they use all kinds of inflators to puff the number up.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:38.500]  Wow, I look forward to having you back on for a full hour in the near future.
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.500]  Professor, give us that website one more time.
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:47.500]  It's pharma-mits.net.
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.500]  And it's the risk of prescription drugs.
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:53.500]  And I thought I'd give you one example if we have a minute of misleading ads.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:56.500]  So this is an ad for Lipitor about a few days ago.
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:01.500]  It starts with saying, did you know more than 80% of people who have heart attacks
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.500]  have high cholesterol?
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.500]  Now, how is that misleading?
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:09.500]  Well, because although it's true, 90% of the people who have cholesterol
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.500]  don't have heart attacks.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.500]  It's a different denominator.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.500]  If you start with all the people with heart attacks,
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:20.500]  most of them have 10 fingers and 80% of them have cholesterol.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:23.500]  But if you start with the millions and millions who have high cholesterol,
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:25.500]  very few of them have heart attacks.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:29.500]  And the evidence is quite clear now that taking statins to lower cholesterol
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.500]  in people who do not already have a risk of heart disease
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:37.500]  does not reduce the probability of dying.
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.500]  It does not decrease the risk.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.500]  Well, now they want to put statins in the water.
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.500]  Have you seen those announcements?
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.500]  Yeah.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:49.500]  I mean, is Big Pharma just going to take over our total economy?
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.500]  I mean, it's like GMO, a closely allied with Big Pharma,
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500]  basically the same group.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:58.500]  Oh, we don't want you to know this is a GMO salmon that's part insect or part eel.
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:01.500]  Oh, we don't want you to know this goat's part insect.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:05.500]  Oh, we don't want you to know that corn in studies caused all sorts of birth defects.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.500]  Oh, I mean, just on and on and on.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:09.500]  Professor, great having you on.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.500]  I look forward to talking to you again in the future when I've had a chance to read the book.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:12.500]  See you next week.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:13.500]  You bet, take care.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.500]  See you next Thursday.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:15.500]  All right.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:18.500]  All right, buddy, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:23.500]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this break.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:30.500]  And then eight after we've got a, or Chris Ramonkin with Key Intel coming up from what's going on
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.500]  down in Mexico with the UN meeting.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.500]  I've got some other important news I want to hit on in the brief segment coming up.
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.500]  Hour number three is 70 seconds away.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.500]  Don't forget, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:51.500]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:55.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:00.500]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:05.500]  I've told you for years that eFoods Direct has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.500]  Now it's that time of year again.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.500]  And their holiday specialist here.

[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:11.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.500]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.500]  Geese Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:31.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:36.500]  You're watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, we punched up Fox News Live.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:37.500]  And it makes no sense.
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.500]  We've been watching it for a while.
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:44.500]  It says, police burning down California bomb home.
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500]  I mean, what does that mean?
[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:50.500]  I mean, if they think there's a bomb in there, why would they burn it down instead of going
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.500]  in and defusing it or using a robot?
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:58.500]  Authorities have set fire to suburban San Diego home.
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:05.500]  They say it was so packed with homemade explosives, they had no choice but to burn it to the ground.
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:08.500]  Okay, who knows if that's even true now?
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.500]  I mean, they're burning the evidence down.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:13.500]  Authorities are using, blow that up for me.
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:14.500]  I can't read it across the room.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:15.500]  Thanks.
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.500]  Again, I'm reading it off a telescreen across the room here.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:25.500]  Authorities are using helicopters and air pollution sensors to monitor the controlled burn for
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.500]  potential health problems.
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.500]  The house was rented by an out-of-work software consultant who allegedly assembled an astonishing
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:37.500]  quantity of bomb-making material that included chemicals used by Middle Eastern suicide bombers.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:40.500]  Investigators are still trying to understand his motivation.
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.500]  Authorities say the fire should be over within a few hours.
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:47.500]  Well, obviously it's a type of explosive they believe it ain't going to blow up.
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:52.500]  But, I mean, will they show up in my house that I guess I might have a bag of black cats
[02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:57.500]  and smoke bombs left over from 4th of July?
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:02.500]  I mean, are they going to...
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:03.500]  This is crazy.
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:07.500]  I mean, are they going to blow my house up and say, oh, there were bombs in there.
[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:09.500]  We had to burn it up, though.
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:13.500]  You know, they did that to get rid of the witnesses that the government had staged the
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:18.500]  Madrid bombings, what, six, seven years ago, and it came out that that was staged in the
[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:19.500]  Spanish news.
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.500]  And so they just went and blew up the entire apartment building that the terrorists were
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:23.500]  supposedly in.
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.500]  Now, that's how you get rid of your witnesses.
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:26.500]  You just blow the whole building up.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:29.500]  That is very suspicious what you're seeing right there.
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:32.500]  How are they going to prosecute this supposed person in court?
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.500]  I mean, how do we know anything of the...
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:38.500]  I don't believe a word they say, especially the San Diego PD.
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:39.500]  Who knows?
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:40.500]  It might be true.
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:41.500]  It's just insane.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:45.500]  Eight police officers seriously injured in battle with mob of anarchists, probably their
[02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:51.500]  own officers, outside parliament as the MPs vote through the rise in student fees.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:55.500]  We're going to come back with Lord Moncton here in just a moment, but first I want to
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.500]  tell you about an amazing Christmas gift.
[02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:01.500]  I know that'll make those that are waging war against Christmas mad, but I will say it.
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.500]  Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:08.500]  Continuing, Renew Tech Solutions is offering the ultimate knife at the ultimate price, the
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:09.500]  Fox Karambit.
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:10.500]  It's an incredible knife.
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:15.500]  This amazing knife is a form fitted and beveled to be the most comfortable knife ever held.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:20.500]  The ring featured helps keep the knife secure in place and help prevent slipping and being
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:21.500]  disarmed.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:26.500]  The immersion wave catch feature allows you to open it with one hand faster than a switch
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.500]  blade with no spring, so it's totally legal.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:32.500]  Full one-year warranty and full seven-day trial money-back guarantee.
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:39.500]  Lastly, to the overwhelming response, Renew Tech Solutions major updates this past week

[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:06.500]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:09.500]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:11.500]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:15.500]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.500]  health and your own family.
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:20.500]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:22.500]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.500]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:32.500]  mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.500]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:39.500]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:41.500]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.500]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:47.500]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:52.500]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:53.500]  That's End of America.

[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:25.500]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:29.500]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.500]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:36.500]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:41.500]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:46.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:18.500]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:23.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:34.500]  Well, the headlines are everywhere. Record cold temperatures in Cancun for the Global Government Summit that Lord Christopher Monkton is attending and covering.
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:41.500]  And we're going to be having just a moment from the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Mexico.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:48.500]  Here's this week's news reporting irony alert, the unusually chilly global warming summit in Cancun.
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:58.500]  The reporting record low temperatures. Areas of Europe are reporting the coldest temperatures since the 1560s, the 1650s, 1670s.
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:09.500]  Mrs. Monkton, the wife of the third Viscount of Brinchley and Monkton, she can't get out of the house in Scotland for 14 days because they're snowed in.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:14.500]  I've talked to Paul Watson, who's over in England. It's just the coldest in his lifetime he's seen.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:21.500]  Now, that doesn't mean the earth is necessarily getting colder. Every time there's a hot summer, they say it means we're getting warmer.
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:27.500]  You have to go through long periods. You have to study it. There's always microclimates that are having extreme weather.
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:35.500]  But it does illustrate that we know in the last 15 years the warming trend has stopped and is now going down.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:44.500]  But we hope for a warming trend. We hope for more carbon dioxide. That's the science. We've gone over that with Lord Monkton at Nausium.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:53.500]  His website, scienceandpublicpolicy.org, really is the preeminent site to really get the true research.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:58.500]  But instead of going over just the background, I want to talk about what they're politically trying.
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:05.500]  They've shifted from saying the sky is falling warming to overpopulation, Ted Turner saying get rid of people.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:11.500]  They've got TV ads running showing children being blown up by explosives if they don't agree to cut their carbon footprint.
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:19.500]  They're calling for eco-fascism and calling it fascism and saying green fascism is good, not about the environment.
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:24.500]  None of us who have children want a bad environment. It's about power grabs and collectivism.
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:33.500]  And Lord Monkton, to give us a rundown for the next 50 minutes, graciously just got to his hotel out of a storm there with the police escorting him.
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:43.500]  He sounded like a tornado or a tempest was going on around him. He's now gotten to cover and we're going to talk to him via cell phone from Cancun, Mexico,
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:50.500]  with so much happening as a global freeze hits much of the planet. Good to have you, sir.
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:58.500]  Well, it's very good to be with you, Alex. I'm now actually in the security center at the Cancun conference center.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:04.500]  I finally managed to get in and there was quite a wind blowing outside. It's just to rain.
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:09.500]  It's colder than it's been since we've been in fact now five days.
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:18.500]  They have had colder temperatures here in Cancun than have ever been recorded at this time of year since records began.
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:23.500]  So this is very exceptional. You've heard about my lovely wife, Lady Monkton. She has snowed up at home,
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:30.500]  a central England temperature record showing the coldest first week of December since 1659.
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:37.500]  And you're quite right, Alex, to put in that cautionary note about how this doesn't mean there's no such thing as global warming
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:42.500]  or we can't be having an effect on the planet. What it does mean, and again you're quite both about this,
[02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:48.500]  is that the rate at which this global warming is supposed to be occurring simply isn't happening.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:57.500]  And in fact, the truth of the matter is that in the last 15 years, as Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:03.500]  was recently compelled to admit when I got BBC to ask him a question about it,
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:09.500]  there has been no significant global warming at all 15 years.
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:15.500]  This is beginning to be a longer period to be altogether ignored as simply a blip.
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:21.500]  It is beginning very much to look at, though, exactly as the likes of me have been saying all along.
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:26.500]  Yes, we may get some warming, but it will be very slow and it will be very harmless.
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:34.500]  It's not going to be a problem. However, delegates here in Cancun are exactly the usual kind of robotic crowd
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:39.500]  of enviro-zombies that you would expect to find that, these things.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:44.500]  And they are getting around saying the planet's doomed, as you rightly pointed out.
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:49.500]  Ted Turner is beginning to say, what we've got to have is a global one-child policy
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:56.500]  and that dreadful move he made in the UK by one of these taxpayer-thundered pressure groups
[02:12:56.500 --> 02:13:02.500]  showing children being blown up and their blood spattered over their classmates
[02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:05.500]  because they had not been willing to agree with their teacher
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:08.500]  that global warming was the worstest problem ever.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:15.500]  That is the kind of hysteria that you always get when those who have been peddling a lie
[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:20.500]  realize that they're not going to be able to get away with it for very much longer.
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:22.500]  And are you still there?
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:28.500]  And one delegate recently said to one of my colleagues here, he said, oh yes,
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:32.500]  of course my colleague up there on the rostrum is talking about how terrible global warming
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:36.500]  is privately there, he said, we know perfectly well that it isn't.
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:41.500]  But our government has told us to say this because it feeds an advantage to itself
[02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:46.500]  against its taxpayers and against the people of the world in pretending that there is a problem.
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:50.500]  So there is a growing willingness on the part of solid delegates here to admit
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:53.500]  that they personally don't believe the word of it.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:58.500]  Of course you have all the extremist groups here, the Marxists, the Greenies,
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:01.500]  and the two are virtually indistinguishable and the policies they advocate these days.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.500]  They are all here in profusion.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:09.500]  Every sort of weird organization, there are gender-centered women against climate change,
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:15.500]  there are people dressed up as polar bears, all this kind of stupidity goes on.
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:21.500]  But behind it all, Alex, I think those are considerable change in tone.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:27.500]  What is beginning to happen is compared with the triumphalism of Copenhagen,
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:33.500]  and Poznan, and Bali, the previous three years, the annual canberris
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:37.500]  of taxpayers' expense all around the world at exotic locations.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:43.500]  What we're getting here is a much more sullen, sober, even somber mood.
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:48.500]  People here are beginning to realize they aren't going to get away with this for very much longer.
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:53.500]  And so contrary to the reports that you have seen in the news papers
[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:58.500]  about how nothing very much is going to happen here in Cancun,
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:04.500]  the bureaucracy which is trying to turn itself into a world government
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:09.500]  having failed to do so when the world government treaty at Copenhagen was simply thrown out,
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:14.500]  now they're trying to do it by stealth with a series of decisions at this conference
[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:19.500]  which the chairman of the conference, I've seen her note on this, thinks they're going to get away with
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:26.500]  creating several hundred new bureaucracies, a hundred billion dollars per year from now and forever
[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:33.500]  from the wealthy nations of the West to be paid to the new world government.
[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:39.500]  And this will go up to 1.5% of GDP if one of the options on the paper is adopted,
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:43.500]  which it may well be, giving this new world government a permanent revenue
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.500]  which will permanently grow as GDP grows.
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:52.500]  So we're looking at a really ambitious power grab by the nasty people who are behind this scam.
[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:55.500]  I'm quite worried they may yet get away with it.
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:59.500]  I think they are going to get away with most of what I've just described here.
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:03.500]  And once they've got it, if we like the EU, give them the money and give them the power
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:08.500]  and then they become unstoppable and they'll get more money and more power until they run anything.
[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:15.500]  And of course, not one of these people is elected by us, the people of the world.
[02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:20.500]  It is all a dictatorship which is gradually taking power from democratic nations
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:23.500]  and from the leaders and elected representatives of those nations
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:28.500]  and putting it to the hands of faceless bureaucrats who we cannot elect, cannot question,
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:32.500]  cannot put to account, cannot remove and cannot replace.
[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:38.500]  Okay, now going back and in past years, they were arrogant, they were celebratory,
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:43.500]  they would have these huge parties, they were the saviors of the earth.
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:49.500]  Now, they're becoming a global laughing stock, but as you said, they're now burrowing down,
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:56.500]  realizing their time is short, everything that's invested in this, and they're trying to get it through.
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:02.500]  Last year, you were instrumental in helping distribute the Danish text in analyzing it.
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:08.500]  The Third World learned that it would basically double the amount of taxes that they had to pay
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:13.500]  versus the West. It wasn't the freebie giveaway, that it was a death sentence
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:17.500]  to over a billion people cutting their energy.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:20.500]  It's now admitted this is about shutting down industrialized societies.
[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:27.500]  So, how are they trying to round this through? What is in the different texts that you've been able to see?
[02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:33.500]  Are there any secret treaties? Like last time, give us the intel, Lord Monkton.
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:38.500]  What they've done this time is they've done what one of the senior officials here
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:43.500]  who also doesn't believe a word of this, I say that the growing kind of rift in the lute now,
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:49.500]  you could see more and more getting ready to jump ship as they see it going glug glug glug down beneath the waves.
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:55.500]  One of them said, he said, what they're going for is an approach called apparent impenetrability.
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:18:01.500]  What this means is that everything I've just described to you, this extra money and the extra bureaucracies,
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:06.500]  they're all listed, they're all specified in the documents which are openly available
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:11.500]  and which nobody, including the delegates, actually reads the notes by the chair
[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:17.500]  on the expected outcome of this conference, which is one I'm basing things on because that's likely to be right.
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:24.500]  They've had several preliminary conferences first informed, then in Tintin in China last month to prepare for this one.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:27.500]  So they pretty well all knew where they were going when they got here.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:31.500]  So the chairman's note is a pretty good guide to what is actually going to happen.
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:35.500]  But get this, it's 33 pages long.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:42.500]  It's written in the most obscurantist obfuscatory, obfuscating style, which is enough to send anybody to sleep.
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:52.500]  And unless you know what the code words mean, you've never realized how much of an expansion of centralized undemocratic power this whole exercise is.
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:56.500]  For instance, let me give you an example. You wanted me to quote from these documents.
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:04.500]  They use a phrase called improving capacity building in the least developed and less well-developed countries.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:06.500]  You think that sounds wonderful.
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:10.500]  So you go and you talk to a few of the UN officials who draw up this garbage
[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:13.500]  and you say, what does capacity building mean?
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:17.500]  And it's nothing to do with industrial capacity or economic capacity
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:22.500]  or the capacity to live a civilized life or educational capacity or health capacity.
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:24.500]  No, it's bureaucratic capacity.
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:32.500]  What capacity building means in these documents is that there are going to be vast bureaucracies established in these less developed countries
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:41.500]  which will come directly under the control of our new masters, the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:45.500]  That's what capacity building means. It occurs all the way through the pages.
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:47.500]  It sounds wonderful when you read it.
[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:50.500]  You think, oh, I'm really doing some good for the third world here.
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:54.500]  All they're doing is putting in bureaucracies to govern them.
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:58.500]  You've got to rule them under the new neo-futilism of the environmental iron fist.
[02:19:58.500 --> 02:20:01.500]  Stay with us, Lord Monkton. Back after this quick break.
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:05.500]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:10.500]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:13.500]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works.
[02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:16.500]  For all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.500]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:25.500]  So I used the program methods and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:28.500]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:30.500]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:32.500]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:38.500]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.

[02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:17.500]  We're sending out an SOS against tyranny. Ted Turner, third biggest landowner in the world, behind the Queen of England and Dutch royalty.
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:19.500]  He owns 2 million acres in the U.S.
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:24.500]  He has five children. He has more than 20 aircraft, more than a dozen homes.
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:31.500]  He flies in on his private jet and then lectures us, we shouldn't take a hot shower, we shouldn't have more than one child.
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:33.500]  We shouldn't take a hot bath.
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:39.500]  People all over England, old people being cut off their gas allowance, are having to ride around in buses to stay warm.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:49.500]  The Guardian reports, but there's plenty of gas and power for all the rich people in the U.S. and England that stand to make money off the carbon tax.
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:25:02.500]  Lord Monkton, I heard that you've been trying to track down Mr. Eugenics, Mr. Green, Green Himmler, Herr Ted Turner.
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:06.500]  Yes, absolutely. The graph was following two Turner.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:14.500]  He was attending a business conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel a couple of days ago, here on the Sandy Strip at Cancun.
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:21.500]  And I gate-crashed the conference and went around it for a bit until eventually the organizers came along and chased me out.
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:30.500]  And they said, you're not allowed in here. The only people who are allowed into this conference are people who believe that global warming is the worst possible proper ever is ever in the world.
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:33.500]  And you're not allowed in. It was sort of baby talk they use.
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.500]  And I said, but I want to meet Mr. Turner. I'd like to issue a challenge to him.
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:42.500]  I'd like to provide some entertainment for the delegates here by having a one-to-one debate with him in front of them.
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:45.500]  Or is he going to run away and are you going to run away?
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:49.500]  He said, no, sir, you're going to run away. We don't want your sort here.
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:59.500]  So clearly, there is a reluctance on the part of Mr. Turner to face the amiable fear of the realm, Lord Monkton, on a debate about the climate.
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:04.500]  And why might that be? Well, I suspect it's the same reason Ted, baby, as Al baby.
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:14.500]  When I threatened to debate him, I sent a challenge to Al Gore. He also backed off. In fact, he's been backing off and running away for nearly four years now.
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:22.500]  So Ted, if you're going to join the run, join the panic, join the escape, then you just avoid debating with me face to face.
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:32.500]  I'll debate with you, Ted, baby, anywhere in the world on international television and we'll take any format of debate that you like as long as it's reasonably fair.
[02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:39.500]  And then you and I will go head to head and we'll argue this thing out and let's see who prevails.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:47.500]  Now, Alex, what I would advise is whatever you do, don't hold your breath waiting for a reply from Ted Turner.
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:51.500]  Any more than you would have done if you'd waited for a reply from Al Gore.
[02:26:51.500 --> 02:27:00.500]  I'm getting to run out of white feathers on fire state to send to these people who are backing out of this debate because they know perfectly well.
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:09.500]  Just as the delegates here, many of them privately are now admitting they know perfectly well that there is no global warming problem.
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:18.500]  It is simply a chimera. It is simply a device used by people who have other agendas which are extremely nasty.
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:32.500]  Here we are effectively trying to reinstall global fascism having just got rid of it in Europe. Now, here we are reinstalling global fascism in the name of saving the planet.
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:40.500]  And as you and I know, Alex, the planet was triumphantly saved 2,000 years ago and it doesn't need to be saved again.
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:51.500]  Expanding on that, James Cameron issued challenges to leading global warming skeptics and then when leading one step forward, he chickened out.
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:57.500]  They will not debate it and they know deep down it's an excuse to have a managed takeover economy.
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:03.500]  A lot of them are on record admitting that. What percentage of the higher ups know it's a complete fraud?
[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:12.500]  We know from their internal emails that they know it's a fraud and that they've got to hide the truth. What percentage of them know it's a fraud?
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:23.500]  And then you've got the people in polar bear outfits running around. I see more and more of the camp followers realizing they were on some type of Jim Jones cult compound.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:35.500]  That's a very good description of this place. I must say it is a very curious religion. Let's start with your point about whether the higher ups know what's really going on, that they know that there isn't a problem.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:48.500]  Let me give you an example. At last year's Copenhagen conference, one of my colleagues here, Wolfgang Müller, from the German division of the Committee for Reconstructive Tomorrow, which I represent here at this conference,
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:56.500]  he was standing next to one of the two delegates, official delegates from Party Star, which is one of the state's parties to the convention.
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:02.500]  And the other delegate was up on the stage speaking about how terrible it all was. We were having frauds, we were having droughts, and we were having this and we were having that.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:12.500]  It was all ghastly and it was all because of our fault. And quite to the other delegate said, he knows, and I know, there's not a word of truth in any of that.
[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:21.500]  And the whole of this thing is just nonsense, but we've been turned by our government to say it. And so that's what we have to say.
[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:29.500]  Lord Monkton, Lord Monkton, we've got to go to break, and that's just as well because you just covered some key info. Your phone for the first time was breaking up.
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:40.500]  Let's perhaps re-establish the line or see if it clears up during the break. I want you to come back because that takes us to the WikiLeaks cable, which the State Department admits is real,
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:49.500]  which you covered without having the secret documents that the U.S. and England were in their twisting arms last year and promising people payoffs if they went along.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:58.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.500 --> 02:30:09.500]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:14.500]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:20.500]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:25.500]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:36.500]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:42.500]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:49.500]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:31:00.500]  Yet you're copy a fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:06.500]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:15.500]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:20.500]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:31.500]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:41.500]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:54.500]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.500 --> 02:32:12.500]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:32.500]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:39.500]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:43.500]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:47.500]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:47.500 --> 02:33:01.500]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:25.500]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude. People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:41.500]  I hope she would better start from the beginning.
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:44.500]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:51.500]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools. They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:58.500]  Mercury-containing vacuums may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:05.500]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:10.500]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:28.500]  For now, the government has the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:47.500]  I have to say, there's a need for a new world order. Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:35:00.500]  I'm Alex Jones. Lord Christopher Monkton joins us. His website and organization is the leading think tank, really laying out the facts of this global takeover.
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:04.500]  And we are beginning to win battles and the war.
[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:17.500]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org, our sites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv. We are fighting the prison planet with the collectivist and their elitist owners.
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:25.500]  See, the ultra-rich many of them are in a camp not liking free market. They want to use government to shut everybody else down because they can't compete.
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:31.500]  And Lord Monkton is fighting them and routing them to the ends of the earth and they run from him in literal fear.
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:43.500]  I've seen video activists have shot. It is as if the mild-mannered Lord is Darth Vader or something or a giant bucket of holy water to a vampire.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:51.500]  Now, I have the London Guardian report here, Lord Monkton, where they admit and the State Department admits this and is angry.
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:36:00.500]  They admit it's a real cable that other governments were all freaked out by the threats, the bribes, the promises of money, the arm twisting.
[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:10.500]  We see the United States at the center along with Gordon Brown, the disgraced Prime Minister, former Prime Minister, spearheading this, trying to ram it through on people.
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:16.500]  And you knew that at the time, but now that's all come out. And that was mirroring.
[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:20.500]  We were talking about the Pakistani minister who's been promised money up there spewing all this.
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:25.500]  It's the end of the world. Oh my gosh, the West did it because they've been promised money.
[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:30.500]  This is now confirmed. It just shows what incredible fraud this is.
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:38.500]  A whole thing is nonsense. But let's be nice to the bedwetters. Let's make this be nice to bedwetters' week.
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:53.500]  And let us pretend, just for the sake of argument, Alex, that in fact there is every bit as much of a global warming problem as the United Nations would like to imagine.
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:59.500]  It is, of course, imaginary, but it is, let's just pretend, just for the sake of a game.
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:09.500]  All right, now we know that at this conference they are going to try to bully the countries of the West, who are all too eager, most of them, to comply,
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:23.500]  to hand over $100 billion of Western taxpayers' money. To the UN, of course, for the name of the game, this is supposed to go to third world countries to help them to adapt
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:32.500]  to the consequences of the terrible global warming that we in the West have caused by our emissions of carbon dioxide.
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:44.500]  But let's just pretend for a moment that they're right. $100 billion a year is a trillion dollars every 10 years.
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:57.500]  Now the thing is this, but in order to forestall just one Celsius degree of warming, if the US government was right in its figures for how much the Waxman-Markey bill would cost,
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:04.500]  which had a fairly typical lot of range of measures like cap and trade and regulations on emissions and all that kind of thing,
[02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:19.500]  then you would need to spend $100 billion a year for 340 years in order to forestall just one Celsius degree of warming.
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:28.500]  That Al Gore says is going to make all the coastal cities disappear within seven years, so a 300-year solution to a seven-year problem.
[02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:39.500]  That's right, and not only that, but if you wanted to forestall all 3.4 degrees Celsius, which is about 6 Fahrenheit of warming,
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:56.500]  which the UN says might happen on the globe by 2100 in the next 100 years, then it could take you 1,000 years of spending $100 billion just to make that tiny amount of temperature change not happen.
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:39:06.500]  So there's a huge mismatch between what these people are trying to argue for here and what they could possibly achieve.
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:12.500]  Until I recently did these calculations, nobody anywhere in the world had sat down and worked out and said,
[02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:18.500]  OK, supposing we spend all this money, how much global warming will we actually forestall?
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:22.500]  It's all been done on the basis of the hope we spend the money, maybe it will make a contribution.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:27.500]  Nobody had worked out, but in fact, it makes practically no difference at all.
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:32.500]  So even if there were a problem as big as these nitwits here, there is.
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:37.500]  The fact is that all the spending that they are planning to make, and it's critically expensive spending,
[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:43.500]  would not make anything like enough difference even to begin to solve the problem.
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:49.500]  And this leads to the idea that if there were to be any problems arising from warmer weather,
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:55.500]  and frankly, if you find any global warming send a slum in Scotland, my lovely wife could do it very badly,
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:40:04.500]  then if there really were, what it would simply do is to say, look, we'd be better off adapting to the warmer weather
[02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:10.500]  and its consequences in a focused way and only when necessary,
[02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:18.500]  rather than squandering all these billions and trillions now on what is an entirely futile exercise.
[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:25.500]  Now Lord Monkden, you got cut off by the break earlier. You were trying to tell the story of the Pakistani minister,
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:31.500]  telling you that the other Pakistani minister was just saying it because they'd been promised money.
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:36.500]  That's now confirmed by the cables that the secret arm twisting was going on.
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:40.500]  Recap that because your phone was breaking up at that time.
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:44.500]  Yes, certainly. This in fact, I think I mistakenly said this was in Copenhagen last year.
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:49.500]  It was Bonn this year, after which one of my colleagues, Volskan Miller,
[02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:53.500]  who is from the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which I also belong to,
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:58.500]  an environmental group that believes in looking after the environment rather than worrying about global warming,
[02:40:58.500 --> 02:41:01.500]  were here under their aegis.
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:07.500]  He was sitting next to one of the two Pakistani delegates at the discussions in Bonn,
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:10.500]  which were leading up to this conference here in Cancun.
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:14.500]  And the other delegate was up on the platform speaking and saying,
[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:18.500]  Oh, it's all terrible. We're doomed unless we shut down the economy to the West.
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:20.500]  All this kind of rubbish.
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:25.500]  And his colleague was sitting talking to Volskan Miller, not really realising that we were on the other side of the space,
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:30.500]  and saying to himself, actually none of us believe a word of this nonsense,
[02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:33.500]  but our government has told us to say it.
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:37.500]  And of course, we've seen this time and time again before.
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:41.500]  The government's been invigilated to changing their view and becoming alarmist.
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:50.500]  India has just decided it's going to change its view and start accepting compulsory caps on the amount of carbon dioxide it emits.
[02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:56.500]  And it's doing this, but all is certainly because somebody has got a very large sum of pride to do that.
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:42:03.500]  We had it in Russia where the Russian Academy of Sciences got a report from a doctor,
[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:09.500]  Andrei Ilarionov, who was one of its key scientists in 2004, saying,
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:17.500]  Look, we've had a conference at which we invited skeptics and we invited the British government to send its chief scientist to tell us why there was a problem.
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:19.500]  We have the skeptics as well.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.500]  And the chief scientist on the list of skeptics were there, walked out.
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:24.500]  He couldn't answer our questions.
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:29.500]  So Ilarionov then made an impassioned speech saying that Sir David King, who was then the chief scientist,
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:37.500]  Had let down the name of Britain, let down the name of Sir, and had certainly convinced him that there was no problem at all with global warming,
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:39.500]  Of course, King was trying to say the exact opposite.
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:48.500]  So then six months later, Tony Blair went to see Gazputin, the new Tsar of all the books at that time,
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:54.500]  And said to him, look, if you want to get entry into the World Trade Organization on highly favorable terms,
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:43:00.500]  We want you to shut Dr Ilarionov and the Russian Academy of Sciences up, get them to change their view,
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  And become a true believer in the new religion of global warming that way,
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:07.500]  All of us in the governing class can, and I'm going to use the rude word here,
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:11.500]  Can screw the ordinary people of the world.
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:16.500]  And of course, Julie Putin changed his mind, ordered the Russian Academy to do the same.
[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:21.500]  And these are the very nasty little games that are being played.
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:25.500]  But of course, the more they play these games, the more they get caught out.
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:31.500]  Because the great thing about bureaucracies is that most of the people who are in these bureaucracies are actually good people.
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:33.500]  They're trying to do a decent job.
[02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:38.500]  They can see that the maniacs who are in charge beside them are dishonest and corrupt.
[02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:40.500]  And so they then leak info.
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:42.500]  One of them has the courage to stand up and say so.
[02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:45.500]  And that's how we get the WikiLeaks, that's how we get the climate gating notes,
[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:48.500]  That's how we get the story from the Pakistan Minister.
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:53.500]  That's how I got Andrei Ilariyov to tell me personally what I just told you.
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:54.500]  Unbelievable.
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:58.500]  So you were told directly by the head of the Russian Academy of Sciences that this went on.
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:03.500]  That is a huge news story in and of itself showing how they do this by hooking by crook.
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.500]  Now, shifting gears.
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:09.500]  We know these people love to play the part of savor of the earth.
[02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:11.500]  They're also control freaks.
[02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:18.500]  The White House science are agrees with Ted Turner and writings that he wants to sterilize us with chemicals in the water.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:20.500]  And he wants one child policies.
[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:25.500]  He's also told the Associated Press in the first press conference he gave almost two years ago,
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:32.500]  that he wants to geoengineer the planet to save us from environmental degradation.
[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:36.500]  And we know Bill Gates who's pushing this has bought the patents for it.
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:42.500]  So another way they want to taxes is for the world having to pay them to, quote,
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:44.500]  save us from the global warming.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:50.500]  Then they get to play the part of like Superman, a savior of the world from Lex Luthor,
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:55.500]  the boogeyman, Bizarro, and the rest of Superman's enemies.
[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:57.500]  We have an activist post article.
[02:44:57.500 --> 02:45:02.500]  You and climate concern morphs into Chemtrail Glee Club.
[02:45:02.500 --> 02:45:07.500]  And I've got all the different articles here where they're hopping around at the meeting,
[02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:11.500]  trying to get rid of the UN treaty on geoengineering from decades ago.
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:13.500]  So what else?
[02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:19.500]  I mean, we cover the other official documents where they call for force relocating populations.
[02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:24.500]  I mean, what types of bizarre craziness are you hearing from these people?
[02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:30.500]  Well, because they are talking of force relocations because of the Imagine sea level rise,
[02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:33.500]  which also incidentally isn't happening.
[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:37.500]  Sea level is rising at around eight inches to one foot per century.
[02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:42.500]  As it has done, as best we can work it out for the last century and a half before that the records aren't too good.
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:49.500]  But we can tell from ice cores and geological records that over the last 11,400 years,
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:53.500]  sea level has risen by more than 400 feet.
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.500]  That's close to four feet per century.
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:58.500]  Now we're down to less than one foot per century.
[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:01.500]  Oh, I'm not very terrified, are you?
[02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:05.500]  So yes, they then propose all these monstrous geoengineering programs,
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:10.500]  putting giant umbrellas made of aluminum up between us and the sun in outer space.
[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:14.500]  And every time a meteorite comes along it punches a hole and tears the thing apart.
[02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:19.500]  They're thinking of using, in fact, putting more pollution back into the atmosphere
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:23.500]  because the pollution stops the sun getting through and cools down the planet.
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:28.500]  So there's one problem with that. They had overestimated the amount of cooling caused by that kind of pollution
[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:32.500]  and the figures were corrected last year by a paper by Gunnar Mairi,
[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:36.500]  which is about to yet again change all the science
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:39.500]  because it means that the warming effect of CO2, paradoxically,
[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:43.500]  is a lot less than the UN had formerly thought.
[02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:47.500]  So we're getting all these people advocating more and more extreme, absurd,
[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:52.500]  and above all expensive solutions and also, of course, very immoral solutions.
[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:58.500]  The idea of saying to people, you could only have one child because we face that.
[02:46:58.500 --> 02:47:02.500]  It's outrageous what they should be doing, but of course they won't do
[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:07.500]  because they don't want to share their riches, is to make the poor people of the world richer
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:12.500]  because as populations become more prosperous and they come up above the poverty line,
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:17.500]  then their rate of breathing slows down all by itself.
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:21.500]  You don't have to have a portion, you don't have to have artificial contraception,
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:25.500]  you don't have to have Chinese soldiers with guns shooting one of the two twins
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:29.500]  if a mother is unlucky enough to have twins. None of that needs to happen.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:32.500]  All you have to do is make people more prosperous.
[02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:36.500]  That's the kind of geo-engineering that the Committee for Constructive Tomorrow
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:40.500]  is in favour of and so is the Science and Public Policy Institute.
[02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:45.500]  We visited just yesterday a village only 10 miles from where I'm standing
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:49.500]  in the Conference Hall and that village had no electricity, no sanitation,
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:54.500]  no water, no school until a Catholic charity came and gave it one,
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:58.500]  and no healthcare. They have absolutely nothing except each other.
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:03.500]  And the Mexican government is spending all this money on air-retail conferences
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:09.500]  while its own people are starving because they don't have basic amenities like electricity.
[02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:12.500]  That's the kind of geo-engineering I want to see.
[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:17.500]  Electricity for everyone. Clean water and safe sewage disposal for everyone.
[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:20.500]  Well, Lord Monty, healthcare for everyone.
[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:23.500]  That's the kind of geo-engineering I want to see,
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:27.500]  but you won't hear much of that among the lunatics at this conference here in Cancun.
[02:48:27.500 --> 02:48:31.500]  And I hope you're getting the flavour, Alex, that I'm becoming very angry
[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:36.500]  at this unwillingness of the world's governing class to listen to the needs
[02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:38.500]  of ordinary people around the world.
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:42.500]  It's bad enough that they spit in the face of democracy and try and take it away.
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:45.500]  It's bad enough that our freedom and our money are being taken away,
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:49.500]  but that they also kick the poor in the teeth while pretending to help them.
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:54.500]  That seems to me to be something that they ought to try for a very long time,
[02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:57.500]  somewhere uncomfortable after this life is not in it.
[02:48:57.500 --> 02:49:01.500]  Well, that was my next point. I mean, Ted Turner, all of them just write books,
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:05.500]  give speeches, dripping with venom, hating the Third World,
[02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:12.500]  but even the Royal Commission in 49 in England found if the Third World was industrialized,
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.500]  they would get a negative population growth just like it's happened in Japan,
[02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:18.500]  Italy, England, the United States.
[02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:23.500]  Not only does it stabilize, for every two adults, man and woman,
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:30.500]  they start having 1.3, 1.4 children that the West is actually dying,
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:37.500]  and the UN admits the Third World's going to stabilize 2020, about 8 million, 200 million.
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:42.500]  So they know, they know by deindustrializing the First World,
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:47.500]  by freezing industrialization in the developing world, that it's a death sentence,
[02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:50.500]  and it will hurt the environment. They don't care.
[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:54.500]  They want to control everything. They are villains. Your comment?
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:58.500]  Well, I'm afraid you're understating it, Alex.
[02:49:58.500 --> 02:50:02.500]  I don't often say this to you, but really, I am so angry with these people
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:09.500]  because of their utter lack of concern, lack of thought, and lack of the use of reason.
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:15.500]  What is it that differentiates us from all the other creatures in the visible creation?
[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:22.500]  It is that we have the ability to use reason, and the entire governing class of the world,
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:26.500]  certainly that part of it, which is assembled in large numbers here in Cancun,
[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:33.500]  they are all as though they are in a limiting asylum, as though they are simply totally unable
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:39.500]  to use their minds at all. And of course, this is because they know, increasingly they know,
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:45.500]  that this whole climate rubbish is nonsense, but what they're doing is they are exploiting it,
[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:50.500]  they are profiting by it, they're making billions out of it,
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:57.500]  and they're making billions at half expense and, worst of all, at the expense of the third world.
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:01.500]  Stay there! Stay there! Final segment! We're going to talk about how we stop these mon-

[02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:20.500]  When I first joined, I was being sued, so I used the program methods,
[02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:25.500]  and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.

[02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:09.500]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:52:09.500 --> 02:52:12.500]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:17.500]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:20.500]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:25.500]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:29.500]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:32.500]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:38.500]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:41.500]  And it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough.

[02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:31.500]  Let's get him on to talk about briefly the aftermath of this criminal consortium meeting down in Cancun.
[02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:36.500]  They're routed, but they're dangerous, and they're still taking over our societies at the local level.
[02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:44.500]  Before we go back to Lord Monkton, Silver's way up, Gold's way up, Midas Resources bought the Silver and Gold when it was lower.
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:53.500]  They're selling it to you when it's higher at the old low price, but Ted is running out of those Silver dollars and Silver half dollars and the Franks and Sovereigns at the lower price.
[02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:55.500]  You've got to tell them it's the radio special.
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:57.500]  I don't have time to get into all of it.
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:54:58.500]  Give them a call.
[02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:00.500]  Get into Silver and Gold today.
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:07.500]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:08.500]  My job's easy.
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:10.500]  I promote what I believe in.
[02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:17.500]  I've been telling you buy Gold and Silver for over a decade when Silver was $5 an ounce, when Gold was $260 an ounce.
[02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:19.500]  Did I scare you right?
[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:21.500]  Get into Silver and Gold today.
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:23.500]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:26.500]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special to get the lower prices.
[02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:27.500]  The regular prices are great.
[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:30.500]  We've got about four minutes left, Lord Monkton, down there at the conference.
[02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:32.500]  Any other observations?
[02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:34.500]  How do we stop these people?
[02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:39.500]  What's the time frame on when we'll know if they were successful at this larcenous meeting?
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:52.500]  Right, in the next two days, we should hear whether or not they've come to the agreement I expect them to come to, and I've outlined the main points of that.
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:56:01.500]  Huge expansion of the West by the UN, huge growth in the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention, which now has its own army, it has its own troops.
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:09.500]  Effectively, you see them now wherever you go, these UN security people who are pretty nasty types.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:11.500]  They're all ex-merceries, as far as I can see.
[02:56:11.500 --> 02:56:19.500]  This is growing into a kind of super state, which exists wherever it decides to land and hold a conference.
[02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:25.500]  The way we stop it, I think, is by the US and one or two other leading countries.
[02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:31.500]  Once we have a Republican president again who starts taking interest in standing up for the US rather than trying to destroy it.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:37.500]  I hope you'll forgive me if I say that about your president, but it is very sad to see what he's been doing.
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:43.500]  He's not our president, he's a total globalist miscrant, but go ahead.
[02:56:43.500 --> 02:57:00.500]  What I'm saying is I think that what we now need to do is for America needs to leave the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, leave the IPCC on the ground that they are all fraudulent, corrupt and unduly expensive,
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:09.500]  and that American taxpayers can no longer be trusted, can no longer have the money taken from them, and the UN be trusted to spend it.
[02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:19.500]  I think we've got to take that all the way, leave it, we've got to found a new organization called the United Democracies in which only democratic countries will be allowed to participate,
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:31.500]  and the only people who will be allowed to speak for various nations at the United Democracies and its meetings will be people who we, the people of the democratic world, have elected to represent us.
[02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:40.500]  Because one of the big dangers, Alex, as the supranational organizations, like this grim, secretive secretariat of the UN Framework Convention,
[02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:50.500]  the danger is not one of these supranational cross-border, powerful, ever better funded organizations is democratically elected.
[02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:57.500]  So every time we pass power from us to them, we're passing power from elected hands to unelected hands, that must stop.
[02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:02.500]  Article 1, section 1 of your constitution, gives all legislative power to the elected Congress.
[02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:06.500]  Nobody else can make laws or impose taxes on America except those who America elect.
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:09.500]  Let that be the rule at international level as well.
[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:10.500]  Absolutely, Lord Moncton.
[02:58:10.500 --> 02:58:15.500]  For more taxation without representation, for more legislation without representation.
[02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:22.500]  You've been very gracious, hopefully you can join us right before Christmas in the aftermath or after Christmas or in the new year.
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:29.500]  Let us know what happened, we're blessed to have you there and I really appreciate you spending time with us. Good luck down there, be safe.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:31.500]  Real pleasure and God bless America.
[02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:53.500]  Alright, God bless you. Back live tomorrow with Rand Paul.
