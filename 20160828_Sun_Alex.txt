[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  I'm David Knight. We're live this Sunday, August 28, 2016, but first, an important message
[00:07.840 --> 00:09.240]  from Alex Jones.
[00:09.240 --> 00:17.080]  Welcome, my friends, to the Sunday edition of this worldwide broadcast. David Knight
[00:17.080 --> 00:23.480]  is going to be anchoring and hosting the broadcast today, but I spent much of yesterday in the
[00:23.480 --> 00:31.840]  office shooting a special report that's going to air at the bottom of this hour. By the
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.320]  time you are tuning in to the broadcast, we should also be able to post the report on
[00:37.320 --> 00:43.680]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com so that you can send it on to warn your friends, your
[00:43.680 --> 00:48.800]  family, your neighbors, and others. The dire straits this country and the rest of the planet
[00:48.800 --> 00:52.840]  is in is unprecedented in our history. I don't think anybody can deny that. It's a
[00:52.840 --> 01:01.160]  prima facie fact on its face. We are in the midst of a global transformation from once
[01:01.160 --> 01:08.480]  quasi-free societies to scientific tyrannies. The globalists are dismantling every form
[01:08.480 --> 01:17.720]  of basic human liberty and in its place, installing a technocracy. Even well-meaning liberals
[01:17.720 --> 01:25.080]  that I know, when they read The New York Times or look at CNN.com and see no exaggeration,
[01:25.080 --> 01:32.720]  60, 70, 80 articles about Trump and every single one of them is anti-Trump, totally
[01:32.720 --> 01:38.600]  hateful. All the rules of objective journalism dropped by the wayside. It shakes them to
[01:38.600 --> 01:44.480]  their core and more and more of them are saying, my God, he must be good. If this big establishment
[01:44.480 --> 01:50.800]  we've always known to be corrupt is so against it. The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, the
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.600]  United States is in the final phases of being turned over to multinational corporations.
[01:54.600 --> 01:59.200]  We have been conquered and Donald Trump is trying to block that. That's why they're
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.760]  panicking. That's why they are going after him with everything they've got. The only
[02:04.760 --> 02:10.080]  risk in Trump is that he could be a super predator who has been planning this for decades
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.640]  and who is coming in to steal the New World Order main command base, the United States,
[02:14.640 --> 02:19.160]  from them. I don't believe that's the case and the evidence doesn't show that, but regardless,
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.480]  that is the only downside. When he says, what do you have to lose voting for me? He's absolutely
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.960]  on target because you have nothing to lose because he is the anti-globalist. We know
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.480]  what we get with Hillary Clinton and we've never seen all these foreign leaders and the
[02:34.480 --> 02:39.760]  Communist Chinese and the Pope and everybody else coming out and get someone anywhere close
[02:39.760 --> 02:45.080]  to this, their panic is real and palpable. Now, the special report coming up at the bottom
[02:45.080 --> 02:52.400]  of the hour is undoubtedly the most important I've ever issued and undoubtedly I will issue
[02:52.400 --> 02:55.480]  more in the near future that are even more important than that because we're entering
[02:55.480 --> 03:01.960]  this quickening phase and it deals with the fact that I have become too comfortable with
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.880]  living next to evil. I have become acclimated to it to a great extent. I've become punch
[03:06.880 --> 03:13.720]  trunk. Sitting back this weekend thinking about what a on record war criminal mass murderer
[03:13.720 --> 03:19.880]  Hillary Clinton is and the fact that she's saying I have a dark heart and going after
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.160]  me in the national press really hit home just how much danger I'm in and just how much
[03:25.160 --> 03:30.160]  danger you're in. These megalomaniacs have already brought us to war and they're bringing
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.800]  us to the brink of a new global war. And so we put on the evidence in this special report
[03:36.800 --> 03:43.040]  coming up at the bottom of the hour that she is a bloodthirsty monster who revels in those
[03:43.040 --> 03:50.040]  that she's killed, that she is a grasping person completely turned over to evil and
[03:50.040 --> 03:55.760]  that she has giant throngs of domesticated zombies that basically serve her every beck
[03:55.760 --> 04:01.200]  and call like she's the queen bee or the queen ant and that the reason I'm standing up against
[04:01.200 --> 04:07.680]  her so boldly and taking her on at the risk of my name, my life, my treasure, my family
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.640]  is because there is no future very soon if this paradigm of evil is allowed to continue
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.600]  to expand my very instincts, my very spirit, my very guts demand that I stand up against
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.640]  Hillary in the new world war. And that's why I'm doing this today. That's why I'm taking
[04:24.640 --> 04:30.280]  action and that's why I'm asking you to pray for info wars and myself but also pray for
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.520]  peace and pray for the light of truth to come into the world with more and more of these
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.800]  WikiLeaks and other information. We're seeing Google censoring the WikiLeaks. We're seeing
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.760]  Google censor the DC links. We're seeing DC links being taken down to try to stop you
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.480]  from knowing what George Soros and Hillary are up to. But the truth is nothing will stop
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.120]  the signal. Nothing will stop the truth from coming out. We'll be right back with David
[04:52.120 --> 04:57.720]  Knight. And again, I'm David Knight here live in Austin. We're going to have more reports
[04:57.720 --> 05:03.200]  from Alex Jones as well as news coming right up. Stay with us, Dr. Group. You developed
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.200]  living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because
[05:07.200 --> 05:12.080]  people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean,
[05:12.080 --> 05:17.280]  I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[05:17.280 --> 05:22.760]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[05:22.760 --> 05:28.000]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.160]  disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[05:33.160 --> 05:35.840]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it. You have the
[05:35.840 --> 05:40.760]  neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing
[05:40.760 --> 05:44.440]  a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some
[05:44.440 --> 05:48.280]  back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living defense,
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.040]  infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body,
[05:53.040 --> 05:57.920]  period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing
[05:57.920 --> 06:20.920]  Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product. It is Sunday,
[06:20.920 --> 06:26.840]  the 28th day of August, 2016. I'm Alex Jones, your host from about to hand the baton to
[06:26.840 --> 06:32.440]  David Knight in 60 seconds. But first, I want to remind you that an extremely important
[06:32.440 --> 06:39.040]  report is going to premiere here that will detail exactly where this country stands
[06:39.040 --> 06:46.040]  right now. Hillary Clinton represents a worldwide criminal combine that describes itself as
[06:46.040 --> 06:51.240]  the New World Order. It is establishing a global corporate government where they are
[06:51.240 --> 06:55.960]  above the law, tax exempt with diplomatic immunity. And what we're seeing with Hillary
[06:55.960 --> 07:01.240]  being above the law with the emails and above the law with all the new WikiLeaks information
[07:01.240 --> 07:07.800]  that's coming out. And her long history is part of an admitted plan to set the precedent
[07:07.800 --> 07:13.440]  that the elites can basically get away with bloody murder and do whatever they want whenever
[07:13.440 --> 07:19.120]  they want. And the fact is the Clinton death toll and the Clinton death count is well known
[07:19.120 --> 07:25.080]  in the last 30 years. And it's only getting more intense now. And Google and others are
[07:25.080 --> 07:33.600]  in the news censoring the search for the Clinton death list. The Clinton death count. We're
[07:33.600 --> 07:39.200]  even seeing other forms of political suppression and persecution like Dr. Drew getting fired
[07:39.200 --> 07:44.080]  from CNN less than a week after he talked about Hillary and her medical records looking
[07:44.080 --> 07:50.200]  like her doctors are doing a terrible job and that he would like to help her because
[07:50.200 --> 07:54.800]  the medications her records say that she's on absolutely are incredibly dangerous to
[07:54.800 --> 07:59.440]  be taking together and nothing makes sense. He was fired. All the other censorship, the
[07:59.440 --> 08:06.760]  staffers being killed, Google censoring WikiLeaks searches. It goes on and on and on. They are
[08:06.760 --> 08:12.800]  hiding so much. And with her coming out and this last week and saying that I'm this horrible
[08:12.800 --> 08:18.400]  evil person that has this dark heart, it is amazingly creepy. It doesn't scare me. It
[08:18.400 --> 08:22.680]  makes me want to work 10 times harder. But to see this incredible war criminal up there
[08:22.680 --> 08:29.360]  talking about my dark heart, it's clearly a threat. And to then have Kimmel and others
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.480]  sit there and wave a gun around on TV and say, this is a threat from the new older to
[08:33.480 --> 08:39.160]  you, Alex Jones. They know it's seen as a comic relief by their viewers, but it's not
[08:39.160 --> 08:44.000]  comic relief because it's being directed by the Clintons, just like they're directing
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.760]  the mainstream media. They're directing these propaganda offenses we see every night during
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.320]  late night comedy. That's been admitted. And they think they can intimidate everyone.
[08:53.320 --> 08:58.040]  She thinks that she's a bully and that everybody's going to back down to her because she threatens
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.960]  them. I know she's dangerous. I know her controllers and the people she represents have had people
[09:03.960 --> 09:08.040]  killed. It's said the Clintons don't kill people, but people that get in the way of
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.320]  the Clintons die because of the interest they represent. That's absolutely true. I want
[09:12.320 --> 09:15.960]  to state it on record. I'm doing this because I care about my family. I care about the future
[09:15.960 --> 09:20.680]  of this country. I'm doing this because somebody has got to stand up against evil. And when
[09:20.680 --> 09:24.600]  you don't stand up against it, it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more out
[09:24.600 --> 09:31.280]  of control like it's now done. And so understand something, Hillary. If anything happens to
[09:31.280 --> 09:35.640]  me, you and your controllers are the prime suspects. And I know now you think you're
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.960]  above the law, so why do you care? Maybe you want to send a message by getting rid of old
[09:39.960 --> 09:45.720]  Alex Jones. Bottom line, everybody knows it's a serious issue and that the Clintons have
[09:45.720 --> 09:50.000]  a thin of skin in politics. So I want you and your controllers to understand that I
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.360]  am conscious of this and I'm doing this because I'm the opposite of people like you. I'm not
[09:55.360 --> 09:59.960]  a parasite. I'm not a bully. I'm not a coward. And I can't sit back and watch you dismantle
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.320]  this nation, go after our Second Amendment and bring us into a world government and put
[10:04.320 --> 10:08.760]  Obamacare on people's backs that absolutely bankrupt someone who's designed to make this
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.880]  nation nothing but a bunch of part-time workers that can only dream of a better future through
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.800]  government. Somebody, just like our ancestors did, standing up against King George has to
[10:19.800 --> 10:23.480]  stand up against you. I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight, broadcasting from
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.400]  theInfoWars.com News Center in Austin, Texas.
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.200]  All right, and that was Alex Jones. We're going to have that report that he's putting
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.040]  together. We're going to have that in the second hour. Make sure that you stay tuned
[10:33.040 --> 10:41.520]  for that report. You know, it is August the 28th, 2016. That is 268 days since Hillary
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.720]  Clinton has had a press conference. I think we need to do something like Ted Koppel did
[10:45.720 --> 10:51.400]  with the, what was it, he had the Nightline show years and years ago. If you remember,
[10:51.400 --> 10:56.960]  if you're old enough, what happened was the Iranians took the American Embassy hostage.
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.280]  And so they did a special report to talk about it that night. They came back the next night.
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.660]  This is night number two of the Iranian hostage situation. They kept going and kept going
[11:05.660 --> 11:09.520]  and kept going. Finally, when it was nearly a year or a little over a year, I forget how
[11:09.520 --> 11:16.560]  long they were there. Sorry. However long it took, they had been doing this special report
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.240]  leading off their news every night talking about the Iranian hostage situation that was
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.360]  never resolved. They did that for so long that they kept the program with Ted Koppel
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.600]  called it Nightline. You know what we need to do? We need to start the program I think
[11:28.600 --> 11:34.200]  every day. Instead of the Star Wars theme song, we need to come in with the Nightline
[11:34.200 --> 11:41.040]  theme song from 30, 40 years ago. And we need to say how many days Hillary has held America
[11:41.040 --> 11:47.080]  hostage kept us in the dark because she's running away from questions. She hasn't taken
[11:47.080 --> 11:55.520]  questions from the press in an open give and take. It's been prepared, scripted engagements
[11:55.520 --> 11:59.880]  with the press or with her podcast. And she hasn't done that since December the 5th. And
[11:59.880 --> 12:04.040]  so we need to call her on that. We need to call her on that every day. We had some people
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.640]  just this last week. She was at an event and the press was very timid. Gathered around
[12:08.640 --> 12:11.960]  here with her cameras. They were afraid to engage her to talk to her. She's sitting there
[12:11.960 --> 12:17.360]  somebody's offering her chocolate. Finally, somebody has the temerity to ask her a question
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.800]  and she just looks at them and says, have some chocolate. You know, as I said on Friday,
[12:21.800 --> 12:27.160]  it's kind of like a forced gump, you know, a press conference is like a box of chocolates.
[12:27.160 --> 12:32.360]  You never really know what you're going to get. So what we take away from that is to
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.600]  run Hillary run, run away from the questions and just make sure if you're a reporter that
[12:37.600 --> 12:42.600]  she doesn't offer you some Turkish delights from her supporter Fatala Gulen. If you know
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.840]  what I'm talking about with Narnia, you know what I'm talking about with Hillary Clinton.
[12:46.840 --> 12:51.200]  We're also going to talk in this segment. We're going to talk about Bleach Bit. You
[12:51.200 --> 12:59.080]  know, we've had this come out. It wasn't just a mistake. This was deliberate. It was industrialized
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.440]  construction of evidence. And that's what Trey Gowdy's been talking about. We're going
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.280]  to talk a little bit about that as well as Trump's comments that the NSA, he thinks,
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.120]  has those 30,000 some odd emails, 33,000, I believe. We're also going to talk about his
[13:12.120 --> 13:19.560]  tax return. Should Trump release his tax return? There's some different opinions on that.
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.760]  Roger Stone says yes, he should. His son, Eric Trump said it would be foolish for my
[13:23.760 --> 13:27.240]  dad to release tax returns. We're going to talk about that as well. And we're also going
[13:27.240 --> 13:32.560]  to play for you Nigel Farage. You know, he had a great stump speech in Mississippi introducing
[13:32.560 --> 13:38.280]  Donald Trump, who he believes has potential to be Reagan 2.0.
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.360]  I think that's true. And I want you to hear a good part of the Nigel Farage speech because
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.880]  he really lays out what the issues are there. As well as pointing out to people that they
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.120]  were told right up to the very end, they were way behind in the polls for Brexit. But people
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.520]  showed up anyway. They want to discourage you. They want to set the expectations for
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.520]  how they're going to stuff the ballots or how they're going to flip the electronic voting
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.800]  machines. All of that is an issue. But I believe that if we show up in mass and a massive number,
[14:09.800 --> 14:15.120]  just like they did in Brexit, if we show up with numbers too large for them to credibly
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.840]  put this back, or even to the extent if they look at it and say, well, you know what, we've
[14:18.840 --> 14:24.080]  got so many people here. I think they're going to call BS on this if we flip these election
[14:24.080 --> 14:28.640]  returns to that degree. We may have to deal with this in a different way and let it go
[14:28.640 --> 14:29.640]  through.
[14:29.640 --> 14:34.120]  And of course, as he's looking at Brexit, he's saying, look, if this hasn't happened
[14:34.120 --> 14:38.440]  by a certain time, and he talks about the things that he wants to see happen with Brexit,
[14:38.440 --> 14:43.500]  if these guys that are now in power, I should say the lady who's now in power, Theresa May,
[14:43.500 --> 14:47.880]  if she's going to sit on this, if she's going to shut this down, then they're going to have
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.240]  something to say about it. And of course, we will as well. I want to take a quick look
[14:52.240 --> 14:58.280]  at some of the breaking news articles because as Alex Jones is talking about the way that
[14:58.280 --> 15:02.040]  we've seen Hillary operate for the longest period of time, it's not just Hillary. There's
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.960]  also the upper echelons of the Republican establishment. We've got Paul Wolfowitz, the
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.240]  guy who was, as many people said, the architect of the Iraq War, the guy who I would say can't
[15:13.240 --> 15:18.560]  find Osama bin Laden on a map. He wasn't in Iraq, okay? Nevertheless, he says, well, I
[15:18.560 --> 15:22.120]  wasn't the architect. If I'd been the architect, I would have done it differently. Okay, fine.
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.880]  You want to say that you would have done this little thing? The issue is, should you have
[15:26.880 --> 15:31.840]  started that war? Should Hillary have started the war in the overthrow of Gaddafi and Libya?
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.040]  Are we better off when they did that? And of course, the emails have come out and we've
[15:36.040 --> 15:42.180]  seen that Hillary started that war in Libya because they were concerned, one of their
[15:42.180 --> 15:46.840]  chief concerns was the idea that they would have competition against the central bank's
[15:46.840 --> 15:51.760]  fiat currency. Gaddafi was going to set up a currency backed in gold and go against the

[01:32:42.200 --> 01:33:01.200]  Why do they do this?
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:22.200]  From the Frontlines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.200]  We're going to play a special report from Alex Jones here.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.200]  You know, this last week, Hillary Clinton called him out by name.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.200]  It's kind of like the Eye of Sauron focusing on you.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.200]  And it's something we ought to take seriously.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.200]  There's a long list of Arkansas.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:45.200]  As a matter of fact, when we had the Monica Lewinsky scandal back in 1998,
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.200]  the day that was released by the House of Representatives,
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:54.200]  Bill started a bombing campaign and it ended only after they came up with the articles of impeachment.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:58.200]  If they will bomb an entire country to cover up their crimes,
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.200]  what will they do to just one person?
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.200]  That's the question Alex Jones talks about. Here's Alex.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.200]  Before the Clintons left their governorship in Arkansas,
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.200]  more than a hundred people had been suspiciously murdered.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:20.200]  Hundreds more died during their first terms and the scourge continues to this day.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:26.200]  D&C staffer after D&C staffer that speaks out against election fraud
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:30.200]  or leaks information to WikiLeaks ends up gunned down.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.200]  And the Clinton crime family and their backers is now in the spotlight.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:41.200]  If I die, if they kill me, it was done for a worthy cause.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.200]  Somebody's got to stand up against these people.
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.200]  Long before George W. Bush had taken office
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.200]  or Senator Obama was even thinking about being president,
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:56.200]  I was there exposing the crimes of the Clintons.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:02.200]  So it is fitting when I, Alex Jones called the dark heart by Hillary Clinton
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.200]  would be your chronicler.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.200]  A chronicler who risk his very life exposing these evil ones.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.200]  It's required by Bill Clinton in 1992 and it was instituted here in Texas in 1993.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.200]  I know the code, sir.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:19.200]  Are you going to institute his urine and blood testing when he commands you?
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.200]  Are you going to stick a needle in my arm when I have no criminal record?
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:28.200]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:34.200]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.200]  Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton,
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.200]  one of the most powerful criminal kingpins in history,
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:48.200]  came out on national television and said that I had a horrible dark heart.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:56.200]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:00.200]  I am committed to standing up against oppression and tyranny.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.200]  That's just who I am.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.200]  But I've got to be honest with you.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.200]  I thought back to the history of the Clinton's reign of criminal terror
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.200]  in the last 20-plus years on this planet.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:18.200]  And I have to tell you, it's surreal to realize that Alex Jones, little old me,
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:24.200]  is one of the main opposition points against these monsters.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.200]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:35.200]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  Hillary Clinton is famous for her death threats, both public and private.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.200]  Back in 2008, even the New York Times had the headline,
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.200]  Clinton's remark on Kennedy's killing stirs uproar.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.200]  When Obama was way ahead of her in the primary polls,
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:37:00.200]  she said it doesn't matter because Bobby got assassinated before the primary ended.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:06.200]  My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.200]  somewhere in the middle of June, right?
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:16.200]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:23.200]  This is the type of bloodthirsty rhetoric that we continually see from Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.200]  Years later, after she had successfully conned the world into bombing Libya
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:35.200]  to give al-Qaeda air cover, Hillary, after landing in Tripoli, bragged that she came,
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.200]  she saw, and Qaddafi died.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.200]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.200]  Did it have anything to do with your visit?
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.200]  No, I'm sure it did.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.200]  I want to go back to the beginning.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.200]  Governor Bill Clinton and his co-governor wife supported George Herbert Walker Bush
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:03.200]  in the 1991 war in Iraq, but from there it only got worse.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:10.200]  Once they were in the White House, they expanded the bombing to hundreds and hundreds
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  and hundreds of attacks a year on the infrastructure of Iraq.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:20.200]  They got the UN to pass the most draconian sanctions ever in modern history,
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:26.200]  where medicine and food and all forms of technology were basically blocked
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.200]  from coming into the country.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:33.200]  Over a million and a half Iraqis starved to death and died.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:40.200]  And Hillary Clinton's mentor, Madeline Albright, bragged on 16 minutes
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  and other channels that 500,000 dead Iraqi children were a good price to pay of the sanctions.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.200]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:57.200]  I mean, that's more children than died when, in Hiroshima.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.200]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:07.200]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price we think the price is worth it.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.200]  The population implodes.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.200]  Refugees flee across the world.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:21.200]  A once pro-Western secular Muslim nation had begun its path to being taken over by jihadis,
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:27.200]  which Hillary, a decade plus later, would facilitate in happening.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:34.200]  I mean, let's remember here the people we are fighting today we funded 20 years ago.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:39.200]  Let's go back again to 1995 and 1999.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:44.200]  You have the Croats, you have the Serbs, you have the Muslims of the South in Albania,
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  you have the Balkans, the Russians have pulled out after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:56.200]  The Clintons back Islamist out of Albania and Croats.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.200]  This is on record to attack Serbia.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.200]  When Serbia fights back, even when they lost twice as many people,
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:11.200]  the Clintons launch giant bombing raids and NATO invasions that blow up power plants,
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  water treatment plants, TV stations with depleted uranium bombs
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.200]  radiating the entire area.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:29.200]  Then they had British television broadcast images of what's admitted now to be fake Serb concentration camps.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:35.200]  The Clintons are the most hated couple in Serbia and the Balkans
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.200]  because the Serbs were the most powerful allies of America.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.200]  And Madeleine Albright, the Secretary of State who ran this whole operation
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.200]  that bragged about 500,000 kids is no big deal.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:52.200]  Her father and her were saved from the Nazis by the Serbs.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.200]  A lot of you younger women don't think you have to, it's been done.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.200]  It's not done and you have to help.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.200]  Hillary Clinton will always be there for you and just remember,
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:10.200]  there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:16.200]  But when you are a Machiavellian sociopath or a sadistic psychopath
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.200]  like George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and others,
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  you don't look at things about alliances and who's right and who's wrong.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.200]  You look at a billion plus Muslims and you look at Syria
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.200]  and you look at the invasion points where you can come into all of Europe and take over.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:41.200]  But first you've got to get the weapons to invade and you see Libya
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.200]  and Muammar Gaddafi who for eight years previous to the Western attack
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.200]  had invested in the West, brought the West in and decided to go the route of Daytona.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.200]  He was set up, jihadists out of Saudi Arabia via the State Department and Hillary,
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.200]  this is all mainstream news now, were brought into Benghazi.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:03.200]  They attacked the country. The West had a bombing campaign to back the takeover.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:09.200]  Islamists were put in control. Christians, blacks, non-radical Muslims,
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.200]  Shiites and others were killed by the tens of thousands
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:16.200]  and Hillary formed by design a failed state.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:22.200]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.200]  You look at the before and after images, it is simply incredible
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.200]  and Hillary admits it's a failed state.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:34.200]  They took the weapons, the stinger missiles, the toe missiles and moved them to Syria
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.200]  to knock down the gates to Europe.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.200]  You take over Syria, you can bring in all the jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and other areas.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:46.200]  Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to return with Alex's report of course
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.200]  as we point out early in the program.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.200]  Paul Wolfowitz, Republican who started the Iraq war said,
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.200]  I'm with her because she's with war.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.200]  We'll be right back with the rest of Alex Jones's report.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.200]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.200]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.200]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:13.200]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.200]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.200]  have now developed Alexa pure breeze.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.200]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.200]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.200]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.200]  The general public doesn't.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.200]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:48.200]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.200]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:55.200]  that didn't do as good a job.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:19.200]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:26.200]  These are rampant.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.200]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.200]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:29.200]  Everything just kind of clears up.

[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:41.200]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:45.200]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:51.200]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce, and came in.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:57.200]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at InfowarsLife.com
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:25.200]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.200]  In the history of InfowarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2,
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.200]  SuperMell Vitality, and so many others.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.200]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:43.200]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:47.200]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:54.200]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.200]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:59.200]  That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:26.200]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:33.200]  We came, we saw, we died.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.200]  You look at the before and after images, it is simply incredible.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.200]  And Hillary admits it's a failed state.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:47.200]  They took the weapons, the stinger missiles, the toe missiles, and moved them to Syria to knock down the gates to Europe.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:55.200]  You take over Syria, you can bring in all the jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and other areas, invade Europe.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.200]  Then use the Islamic threat to ban free speech of those that criticize it
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:06.200]  and use the civil emergency to bring in a permanent form of martial law.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:10.200]  To be fair to Hillary Clinton, she's only a puppet of George Soros,
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  who even the Jerusalem Post has recently reported to the WikiLeaks documents
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.200]  is nothing but a megalomaniac who thinks he's the Messiah,
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:24.200]  establishing world government through chaos he sows.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:29.200]  First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:36.200]  was that you, during the revolutions of 1989, funded a lot of dissident activities,
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.200]  civil society groups in Eastern Europe, in Poland, the Czech Republic.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.200]  Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:50.200]  Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:55.200]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:00.200]  And it played an important part in events now.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  It would take hours to chronicle the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.200]  that have been mysteriously murdered, gunned down, choked to death, drowned,
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  cut into pieces since the Clintons were running for governor right through president,
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.200]  right through the State Department to today. But just since Bernie Sanders openly had the nomination
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:26.200]  stolen from him a few months ago, we've seen at least four top staffers over email,
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:33.200]  over servers, over all the key information, being gunned down, being killed, being murdered.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:39.200]  And WikiLeaks has come out and said, we don't reveal sources, but this is an alleged source
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:47.200]  and we have put on a $20,000 reward. This is getting really, really out of control.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:53.200]  The stuff that you're sitting on, is an October surprise in there?
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.200]  Do you even know what you're sitting on?
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.200]  WikiLeaks never sits on material.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.200]  Our whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:11.200]  As a 27-year-old that works for the DNC, who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.200]  for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.200]  That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn't it?
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.200]  No, there's no finding.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:26.200]  What are you suggesting?
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:37.200]  I'm suggesting that our sources take risks and they become concerned to see things occurring like that.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.200]  But was he one of your sources then?
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.200]  We don't comment on who our sources are.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  Why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:53.200]  Because we have to understand how high the stakes are.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.200]  Google has been caught. So have Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:03.200]  Censoring anti-new stories about the Clintons, including the Clinton death count.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:06.200]  We are seeing what the technocracy is able to do.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.200]  We are seeing them openly engage in mass censorship.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:14.200]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:20.200]  In closing, I want to reach out to you with a personal appeal.
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:30.200]  A free human to other free humans of every race, color, and creed who have the spirit of liberty beating in your breast.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:38.200]  I don't want to confront a kingpin that's killed millions of people around the world and who thinks it's funny.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.200]  I don't want to take on this vampire.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.200]  I don't want to fight this monster as an individual.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:51.200]  But as a man, my spirit directs me, commands me to take action.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.200]  I don't have any other choice.
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:58.200]  And I want to be victorious and successful in this quest.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:07.200]  Evil historically takes over and is unstoppable as long as good men and women do nothing.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:11.200]  But as Thomas Jefferson famously said, our third president,
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.200]  when we take action, nothing on earth can stop us.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:22.200]  That's why tyrants are so scared of good men and women who actually have good will and want you to have free will.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.200]  And who want universal law to reign on this planet.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:29.200]  We're facing cancer.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.200]  That's what Hillary Clinton represents.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.200]  Evil.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.200]  She represents chaos.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.200]  She represents lawlessness.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:39.200]  She represents disease and failure.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:46.200]  Her physical manifestation is a rotting, reanimated corpse.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:52.200]  I'm not scared of Hillary Clinton, but I am scared of failing in this mission.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:57.200]  So I ask you all to redouble your efforts to expose the new world order.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.200]  And I ask you all for your prayers.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.200]  And I reach out to Hillary Clinton as well, because I don't even personally hate her.
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:12.200]  I hate the spirit that has taken over her body, her mind, her soul.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.200]  There's still time for you to turn back, Hillary.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  You talk about my dark heart and then misrepresent what I've said.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.200]  I have a heart of incredible love.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:31.200]  I care deeply for people, and I even care for what's left of you.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:39.200]  You wouldn't have said the things you said on that podium unless there wasn't some shred of humanity left in you.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.200]  There's still time for you and others to turn back.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.200]  But I want to be very, very clear.
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:54.200]  I have chosen the path I'm on, and I am willfully challenging you and everything that you represent.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:54:04.200]  And I'm asking the population of this planet and those that love liberty to support us and to pray for us.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:11.200]  And I'm telling you and your masters that I'm only one symbol of freedom, one manifestation,
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:16.200]  and that nothing on earth will stop the movement that you now see.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:19.200]  It's time for Hillary Clinton to repent.
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.200]  It's time for Hillary Clinton to stop the murder, to stop the killing,
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:30.200]  to stop licking her lips like Madeline Albright and herself when they talk about all the dead kids.
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:37.200]  I look at how you put in jihadis and al-Qaeda into Libya and into Syria to kill hundreds of thousands of Christians,
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:45.200]  and Obama won't let the Christians get out, but lets the Sunnis that engage in the crime escape.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.200]  And I just thank God I'm not on your team.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:53.200]  So whatever you do to me, that's between you and God.
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:57.200]  But I've made my choice, and I am not with you.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:08.200]  I will never commit suicide, and if I am killed, the criminals that represent Hillary, Rodham, Clinton are the main suspects.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:17.200]  You may have the old rotten discredited mainstream media that the AP says has a 6% trust rate with the public backing you, Hillary.
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:24.200]  But I've got common sense and the will of the people behind me, and I'm committed to a cause.
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:30.200]  And in history, and in this universe, nothing on earth can stand up against that.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:40.200]  No matter what happens to this body, ideas and movements backed by truth and liberty are invincible.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.200]  They are bulletproof.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:49.200]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:56.200]  And again, that's Alex Jones, and we've got the docks to prove that they created war and chaos in Libya.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:03.200]  Thanks to WikiLeaks, thanks to Judicial Watch, we now have the documentation as to why they did it.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.200]  They did it for the central banks.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  And they'll go to war to cover up for their own scandals.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:11.200]  We saw this happening, as I mentioned earlier.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:26.200]  Even Huma Abedin's publication admitted that in 1998 Operation Desert Fox was done as began bombing Iraq as the House of Representatives filed a report accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors.
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  And it did not end until they came up with the indictment with the impeachment.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:34.200]  Once that happened, it's like, all right, we don't have to keep bombing them anymore.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:44.200]  So they stopped raining death down on people just to cover up his sexual predator crimes, his committing perjury under oath.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:46.200]  And of course, in 1996, they did it.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  Same thing.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.200]  Went into Iraq, bombed people.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.200]  Their why?
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:52.200]  To cover up for a finance scandal.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:55.200]  You know, earlier this week, we put up a video.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.200]  I talked to Roger Stone.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.200]  We had Vince Foster goes missing again.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  We've got an article and video in that we talked about what Sandy Burger did.
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.200]  Very much like what Hillary Clinton has done with these emails.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.200]  It's now come out that they deliberately destroyed these things.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.200]  Didn't accidentally erase them.
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  They deliberately destroyed them.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.200]  Why?
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:22.200]  She was given special privileges, just like Sandy Burger was given special privileges in the National Archives to delete documents there that they thought would be damaging to the Clintons.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:24.200]  The people who control that said, we made a mistake.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.200]  We gave them special access and they abused it.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.200]  What did he do?
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:35.200]  I made an honest mistake when he was stuffing these documents in his clothes, took them out, cut them up with scissors, he later admitted.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.200]  Did it four different times and he called it an honest mistake.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.200]  Who gave him a pass?
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:43.200]  It was FBI Director Comey when he was investigating that.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.200]  Join us again tomorrow at 11 Central for the Alex Jones radio show.
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.200]  Alex Jones will be back.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:58.200]  David Knight.
