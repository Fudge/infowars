[00:00.000 --> 00:21.400]  Logic is the Enemy and Truth is a Menace. Rod Serling, Twilight Zone author, 1962. Well,
[00:21.400 --> 00:26.440]  here we are on this Monday live edition of the Alex Jones broadcast in the year 2020
[00:26.440 --> 00:35.040]  with only 147, 148 days left until the historic collection. We're seeing the armies of ignorance
[00:35.040 --> 00:41.040]  attack. We've seen Black Lives Matter and Antifa attack the Black Civil War Memorial,
[00:41.040 --> 00:46.080]  the Glory Memorial, and they see, but that wasn't enough. They went on to attack the Lincoln
[00:46.080 --> 00:52.720]  Memorial. Then they attacked the World War II Memorial and their Soros-funded cohorts in the
[00:52.720 --> 00:59.240]  United Kingdom, attacked the police. BBC called it peaceful. They then tried to attack and pull
[00:59.240 --> 01:06.280]  down the statue of Mr. Churchill, saying he was the king of the fascist, all declaring themselves
[01:06.280 --> 01:14.960]  equivalent to the D-Day Normandy landings that face German machine gun dust. This is Maoist Youth
[01:14.960 --> 01:19.600]  Brigade. That's their official operating system. I started first seeing this about 15 years ago
[01:19.600 --> 01:27.800]  in Austin where the local groups at UT and ACC actually wear Maoist Communist Revolutionary
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.480]  uniforms. They're not just larping now. They're trying to overthrow and pull down the government.
[01:34.480 --> 01:39.000]  Now, they're just the front-level decoys, but it's powerful megabanks and people like
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.960]  Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and all of these different globalist minions
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.560]  that are orchestrating and funding all of this while they run with trillions offshore.
[01:52.560 --> 01:57.200]  They're trying to create a culture war. In the West, while opening our boards to the
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.720]  Third World, teaching the Third World that whiteness is bad, whites are taught to be
[02:01.720 --> 02:06.480]  guilty so we then accept whatever the United Nations, the globalist push, and the UN under
[02:06.480 --> 02:11.400]  State Department of the Miranda 7277 openly states that they would open the borders, flood
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.280]  us with Third World, replace the populations, and then demand that not just the citizens,
[02:16.280 --> 02:23.160]  but the police be disarmed. But as the police are disarmed and as the military is disarmed,
[02:23.160 --> 02:30.560]  the United Nations is armed. This is all official canon doctrine of the globalist playbook.
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.840]  Owen Schreuer is taking over in the first hour. I'll be back in the second, third hour.
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.000]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining me out of the gates in the second hour to break down
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.720]  the attempts to overthrow the British government. Now, the globalist orchestrating it. But first,
[02:43.720 --> 02:49.080]  there's a big story on infowars.com, how Instagram, you need to share it. They don't want people
[02:49.080 --> 02:56.400]  to see it banned as violating community guidelines, putting out FBI crime statistics that have
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.280]  even been in the Wall Street Journal. The latest statistics we have are from two years
[03:00.280 --> 03:06.600]  ago, and it shows that the lowest level of crime in the United States is white on black.
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.880]  But the highest level of crime is black on white, and then it shows the other statistics.
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.720]  So this is what Black Lives Matter really sterilized the black people. Planned Parenthood
[03:15.720 --> 03:21.640]  2.0, that's actually who funds it, is saying it's asinine. It's creating a psychological
[03:21.640 --> 03:25.560]  wound in the public that they're bad because they're white, and then trying to hype up
[03:25.560 --> 03:32.160]  minorities, mainly women minorities, who tend to be the quote, leaders of these groups,
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.840]  to come out and demand the takeover of civilization and society. But they don't just really mean
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.920]  they want to disband the police or disarm them. They just want to muscle in through government
[03:41.920 --> 03:47.560]  and take them over and turn them into SJWs, like they've done in the UK and Germany, where
[03:47.560 --> 03:53.480]  they are then thought police enforcers. They've also done it in Canada, where Dan Dix peacefully
[03:53.480 --> 04:00.560]  tried to cover Antifa BLM demonstrations and was arrested after the antifascism physically
[04:00.560 --> 04:07.000]  attacked him. But they can't silence all of you. So share the article from newswars.com
[04:07.000 --> 04:16.600]  or infowars.com with the actual FBI crime statistics on the ground, showing the truth
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.840]  of what's really happening. That there is an over 10 to 1 black on white crime rate,
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.720]  mainly because the media encourages it and helps cover it up and acts like it's some
[04:26.720 --> 04:30.760]  ride of passage to go out and rob white people. This is what they don't want you to share,
[04:30.760 --> 04:37.600]  but you can stop them. Go to infowars.com now. Get the article about the censored graphs
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.720]  and statistics that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want you to see, and share it, share it, share
[04:42.720 --> 04:48.200]  it on your email, share it in your text message, and share it by word of mouth now. You are
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.280]  unstoppable. You are the modern Paul Revere's. Coming up on the other side of this one minute
[04:52.280 --> 05:00.160]  break, Owen Schreuer from Deep in the Heart of Texas. I've been fighting the globalists
[05:00.160 --> 05:05.440]  for 26 years, and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting, and I'm so ready for
[05:05.440 --> 05:10.640]  physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the
[05:10.640 --> 05:14.720]  delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the New World
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.400]  Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is. But you know what? The average
[05:18.400 --> 05:23.120]  person is still asleep. They don't deserve what's happening to them. So I'm actually sick
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.120]  about what's unfolding right now, and I just want to turn things around. But you know what?
[05:27.120 --> 05:31.400]  I can't do that without you. I can't get out of this mess. I can't get out of this
[05:31.400 --> 05:36.120]  stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of it as well. We're all in this together.
[05:36.120 --> 05:39.400]  And so if you just realize how important you are, when you just tell people about the local
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.520]  radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when you just spread the word
[05:42.520 --> 05:48.080]  about infowars.com, when you just buy the products at infowars.com, it changes the world

[06:08.920 --> 06:16.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, June 8, 2020. This is the infowars.com Alex Jones
[06:16.480 --> 06:21.920]  show. Filling in for Alex here in the first hour on your host, Owen Schreuer. Alex will
[06:21.920 --> 06:33.280]  be back second hour with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK where they're tearing down memorials
[06:33.280 --> 06:41.480]  and monuments and marching for George Floyd, which has absolutely nothing to do with the
[06:41.480 --> 06:48.080]  UK. Of course, the police in the UK are already disarmed. And so when a mob of BLM or whoever
[06:48.080 --> 06:54.160]  chases after them, they literally run and scurry because they can't even defend themselves.
[06:54.160 --> 07:01.240]  And now that's what they're trying to do to police here in the United States. You know,
[07:01.240 --> 07:08.480]  I'm thinking, what should I start the show with? Because, you know, Alex has this chessboard
[07:08.480 --> 07:20.560]  on the desk here. And I was thinking about how I could use this allegory here today.
[07:20.560 --> 07:29.640]  And I thought, what is an example of a pawn or what is an example of a bishop or a king
[07:29.640 --> 07:37.640]  or a queen? And I had to go through my mind. Well, is the mainstream media the queen or
[07:37.640 --> 07:45.680]  is the mainstream media the bishop or is it the rook? Well, I don't know. I think that
[07:45.680 --> 07:55.480]  that's complicated. But what is the pawn? Ah, see, the pawn is easy. The pawn is easy
[07:55.480 --> 08:03.600]  to manipulate. The pawn is easy to understand. And so on this chessboard that we look at
[08:03.600 --> 08:08.560]  the current political situation with with the globalists playing us off against each other
[08:08.560 --> 08:18.760]  to death. Well, who is the pawn of the globalist? Well, there is no better example of a brainwashed
[08:18.760 --> 08:29.120]  fool upon than a Soros protester with a face mask on. So that somebody protesting for black
[08:29.120 --> 08:37.840]  lives matter with their face mask on. Now, as you heard from Alex in the stories at infoworse.com,
[08:37.840 --> 08:43.200]  the headline, Instagram censors FBI crime stats graph as hate speech. Now, the one that
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.520]  they're censoring, which is this is an old meme, almost 10 years old. But it's all the
[08:48.520 --> 08:52.520]  same difference. It's FBI statistics. They're in the Washington Post. They're in the Wall
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.800]  Street Journal. And it's what we already know. The highest crime rate is black on white.
[08:57.800 --> 09:05.320]  It's not even close. But they know that defeats the mainstream news narrative. And if their
[09:05.320 --> 09:13.400]  pawns ever figured that out, maybe they wouldn't march. But let's step back from the board
[09:13.400 --> 09:19.480]  for a second, because we've been playing this game for a long time. Now, if you play chess,
[09:19.480 --> 09:26.580]  you know that a pawn is pretty much the weakest member of your team. It's the weakest piece
[09:26.580 --> 09:31.360]  on the board. It can only go one way at a time. It can only go one square at a time.
[09:31.360 --> 09:40.920]  But that is the essence of the brainwash Soros protesters because they are moved one square
[09:40.920 --> 09:48.760]  at a time on the board to ultimate death. And so if you just look at the last four years,
[09:48.760 --> 09:53.960]  what has it been? Well, it's all been out to get Trump. But think about how the mainstream
[09:53.960 --> 09:58.200]  media and the Democrat Party and the globalist move their pawns, which are currently marching
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.480]  for black lives matter. Or who knows what maybe they've already switched it. Have I
[10:02.480 --> 10:06.040]  figured is it global warming yet or what is it now? Is it still black lives matter?
[10:06.040 --> 10:12.840]  I don't know. But think about and they have been marches for all of these things across
[10:12.840 --> 10:18.760]  the country in the last four years. And I and I realize this is their pawn. They move
[10:18.760 --> 10:25.320]  one square at a time. The globalist move their pawns one square at a time. So just look at
[10:25.320 --> 10:34.800]  the pawn or the attack on Trump. We have had marches for each and every one of these squares
[10:34.800 --> 10:40.720]  that the globalists and the media and Soros have moved their pawns forward with Russian
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.560]  collusion. You remember that one Russian collusion? They were all out on the streets. Hashtag me
[10:46.560 --> 10:52.360]  to remember that with the with the old tape. Remember that? Okay, so so that was another
[10:52.360 --> 10:55.120]  one. They were out on the streets protesting. So that's the globalists in the media moving
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.320]  their pawn one square at a time because that's the the weakest of the pawn. It can only go
[10:59.320 --> 11:05.800]  one square at a time. It can't see beyond the board one square. Then he was unfit for
[11:05.800 --> 11:10.680]  office. Remember that they had marches for that kids in cages. Remember Trump was putting
[11:10.680 --> 11:14.160]  kids in cages. Didn't matter that the photo was from the Obama years that they all use.
[11:14.160 --> 11:21.880]  It was Trump's putting kids in cages. Then marches. Ukrainian quid pro quo again, marches.
[11:21.880 --> 11:28.560]  The impeachment, the impeachment, the impeachment of Trump marches in the streets protests.
[11:28.560 --> 11:36.480]  Then COVID-19. Lock yourself inside. Close your business. It's going to kill us all.
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.480]  And then you're still seeing they're all buying into it. But what is the latest Black Lives
[11:40.480 --> 11:48.400]  Matter? George Floyd. And you see this is how the media moves their pawns one square
[11:48.400 --> 11:54.920]  at a time. And because the pawn can only see one square ahead, it doesn't see the whole
[11:54.920 --> 12:01.840]  board. It doesn't see how it's being manipulated. It doesn't see how it's being moved. And it's
[12:01.840 --> 12:08.200]  never been more clear who the pawns of mainstream media and the Democrat Party and George Soros
[12:08.200 --> 12:13.600]  and the globalist are. It's never been more clear. And let me tell you, if you have been
[12:13.600 --> 12:19.600]  to every single one of the protests and marches that I've just mentioned, you are peak brainwashed.
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.080]  You cannot be more brainwashed. It doesn't get worse for you. But as soon as they blow
[12:27.080 --> 12:32.320]  the whistle for the next move to move you one square forward, you'll be there. What's
[12:32.320 --> 12:40.880]  it going to be next? Climate change, global warming. Some other hoax we can't even concoct
[12:40.880 --> 12:53.800]  or imagine yet. Now, here's what the magic eight ball tells us. They're going to infiltrate
[12:53.800 --> 13:00.000]  one of these Black Lives Matter rallies or something and try to set it up with either
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.880]  a mass shooting or a dirty bomb. Now, I personally think that's what they just did last week.
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.240]  They may go for it one more week. I don't know if it's going to work because remember
[13:13.240 --> 13:20.880]  they the police officers in multiple counties found explosives, water bottles, squirt guns
[13:20.880 --> 13:28.000]  full of gasoline. So I mean, they they put the bricks out there. So they really lined
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.600]  it up for this to pop off with mass death. Now, they only got I think so far about 20
[13:32.600 --> 13:38.280]  to 30 dead, most of which are Black. Nobody cares about them. It's still all about George
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.520]  Floyd. He gets to have a funeral and a memorial and a gold casket. You have to stay inside
[13:43.520 --> 13:48.600]  and hope that you can find a roll of toilet paper because of COVID, even though they're
[13:48.600 --> 13:57.360]  out looting and riding and it's all good. But think about that. Think about the power
[13:57.360 --> 14:06.920]  of the grand players on the chessboard to move that pawn whenever and wherever they
[14:06.920 --> 14:14.360]  want. And there they go. And that's how they respond. This is of course in the UK where
[14:14.360 --> 14:22.240]  they tore down a statue of Edward Colston and then danced on it because that's social
[14:22.240 --> 14:28.680]  justice. Of course, you've got and I'm sure Paul Joseph Watson is going to talk about
[14:28.680 --> 14:36.280]  this. They desecrated a Winston Churchill statue. UK police were in the area. And instead
[14:36.280 --> 14:43.560]  of stopping the people that destroyed the monument, you know, spray painted it and everything,
[14:43.560 --> 14:47.840]  this gentleman cleared up some of the trash from the monument and tore down some of the
[14:47.840 --> 14:54.480]  signs on the monument and the police went after him. If you can't spell clown world
[14:54.480 --> 15:00.680]  without liberal, well, that doesn't make sense to you. It doesn't even matter because the
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.800]  clown world's not supposed to make sense. So there it is. So the bad man who tried to
[15:05.800 --> 15:12.880]  pick up the trash and clean up the monument, the police chased after him literally. By the
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.720]  way, we've got 82 year old veteran violently attacked over support for Trump just in his
[15:17.720 --> 15:23.000]  yard in a Trump hat. Someone comes by and, you know, whoops, whoops, wide his ass. And
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.160]  then but it's not even about old whitey because a old blackie gets hurt too. Because a an
[15:30.160 --> 15:38.400]  old man had a American flag t-shirt on at the subway in New York was getting harassed.
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.960]  And he said, I happen to like President Trump. Some thug comes up to him and punches him
[15:42.960 --> 15:48.320]  out, knocks him out cold because that's how you be a real man. That's how you be a real
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.960]  rebel against the establishment is by going after the biggest anti establishment president
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.120]  you've ever seen and then punching an 80 year old guy in the face out. That's that's real
[15:57.120 --> 16:01.000]  hard. I'm always excited about info wars life products. They're amazing. They're cutting
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.680]  edge. You love them. I love them. And they find the info war in the face of the globalist
[16:04.680 --> 16:11.800]  onslaught. But we have come up with a new product over a year in development. That is
[16:11.800 --> 16:19.200]  amazing. The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on
[16:19.200 --> 16:25.720]  top of it. And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour
[16:25.720 --> 16:32.040]  out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really
[16:32.040 --> 16:36.560]  great way. I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic
[16:36.560 --> 16:41.040]  alcohol in it. So spray it right in your eyes. But I just love it personally has something
[16:41.040 --> 16:45.280]  that's a moisturizer as well. So this is a real innovation. I don't know why others
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.960]  didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it. So
[16:49.960 --> 16:57.640]  it doesn't dry you out and smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[16:57.640 --> 17:02.280]  Hey guys, Rob do here with info wars store.com. And I want to tell you about something that
[17:02.280 --> 17:06.200]  I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[17:06.200 --> 17:10.560]  any problems sleeping and that's knockout. Let's face it, our life patterns have been
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.840]  disrupted by this lockdown, this government imposed imprisonment, and it is definitely
[17:15.840 --> 17:19.440]  affected my sleep schedule. But one thing that has helped is knockout. I take one pill
[17:19.440 --> 17:23.080]  about an hour before I want to go to bed and boom, I get a great night's sleep. And just
[17:23.080 --> 17:27.760]  this past Memorial Day, I took two of them fell asleep about one a.m. woke up at 8 a.m.
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.120]  ready to go. It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in
[17:32.120 --> 17:35.280]  your life too. If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch. If you get great
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.200]  sleep, you're going to be on point. You're going to be mentally focused. You're going
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.200]  to be ready to take on the day. And right now, knockout is 50% off. It's less than $15

[21:06.600 --> 21:13.920]  I've got some videos I want to get to here. And I've got some other news stories, but
[21:13.920 --> 21:20.600]  everything really derives at least to the current chaos and madness. Everything really
[21:20.600 --> 21:28.280]  derives from one thing. And it's briefly summarized in a story at the New York post, but but hardly
[21:28.280 --> 21:36.560]  in detail. And the headline is the lying about Donald Trump is now completely out of control.
[21:36.560 --> 21:41.520]  Because ladies and gentlemen, that's really what this is all about. I'm not saying there's
[21:41.520 --> 21:47.880]  not injustice or police brutality in this country. I don't think anybody's denying that.
[21:47.880 --> 21:52.720]  But how much of an issue is it really when we've got groups of white people taking knees
[21:52.720 --> 21:57.920]  for black people, groups of police taking knees, getting on their bellies? It's literally
[21:57.920 --> 22:03.840]  a form of submission. White people washing the feet of black people now in North Carolina.
[22:03.840 --> 22:10.040]  That's yeah, that's happening. Democrats now like pretending their Kunta kente or something,
[22:10.040 --> 22:17.120]  wearing a African scarf with now face masks that match it. I mean, this is a whole game
[22:17.120 --> 22:21.440]  for them. Jerry Nadler is such a fat plump. He can't even knee. So I mean, he's got his
[22:21.440 --> 22:25.920]  own problems. And then he comes up here. He can't get his mask off. His glasses are falling
[22:25.920 --> 22:30.360]  off of his head. And he looks like a complete moron. He's got some woman behind him with
[22:30.360 --> 22:35.560]  the Kunta kente face mask. I mean, it's just this whole thing is a joke. But I mean, at
[22:35.560 --> 22:44.920]  least Kunta kente, I mean, he was American. It's so clown world now. It's so clown world
[22:44.920 --> 22:50.760]  now. And so you have to ask yourself, why is Instagram censoring FBI crime statistics
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.440]  that the Washington Post reports on and the New York Times reports on and the Wall Street
[22:54.440 --> 22:59.640]  Journal has? Why don't they want you to know about all the white people that are killed
[22:59.640 --> 23:04.120]  by police? But they're going to tell you all day long about the black people like George
[23:04.120 --> 23:10.680]  Floyd, which, you know, I'll be honest with you folks, because info wars is now the mothership.
[23:10.680 --> 23:20.600]  Well, I'm going to speak for myself here. But folks, this whole George Floyd thing is
[23:20.600 --> 23:27.280]  a big setup. Okay. And I'm just going to leave it at that because we don't have to get too
[23:27.280 --> 23:32.040]  conspiratorial. And because we are the mothership, it's just a turn off when you get a little
[23:32.040 --> 23:37.480]  bit too conspiratorial for some people. And so we understand this role. But every day,
[23:37.480 --> 23:42.640]  they're sending me different stuff about Floyd and different stuff about the officer and
[23:42.640 --> 23:47.600]  the mugshots and everything. And they're raising all kinds of red flags. And you know what?
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.440]  I don't know. Okay, I don't know what the truth is. I know we were set up. The Democrats
[23:52.440 --> 23:57.000]  were clearly planning this. Okay, they were clearly planning this. That's why they had
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.520]  the bailout reform so they could release all their prisoners. They clearly had their defund
[24:01.520 --> 24:07.440]  the police campaign ready to go. That's why they're rolling it out in perfect synchronicity.
[24:07.440 --> 24:14.720]  It's all way too perfectly rolled out to think that this was just a circumstantial thing.
[24:14.720 --> 24:21.200]  Not to mention you've got Floyd's teacher doing interviews now, Dr. Anilsex. Yeah. Dr.
[24:21.200 --> 24:27.560]  Anilsex was on CNN this weekend. That's George Floyd's second grade teacher. You didn't know
[24:27.560 --> 24:34.080]  that, Dr. Anilsex? I'm sorry. Did I, did I stutter for you? Dr. Anilsex. You guys must
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.440]  have missed that. Dr. Anilsex was on CNN this weekend telling you about how great George
[24:38.440 --> 24:44.640]  Floyd was as a second grade teacher. And so, look, again, we used, this is a national phenomenon.
[24:44.640 --> 24:51.520]  It's just, I mean, you can go look at the conspiracy theories for yourself. Let me just tell you,
[24:51.520 --> 24:56.640]  it's not the first time that Dr. Anilsex has been on CNN, but it's not been Dr. Anilsex.
[24:56.640 --> 25:02.480]  It's been a different character at the time. But hey, I mean, I say Dr. Anilsex is a hero.
[25:02.480 --> 25:08.480]  I mean, the bravery of that woman to go on CNN, Dr. Anilsex, and tell you about how great
[25:08.480 --> 25:16.000]  George Floyd is. But so, that's what we really need, though, is Dr. Anilsex telling us how
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.720]  great George Floyd is on TV. And we need Instagram censoring FBI crime statistics that show that
[25:24.720 --> 25:32.880]  the highest rate of crime, 100-fold, is black on white crime. But you see, CNN hasn't figured out.
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.520]  In fact, let me roll the clip from clip three here, because CNN hasn't all figured out. I
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.560]  didn't realize this. See, when you're the victim of a crime, that actually, that's because you're
[25:42.560 --> 25:49.040]  privileged. See, CNN figured that out, though. So, here's a brilliant guest, probably friends
[25:49.040 --> 25:55.280]  with Dr. Anilsex, on CNN this weekend. We have a state action against our police department,
[25:55.280 --> 26:00.000]  which gives us legal mechanisms in the very short term. You know, there's lessons from
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  all over the country, all over the world that we're looking to take immediate steps.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.480]  So, they're talking about defunding police, and that's what needs to happen, and get rid of the
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.120]  police department, because that's how we save the world. Do you understand that the word dismantle
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.920]  or police-free also makes some people nervous? For instance, what if, in the middle of the night,
[26:19.920 --> 26:27.440]  my home is broken into? Who do I call? Yes, I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.480]  neighbors, and I know, and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege,
[26:32.480 --> 26:38.400]  because for those of us from whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.360]  what it would feel like. Yes, so if you, you know, want to have a safe home and not have your home
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.080]  invaded, and, you know, if your home is invaded, you expect to be able to call the police, well,
[26:48.080 --> 26:53.440]  that's because of your privilege, don't you get it? Says the friend of Dr. Anilsex on CNN.
[26:53.440 --> 27:10.240]  I mean, these people are your friends, folks. These people really care about you.
[27:24.160 --> 27:31.200]  oil survivors, your DNA was blues, leaving the fence in terrible force,
[27:31.200 --> 27:38.880]  extremely available as well. Listen to me, dirty Americans, do not go to info wars store.com for

[29:55.440 --> 30:11.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:16.480 --> 30:23.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[30:23.280 --> 30:32.800]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[30:33.760 --> 30:39.040]  Now, if you play chess, there's a bunch of different ways you can play.
[30:40.320 --> 30:45.120]  Personally, when I play chess, I am literally on the offense 24 seven, like
[30:46.080 --> 30:52.480]  98% of my moves are offensive. And that's my strategy. I mean, I'll tell you my strategy.
[30:52.480 --> 30:58.240]  You can ask people that I play and I'm pretty good. Just take everything, leave nothing.
[30:58.880 --> 31:01.680]  And they get pissed because at the end of the match, it's like basically all they have left is
[31:01.680 --> 31:07.280]  a king and a pawn. And so we're just like just wasting time going around the board. But I always
[31:07.280 --> 31:14.320]  get them in the end. But I think Trump strategy right now is very defensive. He's barely going on
[31:14.320 --> 31:19.360]  the offensive at all. Meanwhile, the globalist chess pieces are all being moved into offensive
[31:19.360 --> 31:26.560]  striking positions. So is that a good thing to let them strike to show the world who they really
[31:26.560 --> 31:32.720]  are? I think not because at this point, if you don't realize who they are, then there's no hope
[31:32.720 --> 31:40.560]  for you. You've probably already bought in. But what are they doing right now? Okay. First,
[31:40.560 --> 31:45.440]  they say you have to stay inside. There's a deadly virus going around. They faked the pandemic. Well,
[31:45.440 --> 31:49.360]  okay, the fake pandemics pretty much been fully exposed. They still buy into it because they
[31:49.360 --> 31:55.600]  know it's their own propaganda. And really, that's why I get so upset when I go out and I see a mask
[31:55.600 --> 32:00.320]  on somebody's face. That's like the flag of the globalists. That's like people flying the flag
[32:00.320 --> 32:06.560]  of globalism and communism right in my face pisses me off. I don't want to see these damn commies out
[32:06.560 --> 32:14.320]  here. Because that's what it is. The mask is now the flag of communism. That's really all it is.
[32:14.320 --> 32:19.120]  They know it. They know they're not going to catch a deadly virus. But they know this because
[32:19.120 --> 32:24.240]  they're all larking. And it's all to get Trump. And they figured, oh, but if I just go along with
[32:24.240 --> 32:28.560]  the fake pandemic, then I'll get Trump. It's kind of like now the Democrats walk out there and
[32:28.560 --> 32:34.640]  their new fashionable African weave scarfs. What do you really call that? Can somebody tell me
[32:34.640 --> 32:38.960]  the official name for that? I'm sure there's an official name for that design from Africa.
[32:38.960 --> 32:46.320]  Very beautiful design from Africa. All of these congressmen are Americans. George Floyd is an
[32:46.320 --> 32:53.040]  American. I doubt George Floyd had ever even been to Africa. I wonder if George Floyd could point to
[32:54.640 --> 33:01.760]  the countries in Africa out on a map. But see, now it's about Africa. Oh, virtue signaling now for
[33:01.760 --> 33:13.440]  black people by wearing African scarves and face masks really makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[33:13.440 --> 33:17.680]  It's all about taking their virtue signaling to the next level because see, none of it's working,
[33:17.680 --> 33:23.920]  none of it's sticking. It's having a reverse effect. They don't care. That's why they wear the mask.
[33:23.920 --> 33:28.800]  That's why they wear the African flags because it's all about flying their flag in your face as if
[33:28.800 --> 33:34.880]  you've been defeated. Wearing the mask out, telling you you can't have a full open business.
[33:35.760 --> 33:43.680]  That's their symbol of victory over you. That's their symbol of conquering America.
[33:45.680 --> 33:48.560]  That's why I can't even deal with it. I don't even want to leave my house. I don't even want to go
[33:48.560 --> 33:52.560]  to dinner. I don't even want to go to the grocery store. I don't even want to go to a bar. I can't
[33:52.560 --> 34:01.840]  stand it because I know these people are so committed to their hatred of me that they pretend
[34:01.840 --> 34:06.880]  to care about black lives and they pretend like there's a pandemic going along and I know it's
[34:06.880 --> 34:12.480]  all fake and they know it's all fake and they know I know it's all fake and they know I know that
[34:12.480 --> 34:18.080]  they know it's all fake. So they wear the mask as a big fat middle finger to us Americans.
[34:18.080 --> 34:24.640]  They wear the mask as a big fat communist flag of victory that they have conquered you
[34:24.640 --> 34:28.800]  and conquered this country and then they show you the videos of the police kneeling.
[34:28.800 --> 34:33.680]  They show you the videos of the National Guard kneeling. They show you the people washing the
[34:33.680 --> 34:39.520]  feet of black people and then I'm sitting here like wait a second. I'm looking at all the footage
[34:39.520 --> 34:48.240]  from all these BLM protests from the weekend. It's like 90% honkies. It's all white people.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.760]  There's some video or it was a picture I can't remember. Some girl is going to I think the
[34:53.760 --> 34:59.040]  Mall of America or somewhere where there's a Black Lives Matter protest and they're all laying on
[34:59.040 --> 35:05.680]  the ground and this blonde girl walks by and she's just laughing at them. Just laughing at them
[35:05.680 --> 35:12.480]  because these people are clowns. You look like a jackass. But so she walks by just laughing at them
[35:12.480 --> 35:20.000]  and you can see people look up at her and they raise her brow like oh my gosh. You don't care
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.200]  about our protest. You aren't even going to acknowledge Black Lives.
[35:25.200 --> 35:41.520]  See and then the left says we need to hear from people of color. We need to hear from Black people
[35:42.800 --> 35:47.040]  and so then a Black conservative steps up and says hey did you see the FBI crime scene?
[35:47.040 --> 35:56.080]  Shut up. You are a race trader and a white supremacist and a bigot. Shut up. You shut up now and
[35:56.080 --> 36:02.400]  the Black conservative just says oh okay. You're not Black. You're not going to vote for Biden. He
[36:02.400 --> 36:09.920]  just wrote the crime bill. He just referred to Black children as cockroaches. Hey come on now.
[36:09.920 --> 36:21.920]  Come on now. Oh by the way you know what I don't even want to show you but there's just
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.960]  nudes that are going around of DeBlasio's daughter and well I won't get into all the details but
[36:28.960 --> 36:36.720]  she's got a nice tattoo that says F capitalism on her leg. So you know DeBlasio raised her right.
[36:36.720 --> 36:44.560]  She walks around dressed like a devil engaging in terrorist activity. Hey and then DeBlasio says
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.680]  well the police need to stand down and not act with force and the police are like hey you know
[36:49.680 --> 36:53.360]  they're looting and burning and rioting right now and DeBlasio says well you know you're just
[36:53.360 --> 36:57.360]  going to have to let them do it and then they arrest his daughter and then it all makes sense.
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.960]  Oh the Democrats don't want police because their children are out rioting. Oh isn't that nice.
[37:02.960 --> 37:12.080]  Here's what I don't understand. If I got caught rioting by my parents I would have gotten my ass
[37:12.080 --> 37:22.720]  whooped. I don't care how old I was but like oh I don't know how old DeBlasio's daughter she's
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.200]  got to be prior to high school. It's like oh oh you know what yeah just doesn't matter that I'm
[37:29.200 --> 37:35.440]  the mayor of New York City go out and burn it to the ground babe. It's all good. Sure have a
[37:35.440 --> 37:44.240]  fan's only account for Antifa members. Yes true capitalism. Yeah you know what you oh yeah that's
[37:44.240 --> 37:50.880]  right because DeBlasio paid the police to help his daughter move. Did you hear about that because
[37:50.880 --> 37:54.960]  that's how public you know servants are supposed to be you know moving the neighbor's daughter because
[37:54.960 --> 38:02.640]  I'm sure he couldn't afford it himself. But you see it's all about how these people are so depraved
[38:02.640 --> 38:09.520]  spiritually mentally. Now you have tranny terrorists which it's all a joke. I mean look
[38:13.360 --> 38:18.480]  some guys want to be girls and then some guys want to pretend to be girls so they can get away
[38:18.480 --> 38:26.560]  with crime. So here's your tranny terrorist from Portland who's actually not from Portland actually
[38:26.560 --> 38:32.640]  from Ohio but hey you know lives in the dump of Portland now wants to be around his own.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.240]  Oh but this is actually a woman. Doesn't matter that there's five o'clock shadow and you know
[38:38.240 --> 38:47.280]  clearly a man it's that's that's Amelia Shamrowitz. Now do you think Shamrowitz was the original name
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.600]  here I wonder or I wonder if you just don't throw sham in there just a sham you because they know the
[38:51.600 --> 39:03.440]  whole thing's a sham. But there's your old tranny terrorist from Portland. Arson one released on
[39:03.440 --> 39:10.880]  zero dollar bail crime mischief one class C felony released zero dollar bail riot charge C class
[39:10.880 --> 39:25.760]  felony released zero dollar bail. Portland Oregon Portlandia clown world. So why is all of this
[39:25.760 --> 39:32.480]  happening folks because as the New York headline put it New York Post the lying about Donald Trump
[39:32.480 --> 39:40.480]  is now completely out of control and so the Democrat riot mob that's been activated by the
[39:40.480 --> 39:48.320]  mainstream media and the trained Democrat militants that we have exposed through Project Veritas
[39:48.960 --> 39:54.000]  have all been activated and it's all because Trump is president and they want him out.

[41:15.600 --> 41:20.720]  coming next what i can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create
[41:20.720 --> 41:28.240]  even a bigger race war to the economic collapse china invading taiwan hong kong you name it the
[41:28.240 --> 41:33.840]  globalists are attacking on every front that's why now more than ever we have to realize they
[41:33.840 --> 41:39.200]  tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation
[41:39.200 --> 41:44.720]  that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air but thanks to you and our crew we are
[41:44.720 --> 41:51.520]  still on air so let's boost that transmission like the batman's signal now more than ever info wars
[41:51.520 --> 42:00.800]  dot com lives what info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your
[42:00.800 --> 42:08.640]  word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic this is the battle for the future
[42:08.640 --> 42:16.000]  of humanity and now open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate
[42:16.000 --> 42:23.680]  the planet now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.520]  which side you're on living and denial having mass dot com syndrome learned help us will only
[42:29.520 --> 42:36.000]  deliver you into misery destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.760]  about not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.160]  and we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new order
[42:48.160 --> 42:54.400]  decide to join it out of fear they are truly fearless we must fight this or lose our souls
[42:55.360 --> 43:01.040]  the people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the
[43:01.040 --> 43:07.440]  globalist out of their countries that's why the new world order is instituting race war and division
[43:07.440 --> 43:13.280]  and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government
[43:13.280 --> 43:20.320]  and destroying essential services this is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.960]  as they've done in the third world will come in and pick up the pieces you must stand against the
[43:24.960 --> 43:31.760]  un the imf the world bank and the u openly saying the fun the police the police have a lot of problems
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.240]  we all have a lot of problems but this is our government and our local tabulari and believe
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.960]  me once the globalists have overthrown this country they are going to put in a real police
[43:40.960 --> 43:45.440]  state where you have no due process or freedom the globalists believe communist china is the model
[43:45.440 --> 43:50.880]  of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing the people helping them are collaborators
[43:50.880 --> 44:01.840]  and are idiots and must be opposed info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:08.480 --> 44:15.680]  we now take you live to the central texas commence ever and the heart of the resistance and now
[44:15.680 --> 44:21.040]  your host olympia you know i've got this video of
[44:23.600 --> 44:29.200]  a black thug knocking out an elderly black gentleman at the subway in new york because he
[44:29.200 --> 44:36.800]  said he liked trump heroic of him to do so this black lives matter i mean this guy can barely walk
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.600]  and so you know he says hey i like america i like trump and so folks this is a technique too i mean
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.760]  to me this is a premeditated murder attempt because you tap the guy in the back to get him
[44:45.760 --> 44:50.320]  to turn around and then you slug him with your fist and if this guy's ever trained in a boxing gym
[44:50.320 --> 44:56.800]  a good lawyer will get you to say that those fists are a deadly weapon i've seen this before so
[44:58.480 --> 45:01.440]  but you know black lives matter knock out a black guy if he likes trump
[45:02.880 --> 45:07.760]  and by the way all these democrats are learning the hard way remember the fake black guy sean king
[45:07.760 --> 45:14.640]  who's like hey you know i just i'm sean king i pretend to be black but uh i pretend to read
[45:14.640 --> 45:22.640]  too and uh i just discovered that all the cities were the violent crime on black people by police
[45:22.640 --> 45:26.880]  it's all happening in democrat cities what is going on we can't vote these people in and it's like
[45:26.880 --> 45:39.120]  whoa wow hey did you know the sun rises too on the east wow but see then de Blasio gives out a
[45:39.120 --> 45:44.480]  speech during a black black lives matter protest he gets booed and jeered and kicked out and now
[45:44.480 --> 45:50.880]  here's i mean this guy this guy's almost unbelievable how this guy gets into office is beyond me this
[45:50.880 --> 45:58.160]  is the biggest cuck low energy loser i've ever seen this mayor fray jacob fray you wouldn't
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.960]  believe this guy was mayor you you wouldn't even believe it so here he is at a blm protest in
[46:05.920 --> 46:10.720]  minneapolis and he said he didn't want to defund police so uh look what happens to him
[46:10.720 --> 46:21.440]  go home jacob go home go home go home go home jacob go home i mean part of me gives credit
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.720]  to the guy i mean even if you're like a total loser low energy if you're if that's who you
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.640]  really are then okay i mean at least you're you're who you are i mean he's out there with no security
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.440]  nothing he's out there with the protest because that's really who he is it's a left-wing activist
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.400]  somehow gotten to office and he really cares so he you know he's a true bleeding heart over here
[46:43.840 --> 46:47.920]  comes up no security he's just like hey i'm with you you know i'm a bad honky and everything
[46:47.920 --> 46:52.160]  you know get whitey that's all good they say but do you want to defund police and it's like
[46:52.160 --> 46:58.720]  in fact i bet if you looked at the demographics i would almost bet the house if you looked at
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.000]  the demographics per capita more black people are police than white people
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.880]  i bet if you looked per capita the percentage of a population
[47:14.080 --> 47:20.320]  based on demographics i would bet you that the percentage of blacks versus whites
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.640]  going into the police force i bet you black people will be higher than white people if
[47:26.640 --> 47:34.320]  not if not even and so maybe maybe jacob fray actually looked into it and he said
[47:35.520 --> 47:40.720]  most of my police force is actually minorities and not white guys so maybe we shouldn't defund
[47:40.720 --> 47:44.960]  the police and cost those people their livelihoods so he says yeah i don't want to defund the police
[47:44.960 --> 47:49.760]  and then the democrat mob boo go home jacob you suck and now he's probably gonna get voted out of
[47:49.760 --> 47:58.960]  office you don't cater to the mob especially a brainwashed mob by the media
[48:01.360 --> 48:07.200]  because when you stand for nothing you'll fall for anything and that's really what this is about
[48:07.200 --> 48:14.240]  for example roll the b roll from an la protest over this weekend now keep in mind in los angeles
[48:14.240 --> 48:22.960]  in hollywood in fact in los angeles as of 2016 there have been hundreds of arrests
[48:22.960 --> 48:32.480]  of pedophiles and sex traffickers no protests nobody cares kids rescued from cages remember that
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.360]  whole kids in cages fake narrative about trump there was actually obama and was really just a
[48:37.360 --> 48:43.680]  detention center that law was written by democrats in the 70s that you have to separate kids from
[48:43.680 --> 48:51.440]  going to dhs instead of to they go to dps no no none of that matters so they run the fake kids
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.640]  in cages thing when it's fake but when there's actual kids in cages they're being sex trafficked
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.720]  that the trump administration is going after and that la cops actually find nobody bats an eye
[49:02.720 --> 49:10.080]  and the media doesn't cover it and then when george floyd his face gets broadcast over media
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.240]  for three straight weeks then in la they get out in protest
[49:17.600 --> 49:20.880]  you know i got an amber alert for a seven month old black baby today
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.600]  anybody else get that yeah crews not in their heads is that black life matter
[49:29.360 --> 49:32.400]  nobody care about that child kidnapping wonder what's going to happen to that
[49:32.400 --> 49:45.360]  baby no no no protests no rallies no i mean imagine if that entire group of la
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.640]  bombs i guess never work i guess they don't have a job now imagine if that entire group of la
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.120]  bombs to the tune of tens and thousands actually wanted to stop child sex trafficking
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.720]  well they wouldn't want to go through the amber alert system which is run by
[50:02.720 --> 50:09.520]  formerly hillary clinton acolyte laura sillsby caught at the border
[50:10.720 --> 50:17.200]  by my estimation trafficking children for sex oh no she just happened to find these
[50:17.200 --> 50:21.840]  poor Haitian kids over here at the border she just she just ran into a group of Haitian kids and
[50:21.840 --> 50:28.640]  she was trying to bring them across the border to safety oh yeah oh yeah she's a hero and so now
[50:28.640 --> 50:37.520]  she's in charge of the amber alert system that is child procurer number uno number one
[50:39.520 --> 50:45.920]  boy i'm telling you i can't even get to my point i'm so sickened you know and it's the same thing
[50:45.920 --> 50:52.000]  because we've got this protest now exposed bill gates day of action coming up we've got all these
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.120]  different you know like pedo gate 2020 part one and part two again it's still happening over the
[50:57.120 --> 51:00.960]  weekend friends and family like you weren't crazy you were right i saw the peace gate
[51:00.960 --> 51:05.920]  documentary i saw a pedo gate documentary i saw this i looked at it oh my gosh you were right this
[51:05.920 --> 51:09.040]  is crazy the democrats trying to kill the country what is going on what should i do
[51:10.960 --> 51:15.520]  so america is awakening to this but the more we awaken and fight back the more desperate the
[51:15.520 --> 51:21.920]  democrat globalist chinese communists get and the closer we get to their final plan of action
[51:23.280 --> 51:27.440]  which is not going to be pre but i can't even get to my point because it's like
[51:27.440 --> 51:31.840]  oh yeah we forget about the fact that uh these people are engaged in child procurement and
[51:31.840 --> 51:35.760]  sex trafficking it's like oh yeah we forget about the hollywood involvement in that and
[51:35.760 --> 51:40.000]  the democrat involvement in that and the republicans too i mean let's be perfectly clear let's not
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.440]  forget about denis hastert you know ted gunderson exposed it all over a decade ago and you know
[51:47.600 --> 51:50.480]  yeah i didn't hear it on cnn so i don't need to matt march or anything but
[51:51.360 --> 51:59.360]  go to the b-roll back to the 10 000 la bums because where's covet where is covet
[52:01.120 --> 52:05.680]  i'm not allowed to go to the store without a mask even though i don't wear the mask anyway
[52:05.680 --> 52:17.520]  i'm uh hypoxia sensitive very serious but there's 10 000 la bums no social distance no mask and a
[52:17.520 --> 52:30.560]  total spread of covet right right right wrong fake pandemic i mean seriously if you had to guess
[52:30.560 --> 52:36.080]  all right what are they gonna do next who would have guessed fake pandemic i mean who would have
[52:36.080 --> 52:41.520]  guessed faking a pandemic and who knows they may have really they may have really released a bio
[52:41.520 --> 52:46.400]  weapon that they thought would ultimately bed be deadly and it just mutated and god's creation
[52:46.400 --> 52:51.520]  of human one again could be the case so they'll probably release another one that's why bill
[52:51.520 --> 52:55.520]  gate says they'll be you know round two and they'll just say it's covet but it'll be something else
[52:55.520 --> 53:02.960]  and you they may never even tell you what it is but are they gonna blame the protesters
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.040]  no no no no they're gonna blame you and they're gonna say it was an act of racism
[53:11.440 --> 53:13.520]  of course they are that's what they do best
[53:16.640 --> 53:22.720]  so what is the point of all this well the point is that we need to realize how dangerous things
[53:22.720 --> 53:29.680]  are we need to realize that democrats have activated their militant wing which is disguised as antifa
[53:29.680 --> 53:34.160]  which is actually antifa there were three antifa members arrested in austin this weekend
[53:34.160 --> 53:40.640]  but antifa it's just another sorrows front group folks there's there's fbi agents there's cia agents
[53:40.640 --> 53:45.040]  john brennan is running the whole thing barack obama is behind the scenes pulling the strings
[53:45.040 --> 53:50.240]  the mainstream media isn't on the whole thing they faked a pandemic they're faking protests now
[53:50.240 --> 53:58.880]  it's all it's all larping man it's all fake it's all fake what happened to covet 19 well it is only
[53:58.880 --> 54:04.080]  real when we want to shut the economy down it's only real when we want to blame trump for starting
[54:04.080 --> 54:10.960]  a pandemic it's only real when we want to use it to power grab when 10 000 brainwashed la
[54:10.960 --> 54:16.800]  bums go out on the street to protest for black lives matter then there is no covet 19 and you
[54:16.800 --> 54:21.360]  know your business needs to close at nine o'clock because covet comes out at nine so you can't go
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.800]  to the gym past nine and you can't go get groceries past nine and uh if you have a restaurant you
[54:26.800 --> 54:32.720]  can only have 25 capacity because the covet you know it can read percentages and know how much
[54:32.720 --> 54:37.280]  if it should infect or not oh but go out and riot loot and protest and shut down the police too
[54:37.280 --> 54:41.840]  and turn your guns in as well and that's called the democrat clown world and that's what we're
[54:41.840 --> 54:45.840]  up against folks and they're about to do something more dangerous than we could even imagine the
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.760]  panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms is going
[54:51.760 --> 54:57.360]  to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[54:57.360 --> 55:02.400]  and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer the
[55:02.400 --> 55:09.520]  shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth
[55:09.520 --> 55:13.520]  that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's important to be a
[55:13.520 --> 55:19.040]  prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent
[55:19.040 --> 55:24.640]  so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember how does
[55:24.640 --> 55:30.720]  info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen
[55:30.720 --> 55:36.240]  because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.520]  yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary
[55:41.520 --> 55:44.640]  it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening
[55:46.480 --> 55:52.160]  i've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting
[55:52.160 --> 55:57.840]  and i'm so ready for physical war that i'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.320]  all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the new world
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.800]  order you're about to find out just how sick stuff is but you know what the average person is still
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.680]  asleep they don't deserve what's happening to them so i'm actually sick about what's unfolding
[56:11.680 --> 56:16.000]  right now and i just want to turn things around but you know what i can't do that without you

[57:16.000 --> 57:23.920]  cabal we refer to as the globalist but they operate under many different hats like the democrat party
[57:23.920 --> 57:32.000]  the chinese communist and so on and this is their ultimate goal to end nation states and bring in a
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.600]  one world government with centralized power which is really just run by the corporations
[57:37.600 --> 57:49.520]  and their heads with an ai smart grid policing the world population 24 7 that you must comply with

[57:59.360 --> 58:08.560]  that's where this is all is going and america is the crown jewel of freedom and sovereignty in the
[58:08.560 --> 58:16.000]  world and so you must defeat america before you can roll that plan out america is not perfect
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.640]  we've had a lot of problems as a nation still to this day we need to figure out info wars has
[58:22.640 --> 58:29.520]  been at the cutting edge of exposing must have a lot of this but at the end of the day the reason
[58:29.520 --> 58:36.320]  why america is necessary is because it is a sovereign nation of sovereign people a republic
[58:37.760 --> 58:46.160]  that at its will in its dna no matter what your skin color is our ancestors fought tyranny put it
[58:46.160 --> 58:57.120]  all on the line to defeat tyranny realizing what that meant for our ancestors and so now

[59:01.440 --> 59:05.360]  well you just hate yourself so you don't value life so you don't care what you leave for the
[59:05.360 --> 59:11.600]  future you are in misery so you want company but this is very complex but that's what this is all

[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.160]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist china ally with the big mega
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:10.720]  banks that set up communist china in 1949 the communist chinese have taken control of us telecommunications
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:14.560]  infrastructure the communist chinese have taken control of hollywood the communist chinese have
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:18.960]  taken control of the main universities this is all confirmed this is not a drill big tech and
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.120]  silicon valley is almost completely run by the communist chinese government they've officially
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:29.600]  become state run apple 100 google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:34.880]  worldwide censorship they are now beta testing using me as the straw man a demonized version of
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.440]  alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other probes before that were meant
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:44.640]  to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:50.640]  with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:56.400]  attacks this is a tight-rated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:02.240]  overcome subversion paradigm manipulation in layman's terms they are manipulating the fact
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:07.520]  that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:13.600]  now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:19.600]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total internet of things
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:24.560]  integration global social score complete command and control system it is the virtual reality
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:30.400]  ai weapon system now attacking the united states with traders inside the major security agencies
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:35.120]  blocking trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:39.920]  of the chai com slash big tech making combine emergency situation i have been chosen for
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.000]  destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:50.640]  i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:56.480]  where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being sincere
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:01.440]  build me into an insincere person in the straw man a person that cares about life and children
[1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:05.600]  and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me into
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:10.960]  this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:17.360]  about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to serve
[1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:23.600]  them by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:29.280]  fault from has been used against you only your full understanding of this t will break you free
[1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:33.440]  from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free

[1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:18.240]  june 8 monday global transmission with one four seven out from the election as the jaws of the
[1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:26.000]  deep state and the neocon leftist globalist juggernaut snapped down hard on america's neck
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:34.640]  attempting to sever our populace president from the people and continue our plunge in the new
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:40.800]  world order without further ado we've got a lot to cover paul joseph watson joins us from
[1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:47.600]  her britannic majesties london all beyond also known by george arwell as airstrip one with the
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:55.520]  incredible globalist activities there the attacks now on winston church hill it's only intensifying
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:07:02.320]  paul watson thank you for joining us from summit dot news you're in the epicenter of it in london
[1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:05.920]  how would you describe it you've been doing a great job the last few days tweeting every five
[1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:12.480]  minutes uh minute by minute what's happening well one thing i wouldn't describe it as alec is
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:18.400]  largely peaceful which is what the media here has been describing it as but over a week now
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:23.040]  and you've been in the middle of these rallies i've been in the middle of this you know i've
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:29.920]  been to what they would call right wing protests brexit events uh bill deberg protests which you
[1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:36.640]  know attended by both left wing and right wing people years ago i used to attend anti cnd nuclear
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:42.880]  disarmament protests which was entirely left wing in all those cases the protests were almost
[1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:50.080]  entirely peaceful this is not peaceful if you're in the middle of this kind of protest and you're
[1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:55.040]  just observing it you've just got your phone out filming it or if you're a media film crew
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:08:00.880]  and then the mob attacks you simply because you're not on their side that is not a largely
[1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:06.800]  peaceful protest you know they hold up sign saying if you're not with us you're against us
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:12.560]  and alex i was in the middle of one of these protests last weekend the u.s embassy in a car
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:17.680]  stuck in the road for over an hour probably an hour and a half because they were blocking the
[1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:24.080]  traffic now they would go up to each car and if you weren't wearing the right facial expression
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:29.440]  or if you weren't honking your horn if you weren't sticking your fist out the window in support of
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:36.320]  these peaceful protesters as they call them they would harass you they would try to stick leaflets
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:41.200]  through the window and that was the best of it a week later they were literally trying to drag
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:46.560]  people out of their cars as we've seen in america and again this is the mob attacking people who
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:51.920]  were merely just trying to drive away from the area or media observing it that is not a peaceful
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:09:01.360]  protest over the weekend alex in london 35 police officers injured chased by mobs smoke bombs
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:07.200]  on objects thrown at them police beaten as we saw in the video right now they're trying to burn
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:14.400]  the british flag at the senator he's facing winston churchill statues shouting run piggy run while
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:21.760]  attacking the police guess how the bbc reported this after largely they said the police wanted
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:25.360]  someone that got hit in the head with a bottle on the horse yet who was thrown off and has
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:31.200]  punctured lung and is super ill they said she did it on purpose it's her fault they attacked her
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:38.160]  well and yeah what happened with that they threw objects they threw flares and bicycles at this
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:45.360]  police force it bolted the female police officer smashed into traffic lights she fell off unconscious
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:50.400]  as he said collapsed lung broke in collarbone shattered ribs she's gonna be off work for six
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:56.960]  months she could easily have been killed guess what cnn's headline what police force causes havoc
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:05.440]  at london protest alex that's like saying airplane causes havoc during september flight to new york
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:12.560]  this is how the media responded to this you talk about the 35 police officers injured bbc headline
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:18.160]  police officers injured during largely peaceful anti-racism protests in london again that's like
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:24.960]  saying two skyscrapers knocked over during largely peaceful september flight absolutely insane
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:32.560]  imagine if 35 police officers have been chased by mobs in attack to a pro brexit rally would the
[1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:39.280]  media describe it as a largely peaceful protest not in a million years it's despicable how they
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:46.640]  treated this we also have where they're blocking traffic and attacking people in cars and then a
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:50.240]  black dude gets out and fights back well they call that a white supremacist attacking but
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.600]  don't even show the actual footage of this is massive concerted deception at every level
[1:10:55.600 --> 1:11:02.000]  to hide what's really going on paul it's absolutely incredible and it's just how the media
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.960]  responds to it it's as if you know they would have reported that george floyd kneeled on his own
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:17.600]  head absolutely incredible and we also have to put up with this just a second goodbye again paul
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:23.360]  joseph watson is live from london just give me a document cam shot and i'll show you some of
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:28.240]  this right now for tb viewers again if you go out there you can find this them throwing bricks
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:34.000]  bottles everything at horses and police and then when a horse bolts and throws the police officer
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.960]  off and she gets hurt and then runs over a protester they separately said the police attacked them
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:43.600]  and then they on top of that uh then separately
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:52.080]  said that the police woman threw herself off on purpose here is a still shot of the police woman
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:59.120]  right here being thrown off the horse doubled over backwards with with her ribs going into her
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:05.120]  lungs they're saying she'll be out four months to a year and they are saying that she did this
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:12.400]  to herself when the horse was attacked because the leftists are virtuous beyond anything on earth
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:18.080]  and can never do any wrong they can never do any harm they are perfect but again what is this it's
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:22.880]  not about the police it's about the communists the socialists the globalists in a movement
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:29.280]  to overthrow civilization and overthrow society to then bring in their system that's 100 times
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:32.800]  worse they're not going to get rid of the police they're going to give you police like north korea
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:38.240]  or communist china that is their goal and these police are primed all over europe and the us to
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:45.280]  kiss the ass of people assaulting them and so they're asking for it that's what this is all about
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:49.600]  but studies show in england if you're nice the police they're mean to you because they also
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.920]  are authoritarian they're overwhelmed because they're communist we're living in insanely
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:01.040]  dangerous times and i've told folks the one back three months ago i'm not buying storeable food
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:05.040]  because i'm worried about the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages and the economic
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:09.440]  collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.840]  shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and it's even worse in
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:18.400]  the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:23.920]  fraud and the covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on
[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:29.520]  now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're in easily totable

[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:11.920]  i'm alex jones your host paul joseph watchin let's write the middle of london and
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:19.680]  looked like an emergency he just jumped up said just a moment and then heard a little bit of noise
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:26.240]  and and disconnected the sky but we don't know what happened so i'm calling paul hope he's okay
[1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:35.920]  we'll follow that as it unfolds looking at paul's twitter feed i mean i see what's coming in f all
[1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:44.320]  white people overthrow capitalism this is what america and the world has turned into
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:54.240]  and it's because there are 6.9 billion people that quote aren't white
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:00.240]  that's the vast majority of people on the planet
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:07.600]  and the un and the globalists have looked at the demographics and they're going to make it about
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:12.640]  race and make it about being anti-white and then the big mega banks and all the big powerful elites
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:17.840]  are going to sit up there on their armored fortresses while directing the destruction of western society
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:24.000]  and the christian system that actually tried to build up the third world and bring medicine
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:30.800]  and electricity and science to it so the western world was really a breakaway civilization
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:35.760]  a more advanced civilization was trying to raise up the other civilizations
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:39.760]  that was called colonialism there were certainly some exploits and bad things that were done but
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:44.880]  what the globalists are bringing in is not colonialism it is a total collapse of all civilization
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:54.480]  but small globalist citadels or city states of advanced technology or the elysium fields
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:01.440]  in great mythology elysium is not a space station for the ultra rich live in orbit it is
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:11.360]  high plains or mountaintops or maces fabled maces on which the faithful of the gods
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:18.480]  could become immortal as well to the golden fields of elysium gold with all the wheat
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:25.600]  and the globalists are taking control of the future they believe that they are the apex predators
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:34.000]  who are reintroducing social Darwinism or theory of the species to the people and it's true if you
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.560]  kill off all the coyotes or all the wolves you're going to have an overpopulation of deer and so
[1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:42.640]  humans come in and it's good to harvest the deer and it's going to keep their population at a good
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:47.120]  level that's sustainable well the globalists have that same attitude that there's too many humans
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:52.480]  that there's too many people that we become like a daisical we become stupid we become lazy
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:18:05.040]  and that we deserve what is being done to us and so Bill Gates because there aren't predators
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:11.200]  saber-toothed tigers and other you know tribes of men killing us he has to come in and fulfill that
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:19.200]  role but then you study Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein and their secret cloning programs and
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:23.040]  all the things they're involved in and there's some of the most degenerate sickening people of all
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:30.640]  who just seek power and control over everyone and who do not want a survival of the fittest system
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:39.440]  they want a technocracy monopoly over humanity and to make independent wild human living impossible
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:45.600]  and that make us an artificiality that is produced by the megacorporations that will now play god
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.720]  and decide what humans or humanoids can live on this planet and everything we do here
[1:18:55.840 --> 1:19:04.160]  is about exposing just that you look at the university rabble that have been taught that
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:07.760]  they're the rulers of the earth the masters the universe that they've gone and paid for worthless
[1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:11.920]  degrees so they're going to be controlling the new green deal the new globalist deal
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:17.680]  and whether they're in europe whether they're in australia whether they're in new zealand
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:24.320]  whether they're in canada the united states they are dumbed down they are hateful they are ignorant
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:31.600]  and they hate free speech and they want oppression and they're brutish and ill-informed and
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:38.400]  have the dead eyes of a crazy zombie because they are the slaves
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:42.160]  of the new world order
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:50.320]  and they are worshiped by the media and worshiped by the culture they're not given jobs or power
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:56.800]  by twitter and facebook giving them dopamine rushes but as they attack every symbol at every
[1:19:56.800 --> 1:20:05.040]  art type at every foundation and every statue and statute they believe they're having a coming of age
[1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:13.200]  and and a great seething of power and control and then those that join in hop around ghoulishly
[1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:21.200]  believing that they have defeated some greater man than them that lived hundreds of years ago
[1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:29.600]  and always when a civilization starts to collapse barbarians rush in and begin burning down the
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:35.520]  buildings and tearing down the statues and burning down the libraries because to them that's not a
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:42.080]  symbol of knowledge and empowerment that's a symbol of superiority that if they can squat on
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:54.400]  it and defecate on it and burn the british flag if they can burn the american flag well somehow
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:21:02.320]  that gives them primacy that gives them hegemonic power and control over it when in truth the global
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:07.200]  has already conquered england a long time ago and then brought in people and put them on welfare and
[1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:13.360]  turned them against the system and used them as a client and now are deploying them against the last
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:21.120]  vestiges of the old state which will then be swept away and with it brutal oppression brutal control
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:33.200]  against the real target the seed or the zenith or the genesis point of the renaissance and of
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:39.520]  modern christendom and the radical liberal egalitarian plan to empower humanity that must
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:45.760]  be pulled down by the neoliberals and the neocons and the technocrats because it stands in the way
[1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:53.360]  of their hegemonic world rule and so that's where we are and as a society that's what we face
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:01.120]  and that's why it's not a failure of the globalists that their minions attacked the
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:12.000]  glory soldier black soldiers from the north civil war monument or attacked the world war two
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:18.240]  monument or attacked the western church show monument or attacked the lincoln memorial and
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:26.640]  sprayed racist on abraham lincoln the fact that the minions are that stupid is a act of victory
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:34.000]  it's a symbol of their brains being sucked out and the police going to the local universities
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:42.720]  and laying on their bellies to empower the mad youth brigade mobs to believe that they are the
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:47.920]  rightful rulers and they should go out and burn everything down this is simply the globalist
[1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:53.280]  finishing america off finishing the uk off when i was on twitter this morning reading a lot of the
[1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:58.080]  people you know saying kill all the whites burned out america burned out england almost all of them
[1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:08.240]  had e u flags up there in the symbol of who they were the e u unelected tyrannical incredibly corrupt
[1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:13.600]  a plan of atall fitler but they know it's the e u getting rid of borders they know it's the e u
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:19.680]  promising them unlimited welfare they know it's the e u that says we're gonna bring in 680 million
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:25.120]  people from other countries into the us 250 million into europe we're gonna overthrow it all
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:30.000]  whites of the enemy these people that literally believe that because they're brown if they could
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.120]  literally just kill all the whites suddenly all of what the west is built would be theirs
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:45.040]  just like the german vandals as they're called for the visit gods those would be austrians
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:49.200]  when they invaded rome and four ten and burned it all down they thought they were conquering
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:54.000]  but really they were just destroying it the people of the world have awakened to globalism
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:00.160]  and so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries that's why the new world
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:05.520]  order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about
[1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:12.800]  overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services this is an attempt
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:17.920]  to have society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:24.320]  pick up the pieces we must stand against the un the imf the world bank and the e u openly saying
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:28.880]  we fund the police the police have a lot of problems we all have a lot of problems but this
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:32.960]  is our government and our local vocabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:37.760]  this country they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:42.960]  freedom the globalists believe communist china is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:48.640]  this entire thing the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed

[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:28.160]  we're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put americans back where they belong
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:31.920]  and dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:35.520]  well i think nbc you are here to listen and not speak
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:41.840]  i think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care yeah a new disease no one's
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:46.320]  immune it's like the summer of the shark except instead of a shark it's an epidemic and instead
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:52.000]  of summer it's all the time that is okay now i hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:58.720]  loves he loves being that guy but janice we do have standards this can't be a made-up disease
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:04.720]  the only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public we do have something
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:08.000]  we've been holding on to but it hasn't been tested get over here nbc
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:20.560]  oh well we certainly believe in testing but i oh wow wow oh yeah so we've got our deadly disease
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:26.400]  now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household something that people are a
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:31.760]  little bit afraid of already house cat flu is coming people the center for disease disinformation
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:36.320]  predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:43.040]  hypothetical outbreak pattern so better be aware that warm body on your left just might be ready
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:54.480]  to destroy your tender vitals springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:59.520]  experience any of the following symptoms mild thirst occasional hunger tiredness at night
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:06.960]  well alex jones here back live paul joseph wantson had a fire alarm and the power going out there
[1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:12.880]  in london site of the soros un funded riots that are going on and now the president of
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:18.240]  baleroos has come out and said they had no real covet nineteen cases the president tanzania says
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:24.880]  no real cases bill blundegates sent fake testing kits that all normal deaths heart attacks cancer
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:32.960]  gunshots bear attacks have been counted george floyd they said died of covet nineteen that's on
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:38.880]  the desert certificate or he had it this is how they operate that's another subject we'll hit next
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:45.040]  segment with paul joseph watson but he is back with us now from summit dot news from london england
[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:52.240]  so paul where we left off there glad you're okay now there at your studios where is this going
[1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:56.000]  is it looks like the demonstrations are being encouraged by media the more people they attack
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:00.160]  the more they're called peaceful they're definitely pushing to undermine the president they're calling
[1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:05.840]  him jimmy carter they're saying you can't rule but this is an international movement saying defund
[1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:11.280]  and abolish the police well who's going to make us all social distance uh and stay inside and all
[1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:18.080]  this oh the new contact tracers the new domestic security forces that are just as big just as
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:22.320]  strong as our military i guess the same folks beating up the police who bow down to them i
[1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:26.880]  guess that's who's going to enforce things paul because it is modeled after the mal enforcement
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:33.680]  cultural revolution isn't it well it is truly a cultural revolution and the goal is to tear down
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:40.720]  society and remold it in their image and their image is pretty ugly but on the subject of social
[1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:46.720]  distancing you know alex we've been told for the past three months that we can't hug our parents we
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:52.800]  can't attend funerals we can't gather anywhere outside in groups of more than six and we can't
[1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:59.680]  even get a haircut yet tens of thousands of people are able to gather in london and nobody cares you
[1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:05.040]  know we had a scandal for the past week which was a government advisor called dominick comings
[1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:12.800]  who was in trouble for arranging urgent care for his child he was subject to absolute vitriol
[1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:19.040]  and abuse for a period of over a week that was a big deal alex but tens of thousands of them
[1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:22.880]  congregating in huge numbers that's nothing i mean what is going on there
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:30.080]  total hypocrisy paul this is this is a cult programming this is what cults do and they
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.680]  admit it's a cult and fouchy admits wearing the mask is a cult i mean this whole thing has been
[1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:43.520]  nothing but a giant power grab well yeah it's a religious worship they're kneeling down uh and
[1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:48.640]  in terms of london let's just look at the stats here we've we've had a massive problem with knife
[1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:55.520]  crime in london and who are the main victims of that knife crime 73 percent of knife offenders
[1:31:55.520 --> 1:32:02.960]  and 53 percent of victims are black now nobody's protesting that you just had a weekend in chicago
[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:08.800]  where i think it was 29 people were killed or 29 people were injured three were killed nobody's
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:14.880]  protesting that you know we've got a situation in london where we have a massive epidemic of black
[1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:21.120]  on black knife crime there's nobody kneeling in the streets over that alex they have white people
[1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:26.800]  in areas of london with massive knife crime problems kneeling on the streets where were they
[1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:33.600]  when we had the highest knife crime higher than even new york they were completely a wall alex well
[1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:39.120]  my 16 year old daughter yesterday when we were tubing the shan marcus river she said i really
[1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:44.720]  like paul watson he's cute uh he ought to come to town again literally but she goes but why is he on
[1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:50.480]  your show if he's in the uk and i said honey and her friend was asking this that was with us i said
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:57.520]  honey we're all interconnected the same global is trying to take down the uk or attacking us and so
[1:32:57.520 --> 1:33:01.680]  it's important to get commentary from over there he gives us commentary over here i give him a
[1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:06.480]  perspective on his country he gives me a perspective i'm not over there telling him what to do i'm
[1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:10.960]  showing we have a common enemy just like you in world war two or you know during the cold war
[1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:19.280]  but you mentioned this instagram censors fbi crime stats graph as hate speech these are from the fbi
[1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:23.600]  we've shown these numbers let's scroll through that for tv viewers radio listeners you should go
[1:33:23.600 --> 1:33:29.120]  to info wars dot com or news wars dot com to get this and it's fbi numbers the latest numbers are
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:33.520]  published two years ago published over the last few decades and it says your post goes against
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:39.680]  our community guidelines and it shows blacks killed by whites including police is the lowest
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:46.400]  number blacks are 10 times more likely to kill whites and it goes over these numbers so so again
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:53.280]  whites killed by blacks 9.83 blacks killed by whites 0.77 so when i say it's more than
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:34:00.320]  10 times and these are hard hard numbers but again this isn't about black people the left
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:06.000]  wants to kill them they've got the abortuaries the plant parenthood uh yeah most the crime is black
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:11.520]  on black in those areas it's even worse it's terrible but look white on black crime 59 000
[1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:22.480]  against 547 000 plus in the same year you just cannot argue with this but now actual numbers
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:27.680]  from the government aren't allowed paul and now you can look at it from either side of the
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:33.840]  atlantic i mean something that i've been retweeted over the past week is a stat again you can get
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:39.200]  banned for tweeting these hate stats they call them you can get censored on instagram for this
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:45.920]  and the one out of america is this but every 10 000 black people arrested for violent crime three
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:52.800]  are killed but every 10 000 white people arrested for violent crime four are killed the very premise
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:58.800]  the very foundation of blm is completely fraudulent and then you look at the uk alex and this is
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:05.840]  reported by the bbc over the past 10 years before i get before that we had these protests over police
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:12.720]  brutality in the uk in the whole of 2019 there were two unarmed people killed by cops in the uk
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:18.720]  okay one was a terrorist and we say unarmed that means they don't have a gun that was the guy on
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:24.560]  london bridge who had um knives he was trying to attack cops he was chasing people down the street
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:29.360]  so two unarmed people killed in the uk and they didn't have a fake bomb on his chest
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:37.200]  yeah he had a fake bomb fake explosives that was the entire year of 2019 the bbc reported over the
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:46.160]  past 10 years 163 people have died in police custody in england of the 163 13 were black
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:54.560]  13 out of 163 and a white individual who has been arrested was 25 percent times more likely
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:36:00.080]  to die in custody than a black individual who's been arrested so the entire premise of this in
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:06.960]  the u.s and the uk is completely fraudulent just like cover 19 it's a total fraud and i saw an
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:12.640]  article out a few months ago pointing out that uk police are mean to the niceies nice to the meanies
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:16.560]  and that's what i've experienced a lot of cops are good but let me tell you being a white guy when
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:22.080]  they pulled me over i was instantly to jail because i had two glasses of wine i know cops man black
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:26.400]  cops they will not they don't even they won't even mess with black people which is the inverse
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:30.880]  then that allows crime to explode and the slow rolling in these communities then helps the
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:36.000]  criminals murder people which does kill black people it's incredible paul let's talk more about this
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:41.040]  and shift gears and some other big subjects like worst covid 19 going what's going to happen with
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:51.840]  trump the latest four chan trolls and more check out paul's excellent site it's summit.news
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:57.280]  we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've told folks going back three months ago i'm not
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:01.120]  buying storable food because i'm worried about the covid 19 virus i'm worried about the food
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:06.080]  shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:10.560]  already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and
[1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:14.880]  it's even worse in the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:20.320]  but with the election fraud and the covid 19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:25.760]  else is going on now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're

[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:57.280]  hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:04.720]  at say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:10.560]  yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:16.800]  the sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over and they die then you go
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:23.120]  bag them and haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:29.680]  what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:34.960]  it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.960]  to mean probably over 100 million dead according to the un and i believe their numbers because it's
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:44.400]  the very un that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:48.000]  thought it was their revolution to get rid of trump you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:54.320]  into something bigger than what hitler did i've been fighting the globalist for 26 years and the
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:40:00.240]  evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and i'm so ready for physical war that i'm kind of happy
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.720]  about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:08.720]  the unborn babies that go along with the new world order you're about to find out just how
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:12.480]  sick stuff is but you know what the average person is still asleep they don't deserve what's
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:17.760]  happening to them so i'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and i just want to turn
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:22.960]  things around but you know what i can't do that without you i can't get out of this mess i can't

[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:40.560]  board slash show when you just buy the products info wars store.com it changes the world right now

[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:14.800]  jones show live from london england it's paul joseph wantson and some answers to 1984 is 1776
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:22.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show and we're with info wars.com we got a lot to cover
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:28.720]  in this final segment with paul and i'm gonna open the phones up next hour but i asked paul what do
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:36.320]  you want to cover next he said i want to cover the 1200 doctors and scientists saying it doesn't
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:41.200]  hurt anyone physically to go out and demonstrate there's no covered issue there but anyone out
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:48.000]  protesting the lockdowns should be arrested let's put it on screen this is from their quote
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:55.040]  as a public health advocates we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for covet 19 transmission
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:59.840]  this should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings particularly
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:06.800]  protest against stay at home orders so this is literally george arwell's animal farm come true
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:12.240]  it was at first the pigs say let's have a revolt the humans are in the house four legs good two
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:16.880]  legs bad once they run the humans off though they enslave everybody 10 times worse it's an
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:23.040]  allegory of communist or well been a communist how bad they were and they said oh no by the end
[1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:29.280]  two legs good four legs bad and if you said wait you used to say four legs good they kill you
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:36.880]  hey wait you just a few years ago you said four legs good two legs bad well you're dead if you
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:42.800]  say that of course the horse the archetype of the working class that brought the commies into power
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:49.280]  they ship it off to the glue factory so paul joseph watson joins us to talk about this people
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:54.560]  say well does it make sense there's no logic to it there's not supposed to be a logic this is a cult
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:59.520]  this is the strength of the new world order that their followers are so stupid and so idiotic and
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:06.480]  so bad paul no they literally went alex in the space of 10 days from saying that stay at home
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:13.680]  protesters in the us and in fact in the uk anti lockdown protesters same thing were literally
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:19.360]  killing granny by going outside and protesting and these people weren't even congregating they
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:24.720]  were inside their vehicles for the most part and you had the scenes in arizona and other places of
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:32.160]  the nurses out blocking traffic when these stay at home protests happened the same nurses in numerous
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:39.680]  american cities now over the past few days literally applauding black lives matter as they congregate
[1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:46.720]  in gigantic numbers on the street oh but we're killing granny but that's okay because racism
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:53.040]  is a bigger public health threat oh by the way in the uk fame people we've been latched for the past
[1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:58.800]  two three weeks meaning black or brown people are disproportionately more likely to get covid and
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:03.120]  that's racist what we're going to do about that well what did you do about it what did you say
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:10.640]  about it you literally celebrated fame people congregating in huge numbers spreading if you
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:17.040]  believe their narrative covid between each other in greater and greater numbers and you mentioned
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:23.200]  the 1200 public health officials in their open letter they literally said and this is this is
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:28.400]  the worst example of double thing i've ever experienced when black lives matter go out and
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:33.840]  protest that's fine because racism is a bigger health threat but those stay at home protesters
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:40.400]  they're all white supremacists so that's bad when they do it they literally said that in the letter
[1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:48.400]  and now we have piers morgan the guy who for the past three months in the uk has absolutely hounded
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:55.440]  anyone who opposes this lockdown going on twitter one day chastising a member of parliament for
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:02.800]  attending the blm protest saying he's irresponsible and disgusting the very next day praising his own
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:09.280]  son for attending the very same blm protest and again alex this proves what we've been saying for
[1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:15.200]  the past two months coronavirus was a big threat in china we didn't downplay it it was a serious
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:20.960]  issue but these lockdowns which will kill infinitely more people than corona virus did
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:28.560]  are complete bs proven now by the fact that they're advocating celebrating the congregation of people
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:36.560]  in huge numbers we've been proven right once again logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:43.360]  that was said by one of my favorite writers many many years ago in 1962 rod serling
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:49.280]  i don't think this is a simulation i know this is real but the way the left and globalist act
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:55.120]  is so cartoonish until you realize they're trying to use the appeal to authority that mainstream
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:46:01.760]  media and hollywood and everybody is in unison doing all these contradictory things day by day
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:06.960]  and i researched the psychology behind it they're just trying to overwhelm people and exhaust us
[1:46:07.680 --> 1:46:13.360]  until we accept our house burning down around us if they say to i mean this is people ask why
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:18.320]  to cults ask to have sex with your kids why to cults ask you to stay on your head why to cults
[1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:24.160]  tell you two plus two equals five because they're they want power over your mind they want you
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:30.480]  to suspend logic and so we you know those of us that still have logic we laugh at this it's not
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:36.080]  funny a lot of people are suspending logic or they're just giving up paul i mean what do you
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:42.640]  think's behind this this the the middle gymnastics we see that should totally discredit these people
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:49.680]  forever well i think what's behind it is it's it's a mafia thing where you can't leave the mafia
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:53.920]  but it's also the intimidation of the mob we've seen the black squares on instagram
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:47:00.800]  that we've seen people literally saying if you post pictures of your food on social media then
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:05.920]  that's that means you're racist now posting pictures of your own dinner on instagram is racist
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:12.240]  oh msnbc officially saying now calling the police is elitist and that minorities don't
[1:47:12.240 --> 1:47:18.720]  deserve police and they're saying get rid of the police entirely people are so dependent now on that
[1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:25.280]  they liberals are the ones that call police if their big mac is cold yeah so now that they're
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:30.560]  introducing the idea of literally having political commissars act as the police and they're gonna
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:37.520]  enforce the law meanwhile as he said the unison the uniformity of opinion behind this is staggering
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:42.560]  you know they've got every major media outlet on their side they've got every major corporation
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:49.280]  on their side every social network every cultural institution hollywood celebrities world leaders
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:55.440]  politicians governors police chiefs and they still claim alex that this is an anti-establishment
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:48:01.360]  movement when you've got every single tentacle of the establishment behind you when you're endorsed
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:07.920]  by every single tentacle of the establishment that's not anti-establishment like imagine if
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:13.840]  we had brexit protesters out on the streets of london attacking police defacing statues
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:20.640]  growing missiles at police horses would they say it was largely peaceful no it's a complete 180
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:26.080]  and it's absolutely incredible what's going to happen alex's next weekend if this continues
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:31.520]  which it looks like it will uh the football lads in the uk which are kind of the tommy robinson
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:36.160]  types has said that they're going to go out en masse on the streets simply to protect these war
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:41.600]  memorials the Churchill memorial now if there's any confrontation whatsoever even though they've
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.240]  said they're going to be the police are going to swim in with helicopter gunships and fire missiles
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:52.000]  at the british patriots right wing extremists attack minorities that's how they report it
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  even though they've literally injured 35 cops and it's largely peaceful absolutely all welly and
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:04.240]  and incredible paul let's expand on what you said because what you said is the key to everything in
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:09.280]  fact i've meant to start the show with that today and for some reason i always get distracted and
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:14.480]  don't what you just said is the key to everything all the mega banks all the media all the authoritarian
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:20.720]  regimes the communist chinese the unelected e u hollywood the jeffrey epstein types they are all
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:28.400]  in unison saying america's bad england's bad europe's bad white people are bad cops are bad
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:34.640]  overthrow the government and their billionaires that control trillions that run death camps in
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:40.880]  china and have three million muslims in slave camps making apple components and then literally the
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:45.920]  most powerful ruthless people on earth that destroyed the middle class vertically integrated
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:51.760]  the money like never before seen in history are literally trying to have third world mobs and leftist
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:50:03.920]  anarchist managers from academia have a communist overthrow this is just so insane this is the elite
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:09.920]  using communism and class warfare as a takeover arm where does it end where does it go
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:18.480]  what can we do to fight this i mean the reaction i've seen over the past 48 hours is absolutely
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:24.800]  fundamentally a massive backlash that i haven't seen before but again what can we do in the uk
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:31.360]  these same people had this same social justice identitarian extremist message before the election
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:37.120]  in december the uk voted in droves for the conservative party so they got absolutely
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:42.560]  crushed on the left but now the conservative party when this happens when people are defacing
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:47.440]  churchill statues attacking the police what are they talking about on twitter they're talking about
[1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:54.160]  wash your hands so it's absolute fundamental weakness the only saving grace i guess alex is
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:59.280]  nigel barrage had the support of the third of the country just about six months ago and if somebody
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:04.720]  runs on a law and order message that's going to attract mass support in america you had a poll
[1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:10.400]  58 percent of american support military on the streets to deal with this mayhem so the silent
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:17.120]  majority is still there and that's the one saving grace but they need to stop being silent
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:22.640]  because all of this appeasement is meant to summon something even more destructive i want to
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:25.840]  five more minutes and we'll get back to work at summit dot news and the great articles you're

[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:11.760]  other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history book show us just
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:17.520]  like the bible states every time israel became corrupt evil and turned away from god they were
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:23.680]  brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:30.480]  spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again today compliance and going along with
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:37.680]  this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has
[1:53:37.680 --> 1:53:57.680]  had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:12.880]  you know i come in here every day and i know that i read thousands of pages a week i know i sit
[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:19.600]  there and read soul linsky's writings and i read the fritz revolution writings i read hitler's
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:26.720]  writings i read stallin and linens writings and we sat here in this bubble in what's left of europe
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:33.200]  in the uk and the u.s and canada and australia and new zealand and we just don't know how lucky we've
[1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:43.120]  got it and i just see basically it's like a planet losing its atmosphere in the fables
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:48.640]  mars had an atmosphere once it lost it that's what the ancients said the greeks said it once
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:54.800]  and i did have an atmosphere how we know this we're not sure we just know what we're losing our
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:00.400]  cultural atmosphere right now and we better get mobilized and aggressive or it's all over the
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:04.080]  four months we have left poll watching what do you predict trump can still win i'm not saying he's
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:10.320]  going to lose but if he listens to the leftist and the pacifist and if he goes soft they're
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:14.160]  telling him to do right now this is all a test that he follows all the fake polls they're giving
[1:55:14.160 --> 1:55:18.800]  him and the fake polls his people are bringing him we're going to lose this thing what's your
[1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:25.200]  gut level poll joseph watching well they're obviously trying to use the intimidation tactics of the
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:30.320]  mob to say if you reelect trump this is what america this is what europe is going to be like
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:35.360]  for the next four years after that so that that's literally why they're out on the streets to push
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:42.240]  that kind of um scare message that if you if you do choose to reelect trump there will be complete
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:47.520]  bedlam and this will become a routine thing in terms of the wider perspective i mean you've
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:51.920]  played that clip many times before of the infiltrator of the weather underground the
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:58.160]  violent terrorist extremist group the bombed police stations attempted to kill people in the
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:06.080]  70s and the infiltrator literally said after he infiltrated the group they if you don't comply
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:12.240]  their goal is to literally put you in gulags and kill you now this is not alex jones saying this
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:17.840]  is not david ike this was a guy who literally infiltrated the weather underground on behalf
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:23.360]  of the us authorities at the time and this is what they told him and if you speak to the people at
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:31.280]  the protest that's the message that they will echo you also have isis celebrating these george
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:36.400]  floyd protests and we had an article back i think it was like five years ago now where in their
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:43.200]  official publication isis said our plan and whether isis is over it doesn't matter we're talking
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:50.640]  about extremists uh infiltrating from abroad it was their plan to go to left-wing rallies
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:56.000]  radicalize and make violent the protesters so that they would follow up these attacks on police
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:02.400]  these attacks on media by literally um throwing explosives throwing grenades at people and bombing
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:09.040]  things islamic state said that was the goal in their own publication so this is where it's going
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:16.240]  it's a cultural revolution in the uk yesterday we had a statue in bristol which is a city probably
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:22.080]  about 100 miles from london not only toppled but then thrown in the river okay because it was a
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:29.280]  racist statue they're going to do the same thing to people who are racist who's racist anyone who
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:35.440]  disagrees with us so they're literally going to stop attacking people on the streets killing them
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:41.360]  if we don't stop this and the media still will report it as largely peaceful oh well only a
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:46.640]  few people killed that person so the demonstration was still largely peaceful so if it doesn't stop
[1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:51.680]  now it's going to get violent the only positive thing with trump is they had a rasmussen poll a
[1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:58.480]  few days ago which found um 40 black support for the job that trump's doing which is up from about
[1:57:58.480 --> 1:58:04.720]  28 percent in august last year so maybe that's something to hold on to but with the amount of
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:11.520]  the vociferous nature of this media propaganda who knows if we can hold back the tide but i mean
[1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:16.000]  it's frightening it's absolutely frightening alec exactly the globalists were arrogant four years
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:21.280]  ago they're not arrogant they're attacking like piranha so i'm telling listeners and viewers do
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:25.680]  not be overconfident okay because i'm not going to get up here and tell you that i i think trump
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:30.640]  right now is going to lose with 147 days out if he doesn't change course the next couple months
[1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:36.080]  if he doesn't get hardcore and just savage the hell out of everyone he's going to lose but i i
[1:58:36.080 --> 1:58:39.600]  think trepp will turn the corner and we should help him do it and a lot of it's us what are we
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:43.120]  going to do to spread the word it's it's not just trump to do this we've got to do it poll
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:50.240]  Watson summit dot news incredible site summit dot news we salute you paul i told listeners back in
[1:58:50.240 --> 1:58:55.920]  december that i would never go to 50 off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the
[1:58:55.920 --> 1:59:00.800]  products to be able to fund ourselves doing that but i gotta tell you things are so crazy
[1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:06.800]  the world is so insane my gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:12.320]  to make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days because we only got money
[1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:16.320]  to operate a few months right now so these are great products you and your family need

[1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:07.920]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war all right ladies and gentlemen
[2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:14.160]  alex jones here now into our number three i tend to open the phones up starting next
[2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:21.280]  segment so stand by for that to happen i only go off well i can observe
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:26.960]  and that means what i can research in the news but i can see an actual real action
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:32.000]  also what i've experienced culturally spiritually and then what sources tell me
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:37.360]  and when i attacked elon musk six months ago when he came out and said oh we're gonna have
[2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:42.640]  kiosk everywhere you're all gonna get brain chips ai's gonna take over just submit to it i said well
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:48.960]  this is horrible news screw elon musk and i got a lot of calls from people that work with elon
[2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:54.720]  and they said look elon's moving to austin and elon really is a fan of yours and you should really
[2:00:54.720 --> 2:01:01.600]  lay off elon i said well i don't go off that i go off what he says elon you know really pisses me
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:08.720]  off so i attacked him more i kind of i'm kind of the only thing there's a way you can manipulate
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:15.760]  me and that's telling me i shouldn't do something so i need to look after that but then he didn't
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:21.680]  put the kiosk out this year for the brain chips he'd previously attack the new world order world
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:28.000]  government the ai gods the post human future they raided his company they tried to shut down
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:35.520]  his operations they had fbi investigations soros tried to didn't try short of the stock for a while
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:42.320]  almost took him down and then elon started coming out and people told me they said watch what elon's
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:51.840]  gonna do watch elon will show you and then elon came out and he attacked the lockdowns two months
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:58.800]  ago that was early on and said they were a fraud to scam and he came out against the globalist
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:04.560]  and he came out against tyranny and then when amazon banned a book by a prestigious new york times
[2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:11.680]  writer about covid being a hoax he said it's time to break up amazon and jeff bezos backed down
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:19.040]  when that happened and that's my experience when you actually stand up as a little guy or a little
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:28.480]  lady or a big lady or a big guy two tyranny they back off and we sit here where drew brie says
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:34.560]  i don't want to kneel for the flag i love america and now he's apologizing and his wife's apologizing
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:41.600]  it's all this exercise of getting on your knees if he got on his knees up front i'd know he was a
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:48.400]  slave but now it's treason to say it's a fraud and he knows what's going on but now he chooses to
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:54.800]  get on his knees once he got some pushback you you're a big star in the nfl you go out there and
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:03:02.800]  fight men in symbolic war all day but when the rubber meets the road man you're a jellyfish
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:09.520]  it's pathetic and by the way i don't sit up here as a man and go drew breeze as a jellyfish and feel
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:16.080]  powerful i feel weak i'm like it's gotta be more men this whole new order takeover pedophiles going
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:22.400]  to the schools to force inoculations that give you cancer and sterilize your ass and the chinese
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:25.840]  communists are in the washington post saying they'll crush our president and the washington
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:34.720]  post endorses it i mean i feel pathetic i don't feel strong that i have it back down and i've
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:41.360]  waged war and i've kicked globalist ass because i don't think of myself as that powerful it's not
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:47.360]  that i'm not powerful it's that there's so many damn weak people everywhere and everyone that keeps
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:53.520]  bowing down to tyranny and thinking that if you grovel to it you're gonna get empowered that's not
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:04:00.400]  how it works they were teaching you when they were undermining the republic because the idea of
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:05.520]  america threatened their tyranny the idea of empowering the individual the idea of judging
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:10.960]  someone off of what they did not their credit score or their social score or what color they are
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:18.000]  you think racism is bad social credit scores and ai tracking is a trillion times worse
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:26.240]  and everybody knows it deep down it's the mark of the beast people god sent his son down here
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:31.600]  to prove he could take the obstacle course before he asked us to do it to show us how to do it
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:37.600]  because that's fair isn't it it is oh you're so big and mighty and great everything else you put
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:42.960]  us through this to decide whether we can be with you forever you're a sadist that's what the satan
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:48.080]  has always said your god puts you through this free will your god no god's not a sadist god once
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:54.640]  as the bible says people for fellowship to be in communion with because when you're the big guy
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:05:00.640]  created it all you're lonely but we got to start at the baby phase think of the potential of that
[2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:06.960]  and the devil always says your god is a sadist and put you in this to watch all this no god
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:17.280]  gave us free will and the question is are you going to use that free will god gave you are you
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:27.520]  going to bow down to the new world order you notice that first you got to bow your head
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:30.640]  then you got to bow your knees now you got to get on your belly

[2:10:52.720 --> 2:11:00.080]  has been nothing short of historic and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:07.440]  and now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:14.960]  now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide which side
[2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:20.720]  you're on living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness will only deliver
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:27.440]  you into misery destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:34.560]  not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:38.800]  and we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new world
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:49.760]  or decide to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls you're
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:12:19.440]  listening to the alex jones show we got some major news here breaking
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:29.280]  fbi three antifa members arrested for looting target store in austin now you'll see headlines
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:35.440]  all over the news telling you that antifa is not involved in anything because the members of
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:40.880]  antifa are never given cards or membership except for the manager who's above each chapter
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:49.280]  so like little secret agents but look at these tough guys and gal here that have been arrested
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:55.040]  and that's that's just the beginning of this and again our government has its problems our police
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.920]  have their problems like every other institution i want to fix them i'm anti-police tape but
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:04.080]  overthrowing government and letting the left take over the police they don't want to abolish
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:08.720]  and they want to take them over that's your real police tape fbi three antifa members arrested
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:15.760]  at for looting target store in austin the three people identified as lisa hogan 27 samuel miller
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:23.680]  22 and sky elder 23 we're among a group of about 20 people who broke into a building
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:29.600]  stole items and damaged property on may 31st according to k sat and that's just the beginning
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:35.120]  of the slow wheels of justice we know george soros funds that we know alexander soros funds
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:39.600]  that i've shown all the documents is on record obama's involved in it the whole mainstream
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:45.520]  media has endorsed it but they keep trying to say oh fbi says there's no evidence nationwide
[2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:49.760]  that's the leftist groups announcing that through the media and putting it out
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:53.200]  antifa is all over the place i've been running into them for
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:01.440]  20 years they'd always come over and hit me below the belt when i wasn't looking at a protest they
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:07.040]  said we're gonna kill you steve mason uh local tv activists radio activists he's explained no
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:11.520]  that's the black mock their communists they're they're part of this group and they're funded by
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:18.800]  soros i didn't know who soros was believe it or not 25 years ago or so but i do now and man he's
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:22.080]  like they're gonna take over they're the communes they're the revolutionary guard they're with the
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:29.360]  malice and he'd been a quaker his parents have been real liberal he'd come down here gone to ut
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:35.280]  let's see how steve mason's doing man that guy's something else but he had been inside of them
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:38.960]  because he was a liberal police found out who they really were
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:44.240]  and since i mentioned it we're gonna go to your phone calls but here's larry grathwald
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.680]  green beret vietnam holly decorated he was going to a major university the weatherman tried to
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:55.040]  recruit him um he went and told the fbi they said yeah go ahead and get involved in it
[2:14:55.600 --> 2:15:00.800]  back on the fbi was a completely communist and he later came out in court what he said
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:06.240]  that they were actually planning to put 50 million of us in camps killed 25 million of us
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:11.520]  and now you hear this hillary says we need camps for men uh in america but they got a bankrupt
[2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:16.800]  you first and training that people are taken away for covet 19 and things that's the smokestree
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.320]  to get you ready to be tracked and controlled here's what he had to say from the grave
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:26.960]  i brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:34.720]  you know we we become responsible then for administrating you know 250 million people
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:42.960]  and there was no answers no one had given any thought to economics how are you gonna
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:48.480]  clothe and feed these people the only thing that i could get was that they expected that the
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:54.080]  cubans and the north vietnamese and the chinese and the russians would all want to occupy
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:59.680]  different portions of the united states they also believed that their immediate responsibility
[2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:05.520]  would be to protect against what they called the counterrevolution and they felt that this
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:13.200]  counterrevolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing reeducation centers
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:20.640]  in the southwest where we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the new
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:28.240]  way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be i asked well what is going to happen
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:35.280]  to those people that we can't reeducate that are diehard cap capitalists and the reply was
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:40.960]  that they'd have to be eliminated and when i pursued this further they estimated that they
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:47.680]  would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers and when i say eliminate i
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:57.280]  mean kill 25 million people i want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:06.720]  have graduate degrees from columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:14.800]  figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:22.720]  no place to hide documentary 1982 and they were dead serious just like margaret sanger
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:30.880]  wanting to abort all the quote black weeds look it up by the way i'm not going to do it but you
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:37.360]  know i could rent a bulldozer and i could go down to ut and i could wait till the middle of the night
[2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:42.480]  so i wouldn't run anybody over when it's empty and i could run over to that lbj statue because he
[2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:48.560]  was in the kkk and his letters from the national archive and they're at his own law library outside
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:56.160]  the building where a statue is saying that he hates black people they call him the inward
[2:17:56.880 --> 2:18:00.800]  but you know if i ran over his statue with a bulldozer i'd spend 20 years in prison
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:08.160]  now i don't want to run over his statue in fact we should leave it up someday and explain who he
[2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:14.560]  is now some blacks around it it's historical but that's the type of crap that those of us
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:27.680]  that are informed have to put up with you understand ladies and gentlemen that
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:36.560]  barack obama was trained by the weather underground on record bill ares and his wife's first job bill
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:44.800]  ares gave him michael obama's first job and that's who these people are and they think it's all
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:52.640]  funny and they take our tolerance as weakness and they're just here to sow deceit and dissension
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:58.400]  and evil they put your ass in a death camp and worked your ass to death in 10 seconds flat
[2:18:58.400 --> 2:19:07.520]  so you remember who they are and you think about it long and you think about it hard

[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:13.680]  you i'm i'm i'm freaked out man the country's in a lot of trouble ah you know what i'll tell you
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:18.640]  this um i'm what first of all i know you don't like to be thanked that you woke me up 10 years
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:25.840]  ago i appreciate your honesty your boldness i learned a lot from you and uh i just want to say that um
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:32.160]  we are uh going through difficult times in this country and and i guess i got a question for you
[2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:38.560]  alex why we have a president that has all the intelligence that's given to him he's a smart
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:46.320]  man why is he not dealing with uh with soros and his filthy son alexander and because because he's
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:25:50.880]  surrounded by generals that lie to him to get in and then stab i mean the secretary of defense
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:55.440]  is attacking the president all i mean he's surrounded he's trying to build a house of bricks
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:01.840]  with cow patties and i'm not trying to defend the president if i had a crew like the president has
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:07.760]  i couldn't turn the lights on here and so he's just surrounded by the establishment in washington
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:14.560]  is just a bunch of uh trash i mean it's true and that's why they they're attacking the police
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:20.480]  because the police have problems but they're some of the best folks americans that care military
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:25.520]  good families they care about justice that's why it's the police are bad the police are bad it's
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:32.000]  that bedrock local government local sheriffs once they remove that they've got the top brother the top
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:38.560]  the fish the fish rocks from the head doesn't it well i agree with you and i do believe the only
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.880]  chance we have of changing uh america is we got to start locally but we got to remember one thing
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:52.880]  alex is that we cannot put our faith in washington we ultimately have to put our faith in jesus christ
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:59.440]  and the only knee i will take is for my lord and savior jesus christ and that's it i'm not taking
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:03.520]  a knee for anybody else by the way i want what he just said put on the very front of the show
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:09.600]  when we post a demand a video and i mean to say this every day that the global elites are pushing
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:15.760]  this this is not a grassroots uprising and more importantly we have to stop thinking we can fix
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:20.880]  it ourselves we have to trust in god now take action more than ever and it's not that i'm arrogant
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:25.840]  against god i just get temporarily obsessed with all the news and the facts and i get demoralized
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.960]  like how do i beat this but as soon as i open that channel up to god and say god tell me what to do
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:37.200]  it's it's in your hands the comforter comes and i'm totally relaxed and the depression goes away
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:41.040]  and i should start every segment with and i'm starting to listeners that don't believe in god
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:45.760]  if you get mad at me i need jesus i'm i'm in a foxhole there are no atheists here and you're
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:53.360]  damn right brother you're damn right mark i trust in jesus christ and it's gods but god needs us to
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:59.040]  then take the challenge and move forward with the action but if we trust in god to direct us
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:03.600]  and people have to then literally dial in like the spiritual internet and god will lead god and
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:08.400]  direct you but you and look it scares the satanist i know why they run from god it's incredible
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:14.800]  to get grabbed by god and to be in god's hand but you have to do that and it takes some getting
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.200]  used to but at a certain point then you get scared that god's going to turn you loose you know what
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:26.160]  i mean brother i do and i'll tell you this uh i'll tell you alex um i'm in my patrol car
[2:28:26.160 --> 2:28:32.000]  i'm working graveyard shift i pray several times night for god's protection and his protection over
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:37.280]  all of us and i'll tell you i mean i'm not in a big metropolitan area but to see my brothers and
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:46.480]  sisters in uniform getting assaulted getting killed um for a narrative that that that doesn't make
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:52.400]  it's not true of first of all but uh um we're not at beaten minorities all over the place
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:59.280]  we're not like that we we were family men we were fathers were sons we're brothers we we love
[2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:03.120]  there's more than a hundred dead cops in the last two weeks nobody knows their names
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:11.360]  i am i i know and that shows it shows it's all hype i hear you brother mark got you finish your
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:17.040]  point go ahead i was just going to say listen i've been down i lost my partner in 1998 to a
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:22.640]  an illegal aliens have been deported once he was shot and killed um i've been through that i don't
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:27.440]  have any animosity towards hispanic culture i work i actually worked in a predominantly hispanic
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:33.600]  area i love the people but it's very frustrating and it's like they're putting a boot on the back
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:38.880]  of our neck and calling us racists when they don't even know who yeah you shouldn't have to grovel
[2:29:38.880 --> 2:29:44.480]  to the illegal aliens and watch them prey on that community and then when your partner gets killed
[2:29:44.480 --> 2:29:50.480]  he's nameless he means nothing and and exactly you care about good people but the lawlessness is
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:56.560]  dangerous it is but the fact of the matter is we're willing to give our life for people that
[2:29:56.560 --> 2:30:02.480]  don't even know us because we love our communities and we're called and that's why the communists
[2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:08.640]  hate you you know mark they don't want to get rid of the cops they want to be you and the day the
[2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:13.040]  commies become the cops is the day i go to war because they're no longer the police they're now
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:20.320]  the enemy i agree with you listen it's better to die on my feet than on my knees i will never give
[2:30:20.320 --> 2:30:25.120]  capitulate i will never give into the new world order i will never give into the communists
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:30.480]  they're not going to take this country because god's hands on this country and let me and i'm
[2:30:30.480 --> 2:30:35.360]  just going to make it very clear we all need to stand together we need to we need to start getting
[2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:41.440]  out on the streets and and making our voices heard because if we sit back and we do nothing we're
[2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:47.360]  going to lose this country absolutely god bless you i appreciate your call mark i don't think we're
[2:30:47.360 --> 2:30:51.760]  going to lose it completely but we're going to have to have a real war and so i'm actually not
[2:30:51.760 --> 2:30:56.560]  scared of that but just everybody like the games are over parties over folks party hey
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:05.200]  party's over now folks all of our acquiescence our passiveness has summoned the globalist attack

[2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:24.000]  for this uh uh saying they knew was coming this it's not a protest it's a pillage of the american

[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:59.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:10.320]  we're going back to your calls right now
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:19.680]  but here is ran paul talking about the bills are trying to pass the band non-existent lynching
[2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:26.080]  but really it just bans everything here it is but i think it's incredibly important that we get
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:34.080]  this right a woman in new jersey a black woman in new jersey assaulted three jewish women and
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:39.360]  slapped them it was terrible and she uttered racial epithets about these jewish women
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:46.160]  she was charged with third degree misdemeanor assault up to a year in prison which actually
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:51.760]  sounds to be pretty significant for slapping but she was then charged with a hate crime in addition
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:58.080]  to that there would be four years in addition so we do have to get this right if slapping someone
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.880]  and hurling a racial epithet could get you 10 years in prison this is exactly what we've been
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:07.760]  fighting about in criminal justice reform that we set up a system we didn't pay attention to the
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:13.440]  penalties and all the sudden things we didn't intend it happen so we have to be smart about this
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:20.640]  i'm willing to pass the bill today as amended which would simply say not that you even have to
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:27.520]  harm someone you have to attempt to harm them but it has to be an attempt to harm them so all of the
[2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:32.640]  discussion about bruising while trying to lynch someone yes that's attempted murder would be
[2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:39.120]  covered by this bill nothing in the bill would stop hein it would would prevent the prosecution
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:44.800]  of heinous behavior that's what's it intended for what i'm intended is what i'm trying to do is to
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:50.480]  make sure we don't get unintended consequences we've fought the battle against mandatory minimums
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:57.920]  for a decade now because we tie up people in sentencing that makes no sense 10 years for slapping
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:04.800]  someone would be an abomination and it couldn't happen to anyone do we want a black woman who
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:09.600]  slapped three jewish women in new jersey to get 10 years in prison if there was a group of them it's
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:15.280]  now a conspiracy to lynch we have to use some common sense here we should not have a 10-year
[2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:20.640]  prison sentence for anything less than at the very least an attempt to do bodily harm
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:26.800]  but it's the democrats that created mandatory sentences for black people
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:30.560]  now they just switched their target from black people to white people
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:35.440]  and it's all selectively enforced we aren't live broadcasting worldwide
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:37.920]  senior citizen in kansas finish up the point you were making

[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:47.600]  plant that picks up the sun and it's that opening the channel with god that is all the power we need
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:53.920]  to defeat the evil all right it's been holding the longest here that be pastor sam or greg or
[2:41:53.920 --> 2:42:01.760]  bart or alex or lone wolf uh or that be jay let's go to uh let's go to jay and then jeff and then
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:08.640]  lone wolf jay thanks for holding from canada go ahead what should trump do hey alex um looking
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:16.000]  at what the democrats are doing they're right now trying to get their people organized and energized
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:21.440]  i think trump has a great opportunity to tell the average american the law-abiding american
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:27.280]  that listen the police cannot protect you all the time that's why you guys have the second
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:32.480]  amendment that you should learn to know your neighbor or you know build community groups
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:39.920]  and defend your home if trump says that across america people will come together talk to each other
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:44.720]  come out more like you see these videos of people protecting their businesses but if trump endorses
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:50.560]  that he'll have a base that's organized and energized and he should say something along the
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:57.120]  lines of listen the quarantine's over this these mass protests have shown that the quarantine is
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.720]  done come out stand together and if he starts doing that he starts holding rallies again he'll
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:07.440]  turn the tide because people are with him they just don't know their neighbor is with them as well
[2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:12.880]  people are with them inside their minds and around but you know once the masses come out the way
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:20.560]  trump did during the rallies he used to hold he'll win and it's that archtable image of trump with
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:25.680]  the rallies is the main reason they launched covet 19 not just for the force inoculation not just for
[2:43:25.680 --> 2:43:31.760]  the lockdown not just hurt the economy but to end us being able to congregate what you said is 100
[2:43:31.760 --> 2:43:38.400]  percent true trump must engage in bold leadership he must call the whole fraud for what it is and
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:44.320]  defeat it what else should trump do jay but he should trust in the people right the trump strength
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:49.360]  comes from comes from the american people so trump was to say something along the lines of
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:56.000]  your security your future is in your hand you know learn he should have a mass rally the left
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:01.360]  can all have their rallies why isn't he exactly and if he was to do that and people started to
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:06.720]  say hey listen i need to talk to my neighbor people may come and shoot my wife rob my house
[2:44:06.720 --> 2:44:11.600]  destroy my property that i've spent my entire life building you'll come out you'll talk to your
[2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:17.600]  neighbors and tell them listen exercise your second amendment right because trust me in Canada we
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.040]  don't have that and if trump says that that's another narrative of the left that'll shatter
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:26.240]  because they're right he should you're totally right he should lay it all out and say we're
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:30.720]  having our own rally and this is what it's all about jay amazing points god bless you thank
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:38.160]  for the call all right let's go ahead and go to lone wolf in portland welcome lone wolf
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:47.600]  alex uh these jellyfish late rape-like creatures that taken over the city and are now running
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:52.080]  around and telling everyone we need to get rid of the cops so we can all be convicted by communist
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:57.280]  youth brigade that basically run around and tell everyone that you have to prove that you're not
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:02.640]  a rape a racist kind of like Kavanaugh had approved he wasn't a rapist they're now putting
[2:45:02.640 --> 2:45:08.160]  this all in the chop block and claiming that you know if you don't post the uh black square in
[2:45:08.160 --> 2:45:14.400]  solidarity with brainwashing basically standing cult of personality you you're a racist this is
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:20.880]  the most bona fide pure tyranny we've seen since the Soviet Union and now it is cartoonish it is
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:29.600]  ridiculous it is guilty until preventive it is mob rule it is cancer yeah it's horrible with the
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:34.480]  nba getting ready to open all of that i just really feel like the nfo and nba are going full
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:39.520]  communist red terror on us all americans and basically they just start counting all this crap
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:44.800]  back at us have lebron james tell us every day that we're the racist we should feel guilty
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:49.760]  for a guy making 125 000 a week man you sure sound depressed
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:56.800]  you just said it man what a circus that's why people now get it though
[2:45:56.800 --> 2:46:02.880]  so you can't live in coexistence with big corporations they're all sold out by the big
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:07.920]  banks by the Rothschilds they all want world government and so i'll never go to another
[2:46:07.920 --> 2:46:12.240]  basketball game another football game i'm done with all of them and i hope they know that
[2:46:14.240 --> 2:46:18.480]  yeah i had two tickets today and i fell this year and i'm i'm selling my tickets i'm not
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:23.920]  gonna go there and have you know my skin be a badge of dishonor for everyone to stand around
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:28.800]  and act like they're gonna kneel in solidarity with uh basically trying to make me feel guilty
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:34.960]  for loving my country you guys will never give me to kneel to anyone but the lord jesus christ
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:40.400]  and that's it so keep dreaming communist i'm like i'm going to the grave with this one by the way
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:45.840]  they want that they they want the state to be god when you get in god's presence you kneel because
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:51.360]  it's so powerful you want to get on the ground that this is not because the weight's so big
[2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:54.400]  they're this is all evil look at this cult garbage
[2:46:57.040 --> 2:47:01.680]  yeah it's so bad that it's so well but notice nadler doesn't kneel because he runs the whole thing
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:09.200]  should be kneeling his health is so bad that that guy none of these people are just like
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:14.720]  the walking dead basically the weekend at bernie's all over again for all these people they're the

[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:32.800]  thank you lone wolf man you know i told the producer of the show i said we got a lot of great
[2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:40.160]  guests but i'm the captain of this ship and i'm the one that's been getting all the guests
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:46.160]  told us i like talking to these people you got a commitment from me starting tomorrow
[2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:52.560]  so we're taking calls every hour if a guest is on there on 30 minutes or they're a big guest
[2:47:52.560 --> 2:47:58.480]  they're going to take calls we're taking calls four hours a day during my show 11 a.m to 3 p.m
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:04.000]  because the calls are amazing and the zeitgeist is now there's so many incredible people trying
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  to get on air we're going to start the next hour to 15 minutes and jerome slanty takes over before
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:14.640]  the war room starts at 3 p.m with oan shroyer and we're going to talk to everybody here wild
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:19.680]  jeff alex mark bill pastor sam and greg and then
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:25.840]  charles slanty takes over ahead of the war room i hadn't plugged it a because the big
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:30.000]  special was supposed to end it's still up there at 60 off the new sale is tomorrow
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  we sold out of most of the products we were able to
[2:48:34.720 --> 2:48:39.840]  the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:45.920]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:50.400]  depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:57.360]  that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:02.000]  decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.480]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to
[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:13.200]  make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:18.880]  how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:24.560]  they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:29.680]  dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:37.680]  more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:47.760]  globalists have gotten away with their russia gate hoax their ukraine hoax their covet 19 hoax and
[2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:57.360]  now it's the race riot hoax of 2020 we've got to ask ourselves what's coming next well i can tell you
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:03.040]  it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race for
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:09.680]  it's going to be economic collapse china invading taiwan hong kong you name it the globalists are
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:14.880]  attacking on every front that's why now more than ever we have to realize they tried to censor
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:20.480]  info wars off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation they didn't want the
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:27.440]  people's voice to still be on air but thanks to you and our crew we are still on air so let's boost
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:33.840]  that transmission like the batman signal now more than ever info wars dot com lives
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:49.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:59.760]  blood on the streets is up to my ankles
[2:50:59.760 --> 2:51:03.680]  the blood in the streets it's up to my ankles
[2:51:05.440 --> 2:51:07.600]  feet blood in the streets it's up to my knee
[2:51:12.720 --> 2:51:17.280]  all these leftists they keep trying to summon war i don't even know how to put their shoes on
[2:51:18.560 --> 2:51:20.720]  i get into a war it's like slipping a glove on my hand
[2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:27.520]  but i don't want to do it because you're not worth killing
[2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:34.560]  you creatures that want to kill the unborn i'm going to cover it tomorrow but right now
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:42.560]  let's go to your phone calls let's go to wild in wisconsin you're on the air welcome
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:52.880]  what's up alice uh i have a extra spicy chili rilenos for you uh you know how on info wars
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:52:00.160]  and uh rogan on his podcast talk about interdimensional cartographers and stuff
[2:52:00.880 --> 2:52:08.880]  yes do you think uh it's a question for you do you think that there are secret societies
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:19.600]  DARPA intel agency cia dia nsa dni and or even neo proto cacophony groups doing more than mapping
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:28.240]  like heist robberies or even assassinations like what's the map for what about videos oh so you
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:32.240]  think like they're sending in these astronauts in other dimensions they're not just mapping i mean
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:38.160]  they're killing and stealing stuff well that's the ultimate deception though oh you're like you're
[2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:42.240]  you're getting this um you you think how do you know they're not jacking into a false map
[2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:48.800]  because god's not going to let us in my experience jack into the real map return the map return what
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:56.400]  you have stolen the the whole thing's a deception the whole thing just like it's a virtual reality
[2:52:56.400 --> 2:53:02.400]  on the dmt they're only jacking into a false reality where they're given false info and believe
[2:53:02.400 --> 2:53:08.640]  absolutely that they're stealing interdimensional off-world technology but all they're stealing
[2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:15.680]  is the keys to their own instructions answer question yeah yeah uh you know obviously i think
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:23.120]  you know as we both agree god is all powerful so you know the firewall is i think the satanist
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:29.920]  stuff they observe is uh the firewall that they can't get past no they just get the trash yeah
[2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:35.040]  you know they can never go how to how you say the higher levels because you know they they
[2:53:35.040 --> 2:53:40.320]  don't believe in god and like you said they're intoxicated you know if you're intoxicated
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:48.240]  driving a car you're not going to get very far you know let alone trying to reach other levels
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:56.640]  of consciousness well exactly the entities manipulating us are know that we're new compared
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:02.400]  to them because they're like sending us out as probes trying to get through it but they're they're
[2:54:02.400 --> 2:54:09.280]  not the but just because we're young spiritually we think oh they must be advanced no they're just
[2:54:10.640 --> 2:54:13.840]  they're like old criminals trying to con a kid that you know take their first set of crack
[2:54:14.400 --> 2:54:19.680]  and so that's why they want instrumentality they want to control things like a robot
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:24.240]  people want instant success that's not how the universe works it grows very slow
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:29.280]  and so a connection to god takes time and and building things through god takes a lot of time
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:34.400]  and and just a lot of growing like everything grows instead of the globalist they want instant
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:40.320]  one button they push what does yoda say when he's talking to luke skywalker about arthvader
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:46.960]  he goes is the dark side stronger he goes no quicker easier more seductive that's absolutely true
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:55.280]  totally totally and uh i just want to say i'm a big fan and i love all your products as well i've
[2:54:55.280 --> 2:55:02.720]  been taking iodine uh since i was a little child it was recommended to me by uh as you said from

[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:46.960]  you're the life boat on the passenger i've been fighting the globalist for 26 years and the evil
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:52.560]  side of me is just so tired of waiting and i'm so ready for physical war that i'm kind of happy
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:57.520]  about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:01.680]  babies that go along with the new world order you're about to find out just how sick stuff is
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.840]  you know what the average person is still asleep they don't deserve what's happening to them so
[2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:10.800]  i'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and i just want to turn things around but you

[2:56:21.040 --> 2:56:24.720]  realize how important you are when you just tell people about the local radio stations listening
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:28.960]  to local tv stations when you just spread the word about info wars dot com port slash show

[2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:26.640]  thanks for taking my call alex uh two things first point uh in the bible it says that christ was
[2:57:26.640 --> 2:57:31.360]  slain from the foundation of the world before the world existed christ was slain so we got
[2:57:31.360 --> 2:57:37.440]  to understand that that christ is the designed operating system of the planet so to put that out
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:44.560]  second point uh we got to remember that these uh protesters rioters um they're the minority
[2:57:44.560 --> 2:57:48.800]  they're coming up they're puffing themselves out puffing themselves they're all totally super
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:56.640]  charged by the big evil corporations yeah exactly these are the jokes of the planet right so i was
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:58:03.520]  so it shows how bad the cops are they're groveling actually exactly it's mass deception i was thinking
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:10.560]  what would be a zeitgeist uh galvanizing message for info wars and uh and what you put forth every
[2:58:10.560 --> 2:58:18.240]  day and i came up with this i'll run it by you uh picture of the earth from space on a t-shirt
[2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:24.640]  and then a big juicy red pill with info wars on it and it says herd immunity from globalist
[2:58:24.640 --> 2:58:32.320]  tyranny underneath love it or red pill earth yeah it sounds good i love it yeah something like
[2:58:32.320 --> 2:58:37.920]  you know we need that herd immunity we need that uh that tipping point where the good piece
[2:58:37.920 --> 2:58:41.680]  well brother we've reached that that's why the enemy launched these attacks let me tell you
[2:58:41.680 --> 2:58:46.640]  we had reached the tipping point but now this is their full assault to stop it i know i don't
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:50.000]  believe it's going to trigger something even bigger the question is how much death's going to
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:56.960]  happen because revelation is a first you know approximation worst case scenario uh you know
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:59:02.800]  three four billion dead death you know almost death moon blown up all of it which is probably
[2:59:02.800 --> 2:59:07.440]  going to happen but just it's it's kind of a god saying hey this is the potential you better change
[2:59:07.440 --> 2:59:15.600]  the view yeah so um back to the idea i think if you come out with a shirt that people can really
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:22.080]  relate to something that really sums up the moment that we're in and sell it for 20 and 20 cents for
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:28.560]  2020 and give the first shirt to joe rogan and and get some of your friendship capital putting
[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:32.320]  that out there i think you know joe's a good guy and he knows that technically i'm bigger than
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:36.320]  elon musk interview because they suppress the numbers they don't know that and and we'll see
[2:59:36.320 --> 2:59:40.240]  if joe has me back on you know he said he would whatever i the other day it's all in god's hands
[2:59:40.240 --> 2:59:44.160]  but that would be a great thing to do god bless you i appreciate your call jeff i can talk to all
[2:59:44.160 --> 2:59:48.240]  you 20 minutes of peace and we've got to move through these calls now uh let's go to pastor sam
[2:59:48.240 --> 2:59:54.160]  in mexico pastor sam thanks for calling oh hey elix thanks for taking my calls been a while since
[2:59:54.160 --> 3:00:01.440]  we've chatted i wanted to bring to your attention uh that the u.s department of justice is reaching
[3:00:01.440 --> 3:00:06.720]  out to prince andrew with some forceful legal measures i meant to mention that yeah they're
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:11.440]  asking if they want him they want him to come in for questioning well they asked before but he
[3:00:11.440 --> 3:00:14.800]  kind of slammed the door so now they're saying they want him handed over here's the article guys
[3:00:14.800 --> 3:00:21.440]  joe and uh here's what disturbs me is the spokesperson on this was jeffrey s burman the
[3:00:21.440 --> 3:00:26.160]  u.s attorney from the southern district of new york and this is the guy who was at the helm when
[3:00:26.160 --> 3:00:34.880]  ebstein uh hung himself arcon cited himself in prison and this guy has been involved in a lot
[3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:40.640]  of shady stuff you know all these tweets are on my gospel gunslingers thread that talk about
[3:00:41.280 --> 3:00:47.360]  him being a burman the judge overseeing the case being a burman they're being a burman law firm
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:53.520]  in brazil that is reaching out to try to sue china where there's numerous burmans involved
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:57.360]  and you know as journalists sometimes what we have to do is ask the right questions we need
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:01:02.400]  to know who these burmans are and this looks like a just a dirty dirty thing where the u.s swamp
[3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:08.720]  is reaching across the pond to the british royal swamp so we we really as info warriors need to
[3:01:08.720 --> 3:01:15.120]  keep a very close eye on it and one more royal who was recently brought to my attention is you
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:21.040]  know the order of st hubertus is who owns the bohemian grove and the stabola ranch in texas
[3:01:21.040 --> 3:01:27.520]  where anton on scalia was arcon cited and the international protector of that order
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:33.120]  is one carlos the first listed on their website is the king of spain now he's still alive but
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:39.600]  he's abdicated and his son felipe the sixth is the king of spain and every time a conservative
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:46.880]  leader gets elected in a latin american country king felipe the sixth of spain shows up and tries to
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:53.680]  you know congratulate that person and then he he tries to impose spanish rule and european
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:01:59.440]  autocrat rule in the americas again but the last time he did it in urigway he came home to find the
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:05.040]  corona virus was banging on the very door of his talent i hear you pastor sam gray points thank you
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:09.680]  so much for looking to it all let's go ahead now take another call let's talk to alex in new jersey
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:16.240]  alex thanks for holding hey alex alex jackson new jersey how you doing welcome sir what's on
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:23.680]  your mind uh i was looking at that one article that you put out about the uh fbi statistics and
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:30.240]  if you go back and you look at all the statistics going back from 2012 to 2018 i mean blatant i mean
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:36.240]  the uh the number of crimes committed by african americans on whites is double what whites commit
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:40.320]  on african americans uh yeah even though whites are seven times the population yeah so it's
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:45.200]  ten times more likely and again it's still low statistic i'm not against anybody i'm just saying
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:50.960]  the idea that whites are running around murdering blacks in mass is disproved by the fbi's own
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:57.600]  numbers but this is now banned by instagram to show fbi statistics true very true that part is
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:02.080]  there's only one group in this world that really is racist and it goes to the core of their religion
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:08.640]  it's the jew so you better start talking about that because you talk about all this esoteric stuff
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:14.880]  and i you say i don't want uh people running around with all this mysterious crap it's blatantly
[3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:20.000]  wrapped right out in front of us well it is just look who owns everything it's these radical
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:25.680]  Bolshevik jews and that's where communism started alex you know this so you know my issue with this
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:31.440]  is i see all the anti jew stuff online and they're always saying i work for israel it's none of that's
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:36.480]  true and there are some corrupt jews out there that do leftist stuff and i'm against them but
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:40.240]  but they're like nazi collaborators like soros there's always a weird globalist connection
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:44.800]  i'm trying to unify everybody against the new world order i mean you know there are a lot of
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:49.440]  jews that are conservative a lot of jews that are christian i mean i just don't get into
[3:03:49.440 --> 3:03:54.000]  white people are bad or white people are bad or catholics are bad i mean when do you hear me say
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:58.960]  i'll say radical orthodox islam is really bad i don't blame all muslims i think they're the greatest
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:04.880]  victim of islam so my message is consistent a pro-human message the ai's coming in to take over
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:11.760]  humanity and i just see this big pushback like when i'm being censored i see like online good
[3:04:11.760 --> 3:04:17.120]  job you israeli will shut you down and so many of the black lives matter people have an anti-israel
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:22.640]  operating system i appreciate your call alex i just you know this whole thing about going after
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:27.760]  jews all day becomes a fetish and and it's a cover for the adl it's a terrible organization
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:32.800]  and i criticize their anti-free speech very evil but i'm not going to lower myself at their level
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:37.680]  and then and then have them trick me into attacking jews in general so they can go shake jews down
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:43.760]  and say oh look alex joseph's anti-semi it's more sophisticated than that and the precursors of the
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:50.400]  adl wouldn't let jews get out of germany unless they paid the certain jewish uh mafias money
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:56.160]  and dr steve pacenic who's in part jewish he'll tell you those stories here on air
[3:04:56.160 --> 3:05:02.240]  that's the reality there are good people of every stripe and i'm just not gonna engage in
[3:05:02.240 --> 3:05:07.040]  that type of stuff i'm not doing it man i care about black people i care about white people i
[3:05:07.040 --> 3:05:12.080]  clear about russians i clear about mexicans i clear i care about brazilians i care about
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.720]  south africans and i'll criticize the overthrow of the south african government to put communism
[3:05:16.720 --> 3:05:22.480]  into record doesn't mean i defended apartheid it's it's it's about really knowing the subjects
[3:05:22.480 --> 3:05:27.680]  here and i really try to stay out of all the all the jew bashing you know i don't like jerry kushner
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:32.800]  because the policy is in the supporting censorship it's not because he's jewish so i'm against jerry
[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:37.600]  kushner because he keeps getting trump to stand down but not because jerry kushers pro israel
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:43.440]  so i'm out of time i wanted to go to bart and bill and greg and you call me back tomorrow i promise
[3:05:43.440 --> 3:05:46.800]  you'll go to the front of the line i love you and i appreciate you i don't want to cut more into

[3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:16.640]  but i'm not going to get on the level with the mentally ill prosciites out there
[3:06:17.360 --> 3:06:23.280]  and the neocons and get on their level i'm above them i want to unify people like christ did around
[3:06:23.280 --> 3:06:28.480]  a relationship with god or a relationship with the devil my relationships with god pro-life pro-human

[3:07:00.960 --> 3:07:05.280]  states and it's even worse in the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up
[3:07:05.280 --> 3:07:10.400]  and fix it but with the election fraud and the covet nineteen all the wars and the third world

[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:42.400]  in world history with this lockdown you got the markets up now over 300 points as we're speaking
[3:09:42.400 --> 3:09:47.760]  the whole thing is totally rigged it's a game and i'm not making it up this isn't a conspiracy
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:52.640]  theory the federal reserve is spending our money you will have to pay tax pay and money
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:10:00.080]  by the tens of trillions of dollars to buy up corporate junk so it and it's only a very few
[3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:06.160]  stocks that are pushing this up there's no relation to reality here at all look what happened last
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:10.800]  week when the market spiked on the fake unemployment numbers that came out and everybody that
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:16.320]  listens to info wars or reads a trends journal knows that they were fake and they're much worse
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:21.600]  than that and even the labor department admitted that those are only partial numbers you saw gold
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:31.760]  falls from $33 an ounce more 43 today it's back up over $1,700 an ounce it's spiked up well over
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:38.480]  20 bucks gold's telling the story and so too is silver what's also telling the story is oil
[3:10:39.760 --> 3:10:45.920]  the other markets are up today over 300 points but hey how come oil is going down and that's
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:52.000]  after this past weekend opec plus includes russia and a couple of other countries
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:11:00.160]  agreed to cut production keep it going the cutting about 10 million barrels a day
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.880]  so oil is telling the story there is no recovery here
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:10.960]  and then of course there the demonstrations riots and protests going on
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:20.400]  on and very sad morning good you know the gentleman they say 75 year old man that was

[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:55.280]  and these murderous presidents that we have and i'm totally opposed to trump in what he's doing
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:04.720]  with venezuela and iran just to make that clear and i am not in favor of the military moving in
[3:15:04.720 --> 3:15:14.160]  but how about all those lives that american military because their president sent them to go kill

[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:27.120]  the militarized police are just a mirror of the militarized america
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:33.680]  the only thing that's going to get us out of this is a real peace movement
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:40.000]  this is going to be worse than the 1960s this is just begun
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:48.880]  and of course you have the agents provocateurs in there the antifa and others
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:55.280]  that are making peaceful demonstrations worse they did it at the battle of seattle people
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:16:05.360]  forget that they were protesting against look at this look how sad we're becoming
[3:16:07.360 --> 3:16:11.840]  the battle of seattle they brought in pro they brought in agents provocateurs there were hundreds
[3:16:11.840 --> 3:16:18.640]  of thousands of people that were protesting the world trade organization
[3:16:18.640 --> 3:16:28.000]  and i said who's guys dressed up in black that you know in perfect shape bashing windows and

[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:49.280]  what i own over here in kingston new york the most historic four corners in america
[3:16:50.720 --> 3:16:54.960]  were pre-revolutionary war stone buildings on each corner where the seeds of democracy were
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:17:03.440]  sewn if we don't fight for freedom we're going to die for war i'm tired of all this tough talk
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:08.400]  i was asked what's going to happen if somebody breaks into your building
[3:17:08.400 --> 3:17:14.400]  and tries to threaten you oh very simple i'll blow their brains out
[3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:24.080]  i want peace but i'll fight for freedom because i'm a warrior for the prince of peace
[3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:32.560]  and if we don't have peace we're going to die in war civil war next if we don't stop this madness

[3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:56.080]  we're going to call it phase one we're a bunch of government officials yeah official you know what

[3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:29.440]  do you hear the wind blowing around outside
[3:22:31.520 --> 3:22:37.680]  or maybe you're going to keep changing it as the the temperatures change and the wind changes
[3:22:37.680 --> 3:22:45.600]  you're making this stuff up and i gotta tell you most of the strangers that i know
[3:22:46.720 --> 3:22:54.960]  are still believing the bs oh we saved a lot of people oh so many people died not no not so many
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:01.040]  people died and don't tell me about the infection rate because you get it most people recover from
[3:23:01.040 --> 3:23:09.360]  it and those are hard facts i have a sister great system my sister gracing she's doing a nursing
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:18.640]  house they called me up about two and a half weeks ago she's diagnosed positive for covid
[3:23:20.480 --> 3:23:26.160]  and she's out of it she had two strokes you know she's in very sad anyway great sister couldn't
[3:23:26.160 --> 3:23:33.680]  ask her best you know i call her every day and i you know they they don't she didn't know that she
[3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:41.680]  was tested positive and because she had a private room they didn't have to quarantine her then they
[3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:48.480]  called me up last week and the last week and told me she tested negative
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:57.680]  all right not everybody dies soon miss and here are the facts here are the hard facts
[3:23:57.680 --> 3:24:03.600]  the slimy gutless dictators that are running our states
[3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:15.680]  have not demanded that nursing homes release all of the data of who died in every state
[3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:21.840]  in a nursing home these are facts and that low life centers of disease control and others
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:25.840]  oh they were the ones that said i believe oh you don't have to wear a mask you only should wear
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:32.160]  a mask if you're sick of doing you know in a in a in a hospital situation you're working on a patient
[3:24:33.840 --> 3:24:41.360]  yeah then you know when they have to report who died in a nursing home as of may 11th
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:44.720]  hey wait a minute didn't most of the people die in a winter time
[3:24:46.880 --> 3:24:50.080]  yeah we know that but that will just make that number higher
[3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:58.560]  so you will see that the people that should have been quarantined were elderly in nursing homes
[3:24:59.120 --> 3:25:10.640]  elderly with chronic disease obesity diabetics people that smoke a lot and have lung disorders
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:17.040]  because it's a respiratory ailment that knocks you out heart disease and look at the shape of
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:28.880]  americans can't understand why so many are dying but don't talk about obesity salinity i have every
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:34.400]  right that i want to keep eating all i want do what i want you're being disrespectful no i'm not
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:43.280]  but i don't want to pay for your habit knock yourself out we did a trends top trends for 20
[3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:48.240]  i believe it was 18 or 19 america ready to explode
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:25:58.160]  and again that's why you buy a lot of the products on info wars to stay healthy nobody
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:05.360]  talks about building your immune system that's against the law we got to wait till you get vaccinated
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:19.680]  so they locked down our country needlessly they destroyed millions and millions of lives
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:28.960]  the numbers are there the people suffering from depression suicide rates increasing calls coming
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:34.960]  to 9 11 and other emergency numbers of people under distress because a bunch of low life
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:50.000]  low life polytics polytics many sick ticks have sucked a life out of us all of what they've done
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:59.920]  without any scientific data zero story in the toilet paper record i had new york is opening up
[3:26:59.920 --> 3:27:10.560]  a delicate restart has come at last to new york exactly 100 days after it was the first case
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:18.640]  of coronavirus was confirmed new york city which weathered extensive hardship as a center of the
[3:27:18.640 --> 3:27:25.840]  worldwide outbreak was set to take the first tentative step toward reopening its doors monday
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:38.080]  today one of the reasons why the death rate is high here is little Andy Cuomo the arrogant boy
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:46.400]  that everybody all those demo craps love again the boy born on third base and thought he at home
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:52.800]  wrong would be nobody if daddy was in mario you remember what this pandemic was going to be it
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:58.480]  was going to be the hospitals would be able to handle it they brought in those navy emergency
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:09.360]  ships hospital ship they turned parts of the javits center convention center the hospital beds
[3:28:11.680 --> 3:28:19.040]  he took people that had covered and that were ill out of the hospitals and that were elderly
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:24.160]  and putting them in put them in nursing homes got it
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:36.480]  they didn't use that ship they didn't use the javits center all over the state everybody freaking out
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:49.360]  and it never happened and it's like that in every state we are going into the greatest
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:56.560]  depression and as the economy goes down you know what I say when people lose everything and
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:29:03.040]  I'm nothing left to lose they lose it and the losers are going to lose it first robbing looting
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:10.720]  one after another and the more they do it the more they're going to crack down on us
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:17.280]  we need a new direction and it's not with the two political parties
[3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:23.760]  new york city's all boarded up tiffany's boarded up

[3:33:06.800 --> 3:33:13.600]  world and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated
[3:33:13.600 --> 3:33:18.640]  it they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and
[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:24.400]  they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post human technocracy i know
[3:33:24.400 --> 3:33:29.680]  all this sounds insane when i was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's
[3:33:29.680 --> 3:33:34.960]  their operations manual i wish this wasn't the case but they're really our evil psychopaths in
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:40.480]  control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them the people of the world have awakened
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:47.200]  to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries that's why
[3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:52.800]  the new world order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion
[3:33:52.800 --> 3:33:57.920]  is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:04.800]  this is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the third world
[3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:11.200]  will come in and pick up the pieces we must stand against the un the imf the world bank and the e u
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:16.240]  openly saying we fund the police the police have a lot of problems we all have a lot of problems
[3:34:16.240 --> 3:34:20.720]  but this is our government and our local tabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown
[3:34:20.720 --> 3:34:25.920]  this country they're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:30.720]  the globalists believe communist china is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:36.400]  this entire thing the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed

[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:12.880]  the Nobel Peace of crap prize winner folks you know that barack obama who kept folks in us all the
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:28.640]  time he signed the national defense authorization act on new year's eve 2011 that repealed the
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:41.120]  passe comatose act of 1687 that prevented the military from coming in and controlling the nation
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:52.160]  it was a major story and a trans journal the winter editions when the journal used to be a
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:38:00.000]  monthly excuse me accordingly and i went to a monthly and now of course it's a weekly and the
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:07.680]  story that we wrote we called it battlefield america martial law in the usa can it happen it's
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:15.920]  happened america has been decreed a war zone in which military rule can replace civilian rule
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:27.680]  and i'm making this up on december 1st 2011 the united states senate voted 93 to 7 to pass into law
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:36.640]  the national defense authorization act the fiscal year 2012 a law that effectively strips americans
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:42.640]  of their fifth and sixth amendment rights we go on to write about all the details in here
[3:38:42.640 --> 3:38:50.000]  and you got a quote by another piece of lowlife garbage crap like how could any person with a
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:56.400]  brain bigger than a p listen to this piece of crap that the media loves and they keep bringing
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:39:04.320]  him out there going back to then and still now little lindsay graham we go he made a crystal
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:14.400]  clear that quote you ready the statement of authority to detain does apply to american
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:22.800]  citizens and it designates the world as a battlefield including the homeland
[3:39:22.800 --> 3:39:33.760]  and obama signed this in new year's eve when no one was paying attention
[3:39:39.440 --> 3:39:41.200]  no peep from the prostitutes
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:50.880]  which should have been extra extra read all about it with headlines blaring president granted
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:58.800]  dictatorial powers bill of rights repealed barely made the media the new york time self-proclaimed
[3:39:58.800 --> 3:40:06.800]  newspaper of record relegated the story to the bottom you ready for this of page a 31
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:18.560]  under the who gives a damn headline 662 billion military bill is approved by congress
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:25.600]  for the rest of the so-called liberal mainstream media it was mostly silence and
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:33.840]  hardly noticed by its normally vocal lefty chorus who along with the lefties on the street would
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:42.240]  have been shouting screaming and bush bashing had been the former republican president advocating
[3:40:42.240 --> 3:40:52.320]  for this bill of no rights but the spineless gutless tree hugging non-violent key sheeting
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:41:01.920]  intellectually superior liberals still blindly devoted to obama conjured up endless excuses
[3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:11.440]  when he took actions that outbushed archvillain george w bush rather than acknowledge
[3:41:11.440 --> 3:41:19.440]  that the hero in chief was a traitor to the country a liar and betrayer of his stated principles
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:28.720]  the lefties refused to face the facts when the fact is the obama administration threatened
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:36.800]  to veto the legislation if it did not explicitly include language to permit you ready for this
[3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:47.920]  you ready for this the indefinite detention of american citizens as to the general public
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:54.800]  this day of infamy was dominated by breaking news that britney spears got engaged and quote
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:58.560]  judge orders trial for two penn state officials
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:10.480]  you can see where we're going this thing is going down they're dividing us
[3:42:13.840 --> 3:42:22.080]  yes black lives matter disgusting what the cops did all in favor of no police brutality
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:27.520]  yeah you kill somebody if they're threatening if somebody tries to threaten me if i feel my life
[3:42:27.520 --> 3:42:33.920]  is in danger i'll kill them i'll do everything i can to take the cat or kitten out if my life is on
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:42.160]  the line but come on you're resting the guy for fraudulently spending a 20 dollar bill of fake
[3:42:42.160 --> 3:42:53.200]  10 20 dollar bill maybe while you bow down to the jp morgan chases and the wells fargos
[3:42:53.200 --> 3:43:00.480]  and the city groups who steal trillions from us yes sir them
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:10.000]  all lives matter and we have to unite for peace
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:19.280]  this is going to be out of control and the more out of control it gets
[3:43:19.280 --> 3:43:27.520]  the more they're going to crack down militarily and there's that guy over there also another phony
[3:43:28.720 --> 3:43:36.720]  a guy wolf wolf in sheep's clothing puppy dog over there in pennsylvania and all these other
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:44.560]  little clown tough boys and girls you don't have to social distance when you march with them
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:52.560]  but you have to social distance everywhere there is clown boy wolf wolf tommy boy
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:44:00.960]  marching shoulder to shoulder with other people that's okay but if you're going out and having
[3:44:00.960 --> 3:44:07.680]  a good time or a bad time can't go to a funeral with x amount of people no weddings allowed
[3:44:07.680 --> 3:44:14.800]  then they'll send the cops in maybe they beat you up and put you down but when the slimmers do it

[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:33.920]  is the time for those brush fires of freedom and peace
