[00:20.840 --> 00:33.720]  it's Thursday the 26th day of February 2015 I'm on exchange your host another
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.080]  incredibly jam-packed transmission lined up for you as the world accelerates
[00:39.080 --> 00:47.160]  into destabilization by design Saudi Arabia says it might help Israel attack
[00:47.160 --> 00:55.840]  Iranian nuclear sites unbelievable headline its official NSA spying is
[00:55.840 --> 01:05.080]  hurting the US tech economy that's a ZD net news former FBI assistant
[01:05.080 --> 01:12.360]  director says to help keep budgets high we must quote keep fear alive the
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.880]  comments come one hour six minutes into the video full-body transplants will be
[01:17.880 --> 01:24.560]  possible within two years this is controversial surgeon Obama tells ICE
[01:24.560 --> 01:29.360]  officers that's board patrol consequences for ICE officials who don't follow
[01:29.360 --> 01:34.920]  executive amnesty you follow my illegal orders not to stop drunk drivers to let
[01:34.920 --> 01:38.760]  illegals go free let them be above the law or I will have your butt fire and I
[01:38.760 --> 01:44.960]  will grab your pension so you can't sit there because I see people in these
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.760]  videos bashing the border patrol but why don't you do your job why don't you
[01:49.760 --> 01:54.920]  arrest some people why don't you they've been ordered to stand down now quite
[01:54.920 --> 01:58.360]  frankly they're complicit when they follow their orders and are somewhat
[01:58.360 --> 02:02.160]  guilty but in the scheme of being guilty Obama and the globalist are a hundred
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.760]  percent they're about five percent guilty we're more guilty than the board
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.760]  patrol they have their jobs they have their pensions they have their lives
[02:10.760 --> 02:15.680]  they've risked their lives and what quite frankly is the hellish job and now we
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.440]  just sit here mad that they're not doing their job and they've been ordered to
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.960]  we're letting the trader-in-chief carry out this North American Union plan so
[02:24.960 --> 02:30.320]  I'm already ranting it's just that I guess as you get older you just realize
[02:30.320 --> 02:34.480]  that it's easy to sit around and blame people and and folks always love to seem
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.720]  to blame the low-level people because then you know it's politically correct
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.040]  and nobody gets mad at you instead of blaming ourselves and blaming the
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.600]  people at the top of the pyramid who are really guilty I'm just gonna say that
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.520]  again they're saying brace for imminent terror attack any minute the shopping
[02:51.520 --> 02:56.440]  malls aren't safe to go to you Jay Johnson says on Face the Nation is it
[02:56.440 --> 03:00.640]  safe to go to Mall of America you need to be very concerned you do watch you
[03:00.640 --> 03:06.480]  need to be really careful what I mean statistically let's say you work at the
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.840]  mall of America and there was a terror attack what one out of 500 you're gonna
[03:11.840 --> 03:15.360]  get shot there's a better chance you're gonna down a car wreck this year than
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.840]  that if you work there then what maybe one out of 500 chances there's gonna be a
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.560]  terror attack you add those two together and I'm just throwing out numbers here
[03:24.560 --> 03:31.400]  as an example it's not scientific very low probability you got a better chance
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.960]  of a deer jumping out in front of your car and coming through the windshield and
[03:35.960 --> 03:41.640]  killing you think it's like 260 something people in the World Almanac last time I
[03:41.640 --> 03:48.320]  read it think in 2013 died of deer are we having checkpoints for the phantom
[03:48.320 --> 03:52.680]  deer are we having TSA out there to you know have checkpoints to stop the deer
[03:52.680 --> 03:56.800]  from jumping in front of us no there's a sign they put a sign up when they've
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.720]  had a bunch of wrecks that's how that's chosen in most states they put them on
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.440]  deer trails and they say hey look out for elk look out for moose look out for
[04:05.440 --> 04:11.800]  whitetail look out for mule look out for children if it's in a city at a
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.680]  crosswalk you know I mean there's no way to keep you completely safe and I know
[04:16.680 --> 04:19.640]  our listeners know that but the globalists put not this idea that we're
[04:19.640 --> 04:24.440]  doing all this keep you safe it's a load of bull our borders are only there to
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.280]  stop cowboys shipping drugs in that the big banks aren't actually bringing in
[04:28.280 --> 04:34.000]  themselves that's it but if you're an illegal they're there and they're wide
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.400]  open and that's just not fair I mean you get arrested in Mexico if you're an
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.680]  illegal but not here more and more they I'm digressing socialist architect

[08:18.360 --> 08:31.840]  resistance it's Alex Jones
[08:31.840 --> 08:37.480]  because he was British and there was supposed to be four men in Syria who
[08:37.480 --> 08:41.880]  were given that nickname because of the Beatles as I said the BBC understands
[08:41.880 --> 08:48.000]  he is Mohammed Mwazi what we understand about him and there is little we don't
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.200]  know full details at the moment but that he was in some way on the radar of the
[08:52.200 --> 08:57.560]  police and security service in the UK before he went to Syria we believe that
[08:57.560 --> 09:03.120]  he is linked to a man who was at some stage on a control order that's those
[09:03.120 --> 09:07.480]  who are suspected of terrorist activities but haven't been through a
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.680]  court case and potentially linked to a man who was on a control order linked to
[09:12.680 --> 09:17.880]  the Al Shabab network in Somalia he is linked to people who traveled out to
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.440]  Kenya and then on to Somalia British people who then brought back to the UK
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.920]  and questioned welcome ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here live in
[09:26.920 --> 09:32.680]  almost every case the leadership of Al Qaeda ISIS Boko Haram all these
[09:32.680 --> 09:39.600]  different groups are British intelligence time and time again I had the
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.040]  former top Justice Department official over counterterrorism on Loftus John
[09:44.040 --> 09:48.240]  Loftus about five years ago as I saw him on Fox News we played the clip
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.760]  exposing that the leader of the 7-7 bombings in London of the subway in the
[09:53.760 --> 10:01.520]  bus remember that in 2005 it came out in documents was MI6 their CIA and was
[10:01.520 --> 10:06.960]  being protected going in and out of the country and it's the same story over and
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.520]  over again remember they caught British SAS special forces what our Delta
[10:13.520 --> 10:21.760]  forces modeled after dressed up like Wahhabist attacking Shiite shrines in
[10:21.760 --> 10:28.120]  2006 in Iraq it was even in the London Guardian and when the Iraqi police that
[10:28.120 --> 10:31.280]  our military trained and British military trained you know the good guys
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.160]  supposedly arrested them took their mask and beards off all their weapons that
[10:36.160 --> 10:41.880]  they had and put it on television released the photos they had a whole
[10:41.880 --> 10:47.320]  bunch of tanks and the British Army attack the barracks and the police
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.520]  station blow it up kill a bunch of people British troops got killed and it
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.800]  was film footage of British troops on fire on top tanks it was a major skirmish
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.920]  to get them out of the jail and cover up their identities I can go on for like
[11:03.920 --> 11:09.200]  five hours it's just that so many times the people getting the Shiites and
[11:09.200 --> 11:13.240]  Sunnis to kill each other or Western intelligence you got Adam Gadan the
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.020]  grandson of the former head of the Anti-Defamation League arrested
[11:18.020 --> 11:23.080]  repeatedly in California going to mosque and beating up Muslims that's how much
[11:23.080 --> 11:28.640]  he hated Muslims joining Al Qaeda growing a beard and becoming number two
[11:28.640 --> 11:37.960]  some argue number one Adam Gadan former named Perlman leading Al Qaeda I mean
[11:37.960 --> 11:44.600]  who believes that Al Qaeda is going to follow a Jew it's totally fake are there
[11:44.600 --> 11:48.520]  real jihadis are there real Wahhabist terror grips being fun about Saudi
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.680]  Arabia to invade Syria and other areas absolutely but the when you see even
[11:53.680 --> 11:56.880]  Fox News had to come out and say you know this is fake video the State
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.120]  Department went yeah it is two weeks ago of the them walking the people to be
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.800]  executed by the beach and they're seven foot five or whatever every one of the
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.480]  Al Qaeda people is is over seven feet tall it's just manipulated I mean we
[12:12.480 --> 12:16.000]  could make videos like this I could look at the beheadings and the mass
[12:16.000 --> 12:23.080]  burnings and tell you as a video person that's worked with for 22 years and who
[12:23.080 --> 12:26.680]  we got green screens you know we do some fun pieces around here but it's
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.200]  obviously fake when I'm up there in a blue throne as Cobra commander but it
[12:31.200 --> 12:35.000]  looks like I'm at the White House in a throne I mean it would fool a child you
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.800]  can see that it's fake though the eye picks it up these are all green screen
[12:41.800 --> 12:47.880]  boys and girls they were made in some Hollywood lot now separately you got
[12:47.880 --> 12:51.520]  thousands of Christians getting killed every month churches getting blown up
[12:51.520 --> 12:57.720]  everywhere that'll be in a military news website that will be in a foreign news
[12:57.720 --> 13:02.000]  site that will be in a local site that'll be in foreign papers but the real
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.920]  stuff and let me tell you we've played the videos of Christians being taken to
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.560]  the top of an eight-story building and thrown off one after another and they
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.000]  censor our YouTube account the news and everybody else is allowed to put out the
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.880]  beheadings and the burnings but we show you real stuff real stuff and it's shut
[13:23.880 --> 13:32.640]  down okay so there's plenty of real radical jihadi garbage there's plenty of
[13:32.640 --> 13:39.040]  real footage of them killing people and they are killing people mainly Christians
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.640]  and Al-Awaite Muslims and other minority groups and Kurds but that's not
[13:44.640 --> 13:48.440]  what's being shown here in the United States and it's part of a propaganda
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.720]  operation last night in fact I see if you can find it it showed a new ISIS
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.720]  the women of ISIS video I was I was watching I think CNN they showed a clip
[13:57.720 --> 14:04.920]  of it and it looked like they were wearing designer Versace and it was like
[14:04.920 --> 14:08.480]  beautiful women and it was how the beautiful women of the West are going
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.800]  and joining it this is meant to purely make everybody get jealous and go how
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.560]  dare them be getting arcade up and look likes how dare them be getting our
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.960]  women we gotta go over there and blow them up and then it will be Syria that's
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.400]  attacked and Assad's taken down and the very jihadis we claim we're fighting
[14:25.400 --> 14:29.120]  that are put in power and notice that's all being announced on the news now I
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.360]  saw McCain yesterday calling for attacking Russia basically and comparing
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.920]  them to the Nazis and then later when I went to the full tape of it they were
[14:38.920 --> 14:43.320]  talking about we've got to go and take Assad out because Assad has created the
[14:43.320 --> 14:47.160]  vacuum that's allowed al-Qaeda and ISIS to be there when the West started the
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.320]  whole thing but when they know the public is politically and geopolitically
[14:51.320 --> 14:57.720]  and economically illiterate and the public on average is illiterate when it
[14:57.720 --> 15:00.720]  comes how the world works they know about the football scores they know
[15:00.720 --> 15:06.520]  about what Babe Ruth hit in 1931 they know how to act cool they know how to
[15:06.520 --> 15:11.240]  jack their trucks up they know how to get the right dear rifle women know how
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.080]  to go get their lips injected with you know with collagen they know how to act
[15:15.080 --> 15:19.600]  cool to their girlfriends but they don't know about the three branches of
[15:19.600 --> 15:22.960]  government they don't know about bait and switch stuff like this net
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.760]  neutrality garbage they don't know about dirty tricks they don't know about
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.760]  pump and dump they don't know about the clergy response teams they don't know
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.200]  about the panopticon surveillance grid that's in place they don't know how
[15:35.200 --> 15:39.000]  it's used to corner the market and shut down competition that's in the news
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.840]  today I'm telling you forever the NSA is about giving select economic intel not
[15:43.840 --> 15:49.400]  to defeat our economic enemies overseas if you believe in that but to shut down
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.400]  us independent industry or any other industry that's not part of the inner
[15:54.400 --> 16:00.920]  cabal that is bank owned mega corporations there's the six now five
[16:00.920 --> 16:04.880]  global banks that issue the currency and credit worldwide that are buying up the
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.600]  entire economy and they've got the NSA type systems globally spying on
[16:09.600 --> 16:14.120]  everyone jacking that intel in to corner the markets and consolidate and take
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.680]  full control and know every decision that's being made that's why under
[16:17.680 --> 16:21.640]  infraguard and similar systems in Europe in the United States all major
[16:21.640 --> 16:27.520]  Fortune 500 CEOs who opt in and if you don't opt in they come after you with
[16:27.520 --> 16:34.880]  economic warfare and regulators you then get a heads-up display of Intel that's
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.360]  been thinly washed where it just gives you recommendations directives on where
[16:40.360 --> 16:45.880]  to invest what to do what competition is going to be up to and that's the next
[16:45.880 --> 16:50.880]  big next big shoot a drop I can tell you that's the next thing that Snowden is
[16:50.880 --> 16:57.080]  going to be releasing is that if they let them because there's a lot of behind
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.600]  the scene stuff going on he's a libertarian reportedly and he said
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.000]  libertarianism will sweep the world and all these crony capitalists are going to
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.480]  be brought down what he's talking about is what will bring down the quote US
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.080]  government with lawsuits and the rest of it is the torturous interference is the
[17:14.080 --> 17:20.480]  economic espionage is the criminal racketeering of the Fortune 100 across
[17:20.480 --> 17:27.040]  the board and much of the Fortune 500 are globally tied in and to get access to
[17:27.040 --> 17:32.360]  this data you've got to swear then to follow agenda directives of the higher
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.600]  level infraguard that's the FBI operation they have even higher level

[17:55.680 --> 18:00.320]  in just like the Capitol has a room that has that Warren Buffett the day before
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.400]  9-11 called over a hundred top CEOs it was a hundred and forty six of them
[18:04.400 --> 18:09.600]  reported on in the Omaha newspaper and had them an off at Air Force Base in a
[18:09.600 --> 18:16.200]  secret meeting that started at 8 a.m. central time that day and they had big
[18:16.200 --> 18:23.840]  screen TVs in there of the towers being hit with top generals in the meeting so
[18:23.840 --> 18:27.600]  you understand that's a little window into how things really work you're told

[18:56.440 --> 19:01.360]  Latin America Miami you name it 10 years to write Scarface Scarface is
[19:01.360 --> 19:06.080]  basically real folks it's an allegory of the world with with real characters
[19:06.080 --> 19:11.240]  whose names have been changed to protect the innocent as they would say and in
[19:11.240 --> 19:16.120]  that the corrupt cop goes in he says you're going to pay us 20 30 percent
[19:16.120 --> 19:18.840]  everything you make you know writes the number on the paper and he goes but

[23:55.440 --> 24:17.120]  back
[24:17.120 --> 24:28.640]  It's so frustrating to know that since 1947 the private corporations have been able to
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.600]  take over our government and have total secrecy, total anonymity, diplomatic immunity, get
[24:33.600 --> 24:41.920]  out of jail free cards, licensed to kill basically, with the National Security Act of 1947.
[24:41.920 --> 24:48.160]  And then you learn that England, since about the 1870s, had a similar National Security
[24:48.160 --> 24:57.560]  Act to establish officially new systems for its already huge intelligence apparatus, one
[24:57.560 --> 25:01.040]  of the best in the world.
[25:01.040 --> 25:04.600]  And it's taken over their parliament, it's taken over their government, and the same
[25:04.600 --> 25:09.360]  system has now taken over here.
[25:09.360 --> 25:17.080]  The House, 1922, established in New York City, council on farm relations by Anglophiles,
[25:17.080 --> 25:24.480]  when you see Gilligan's Island and post some howl of the thud, oh, Buffy, oh, Mrs. Howe.
[25:24.480 --> 25:29.080]  When you hear people talk like that, that was in fashion since the end of the Civil
[25:29.080 --> 25:36.320]  War, right through to today, that East Coast elites speak with an affected quasi-British
[25:36.320 --> 25:43.400]  accent known as an Atlantic accent.
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.120]  And then that kind of degenerated into the fake speech of what you'd think of as a judge's
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.120]  schmales.
[25:49.120 --> 25:53.920]  And what I'm getting at here is, this is the fraudulent aristocracy that is in control
[25:53.920 --> 26:01.680]  with Rothschild money and Rothschild banks backing it, because the Rothschilds in 1913
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.840]  were able to establish the private run for private reserve and a hundred years previous.
[26:06.840 --> 26:14.000]  It seems like a long time ago, but it was 98 years previous, were able to do the same
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.960]  thing with the Bank of England in what is now the United Kingdom today.
[26:19.960 --> 26:26.240]  So to understand all the things that are happening and the big picture, out of all this news
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.320]  I've got in front of me in the stack, they're telling us brace for terror attacks, give
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.080]  all your rights up, the terrorists are going to hit you any minute, the only way to protect
[26:35.080 --> 26:42.960]  yourself is to give your rights up while the borders stay wide open.
[26:42.960 --> 26:54.040]  And then meanwhile, it's coming out in the news, and I'm going to cover this, that the
[26:54.040 --> 27:02.800]  people running ISIS are connected to British intelligence.
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.920]  What a surprise that is.
[27:07.920 --> 27:10.200]  What a surprise that is.
[27:10.200 --> 27:16.640]  And I just start thinking back as I started the show last segment, to all the times it
[27:16.640 --> 27:19.480]  turns out being British intelligence.
[27:19.480 --> 27:21.320]  People say, well, what is it?
[27:21.320 --> 27:26.800]  Is it a Jewish conspiracy, is it a Masonic conspiracy, is it a Vatican conspiracy, is
[27:26.800 --> 27:32.480]  it a British conspiracy, is it a Islamic conspiracy?
[27:32.480 --> 27:40.440]  No, it's the screw job conspiracy of secret intelligence agencies above the law, tied
[27:40.440 --> 27:50.280]  in with corporations, now with a giant Panopticon, almost omnipresent spy grid, feeding everybody's
[27:50.280 --> 28:00.040]  economic, cultural, and spiritual data, everything we do back to them to giant deep blue Watson
[28:00.040 --> 28:08.120]  IBM devil computers to understand the mind of the group politic, to then twist and manipulate
[28:08.120 --> 28:10.680]  and guide it.
[28:10.680 --> 28:17.400]  And now the unseen hand is not unseen, and it's a thousand times bigger in its sophistication
[28:17.400 --> 28:19.640]  than it was a hundred years ago.
[28:19.640 --> 28:25.240]  Only ten thousand times, there's no way to quantify the leap in all this, but it's the
[28:25.240 --> 28:33.560]  same humans, the same corrupted humans, the same family lines that are now controlling
[28:33.560 --> 28:37.840]  this awesome power.
[28:37.840 --> 28:45.040]  So what is going to come out of that?
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.680]  All I'm trying to do is cause a debate about this, and for us to really get serious, and
[28:50.680 --> 28:56.240]  it's not like I'm saying let's do a bunch of work, it's awesome to sit back and really
[28:56.240 --> 29:00.880]  figure out what's going on in the world, because then you're living in a super exciting science
[29:00.880 --> 29:03.280]  fiction movie.
[29:03.280 --> 29:08.160]  You're not living in dancing with the stars in the NHL and the NFL, and believe me, I
[29:08.160 --> 29:14.200]  like dancing with the stars, beautiful women, I love the human body and the dancing, I love
[29:14.200 --> 29:16.840]  the NHL, I love the NFL.
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.720]  But compared to a world scientific government jacking the water and food, and we can see
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.920]  the population already getting sick and dying, and knowing, I mean, that's just epic, that's
[29:27.920 --> 29:31.040]  just one facet, so sorry.
[29:31.040 --> 29:36.080]  I did watch Dancing with the Stars when I was on the elliptical yesterday.
[29:36.080 --> 29:42.760]  Watch this, it was on TV, they had like a finalist thing, and I was admiring the models
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.440]  and things, I mean, I get it, we're supposed to have a good time sometimes, but I'm just
[29:47.440 --> 29:49.640]  saying, it's all put up for the distraction.
[29:49.640 --> 29:58.960]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.960 --> 30:05.080]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day, big heart shaped boxes filled with delicious
[30:05.080 --> 30:06.080]  candy.
[30:06.080 --> 30:10.400]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day, and instead made it about human liberty
[30:10.400 --> 30:11.840]  and individual empowerment.
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.280]  I'm all about human potential, I'm all about the individual being empowered, the establishment
[30:16.280 --> 30:17.280]  is the opposite.
[30:17.280 --> 30:21.240]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.240]  garbage.
[30:22.240 --> 30:26.520]  Info Wars is striking back in the month of February, with Human Empowerment Month.

[33:43.760 --> 33:48.080]  I'm honored to talk about one of the main leaders out there in California and other
[33:48.080 --> 33:54.720]  areas in the country leading the health revolution, he's it, and I think that looks like a CIA
[33:54.720 --> 33:55.720]  hitman.
[33:55.720 --> 34:00.680]  He was like a GQ model or something and as soon as he was in there wearing, I tell you,
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.880]  he's something else, and he's got a lot to talk about today about how we're winning the

[34:24.880 --> 34:31.240]  Now the British government is in the Daily Mail, calls GM foods something else to ease
[34:31.240 --> 34:36.840]  public fears, say MPs, members of parliament, report says label is lightning rod for fears
[34:36.840 --> 34:38.280]  of designer crops.
[34:38.280 --> 34:44.040]  So now they don't just want to have to label, they want to pass a law where you can't label
[34:44.040 --> 34:48.600]  and say organic in the UK because no one will buy it over there.
[34:48.600 --> 34:52.240]  They're voting with their dollars, they're voting with their free will choice, one of
[34:52.240 --> 34:56.680]  the last freedoms they have in the UK, and so now the government wants to stop calling
[34:56.680 --> 35:07.160]  it GMO, unbelievable, unbelievable, so we're going to talk about this and more with Dr.
[35:07.160 --> 35:14.360]  Billy DeMoss coming up, you can find up the tales at infowars.com forward slash Cal Jam.
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.480]  And by the way, you go ahead and tell Anthony because he's in there in charge of our web
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.400]  marketing as a fabulous job on top of writing news articles, I'll just let you know Anthony
[35:22.400 --> 35:26.240]  has been doing that for over a year for us, done a great job.
[35:26.240 --> 35:32.760]  Anthony has it, we're all the banners in the next hour, we'll go to Cal Jam, well let's
[35:32.760 --> 35:36.600]  just have him go to that now and you can find some specials and things there.
[35:36.600 --> 35:41.880]  The first goes to doctors and health nutritionists and others, it's already almost sold out when
[35:41.880 --> 35:47.200]  they open up to the public, I think it holds 5,000 people, but they can open up another
[35:47.200 --> 35:54.160]  area to about 6,000, they've got some reserved in the select areas in the first few rows,
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.040]  so there's a few tickets in each area left, that's a classic sales tactic, oh hey, it's
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.800]  going to sell out better by your tickets if you're on the West Coast, no, it does sell
[36:02.800 --> 36:06.880]  out every year, you can go to the website and see the videos, it may sell out in a matter
[36:06.880 --> 36:13.720]  of days, today is the day that they start selling the tickets for Cal Jam, so infowars.com
[36:13.720 --> 36:19.360]  forward slash Cal Jam, that's where you link through infowars.com, prisonplotter.com, let's
[36:19.360 --> 36:25.920]  flip the banners now for the next hour and a half to 100% to this event where I am the
[36:25.920 --> 36:26.920]  keynote speaker.
[36:26.920 --> 36:29.440]  You know they asked me to speak this year and I said you know I haven't been speaking
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.000]  enough, I've been promising to start doing some more traveling and speaking, and I said
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.320]  I'll do it, then I'll go to their website last week and I'm the featured speaker, so
[36:37.320 --> 36:43.560]  I didn't realize that, so I am the featured speaker and if you want to do that go to infowars.com
[36:43.560 --> 36:49.960]  forward slash Cal Jam or just go to infowars.com and all the banners link through if you want
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.800]  to get tickets, and you know I've had events in Southern California before and we had to
[36:54.800 --> 37:01.280]  turn away over 1,000 people at my LA event, over 1,000 people and people were really upset
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.960]  with me, I'm sorry, I mean we had to turn away probably 500 people after we booked a
[37:06.960 --> 37:14.000]  second show with 1,000 people at each event in Santa Cruz and the tickets were very affordable
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.680]  as well as one reason, but every event I've basically ever had has been sold out, there's
[37:18.680 --> 37:23.840]  been a few where I didn't promote it and it was you know just 60-70% full, but if I promote
[37:23.840 --> 37:29.040]  something it always sells out, plus Cal Jam always sells out, so it's got a lot of great
[37:29.040 --> 37:34.160]  music, a lot of great speakers, the cutting edge of what's happening, you know alternative
[37:34.160 --> 37:37.600]  health, that's an event I've always wanted to go to, I've heard so much about it, the
[37:37.600 --> 37:44.160]  amazing huge theater that it's in that holds again, they can expand it out total to 7,000,
[37:44.160 --> 37:47.880]  they're only going to expand it up to 6,000, that's what I was told, so there's basically
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.820]  1,000 tickets left and those will sell out today's the day they open it up, again insiders
[37:53.820 --> 37:58.600]  that are already into the health field get the first dibs to get in the tickets last
[37:58.600 --> 38:02.160]  week and then they hold some to the general public, that's why it's such a great event
[38:02.160 --> 38:11.160]  to be at is that these people are just so healthy, I mean they look like Barbie dolls
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.640]  or something or Ken dolls, but it's what healthy lifestyles actually do for you and I haven't
[38:16.640 --> 38:22.200]  gotten there yet but I've lost 40 plus pounds ladies and gentlemen, 40 plus pounds in fact
[38:22.200 --> 38:26.040]  soon I'm going to show the photos of myself in the last few months losing another 10 pounds
[38:26.040 --> 38:31.640]  or so and I've got a tiny bit of fat on my stomach and it's gone, I just got a big round
[38:31.640 --> 38:38.560]  head but my body, I mean it's there, I'm down to like 6, 7% body fat now and I used to be
[38:38.560 --> 38:46.560]  like 25% body fat, so just vitamins, minerals, the same amount of exercise, cutting back
[38:46.560 --> 38:50.640]  some of the crap food I was eating, not a purist like these folks but I'm trying, it
[38:50.640 --> 38:53.700]  has been life changing and this is how we defeat the globalists, I didn't mean to go
[38:53.700 --> 38:57.720]  off into a whole jag talking about this, that's in the second hour, then we'll have open
[38:57.720 --> 39:04.720]  phones in the third hour and cover some other major news, Obama to ban bullets by executive
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.800]  action threatens top selling AR-15 rifle, that just broke at DrudgeReport.com, red linked,
[39:11.800 --> 39:17.480]  will you please print this for me, this is unbelievable, we've got to get this article
[39:17.480 --> 39:22.120]  up on infowars.com right now and he promised that he would try to restrict bullets and
[39:22.120 --> 39:27.200]  guns with executive action and this is the line in the sand folks, opening our borders
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.840]  by executive action, cutting off our power plants by executive action and now as promised
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.120]  President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control in the nation, targeting
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.720]  the top selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic with a ban on one
[39:43.720 --> 39:47.800]  of the most used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters and here's the deal, they'll
[39:47.800 --> 39:55.080]  go after one rifle and one type of bullet first, one type of projectile and then when
[39:55.080 --> 40:00.560]  they've got that, it's everything, it'll be all semi-autos, down your semi-auto bird
[40:00.560 --> 40:07.080]  shot gun and then it'll be bolt action and it'll be single shot, this is un, and they've
[40:07.080 --> 40:12.640]  got the link directly to the NRA, oh my gosh, get this up on infowars.com, they're going
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.640]  to executive tyrannical action, he couldn't pass the gun restrictions so he's doing it
[40:16.640 --> 40:22.680]  as a dictator and if tyranny came when anybody noticed, I mean this is it, the Bureau of
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.760]  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives this month revealed that it's proposing to
[40:26.760 --> 40:35.960]  put a ban on 5.56 ammo, oh my gosh, that's the most popular ammo in America now, I've
[40:35.960 --> 40:42.520]  got like five guns that shoot that, unbelievable, I've got the evil Bushmaster, I've got the
[40:42.520 --> 40:49.440]  evil Stag Arms, in fact we go to Weldon and have him bring me one of my AR-15s in here
[40:49.440 --> 40:55.800]  please, one of my M4s, immediately driving up the price of the bullets and prompting
[40:55.800 --> 41:00.280]  retailers including the huge Outdoors Company Cabela's, see where is my news division, I'm
[41:00.280 --> 41:04.960]  not mad at anybody but I'm so focused on the internet power grab, the internet kill switch,
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.840]  this has been out for days and I didn't know about this and drugs just learned of this,
[41:09.840 --> 41:15.440]  I know Jacari was covering gun stuff last night, we had Michael Cargill on last night
[41:15.440 --> 41:20.800]  and actually if they can pull it up on 9, as soon as I heard you Jacari, I knew I was
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.680]  good, good job, fill me in, what's going on, there it is, gun owners agree, ATF wants to
[41:25.680 --> 41:31.080]  re-regulate types of ammunition and they're trying to spin it as you know it's a great
[41:31.080 --> 41:36.880]  deal, you'll have more bullets to go out shooting with your AR-15 but as I was talking to Cargill
[41:36.880 --> 41:40.400]  last night we both agreed that if you let them in to change this one thing then they
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.120]  can just keep changing whatever they felt like changing, so it could go all the way
[41:44.120 --> 41:45.120]  down the line.
[41:45.120 --> 41:47.600]  Well that's like they say they're going to protect the internet neutrality by having
[41:47.600 --> 41:51.120]  the FCC take over the internet and restrict it, we need to change your video headline
[41:51.120 --> 41:57.200]  to Obama to ban bullets by executive action, that's what this really is, Washington Examiner,
[41:57.200 --> 42:01.840]  it's already driving up the price, Wednesday night representative Bob Goodlot, the Republican
[42:01.840 --> 42:07.000]  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee stepped in with a critical letter to the Bureau demanding
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.320]  and explaining the surprise and abrupt bullet ban, why are they calling it a bullet ban,
[42:12.320 --> 42:14.480]  what specifically is happening Jacari?
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.520]  Well what they're doing Alex is with this particular thing, the ATF, like I was saying
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.240]  they're saying that all it's going to be is something for the hunters so you can have
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.440]  more ammunition but you know as myself and Cargill were pointing out that once you let
[42:27.440 --> 42:31.720]  them in, you let the camel put its nose under the tent then they can change this, they can
[42:31.720 --> 42:35.520]  change that, it's the slippery slope and a lot of people, a lot of the gun owners I've
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.360]  seen don't want to play this game.
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.520]  Well give me a wide shot in there because I've had enough of this, I've had enough,
[42:41.520 --> 42:47.160]  let me explain something for the New World Order okay, you're not getting our guns, 1776
[42:47.160 --> 42:52.000]  started when you tried to get them you bastards and as Charlton Heston famously said, from
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.640]  my cold dead hand you sons of bitches, you got that, you're not getting our firearms,
[42:58.640 --> 43:04.280]  do you understand, this far and no further with your damn dictatorship, I'm sick of
[43:04.280 --> 43:08.840]  it, excuse me let me plug back in so I can hear Jacari, I mean folks they are pushing
[43:08.840 --> 43:14.080]  on every front, totally open borders, selling us out to world government, trying to take
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.840]  over the internet, I mean they are moving on every single stinking front, what do you
[43:18.840 --> 43:20.160]  say to this Jacari?
[43:20.160 --> 43:23.840]  And you also know Alex you know this but some of our viewers may not, they've tried to
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.400]  ban you know AK-47s, other type of things and every time they do this there's a massive
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.160]  gun sale, I talked to Karga last night he said when they came through with the UN sanctions
[43:32.160 --> 43:37.920]  on the AK-47s you know massive splurge and ammunition, all these things always go up
[43:37.920 --> 43:42.560]  you know right after Sandy Hook they wanted to ban the AR-15 rifle, everybody goes out
[43:42.560 --> 43:47.480]  and buys the AR-15 rifle and I see you got one there as well.
[43:47.480 --> 43:51.560]  So it's just more of the same, they keep trying to do the same things, if they can't
[43:51.560 --> 43:55.520]  just go door to door and everybody says they've never gone door to door, Hurricane Katrina
[43:55.520 --> 43:59.200]  they went door to door taking people's firearms, they realized that wasn't the best way to go
[43:59.200 --> 44:03.480]  about it, so now they're trying with these executive actions, trying to ban the ammunition,
[44:03.480 --> 44:08.680]  trying to do all these other things to take your firearms away.
[44:08.680 --> 44:14.480]  And they want to restrict the 223, unbelievable by executive action, which sets the precedent
[44:14.480 --> 44:19.080]  that they can do everything by executive action, we have a Congress and we have a Bill of Rights
[44:19.080 --> 44:24.480]  and Constitution, not even the Congress can touch the Bill of Rights ladies and gentlemen.
[44:24.480 --> 44:29.120]  Jacarie, I didn't mean to read this headline and read this article and blow up but people
[44:29.120 --> 44:33.960]  should get upset, why do you think the globalists are moving in such high gear Jacarie?
[44:33.960 --> 44:37.720]  Well, just like you always say you know what do you do, you come in and you disarm the
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.080]  population and once you disarm a population you know nobody can really say anything about
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.720]  it, you know so we've seen this in other countries and everybody talks about, what
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.640]  about the low gun crime in Britain, even though those are misleading numbers they count incidents
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.500]  not victims, but if you want to talk about a gun-controlled country why don't you talk
[44:54.500 --> 44:58.360]  about Mexico, they don't have guns but you know they got cartels running down the street
[44:58.360 --> 45:02.560]  shooting people, hanging people from bridges and doing all these other crazy things, cartels
[45:02.560 --> 45:09.800]  they get their weapons courtesy of the United States government.
[45:09.800 --> 45:13.880]  I don't have time to go out and do a lot of shooting these days but I understand it's
[45:13.880 --> 45:19.200]  a canary in the coal mine but so is the internet, so is our borders, the president is officially
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.640]  now a dictator, he says he'll implement the UN gun ban treaty even if Congress doesn't
[45:23.640 --> 45:28.880]  ratify it, do people understand this is called dictatorship Jacarie?
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.280]  I don't know what they think, I mean because they're so distracted with all these other
[45:32.280 --> 45:35.440]  things and there's a lot of things going on in the world, we've got plenty of other
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.880]  articles on infowars.com but if people can, you can go to the ATF right now and write
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.480]  them and tell them what your thoughts are about this and it was interesting to me that
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.880]  they're not having an open comment form, it's just email us and tell us what you think,
[45:50.880 --> 45:55.400]  so they could cook the books potential, well you know 90% of gun owners sent us an email
[45:55.400 --> 45:58.960]  and said they love the new ammo restrictions and I don't think that's what the case is
[45:58.960 --> 46:00.800]  going to be at all.
[46:00.800 --> 46:05.440]  And the way they're restricting it is they're going to call full metal jacket armor piercing
[46:05.440 --> 46:11.040]  and basically restrict it, this is unbelievable and then they'll start rating people's houses
[46:11.040 --> 46:15.920]  that have it, I mean I've probably got 10,000 rounds of full metal jacket, at issues of
[46:15.920 --> 46:21.680]  so called armor piercing ammunition, an exemption for those bullets mostly used by sports, see
[46:21.680 --> 46:26.040]  they're saying oh you can't use it in sport anymore, owners and the recent popularity
[46:26.040 --> 46:34.000]  of pistol style ARs that use the ammo, the inexpensive 5.56 M885 ammo commonly called
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.440]  green tips have been exempt for years and have higher caliber ammunition that can easily
[46:40.440 --> 46:46.880]  pierce the type of soft armor worn by police, so see all bullets are cop killer, all bullets,
[46:46.880 --> 46:54.960]  I mean listen folks, I bought B52 50 cal ammo from a police supply house, I walked in with
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.440]  SWAT teams buying bullets in front of me and I went out with a shopping cart loaded with
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.840]  a B52 ammo from 1963 that's armor piercing.
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.040]  But the issue is I'm not going to go out and do anything illegal with it, it was sheep
[47:10.040 --> 47:16.320]  target ammo about a half the price of regular 50 cal and we bought a couple thousand rounds
[47:16.320 --> 47:17.600]  of it.
[47:17.600 --> 47:22.280]  The point is though I could use my car hypothetically or you could to run people over, we don't
[47:22.280 --> 47:26.720]  need to ban cars or baseball bats because someone might do something with it, but now,
[47:26.720 --> 47:32.480]  so the real headline here is most popular round to be banned by Obama under executive
[47:32.480 --> 47:40.400]  action sub headline bullets to be labeled cop killer, so that's how they're going to
[47:40.400 --> 47:46.880]  get the bullets is calling them cop killer, look any bullet can be a cop killer, a hatchet
[47:46.880 --> 47:52.200]  can be a cop killer, my fist can be a cop killer, just like a cop can kill you with
[47:52.200 --> 47:56.200]  their fist, a taser or a gun, this is asinine.
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.720]  That's right Alex and actually on nine if we can pull this up, I have the contact information
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.400]  for the ATF so anybody who wants to contact them can see it right here on the screen.
[48:07.400 --> 48:18.440]  And that's APA comments at ATF.gov, APA comments at ATF.gov, listen this is holders sworn to
[48:18.440 --> 48:27.080]  get our guns, their faxes 202-648-9741, listen I love how we can go to the EPA on comments
[48:27.080 --> 48:31.160]  on shutting down power plants and they just do it and it's fine to contact them but it's
[48:31.160 --> 48:36.480]  not the ATF to restrict our bullets, it would have to be an act of Congress and the Supreme
[48:36.480 --> 48:43.400]  Court would overturn it just like they did in DC Heller, this is criminal, this is lawless,
[48:43.400 --> 48:48.440]  this is illegal and I want to be clear, it was the ATF that began to blow the whistle
[48:48.440 --> 48:51.280]  on Fast and Furious because that was so criminal.
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.800]  So the entire ATF, though they're unconstitutional, though they're out of control, though they're
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.240]  the original revenuers on the whiskey tax and are a very bad federal agency, there are
[49:00.240 --> 49:05.040]  believe it or not people in the agency because I know now because they've leaked stuff to
[49:05.040 --> 49:08.800]  our connections, I'll just say that, who do not like what's happening, who didn't believe
[49:08.800 --> 49:12.320]  us 20 years ago saying they were tyrants, now they know we're right, so we don't want
[49:12.320 --> 49:17.360]  to make the ATF our enemy, but they do not have the legitimate right to run around with
[49:17.360 --> 49:22.920]  rule making because Obama tells them to restrict our guns, period, there's no debate, Chikari,
[49:22.920 --> 49:23.920]  do you agree?
[49:23.920 --> 49:29.720]  Absolutely, absolutely, and he keeps trying, they keep saying, you guys have been saying
[49:29.720 --> 49:33.600]  since Obama became a president that he was going to ban your guns, he keeps trying, there's
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.000]  that famous clip of him talking about the bitter clingers, people hanging onto their
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.480]  guns in their Bibles, and now today we see the reports out, eventually the media has
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.320]  gotten around to reporting how these ISIS rebels, these al-Qaeda rebels are now killing
[49:46.320 --> 49:51.720]  Christians, we've been reporting on that for years, it's just now a news thing.
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.000]  Well what I want to do is, I want to take the examiner article, add some of our videos
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.840]  and warnings to it, and I want to just go with the headline, Obama to label bullets
[50:02.840 --> 50:09.600]  cop killer, I mean Obama gun confiscation plan revealed, he begins with executive action
[50:09.600 --> 50:14.280]  to restrict bullets calling him cop killer, I mean I guess their headline's good, Obama
[50:14.280 --> 50:19.480]  to ban bullets by executive action threatens top-selling AR-15 rifle, that's it, I mean
[50:19.480 --> 50:26.520]  that's what it is, and if they can take down the big dog, the AR-15 M4 variants, then because
[50:26.520 --> 50:30.280]  they're so easy to shoot, they're so accurate, women love them, that's why Joe Biden says
[50:30.280 --> 50:36.520]  women don't get them, I mean the headline is Obama, Obama to ban most popular bullet
[50:36.520 --> 50:41.360]  calling it cop killer, executive tyranny in high gear, I mean this is a red alert over
[50:41.360 --> 50:45.520]  the top, unbelievable, and I saw him again to read the article and sure enough they're
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.760]  calling them cop killers, and just the ATF outside of law, I want a full court press
[50:49.760 --> 50:53.720]  on this guys, everybody knows about the net grab, we need to go a full court press, because
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.720]  if he gets away with this executive action, Katie bar the door, this is incredible.

[53:55.480 --> 54:13.760]  Go to faketv.com.
[54:13.760 --> 54:23.560]  I've got infowars.com to my right on my little iPad, and then I've got drudgerport.com to
[54:23.560 --> 54:24.560]  my left over here.
[54:24.560 --> 54:27.480]  And I've got my crew constantly scanning the news.
[54:27.480 --> 54:29.400]  We knew he would go after the AR-15.
[54:29.400 --> 54:31.720]  He promised to with executive action.
[54:31.720 --> 54:33.600]  Congress has warned him.
[54:33.600 --> 54:37.440]  We knew he would, because the anti-gun groups tell us what they're going to do.
[54:37.440 --> 54:41.960]  We knew he would use the UN treaty as some type of official authority to supersede Congress
[54:41.960 --> 54:43.560]  and the Bill of Rights.
[54:43.560 --> 54:52.080]  And now they're actually going to try to ban a type of full-metal jacket, 223, that they
[54:52.080 --> 54:53.920]  call armor piercing.
[54:53.920 --> 54:58.200]  They're all armor piercing.
[54:58.200 --> 55:02.120]  This is incredible.
[55:02.120 --> 55:04.000]  And then by that argument, ban everything.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.600]  I am simply blown away at this point.
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.200]  I want to take your phone calls again in the third hour after our special guest on a bunch
[55:10.200 --> 55:15.080]  of key positive health news, but we'll also go over some of the studies that are out.
[55:15.080 --> 55:22.320]  You guys reprint me that Canadian government study on the fluoride causing brain damage,
[55:22.320 --> 55:27.040]  and then there's this new one out of England, the London Telegraph, on it also causing brain
[55:27.040 --> 55:29.200]  damage and depression and the thyroid to go out.
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.840]  I know we covered that yesterday, but I'm going to get back into that with this GM news.
[55:32.840 --> 55:38.400]  And then we're going to cover full-body transplants will be possible within two years.
[55:38.400 --> 55:40.840]  That's in the London Independent.
[55:40.840 --> 55:45.000]  Obama threatens to fire, quote, ICE officials who don't follow his executive amnesty.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.480]  He has illegal executive amnesty, unbelievable.
[55:48.480 --> 55:50.680]  So again, the government is not even our enemy here.
[55:50.680 --> 55:52.280]  They always call us anti-government.
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.800]  We're anti-unconstitutional government, anti-all-powerful state.
[55:57.800 --> 56:02.720]  But they want to make it where if you disagree without a controlled government, you hate
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.760]  the border patrol, you hate the FBI, you hate the bookkeeper.
[56:09.760 --> 56:14.040]  And I've always been critical of these groups, but always said, hey, they're not the enemy,
[56:14.040 --> 56:16.960]  but at the same time got threatened by them at a primitive level and said a lot of mean
[56:16.960 --> 56:17.960]  things.
[56:17.960 --> 56:20.120]  I realized I was helping the PSYOP last six, seven years.
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.880]  Notice my change because I go out to rallies at federal buildings.
[56:24.880 --> 56:28.560]  I get a lot of intel from feds.
[56:28.560 --> 56:29.560]  They're more awake.
[56:29.560 --> 56:34.680]  People like Bongino and Dan Bongino and just countless others that you've heard on the
[56:34.680 --> 56:37.560]  air and countless others you haven't.
[56:37.560 --> 56:40.840]  They're totally freaked out, folks, because they know the law.
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.600]  They know that they're being ordered to engage in crime and they don't know what to do.
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.600]  They're begging the American people to put a stop to this.
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.600]  The globalist, if I was them, and I know how they think, they've done it before, 1995.
[56:55.600 --> 56:58.600]  They're going to blow stuff up, they're going to do it.
[56:58.600 --> 56:59.600]  They're going to blame it on us.
[56:59.600 --> 57:02.480]  You can see them building up to it to try to get us all killing each other, and I'm just
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.160]  not going to be part of it.
[57:04.160 --> 57:09.920]  I am not offensively looking to start a war, but if they start rounding people up and doing
[57:09.920 --> 57:13.840]  stuff like that, it will start a real civil war.
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.400]  And just know that people like George Soros and the globalists are the ones to blame,
[57:18.400 --> 57:19.920]  ladies and gentlemen.
[57:19.920 --> 57:24.920]  And I just hope that all the fools that have gone along with this system, because they've
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.600]  got a lot of idiots working for them as well, understand they're on the losing end and they're
[57:28.600 --> 57:30.080]  on the wrong side of history.
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.640]  I mean, who could deny that, that bad guys are running the country?
[57:34.640 --> 57:37.920]  Congress has an 8% approval rating in Gallup right now.
[57:37.920 --> 57:42.000]  That's just a general approval of government.
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.960]  The feds and locals need to decide who's side they're on and need to work with the public
[57:46.960 --> 57:48.200]  to try to save this country.
[57:48.200 --> 57:50.760]  And I know most of you are already on that page.
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.720]  What do we do about the brainwashed that think following every criminal order is what they're
[57:54.720 --> 57:57.040]  supposed to do?
[57:57.040 --> 57:58.440]  How do we stop this?
[57:58.440 --> 58:00.320]  There's some smart people out there.
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.800]  Will you please give me some ideas?
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.280]  I'm just trying to warn everybody, hoping we're smart enough to figure it out.
[58:07.280 --> 58:12.040]  Briefly, we will sell out a super male and super female vitality.
[58:12.040 --> 58:15.800]  Well, super female isn't selling out, but super male is selling out, so we may have
[58:15.800 --> 58:22.760]  to end the special of 20% off earlier than next week, because it's all selling out.
[58:22.760 --> 58:26.880]  There's two days left, 20% off, already discounted, super male, super female vitality.

[59:22.720 --> 59:27.080]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[59:27.080 --> 59:29.080]  Can you put two and two together?
[59:29.080 --> 59:34.680]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[59:34.680 --> 59:36.680]  priced and fully legal.
[59:36.680 --> 59:44.760]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[59:44.760 --> 59:51.040]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[59:51.040 --> 01:00:04.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:25.240]  Well, we knew it was coming, Obama promised executive action on the UN gun ban and to
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:34.640]  try to go after semi-auto, M16, M4, AR-15 variants.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.640]  Almost no crimes are committed with these guns, but they don't care.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:43.000]  2% of crime, FPS statistics, are using assault rifles, and in front of you is the Army version
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.040]  or Marine Corps version, it's the infantry version to be more accurate, of the Barrett
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:54.240] .50 caliber rifle, and we've got two of those here at the office, and look, it's not coming
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.440]  out of its gun safe at night and attacking people, because we're engaged in an Info War.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:05.360]  In fact, guys, we bring in my printout that I had on the nightly news last night of how
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.360]  we burned in the camps later, because that's really what all of this is coming down to
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.160]  these days.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.240]  We're faced with classical tyranny, we're faced with the classical takeover, and notice
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.520]  how they phrase all this from the article in the Washington Examiner up on infowars.com
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:32.600]  and drugsreport.com, the VATFE and explosives says that since the bullets can be used in
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.440]  semi-automatic handguns, oh my gosh, they pose a threat to police and must be banned
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:43.640]  from production, sale and use, but as the congressman noted, they offered no proof.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:49.040]  Federal agencies will still be allowed to buy the ammo.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.520]  All bullets are cop killers, all bullets can be armor piercing, basically.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.400]  So the argument that they've got a ban of bullet because it can shoot through body
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:04.840]  armor, I mean, do you know how easy it would be if you really wanted to wait around the
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.720]  corner or walk up to a cop when they're getting out of their squad car and club them in the
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.760]  head with a ball peen hammer and take their gun?
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.960]  I don't want to get into special forces tactics, but I mean, you can go read about them online,
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.960]  you can learn about it.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.800]  You can learn about World War II tactics, and I talked to some of the old boys before
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.640]  they died that that's how they'd get more guns and ammo when they were running out,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.920]  because they just go get German weapons and how they do it with a hammer.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.480]  You're not going to stop people killing.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.160]  I don't care if it's citizens, cops, whatever, and so it's, oh, you want to kill the cops
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.000]  and the Republicans are like, you haven't proven this ammo can kill cops.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.640]  Don't go in that briar patch.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.360]  All ammo is cop killer.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.520]  They can't restrict legal and lawful citizens right to ammo by their argument, folks.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.840]  The way I read this now, and I've had time to read it all because it just broke as I
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.000]  saw it go up as a red link.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  By the way, this is a red link.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.960]  This is basically all full metal jacket, not just the so-called green tips that I guess
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960]  have a little.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.080]  Is it a tungsten cord, Jacari?
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.120]  Like I saw some of this in your office a few months ago on your desk and I think it was
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.480]  advertised as hog killer because I guess it penetrates better.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480]  Yeah.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:18.960]  I think we have that back in the, the prop room, but yeah, I had to look it up to exactly
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.720]  where you were doing some report when he was already proposing this, right?
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720]  Yeah.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720]  Oh yeah.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.720]  He's been after this for a while.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.320]  Well, somebody do me a favor and go find that in Jacari's office with the prop room.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.120]  It's a green box, isn't it?
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120]  Jacari knows where it's at.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.440]  He can get it.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.640]  My head's just spinning right now.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.760]  I mean, I knew the other shoe was going to drop, but I'm going to explain this again.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.440]  It wouldn't matter if the 322 pages of the FCC takeover have bad stuff in it or not,
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.440]  which we know it has bad stuff in it.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.440]  That's why they won't release it.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.120]  Folks that have seen it have leaked it, including commissioners.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:56.200]  It's the FCC getting regulatory jurisdiction outside of Congress over the internet in the
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.020]  United States where the internet came from.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.960]  So that's why it's bad.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.240]  We need net neutrality from the corporations and the government and the big corporations,
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.200]  we better believe, are in deep with this group.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.200]  So I want a full court press, folks.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.680]  Obama moves to ban two to three Amos, really the headline, sub-headline executive action
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.920]  latest imperial move.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.880]  Other ammo and guns will follow just as sure as night follows day.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.520]  I mean, boom, were you able to find that quick, Jacari?
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.520]  Wow.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.880]  He's got them right there.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.160]  Let's punch Jacari up.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]  There is the evil ammo.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160]  Jacari shows.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.640]  Now, these aren't green tip, but these are pretty similar to what they're talking about
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.640]  then.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.640]  I mean, that's a penetrator round, isn't it, or is that a mushrooming round?
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.640]  Let's see.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.640]  Isn't that a game round?
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.040]  Yeah, this is for you, honey, hog hammer.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.040]  I knew it was, yeah.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.040]  That's a game round.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.880]  By the way, in my experience, those are even more armor piercing.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.880]  I'll tell you a little secret.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880]  Those bullets break up.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.320]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.440]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.720]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:16.000]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.640]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.360]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.840]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.840]  and individual empowerment?
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.680]  I'm all about human potential, I'm all about the individual being empowered, the establishment
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.680]  is the opposite.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.000]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  garbage.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.960]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:29.080]  Well Dr. Billy DeMoss, the founder of Cal Jam, is our guest for the next hour.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.240]  A lot of really exciting health and alternative medicine and supplement news.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.880]  We are winning the battle not just here but worldwide.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.040]  It doesn't mean we're not overall in a fight of our lives here and the globalists aren't
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.160]  moving forward on many fronts but we're having a lot of victories.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.640]  We're going to talk about that with Billy who's come all the way here from California
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.360]  to deep in the heart of Texas in the InfoWars.com News Center.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.600]  Then coming up after he leaves us, and we're going to cover some of this with him, full
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.960]  body transplants will be possible within two years, London Independent.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.000]  We're also going to get into Obama says there'll be consequences for ICE officials who do not
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.800]  follow executive amnesty where he just orders the borders open, everybody legalized and
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.160]  free welfare just because he feels like it.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.960]  Saudi Arabia says it might help Israel attack Iran nuclear sites.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.400]  Top military experts say we've moved two more minutes towards midnight.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:31.040]  We're also going to get into socialist architect behind FCC's net neutrality says, quote, let's
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:38.880]  eliminate capitalist propaganda, locked and loaded FCC prime for vote on internet regs.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:47.240]  Ford Soros and the Ford Foundation gave $196 million, I'm going from memory, look that
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:53.360]  up for me, $196 million in the last 12 months because he wants to protect free speech though
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.080]  he funds media matters that spends all its time trying to shut down Drudge Report and
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.680]  InfoWars.com.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.640]  It came out three years ago in Politico, internal memos that they quote, infiltrate and bring
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.320]  down alternative libertarian media.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.600]  I mean, do you understand that fact?
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600]  There's the article right there.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:21.720]  I actually found it right here Soros, Ford shoveled $196 million to net neutrality groups.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.200]  Staff to White House, boom, there's the headline.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.680]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.280]  They're moving on every front right now.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:35.720]  Now with our guest, Impact of Flora on Neurological Development in Children, Harvard study.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.560]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but just real quick before you get into that, we have it online.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.880]  FCC votes yes on strongest net neutrality rules.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.040]  Oh my gosh.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:53.360]  So the FCC, the FCC, not Congress, has decided to draconially, wow, Time Magazine, print that
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.120]  for me immediately, FCC votes yes on strongest net neutrality rules.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.160]  And of course, the establishment got the news first, net neutrality advocates quite literally
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.560]  danced in the snowy streets Thursday.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.440]  Look how they're phrasing as a victory for freedom to have the FCC take the web over
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.320]  as commissioners and others have said that this Obama initiative actually lets them take
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.240]  it over.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.560]  It goes on as the Federal Communications Commission in Washington just before the agency voted
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.960]  to approve the strongest ever rules on net neutrality, which puts the internet under
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.240]  FCC control.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.520]  The vote marks the culmination of the year long struggle that pitted grassroots internet
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.520]  advocates and Silicon Valley tech giants against the titans of telecom industry.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.920]  Actually it's a bait and switch.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.920]  The Federal Reserve Board, before they got it passed in 1913, put out ads from the banking
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.840]  associations saying they were against the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.840]  This is so over the top.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.960]  They admittedly are calling it Chinese style net censorship.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.280]  And it's another bait and switch just like Obamacare was.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.280]  Here's the deal.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.800]  They wouldn't let us see the 32 pages.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.520]  The FCC chairman, Obama appointee said that he would release it the minute it came out.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520]  So where is it?
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520]  Look at that article.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]  I bet it's not there.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.320]  I bet they let everybody for a day or so just say it's great and say it's like free
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]  healthcare.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.440]  And then, you know, in the case of Obamacare, years later we find out what it actually
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.960]  does.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.920]  So all of our researchers get on that right now.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.200]  Let's find out exactly what's going on.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.720]  Simply, simply amazing.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.600]  Very, very, very, very frustrating.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.280]  What a Trojan horse yet again.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:42.720]  Dr. Billy DeMoss, he found that the dead chiropractic society in 1996, one of the first monthly
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.440]  philosophy meetings where local DCs and students could immerse themselves regularly in philosophy,
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.480]  art, science, chiropractic, inspired by music and driven by chiropractic.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.960]  Eight years ago, Billy De decided he needed to share his vision, the larger audience and
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.760]  a mega lineup of speakers and thus California Jam, the chiropractic rock and roll event
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760]  was born.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.680]  Eight years on, Billy De continues to bring his unique vision to the world of chiropractic,
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.920]  health and wellness, which has seen Cal Jam morph into the fastest growing chiropractic
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.200]  event on the planet between putting on Cal Jam and speaking at chiropractic events around
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.880]  the country and abroad, Billy De continues to run one of the most successful practices
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.840]  in Orange County, California, and is known for his no holds barred approach to telling
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.480]  it as it is and like it is, particularly when it comes promoting an inside, outside approach
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.680]  to health and wellness.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:36.400]  All I know is shooting 50 cows handheld last year, I threw my back out, my spine was going
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.480]  in, went to medical doctors, they couldn't help me, went to chiropractors, they totally
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480]  fixed it.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.240]  The medical doctors said no way I could get it fixed.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.760]  And the chiropractors I know, you're 50 something years old, look like, how old are you?
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760]  56.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.600]  You're 56, you mean you look like you're 45.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.880]  I want to get like that.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:59.760]  I've lost 40 something pounds from, you know, 280 pounds, 279 pounds, naked, down to, you
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.760]  know, 235.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.000]  I want to go that last 20, 30 pounds, but everybody says I look a lot better from years
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.240]  of stress and, you know, bad living.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.120]  But I tell you, when I've gone to events like this, the people are so happy, they're not
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.040]  fake, good-looking people, they're just really energized folks, and even when they're not
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.320]  classical, you know, CIA assassin look like you've got going, they still, you know, just
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.840]  have that fire in their eyes that you find in the alternative wellness communities, people
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.920]  that live longer, they're healthier.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.920]  What is your vision?
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.920]  What's going on?
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.880]  Why is Cal Jam so popular?
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.120]  I am one of the main speakers there.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.360]  We're excited to have you, too.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.480]  Well, thank you for having me, brother, thanks for coming to Texas.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.240]  Well, the vision is just to get the world to wake up to what's going on and everything
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.000]  from healthcare to sustainability of the planet.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.840]  And I've just tried to really make an eclectic menu of different speakers with different
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.520]  topics from GMO to the Fukushima thing we're going to be talking about this year, to all
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.040]  the geoengineering, to health and nutrition, and I also wanted to get the chiropractic
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.160]  message out to people, because everybody looks at chiropractic as kind of a band-aid
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.960]  kind of healthcare system.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:11.040]  But reality, if people really understand what chiropractic is about, it's about basically
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.400]  life extension, because if we really maintain the spine like you maintain your teeth, your
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.920]  spine protects your nervous system, and if your body has the capacity to better express
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.320]  nerve intelligence through the nervous system spinal cord by having better channels open
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.040]  because of proper spinal alignment, then you're going to have better expression.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:33.240]  Well, I've fired 100 rounds or more hand-held, and just for some reason, I'm always saying,
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.280]  oh, it doesn't kick. It made my spine just bow out. They wanted to do all this surgery.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.040]  And I went to a chiropractor, and they fixed it in two visits, and this incredible pain
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.560]  was gone, but then I hear the mainstream media bashing chiropractors constantly.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.240]  Oh, we've been vilified from the very beginning. I mean, there was a movie that was just out
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.360]  called Doctor, and I think that would be another great guest for you have is Jeff Hayes. He
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.520]  just put the movie out, BOT, which is about how the whole system's bought by Big Pharma
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.960]  and this whole vaccine push, and even the GMO push.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:09.040]  You're 56 years old. I mean, you look like you're like 45. You could be 40. Simply amazing.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.640]  I look at Dr. Joel Wallach and, you know, how healthy he is at his age. You know, finally
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.600]  he's 70 plus years old. It looks like he's 60. I want to get on this train. It takes
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:22.480]  a while to segue into it in my stressful life, but I'm doing it, but you cover sustainability.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.800]  People saying, what's Alex Jones doing going to a conference that's partially about sustainability?
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.680]  Well, there's real environmentalists, real conservationists that don't want nuclear
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.440]  reactors blowing up, that don't want to overfish, that don't want poison or water, that don't
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.880]  want GMO. That's me versus the George Soros crowd. This is the only problem is carbon
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.480]  dioxide. Let's tax it. Right. I mean, there's the real environmentalists who are the listeners
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:51.120]  of the show. And then there's the, I'm not talking so much about environmentalism at
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.520]  a restaurant. Somebody goes, you don't want to talk to him about trying to save the oceans.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.480]  He doesn't care. He's Alex Jones. Like there's this idea. It's just crazy. I mean, who would
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.400]  want to hurt the planet for our children? That's the whole vision for me is I say this
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:11.360]  all the time. I have lived the most amazing life. My goal is to future generations. They
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.960]  have that same opportunity. I mean, I look at my nieces and nephews and I just really
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.000]  fear for what's going on. And the thing that scares me the most is this big builder trying
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.440]  to push in California, the SB 277, where it's going to be mandatory vaccination in California.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.080]  We're going to talk about that. The Navy just came out with the Canadian government study
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.880]  and said that they vaccinated all these ships in the Canadian and U.S. Navy and they had
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:33.880]  more flu.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.600]  Well, of course. I mean, personally, in my opinion, I really have zero faith in vaccines.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:45.320]  I think they're hideously dangerous and I really have zero faith in them. Mahatma Gandhi
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320]  was against them.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.600]  Of course. But the thing that you reportedly had about 160 IQ, right? Why are all these
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.760]  smart people concerned about them?
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.320]  Because they know the truth and they haven't been snowed and brainwashed into believing
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.800]  that vaccines saved us from smallpox and polio and all the dogma that I always hear from
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.360]  people that typically have so much faith in something that they've been brainwashed by
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:13.480]  their media and by a pharmaceutical cartel, which controls the way the doctors think in
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480]  the system.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.400]  Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor for the next 40 minutes and about 20 minutes
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.880]  to the next hour that I'm going to take calls. But what are some of the topics you want to
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.400]  get in today? Because I know you're an amazing speaker. I've seen a lot of the videos. People
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.080]  are, I mean, that's why your seminars are so popular, not just this big gal jam event.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.120]  Well, they either love me or they hate me. They're probably kind of like you, right?
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.680]  Does everybody love you?
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.320]  Most folks like me, but I think there's about 20% that hate my guts, yeah.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.520]  Okay. Well, that's probably my range as well.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.960]  But I mean, who cares if...
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.120]  Oh, I know. It doesn't bother me. I have thick skin. I mean, after a while, you just get
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.600]  used to it. In fact, sometimes when I don't have enough haters, I start to feel maybe
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600]  I'm not pushing hard enough.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.120]  Exactly. Do you ever use haters and people that lie about you and misrepresent what
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  you say? That's what they always do. They build strong men.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.120]  Right.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.640]  Does that ever fuel you like you're tired and all of a sudden you get attacked, you
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640]  have all this energy?
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.960]  Right. I do. In fact, it's almost fun to me. But I think a lot of those...
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.440]  I think that's winners versus losers.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.440]  Right, right.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.800]  Winners don't mind losing some time, because you're going to get better and win.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.080]  It's when you're successful, people want to pull you down into their quagmire of just
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.920]  a lower vibration in life. And I think people don't want you to be successful.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.960]  I don't get that. I see people that are successful by doing good and I admire that.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960]  Right.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.760]  Right, right, right. But not everybody thinks the way you and I think.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.200]  I think one of the biggest secrets of success in life is not being like that. I think these
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:39.080]  people feel bad about themselves and so they can't imagine that somebody successful is
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.080]  good so they have to demonize you because they have to think you got where you are
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.080]  through fraud.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.080]  Right.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.160]  Or luck or whatever it is. But it's been hard work. I mean, I put a lot of time into
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:53.200]  this whole mission and the goal is to get this to stadiums eventually.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.040]  We're going to talk about your mission, your goal, your vision straight ahead. Stay with
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040]  us.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.440]  My name is Dale and I live in El Cajon, California. I was concerned about my cholesterol readings
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.320]  because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.120]  the risk for heart attack and stroke. One day I heard an ad for heart and body extract
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.640]  and I was skeptical. But I decided to give it a try. Man, the numbers don't lie.

[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.360]  was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.680]  was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:20.480]  action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriot Supply has never taken
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:25.880]  a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and employ
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.360]  over 50 hardworking American men and women. It is rare to find companies who practice

[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.000]  There's a man named Dr. Joel Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor, both a
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.640]  veterinarian and naturopathic physician. Doc asks, why does the United States spend
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:12.080]  more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.520]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition. Take
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.160]  charge of their health and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition, not
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:26.960]  by toxic prescription drugs that lead to side effects and more toxic prescription drugs.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.520]  Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.520]  waking up to all the big government, big pharma and big insurance manipulation of our health
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:41.320]  care system. I'm George Dory and I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:47.320]  people about health care. Visit criticalhealthnews.com and listen to Dr. Wallach's deadly recipes
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:52.160]  lecture. It makes a lot of sense and I urge you to join our critical health news team.

[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.920]  And literally I think over time it just dumps people down and they're not as in tune with
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.520]  reality anymore. And they're so susceptible to believing everything that they see on TV.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.280]  I mean I don't watch any TV, I'll watch your show. But other than that I mean I don't even
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.880]  own a TV because I don't want to get that daily brainwashing that everybody else gets
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.120]  to believe in all this fear that they try to sell and the agenda that they're trying
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.880]  to push us down. More and more it looks like the agenda is starting
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.760]  to fail. That's why they're trying to double down and really force all of this. I think
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.840]  all the force inoculations and force override, I think it's blowing up in their face.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.160]  Right. I mean that's the whole thing with this SB 277 in California. They know in fact
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.080]  where I'm from, Horns County, California supposedly has the highest unvaccinated rate
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.800]  of any county in the United States. And I'm not going to take credit for it but I have
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:50.320]  really been for 25 years teaching people in my community the truth about vaccines and
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:56.480]  I've also really promoted other chiropractors in our neighborhood to do the same thing to
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.440]  get out and teach this stuff because once people hear the truth it's hard to believe
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:06.120]  the lies anymore and then I just really try to get people to read and do their own research
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:11.600]  rather than blindly believing all the drivel that they hear on mainstream media and all
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.640]  the stuff that their pediatricians spout out because the pediatricians have been brought
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:21.120]  up in a system that's controlled by Pharmakia. Sure. And it's just the system's rigged.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:26.480]  All I know is I could hardly walk and I went to the chiropractor on a Monday and on a Wednesday.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.400]  They did all these adjustments, hooked up the electricity systems that, you know, relaxed
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.360]  the muscles and then did more x-rays and my spine was back 80% where it was supposed
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.760]  to be. Then I came back a third time, they popped it completely back and I haven't been
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.480]  back. Right. Three visits, I said two. Two got it where it was almost better. Three visits,
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.000]  completely better. X-ray, spine straight. I'd already gone to the medical doctor and
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.880]  they said, oh, you've got to go have surgery. Oh, I've been here that all the time. I mean,
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.360]  that's, I mean, miraculous. Right. So you have to be shut down. You're not a real doctor.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.520]  Right, right, right. Just because I don't have an MD after my name. You just get such
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.280]  great results. Well, you know, until 80 years ago there were four different types of doctors
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:07.160]  in the establishment. Now they only say MDs. Right. And the thing about Jeff Hayes that
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.840]  I was talking about, I think he'd be a great addition to one of your shows in the future.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:16.720]  He did a movie called Doctor where the, actually, AMA came out with goals to contain and eliminate
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.000]  the chiropractic profession. I remember, I want to get him on. Yeah. He would be great
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.320]  and he's very articulate and he's got two great movies that are great for your viewers
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.800]  to see as well. Thoughts, one of them. Well, all I know is my uncle from motorcycle accident
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.840]  was going to have to have surgery. He goes to a chiropractor once a month. He has his
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:36.560]  back pains gone. I mean, I'm not here trying to sell chiropracties, just that they demonize
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.800]  it in the news all the time because it's such a good alternative. Right. But I want to
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.960]  want people to understand that we could take you to the next level of health by getting

[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:23.920]  during the breaks. You've been amazing on air but you're really talking about a lot
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.800]  of key stuff here during the breaks. Repeat all the stuff you just said please for the
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.800]  audience out there. We want to talk about vaccines or chiropractic. Whatever. Finish
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.400]  up with the vaccines then chiropractic in your vision. All right. So I was on the phone
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:40.840]  with Sherry Tenpenny Friday. Dr. Sherry Tenpenny who spoke at Cal Jam last year. She was supposed
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:46.040]  to speak at Cal Jam this year but she got a better offer to go to Australia but then
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.880]  obviously she got banned down there because the censorship down there. You knew that right.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.560]  Yes. Incredible. And she was talking to me. I mean the issue
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:35:00.840]  isn't about measles. It's about getting people to have basically they're pushing for compulsory
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.480]  mandatory vaccines. They're using this as foot in the door. Right. And because they've
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:09.200]  got 300 different vaccines in the pipeline and then what they say is that whatever they
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.200]  deem is necessary for people to get they're going to push on us. And so that means there's
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.440]  an endless supply of vaccines. And this is not about just the kids. This is about they're
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.800]  going to be going after the adults too. So I mean one of my big issues has always been
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.000]  to get people to understand the reality with vaccines. And I mean I'm you know it's not
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.680]  that I'm anti-vaccine. I'm just I'd be for any vaccine that number one that they prove
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:36.200]  is safe. And then after they prove to me it's safe. I want to see that it's effective. So
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.720]  they haven't done that. And by a third party not by you know somebody not the. And that's
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.600]  why they lie and always say save and effective. Save and effective. It's the same. The insert
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.280]  reads like a over reads like hell on earth. The insert reads like a nightmare. Right.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.440]  And then with the chiropractic thing like you the way you've expressed it to me as most
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.480]  people look at chiropractic as just this bandaid kind of care you only go when you hurt. I
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.240]  try to get people understand that I'm really trying to elevate your natural expression
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:07.160]  of nerve potential by maximizing just alignment and postural issues. Yeah. Also using nutrition
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.800]  to promote longevity of the spine because if you the spine is everything in your posture
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:16.360]  is everything about your body's potential to express 100 is that called holistic. That's
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.240]  holistic. Right. Holism is just the body works together. I mean look at how healthy and handsome
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.360]  Dr. Group is. He looks like he's 15 years younger. He does in person. He looks good
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:29.320]  on camera. But in person it's just like this guy glows and I want that glow. So I'm trying
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.040]  to get there. Yeah. I mean other things that I mean I try to teach my peeps and my practice
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.640]  is I really want people to live a healthier lifestyle. So we try not to get them to eat
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:43.320]  any GMO food. We get GMO foods hard last year at Cal Jam. We try to get them to eat mostly
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:49.520]  organic. There's some supplements that we recommend. I'll talk about that in a minute.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:54.800]  You know get them help drinking healthy water exercising putting positive things into their
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.440]  brain and sleeping in a healthy lifestyle. All that's going to increase your potential
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.360]  for health and give you greater resistance to disease. And the problem with the system
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.120]  that we currently have in place is medicine typically and it's great in an emergency crisis.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:13.000]  Medicine is great in it but it has really nothing to do with health care. It really
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.200]  basically medicine deals and treats with symptoms and never really addressed the cause of people's
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:24.000]  problems. Keep rolling with it because that's what I found with chiropractors and alternative
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  health people is they're informed. They know about the studies. They know about the globalist.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.440]  They know about the GMO and if we can ever get that group even to a bigger audience it's
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:39.720]  already a huge dominant force in so many levels. They can be the people to lead what you would
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:44.480]  call leftist who are actually good people into seeing the big picture. I think that's
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.440]  why the establishments always attacking alternative health and nutraceuticals and chiropractors
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:55.320]  because you guys really are the leaders that could lead people you know out of Egypt basically.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.200]  Right. Right. Well you look at the average car but they have thousands of chiropractors
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.320]  I mean thousands of patients in their practice. What we need to do as a profession is we need
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.080]  to lead those people and create that change. And get aggressive because the system's coming
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:13.320]  after us. Fast and hard. I mean I mean it's serious. This SB 277 scares me more than anything
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.920]  that's come along. Obama's about to ban the most popular bullet in America without an
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:22.520]  even executive order. Right. The FCC just took over the internet 20 minutes ago. Yeah they're
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.880]  going to protect it. No. Now the FCC is over the internet. The government wasn't over it
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.800]  before. Right. The other thing that scares me is this whole DO engineering issue. I'm
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.760]  going to be speaking about that in my speech. Yeah. Yeah. I mean Dane Wiginkins going to
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.680]  be at Cal Jam who I love and he's a very eloquent speaker. He's got his stuff down. I mean literally
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:45.320]  I mean I surf every day at home. That's one of the reasons I feel like that's my religion.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:50.560]  It's also my spiritual contact but it's just so disheartening and it's so frustrating for
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.280]  me to go surfing and you'll go out and it's a perfectly clear day and then here come the
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.240]  Jets and it's just like you feel like you're a cockroach. NASA now says the earth is 30%
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:06.760]  darker because of jet condensation trails but there's something different about them
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.520]  and we're not saying every condensation trail is a chem trail but it's going on and then
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.440]  they admit there's all these secret programs going on. Right. Let us see the secret program
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.640]  just like the secret FCC proposal. Right. That they're celebrating right now. Right.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:26.120]  I mean how obvious. It's secret. We're not going to tell you but it's good. Right. Right.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.560]  Getting back into forced inoculations. I mean they are really pushing this. What are
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:36.160]  we going to do when they try to forcibly inject this? That's a really good question. I mean
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.960]  this is going to come to a point where they're going to come to your house by gunpoint and
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.720]  start forcing people to get vaccinated. I don't know. They do that in India and Africa
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.120]  but people have they have uprisings though. Right. And I think that's what they're really
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  pushing for. I think they're pushing for this is the straw that's going to break the back
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.120]  of people in the United States. It's going to push us into that police state martial
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.560]  law which I think they want to go towards right now. Well I know you've been doing
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.440]  Cal Jam for what eight, nine years. Eight years. And you're about to move to be doing
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.480]  more of these. Right. Right. And that's the vision is I want to take it from this 3,000
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:16.040]  seat arena and go maybe to a 25,000 seat arena to up to 15,000 seats. Well 30,000, 50,000.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.120]  You know how to put these on. I can go and get 2,000, 3,000 people to show up anywhere
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:24.280]  in the country. I don't like having to set it up. It's super expensive to get the hotels
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.520]  all of it. But when somebody like you comes along doing this, I would love you start doing
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.040]  more of these to partner with you and others to where six, seven, eight times a year we're
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.920]  in different major cities. Right. Then do one in Europe. Right. Because people need
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.520]  this. Right. People need to come together and feel the power of people coming together
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:46.440]  in agreement for healthy, good lifestyle and real environmentalism. And make it fun and
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:51.720]  bring music into it. So that's one of my other visions is to get bands that are also on the
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:57.680]  same page that would be willing to work with us to again attract more people. Say if we
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.520]  got somebody like Aerosmith or Red Hot Chili Peppers to be at the event, we could really
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.600]  attract them. Well I know the Aerosmith folks. I knew that's why I dropped that one in. And
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.840]  I know Tom Petty or ACDC gets some band in there that's going to bring people in. So
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.440]  we have a festival fun celebration. But then we're hitting that. We're hitting all the
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:23.560]  issues. Megadeth or maybe somebody like, you know, the folks from I love Megadeth, but
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:27.840]  I don't think it's not fit in with that crowd. Yeah. Dave's probably listening right now.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:32.800]  He's awesome. Billy Corgan would fit in probably good. Yes, he would. Aerosmith would be great.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.920]  Yeah. Yeah. See if I can get them to do that. That's like herding cats. Right. That's what
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.840]  the chiropractic profession can be like sometimes. So that's why I mean, I was talking to Jeff
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.000]  Hayes the other night. Actually, Aerosmith is right there in Southern California. I guess
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.200]  there you go. Right. Right. It's not like we wouldn't pay them, but they probably wouldn't
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.600]  get what they typically get paid at it. You know, but that's what it's about. Instead
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:56.680]  of just getting musicians to go do UN functions that raise money so Bono can pay 2% taxes and
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.520]  run off with it with Clinton. I mean, imagine doing something real just about getting the
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.000]  word out and the attention. If we ever get Hollywood and the music industry, what you're
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.760]  hitting at to start promoting libertarian transcendent ideas of not being part of this
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.880]  paradigm, it's over for the establishment. Right. Their entire grid is to keep us in
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:19.880]  this Madison Avenue, Wall Street. I guess you could call it Times Square system where
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:25.600]  they immerse us in all their disinfo and basically keep us in the cave. Right. And we've got
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  to resist it. There's definitely, in my opinion, it needs to be a revolution to some degree.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:36.320]  But they don't call it a revolution when it's a peaceful idea revolution and it takes over.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.200]  Right. They only build revolutions as violent. Right. It can be a peaceful revolution through
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:47.600]  awareness and education. Guys, did you bring me my Oh, how later we burned in the camps?
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.440]  Somebody bring me the famous quote of Alexander Soltanica. I want to end this hour on that
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.440]  point because I don't want us later as this tyranny accelerates. We're not going to wait
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:00.560]  long now. If we don't see a huge blooming of resistance peacefully, the globalist may
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.960]  be able to actually carry this out because even if we're awake and everybody submits
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:11.640]  to it, we'll just be awake in the gulag. Let me read this quote right now. This is of course
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:19.080]  the famous Nobel Prize winner for literature, but it wasn't fiction. His experience decades
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:24.760]  in a forced labor camp in Siberia, Alexander Soltanica, who later left the U.S. saying
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:30.040]  it was becoming what he'd left in Russia. And he said, and how we burned in the camps
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:34.280]  later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.640]  out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:45.520]  goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad,
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.280]  when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.760]  layers, pawling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and at every step on
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.120]  the staircase, but it understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:03.440]  at the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers,
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.000]  and whatever else was in hand. The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.520]  of officers in transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:17.640]  would have ground to a halt if, if we didn't love freedom enough. And even more, we had
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:22.400]  no awareness of the real situation. We purely and simply deserved everything that happened
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:28.800]  afterward and Stalin killed over 6 million, 7 million Russians just during the period.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.800]  We're talking about here starved to death around 10 million Ukrainians. That's why they
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:36.480]  have a real beef with Russia. But still, it doesn't mean the globalist thing will stir
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:41.440]  up a fight over there. We should see how they, how they play on these. I don't want to burn
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:47.240]  in the camps later as they come with force inoculations and gun confiscation and admit
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:53.160]  black sites in Chicago and admitted black site in Chicago. It's been going for 10 years
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:58.880]  where Guantanamo torturers, famous people are at this facility and they're disappearing
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.600]  people in who were dying. And it's not even a big news story in the US. It's London Guardian,
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:07.960]  their spiegel Europeans are going, Oh my God, America is Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, they've
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.840]  got this torture facility and they train back and forth and send torturers to Iraq out of
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:18.760]  it. This is in the London Guardian. We're sending our reporters, Joe Beggs and the valiant
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:22.560]  camera guy, Josh Owens up there. And who knows? I mean, they may show up on videotape
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:27.200]  and they may disappear there. I mean, that's how crazy this place has gotten. Billy, what's
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  your take on that?
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.480]  Well, I mean, you've covered a lot of things and I'm not really typically in as much news
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.880]  as you because I'm so focused on everything that I'm doing. But I just really, my focus
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:41.360]  is on getting people to understand health and what they can do.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.920]  Making it fun, transcending that.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.320]  Because if you can get your body better with the simple stuff you and others are teaching,
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.320]  that raises your awareness.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:53.040]  I think it's all about dumbing people down. So they just have no realization of what's
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.040]  going on anymore.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:58.760]  Well, I read that quote, as you said, revolution. Again, most violent revolutions are fail or
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.440]  they cause something worse, but they bill everything as a violent revolution, hoping
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:06.640]  we'd go that way. When we may have to, if they try to put us in FEMA camps, but before
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.360]  that happens, let's fight with everything we've got in the Info War and that's what
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.360]  you're doing.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.240]  Your awareness and empowerment.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:19.040]  Talk about that. I mean, talk. Why are the people involved in what you're involved in
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.160]  glowing?
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.640]  It's just living a different lifestyle than most people on this planet live, especially
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.440]  in this country. I mean, can I talk about this?
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:30.440]  You told Anthony something.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.800]  I mean, I didn't realize till I was in back with Anthony. He was speaking and he's going
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.040]  to be talking about Fukushima, which is another.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.520]  Which started melting down last weekend.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.720]  Right. I mean, what are people going to realize that we have to address some of these issues
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.720]  on the planet?
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.720]  Brother, you know about whatever you want.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.240]  Yeah. But I mean, that's why I want people to know about geoengineering. I want them
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:53.920]  to know about Fukushima. I want them to know about GMO. I want them to know about the forced
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.600]  vaccination and vaccines. I want them to understand things that they can do to elevate their health.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.520]  You want to raise the alarm, but also get people stuff they can do?
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:03.520]  Right. I mean, the thing is, it doesn't make any sense to scare the living daylights out
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.800]  of people, but if they don't have anything to do to counteract it. So, I mean, I've
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.760]  been taking this super vitality, male vitality. And I also...
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.040]  By the way, we didn't ask you to do this.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.040]  No, I know. Well, I was talking...
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:15.040]  Just told Anthony the story.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.040]  Right. I mean, this is not a plug, but...
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.040]  It is a plug.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.040]  Well, it's a plug because it works because we're going to this Dr. Eleanor, who's going
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:27.720]  to sit at your table. We also have a gala where people can go to that. We do it in a
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:33.280]  really high level restaurant right across the breezeway from the event where all the
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.960]  speaker's going to be, and she's going to sit at your table. She runs a longevity clinic
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.960]  in Tustin, and I went there and she did all my numbers. And, you know, I was low on a
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.200]  couple of things like copper. That's, I think, because I have this killer water system that
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:48.600]  gets all the copper out of the water. But she was like blown away. My testosterone was
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.000]  at 1400, and I didn't know that was like super high number until I was talking to Anthony.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.360]  I think most 56-year-olds, it's something like 300 or something.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.600]  Yeah. And she wanted to know what I was doing. I was... So, I've been taking this super male
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.720]  vitality. Of course, I'm doing everything else. I'm getting adjusted. I work out every
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:10.240]  day. I mean, I eat pretty much raw paleo. So, I mean, it's, again, lifestyle. You don't
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:14.240]  have to age prematurely like most people in this country do. And I think that's the whole
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:20.200]  other thing with this whole vaccine agenda, the GMOs, the geoengineer. I think it's really
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.880]  going to create more... That's the plan. It's the suppressors.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.080] ... more Alzheimer's as people get older. And then when we...
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.360]  They're soft-killing us. When we get the Adgena 21 thing going, and then we're just going
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.720]  to have forced euthanasia next. When is you specific... There'll be so many
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.000]  sick people that'll be, oh, we have to... A third of the kids have autism or whatever
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.520]  in the future. When did you start taking super male vitality? Because I know you're illiterate,
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.560]  but I'm flattered you got it. I would say groups sent me about... Groups
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:47.280]  a good friend, a speaker at Cal Jammie's been there the past three years. I love the dude
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:53.440]  to death. I've probably been taking it for almost probably half a year.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:58.640]  I mean, what happened when you took it? I always like to take it before surfing because
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:02.240]  it makes me a little bit more... I don't know, aggressive, maybe not...
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.240]  You got to take it before I work out. Yeah, I mean, it's great. It gives me
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:10.360]  more drive. It makes me feel younger. I don't know if those... It could be placebo, but
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.440]  it works for me. Well, I mean, it's got a whole bunch of known
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.960]  herbs that are known to boost a bunch of stuff and just get your body going. And it's cold
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.640]  pressed and it's concentrated. I mean, the average similar product's got about three
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.160]  dollars a product in it. This one's got 18 dollars a product in it. No one in the industry
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.480]  is doing that. That's why I developed this with a group who's one of the biggest formulators
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.040]  in the country. Right. I do your iodine, too. And the...
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.840]  Well, I appreciate your support because it's funding our operation, but it's also the listeners
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.280]  are getting and going, wow, but now I got to warn folks about the iodine. You will detox
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.360]  within two to three weeks. You will feel like crap for about a week. Everybody that takes
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.000]  it... I don't feel like crap for a week.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.600]  That's because you're probably already so healthy. Right.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.760]  I felt pretty bad. Yeah, you got to...
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.640]  Because I was taking it about six months before it came out.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:56.480]  How's your diet overall? Still hellish.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.680]  Is it? When are we going to get you on the program?
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:01.600]  But, I mean, compared to what I was doing three years ago, big difference.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.640]  Yeah. I mean, it's not that hard.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:08.240]  The weird thing is I don't want to go... I never finished my food now at a restaurant.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:11.800]  I mean, I'm full easier and I'm just slowly losing the weight now.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.040]  Because we've got to keep you around, man.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:16.080]  Well, I got to do a shot because I got a big, big head. So it looks like I'm over.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.960]  And I take my clothes off, which we're going to do some shots and show it. I mean, I look
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:25.720]  like a bodybuilder now. I'm not even trying to get big. It's the exercise and the products.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.720]  Yeah, you got to exercise.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.440]  But my problem is I already have a big frame.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  Yeah.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.800]  So it's just... I got a lot more muscle and a lot less fat.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.680]  You got to get Dr. Group adjusting more on the show, too.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.480]  He comes to town. He does it. That's one reason I'm...
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.640]  I'm going to adjust you after the show.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:40.040]  Thank you. Because then you got to catch your plane, though.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.040]  Yeah, I got to catch a plane.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.120]  But you're awesome. We're going to come right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:02.360]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:06.680]  are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body. As a result, you'll have less
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:10.720]  energy, your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled. An older person will typically
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:16.080]  injure more easily and heal more slowly. Not fun. However, if you could consume a protein
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:21.000]  powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.700]  and speed of recovery. One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:31.120]  may be the perfect answer for you. My name is Errol. I'm 74 years old. You know the taste
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:35.960]  of One World Way is amazing. I played pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:41.080]  mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out. I used
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:45.920]  to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:54:07.400]  One World Way.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:54:28.280]  Dr. Billy DeMoss is joining us here in Austin, Texas. At the end of March, I'm
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:35.120]  going to be joining him out in Southern California at Cal Jam. Infowars.com forward slash Cal
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:41.840]  Jam. Banners are all over the websites. The tickets will sell out. You can sign up for
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:48.800]  the streaming as well there on the website by going to infowars.com forward slash Cal
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.400]  Jam as well. I look forward to seeing you out there, but you obviously want to act quickly
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.320]  if you do want to physically be there. There's a lot of amazing speakers. Tell us about some
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:01.960]  of the speakers and some of the music that's going to be at California Jam, Dr.
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:08.760]  We've got like Kathy Wendland Colby is going to open in the show about just natural childbirth
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:14.080]  and breastfeeding. So we could cover every game. Human empowerment. Yeah, and then we're
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.200]  going to teach people. I mean, Genie Ohm is going to be talking about the same things,
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.560]  just pediatric, taking care of kids in a more natural way and feeding them properly. We've
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:27.840]  got one of the doctors is on the program is going to be talking about, he got cancer
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.920]  and he went through the normal system and he just saw the whole sales process, trying
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:35.880]  to push him into. So there's a mix of chiropractors, medical doctors. Yeah, I've got everybody
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:40.760]  on there. I mean, I mean, you guys are there. I'm so stoked to have you guys there. You
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.080]  know, we're again, the geoengineering. That's one of my biggest issues. I mean, because
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:49.240]  I mean, that really just, I mean, I see it every day and it literally just burns holes
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:54.960]  in my soul to see this happening. We're going to be talking about just nutrition. I mean,
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.800]  JJ Virgin's going to be there who's got a great book called Sugar Blues. I mean, I try
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.360]  to get people to, you know, really understand what's going on with health. But what I was
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:09.720]  trying to tell you is that the music also has a part as part of the integral message.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.560]  So we're going to play happy music, but then we're going to play like one of my speakers
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.760]  is going to be speaking about John Benardi, who's a chiropractor, who's going to be speaking
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.760]  about the way we typically treat ADHD with psychotropic drugs, i.e. Ritalin, which is
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:27.320]  basically speed and cocaine. So we took the song from Black Sabbath called Snow Blind.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.680]  I don't know if you remember. So we're going to do Snow Blind. And then what we do is we
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.120]  have huge video screens. I mean, the show is being produced by the same guys that produced
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.320]  the Black Keys show. So I mean, this, this is a full on Rock and Roll show.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.200]  All of the Black Keys. Yeah. Rock and Roll show. And but we're, we're
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.440]  taking that and we're using video to kind of portray how cocaine isn't the issue now.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:50.520]  We've got Ritalin. We've got Concerts. We've got Billify all the way.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.640]  By the way, I never use illegal drugs. I never, but I've said on air, I have tested
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:02.920]  them to see what they do. And I took eight, nine years ago. What's the speed they give
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:07.200]  the kids? It's not the Ritalin. It's something else. An adult was on it.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:12.240]  Adderall. Adderall. Right. And I, I took half a one that one of my friends have been on
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.960]  since high school. And I literally was out of my mind speeding for the next 12 hours
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:22.120]  and had was hung over. You would need that. That was horrible. Well, they say it makes
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:28.360]  a hyper person calm bull. Right. I was, it was horrible. I, and I'm a full grown man
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:32.400]  and I took the dose a kid would take. I didn't take the whole pill, right? I mean, because
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:36.800]  I've tested this stuff, you know, that's like the new marijuana. I've smoked it just to
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:39.800]  see what it does. Like the police do. I mean, it knocks you on your butt.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:44.440]  Yeah. I mean, not like the old days back in the seventies when I grew up, man, I tell
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.960]  you, I'm not saying to criminalize it because that lets them control a black market, but
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.400]  also don't promote the whole marijuana culture. Right. And then the marijuana folks get mad
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:54.400]  at me. No, I don't think it's the savior of the planet. I'm sorry. No, it's not. It
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.880]  has a lot of medical uses that are real. Yeah. I mean, as far as cancer treatment, I think
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.240]  this got some highly efficacious, but living in mom's basement is its main achievement.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:05.680]  Right. Right. Yes. So some of the other songs we're going to play, we're going to play like
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.160]  shiny star from earth when fire just to like get people motivated to get out and be that
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.040]  shiny star in the community. Because I, the reason I'm saying it's not just for doctors.
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.880]  I want lay people to go back to have this knowledge to empower them to take the action
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.000]  to start spreading this because we've got to do it. That it's a grassroots movement.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.160]  We don't have the same power that mainstream media has, but we're beginning to get it.
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:32.600]  Dr. Billy DeMoss is our guest, the founder of Cal Jam. It's ideas like this that can
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:37.360]  help save our planet and awaken humanity. We'll be back in 70 seconds, third hour straight
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:48.800]  ahead. Thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:54.800]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart shaped boxes filled with delicious
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:59:00.240]  candy. What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.480]  and individual empowerment? I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.120]  being empowered. The establishment is the opposite. That's why they spike our water
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:12.720]  with fluoride and GMO estrogen, mimicers and the rest of the garbage. Info Wars is striking

[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:16.880]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:42.200]  and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got two more segments
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:49.120]  left with our guest Dr. Billy DeMoss info wars.com forward slash Cal Jam or follow the banners
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.560]  to find the limited tickets that are left, but they've got them spaced out at the gala
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:58.480]  down in the front rows and also up in the gallery. So there's a smattering of tickets,
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.240]  a full spectrum of tickets still available, but I predict it will sell out very very quick
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:07.080]  so you can sign up for the live stream as well and watch it anywhere in the world and
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:11.680]  help support these type of events that believe me the system is definitely scared of. This
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:15.760]  is a short segment, long segment coming up. We're going to be taking calls after our guest
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:22.720]  leaves us. They passed the FCC regs. Congress didn't. The FCC refused to testify to Congress.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.680]  The chairman, they just did what they wanted. Another executive power grab. The name's protecting
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.440]  the web. Hillary Clinton supports it. What does that tell you? Will we see the 322 pages?
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:35.840]  We'll find out the toll free number to join us on that issue and everything else we've
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:45.400]  raised. First time callers 800-259-9231 800-2599-231. Doc, we only got four minutes to break or
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.800]  so. You've got the floor on the issue of some of your heroes you wanted to talk about.
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.440]  I also want to talk about one of my favorite speakers will be D. Harrison, who's the most
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:59.040]  published chiropractor when it comes to corrective care. It's just we have this epidemic and
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:05.080]  I wanted him to talk about the epidemic of just this forward head posture. I mean, I
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:10.280]  go through the airport and it's literally, you see everybody's so addicted to, you know,
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.080]  their phones and, you know, that's it. I've really never heard of this mic. Well, yeah.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.200]  So what we try to do is teach you things to do to counteract that. So I'm really excited.
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:22.320]  What do they call that slouch? It has a name and then... Typhosis. There's a name of the
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:27.640]  back hump. Oh, yeah. Dowager hump. Yep. Yeah, they're sexy, huh? Yeah. Mine is like 80%
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.200]  going. Okay, good. I've got to really work on, yeah. That's why surfing is good because
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.600]  it... Problem is, I look like a really arrogant one. I actually see nothing I'm supposed to,
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:37.520]  I guess it's how... I mean, this is what I really look like. You can do that though.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.480]  You look good like that. I mean, this is what... But I mean, you can't get a suit big enough.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.240]  My shoulders and chest are ridiculous. But this is it. Here, I'll just sit here normal.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:50.240]  Yeah. I also wanted to talk about Jeff Hayes because I think he's great on your show. Yeah.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.800]  Because I mean, he... I put that... He's got... Cajones, can I say that on your show?
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:56.240]  Wave-os. Wave-os. He's got big wave-os. Walnuts.
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:02.200]  He took a full page out in the Wall Street Journal, kind of in Obama's face, about this
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:07.480]  whole vaccine initiative, about the GMO, about Big Pharma. And I think... No, I don't think.
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:12.480]  It's a great film for everybody to get a chance to watch. He's got it streaming live now.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.200]  And by the way, we sell Doctrine. It's funny you mentioned it. We sell Doctrine. We should get
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:19.160]  BOT on there too. I want to get BOT, yeah, in the worst store. I think you just go to
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:24.640]  BOTmovie.com. You can watch that movie for free. Awesome. BOTmovie.com. He's streaming it.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:27.840]  Yeah. That's what I love about you guys. I do the same thing. We sell the DVD if you want to
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:31.080]  support us, but we just give the films away for free because that's the real joy.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:37.080]  We've got to get it out, man. We're going to lose everything. This is a war. It's a huge war.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:41.920]  Why do you think these globalists want to suppress us? Well, obviously, I know why.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.520]  Isn't it a depopulation issue? That's what I like about chiropractors. You guys are
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:53.080]  pro-human, the globalists are anti-human. Right. And they want to decrease the population down
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:59.040]  to $500 million. That's the bottom line. The thing is, why is it such conspiracy theory when
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:04.160]  they openly say it? Yeah. When they openly say it and you bring stuff up like geoengineering or
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:08.880]  different topics, we won't talk about those topics because I don't want to ostracize myself any
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:15.200]  further than I already have. To us, it's so blatantly obvious. Why is it so hard for some
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.320]  people just to grasp some of these things? Because that's why women would get in the car with Ted
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.400]  Bundy. He just was wearing a suit and it was a nice little Volkswagen on-threatening. People
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:28.720]  just can't believe it's happening. The history of chiropractic is so interesting. Can you
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.680]  briefly give us the history of it when we come back? Yeah, we can do that. I would be honored to
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:37.480]  do that. I don't think I've ever met a chiropractor who wasn't more awake than the general public or
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:44.040]  wasn't super awake. My little nephew, Cole, 16 years old, is more awake than 95% of adults out
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:49.280]  there. So understand who are the leaders of the proto-chiropractic movement, that every time I
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:53.320]  turn around, the people fighting the new order of chiropractors, I want to find out why statistically,
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:05:00.040]  just from my own experiences, that is the most awake group stay with us. For all of recorded

[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.280]  Dr. Billy DeMonst is our guest, the founder of CaliJAM. We'll be speaking there the last few
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:38.400]  days of March, the 27th and 29th. It goes for three days and I'm speaking on the second day.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:45.440]  CaliforniaJAM, you can find out more at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com. William,
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:52.720]  John, Joe, Phillip, Dave and others, your calls are coming up after our guest leaves us. The FCC chief
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:59.440]  is refusing to still talk to Congress after he put regulations through, won't testify,
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.440]  and last time I checked, you guys are looking, right? They will not, they have not released
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:12.720]  the 320 pages yet, correct? Yeah, so we're ferreting that out. This is unbelievable. I would search
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:19.680]  in FCC 322 in Google News and see if that's anywhere. That is a major issue. I mean,
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:26.640]  this is so dastardly now. They do it in secret. Obama's behind it. George Soros gives 196 million
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:31.520]  with the Ford Foundation for disinfo to get leftist grips, who mean well, they think they're
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:37.760]  protecting the Internet when all this does is put the government over it. Unbelievable,
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:45.440]  and now he still won't testify before Congress. That is mind blowing. We have another video,
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.400]  police confront open carry actives for engaging in constitutional BS. I can't say the word.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:57.520]  That's just some of it. I don't even know what to say anymore. It is just crazy. This world
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:04.000]  is going nuts, Billy. Hell in a handbag, baby. The history of chiropractic, as we were talking
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:11.440]  about earlier, so many times it's chiropractors and their associates and allied health type people
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:18.640]  that are fighting tyranny, and they would be clashed in many cases as kind of leftist or moon
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:23.680]  beaming, but that's not really what's happening. Well, it's just, I mean, we're more aware because
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:29.520]  we have a completely different paradigm of health. I mean, we're not into drugging every problem that
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:34.000]  a person has, and I think that gives us greater clarity and it gives us a chance to actually
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.480]  realize what's going on. I mean, most chiropractors are highly anti-vaccine. I mean, so from the very
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:45.840]  begin, our kids aren't being poisoned and maimed and dumbed down, in my opinion. But you were
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:49.680]  saying earlier, but they're also into... They're super health stuff. Right. Yeah,
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:54.400]  nutraceuticals. We're also into just the lifestyle. I mean, I juice every day. I use
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.920]  a Vitamix every day. All those things to help contribute to elevate my health, not treat disease.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:04.000]  It's all about... And you've got the testosterone of an 18-year-old. Well, I didn't know that till
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.600]  today. You guys told me that, so... I mean, you knew it was 1400. You should know... I just know
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.680]  that was a great number. Like, just Dr. Elliot Thorpe told me that. That was like 1400. She
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.400]  wanted to know what I was doing, so you said she hadn't seen one that high in a while. Maybe that
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:22.720]  explains why some of my hair fell out. Yeah, something tells me you already have high testosterone.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:29.440]  The third chiropractic goes back to... It was founded in 1895. And it was all about just
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.760]  helping people. And then the chiropractors started actually going to jail for practicing
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:39.120]  medicine, which we never ever wanted to practice medicine. We'd given people an alternative to
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:45.280]  medicine. And basically, we're trying to teach people to live a different lifestyle
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:48.800]  than the allopathic lifestyle, which is great for emergency and crisis care.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:55.200]  Well, I tell you, I'm excited about what you're doing. I can't wait to speak at CalGEM. Now,
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.000]  obviously, it's going to sell out. So if people don't want to go or can't get tickets right now,
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.280]  they should go sign up for the two-plus-day event, all these incredible speakers,
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:09.760]  to be able to sit there and watch it and archive it and have it. Because it's also important
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.920]  to financially support these events. It is not cheap to put these on. I've done myself...
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:17.680]  No, no, no. That's not cheap. And there's so much time that myself and Jane have put into
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:24.560]  this event. I mean, it's a full-time job. And I'm just asking people that come just to support it.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.560]  And it's just a mere pit. It's what you're paying to be there. But at the same time,
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:32.240]  we have to create this movement and resistance. And everybody that comes...
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.200]  With the network.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:38.560]  Yeah, comes and has the most amazing time. Because it's not only the information,
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:43.280]  it's a celebration. And everybody's, you know, hugging. And it's just a love fest. And people
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.040]  come and we have two different parties, the gallery, and we have a disco party one night.
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.240]  We have three different bands. It's a great time for people to come. And it's in California,
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.400]  which doesn't hurt. I mean, I was on the beach yesterday with 75. I've surfed in 63-degree
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:00.640]  water. It's a great time to come to California for some of these people that live up in,
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:04.960]  you know, the tundra of Wisconsin or something. It gives them a chance to take a little...
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.640]  Take a vacation once in a while, too.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.400]  Absolutely. Speaking of the tundra, I misspoke earlier and Jacari corrected me out in the home.
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.400]  Thank God. I love having him in there on the show to pop in and stuff breaks. So he's not just a
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.800]  reporter and an anchor. He's also wants to work on the show. So we appreciate it. He's in there
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.880]  doing a great job. He said, hey, you're wrong. Joe Biggs. And some of the other guys were telling
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:29.920]  me, too. Joe Biggs and Josh are not gone. The airports are shut down in Chicago from the record
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.480]  snow and all the rest of it. So they're going to fly out later to investigate the secret gulag.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:39.440]  But there they are claiming now that global warming is going to kill everybody. And again,
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:44.160]  obviously, climate change is real. It's always happening. And it becomes this left, right debate.
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:48.320]  But now scientists are in the Guardian saying, no, there's weather modification going on.
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:53.360]  That might be what's doing stuff. Do we ever think about weather weapons?
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:56.960]  And that's going to be at the conference as well. Right. With Dane Wiginton on G.O.N.G.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:00.800]  We've got a few minutes left here. Other points you'd like to get into.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:06.640]  I mean, I think we've had everything pretty much. I mean, if people want to come and really learn
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:11.840]  really learn so many more things that they can do and apply to their lives to increase their health
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:17.600]  and vibration and also, again, things that they can do in their own communities to teach more people
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:23.840]  about things that both you and I need. We've talked about. It's just important for us collectively
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:29.440]  to come together as a human race to perpetuate and sustain this planet for our children and
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:35.120]  future generations. Well, when you talk about vibration, when I was 10, 11 years old, had a
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.200]  bad attitude sometimes. I'd say, dad, why is everybody like you? Why do people give you free
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.800]  stuff at restaurants? Why do women at checkout counters try to get your phone number? And
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:48.560]  why does everybody like you so much? And then people are rude and mean to me. And he said,
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:52.720]  because I'm smiling and have a good attitude and putting that off. Right. And he goes, you know,
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.480]  sound like you go to a football pep rally. Everybody gets excited. You feel that energy.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.200]  He goes, that's spirit. Right. And he goes, whether it's pheromones or letting off, whatever,
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.600]  you've got to have a good attitude. And that's the difference between somebody who has this
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.440]  bad attitude about everything. Somebody who has a good attitude. When I bring out all this negative
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:10.640]  stuff, it's not because I'm being negative. It's like saying, we have a wonderful world full of
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:15.680]  great people that God gave us. Of course. We don't want the bad guys with all their fear and all
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.320]  their garbage to take over. We're covering what's bad, but saying we can change it. We can stop it.
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:25.680]  Right. Because there's way more of us than there are them. That's how we're going to win this war.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:33.600]  Well, there's, there's certainly scared. Well, that's good to know. Sometimes I get scared.
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:38.080]  What about you? You know, every time I start getting it, it's mainly like a fire under my
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:42.720]  butt. I just want to take action. I get scared that I'm not living to my potential. I get scared.
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.120]  Sometimes I leave her at, you know, five, six o'clock. Sometimes I stay on here till midnight
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:50.480]  working. I haven't done that in a long time, just because the family stuff I've been having to deal
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.360]  with a lot of other issues, but then more executive things I have to do. But I would just,
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:02.640]  sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and go write an article or go climb up, climb a
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:07.040]  billboard and spray paint. I'm joking. I don't do that. You know, it's a big vaccine billboard.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.400]  No, that's somebody else in the office. I'm sorry. I'm joking. No, but sometimes it just,
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:19.360]  I get spurred into action, put up 500 info wars, you know, bumper stickers over city propaganda.
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:24.000]  Oops. I mean, I didn't do that. I'm sorry. I'm gonna be like Pinocchio here in a minute.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.320]  Yeah, exactly. But I mean, I physically go out and take action. I talk when I'm in a grocery
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.280]  store line, right? When I'm where you go. Yeah. And it's not work. I can't stop. It's not work.
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:40.080]  That's when people call me now. I'm not a workaholic. It's, I get up the minute I get up
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.480]  to the minute I go to bed, I get up at seven and I go to bed sometimes at two o'clock in the morning.
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:50.000]  And it's just living and breathing this stuff because you've got this inner drive and this
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.680]  purpose to get people to understand what both you and I know. Well, that's what I pick up around you
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:59.280]  and Dr. Group. I mean, I hadn't met you at senior videos and heard some of your great speeches,
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:04.000]  but as soon as I met you, it was like the energy was just so positive and good. And I think more
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.760]  and more, I got negative for about 10 years, thought they were going to come after me any
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:11.760]  minute, which they were. So I just sort of eat whatever I wanted to not Karen drinking too much
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:16.800]  beer, you know, being a good father. But other than that, I was living a horrible life. Right.
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:21.280]  And now we need you, man, talking to group and others in the last two years and Dr. Wallach
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:26.000]  and young Jebedy and fours health.com. I've started turning that ship around. And now it's
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.160]  getting easier and easier every week. I see the changes. I'm getting better changes in a week
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.760]  now that I would get in a month before. And is that how it works? It accelerates the change?
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:39.440]  Yeah, I mean, it's not going to happen overnight, obviously, you know, you've got to start implementing
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:44.160]  things slowly. I try to teach people in my practice that you want to slowly implement because if people
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:47.040]  try to do everything all at once and they're going to get frustrated, they're going to stop doing it.
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.480]  So it's a matter of just maybe eating a little bit more fruit once a week or going out for a 30
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:58.960]  minute walk and, you know, get adjusted more frequently and get better rest and sleep. And
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:03.680]  the thing is once you start that that ship turns around, like you said, it's hard for you to go
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.440]  back the other way because then you start to feel like you used to feel. I mean, there's a certain
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:12.080]  clarity that you have in your life. If you live this lifestyle that we've been talking about.
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.280]  And once you start to put in the crap and garbage like last night, I had a little cheese for dinner.
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:22.160]  I can feel the fact that I had dairy products, but sometimes when you're on the road, also the mold
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:26.160]  is off of the world record chart that they say the worst ever in Austin, the mold right now.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:31.520]  Is it? It's black mold that grows on the oak trees. It is just everywhere. I think it was cheese for
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:36.080]  me. Well, no, I mean, exactly. They say the cheese triggers the histamines, right? So I think the
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:40.800]  cheese and the mold. Yeah. I mean, I just know, I mean, I can tell, oh, that's mold. I look on the
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:44.960]  news mold, record level. I go, oh, that's Cedar. So can we get you out surfing when you're in
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:50.400]  California? I'm kind of a big clutch, but I'll try. All right. We'll get you a big board.
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:57.360]  Stand up for the TV viewers though, because you look like you look like like a commando or something.
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:02.320]  And you said a secret service dude. I said a CIA assassin. Yeah, okay. Actually,
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.960]  when you see these big guys with shave heads, those are the ones you gotta be scared of.
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:08.160]  But when I've been like a Bilderberg group of events and stuff, the guys that actually cause
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:13.360]  you big problems look just like you. And I'm dressed just like you. You learn these types
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.360]  and government types, but no, no, no. It's just that you got to watch the wiry guys that are,
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.680]  you know, all muscle and that have a friendly face. Like the fake tough guys are all acting tough
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:25.040]  and the guy acting real friendly is when you got to look out for. I don't mean you so much. Right,
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:28.480]  right, right. I'm just saying the whole friendly lover did feeling good in your skin. Right.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:34.240]  You fit the archetype of like a CIA killer. That's a good thing. People won't pick on me

[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:09.520]  Well, the FCC chairman has been celebrating for an hour and a half the ramming through of their
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:16.240]  still secret internet takeover plan with George Soros and the Ford Foundation, the usual suspects
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:21.120]  financing it. I'm your host Alex Jones. We just joined us. Well, I told the guys,
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:25.520]  I said, watch, I've never learned enemy tactics. If we don't make a big deal about this, they won't
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:29.120]  release it for months. If we make a big deal, you heard me on there talk about this, they'll
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:33.840]  release it tomorrow. They want to just say, we save the internet ding dong, the witch is dead,
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.560]  the witch, witch, witch, the witch, witch, witch, ding dong, the wicked witch is dead. No, the wicked
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:45.040]  witch just got the feds to be able to power grab the whole internet. I mean, look out. And Ajipi,
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:56.000]  the one of the commissioners said, quote, immediately release a 332 page internet
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.720]  regulation plan publicly and allow the American people a reasonable period of not less than 30
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.360]  days to carefully study it. That request was denied. We'll post the document here when it's
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:11.600]  available. And what publication is that out of? That's out of NPR. So of course, if you're not
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:18.480]  going to release it before they pass it regulatory, why ever release it? It's like Obama said, I'll
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:25.040]  never sign the end AA. 2011 turned out his lawyers had written it and he was twisting arms to get it
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:33.760]  passed. And then he signed it on December 31 at 11 o'clock at night from Hawaii. So no one would
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:42.800]  notice. These are criminal tactics. Now, I really wish that Joe Biggs and crew were able to get
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:49.440]  into Chicago to cover this. The global cooling with the sun right now cooling off is so bad that
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:53.760]  they're in feet of snow. Every one of their airports is shut down. The flights are canceled.
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:59.360]  This is a disaster. We'll get them in this weekend. We'll cover it Sunday live with live feeds.
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:04.560]  And we need to have live feeds because it'll be a major incident though. They end up arresting Biggs
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:11.280]  or Josh Owens. And you've seen Josh with the feds, amen, guns that I'm threatened to shoot.
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.680]  I'm still walk forward with this camera. We've got these guys have a major, major guts.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.880]  But here it is. Gestapo tactics. New London Guardian article at US police black site. Imagine
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.720]  these headlines. Biggest paper in Europe. It's not just the biggest paper in England. It's
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:30.560]  undoubtedly the biggest paper in Europe. The English paper everybody reads. Because English
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:33.840]  is the second language across Europe. That's how they all communicate with each other. If you're
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:37.600]  German and French, you don't communicate in German and French. You communicate in English.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:41.600]  That's why they don't want the poor illegals to ever learn English. They have these programs to
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.720]  stop them learning English because it's such a boon to help them. Totally sick, but side issue.
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:54.320]  Gestapo tactics at US police black site. Ring alarm from Chicago to Washington. And then they
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:01.120]  have video and photos of police in military gear with a mask, basically threatening them not to
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:08.640]  take pictures. I mean, you can't make this up. This is Illinois where they tried to pass a law
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:16.960]  life in prison for videoing police. Remember that? I mean, this is so entitled and screwed up. And
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:22.720]  then they have famous tortures. But that's in my stack from yesterday. If somebody can pull it,
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:28.560]  thank you. Famous tortures, it's all highlighted. Richard highlighted it for me yesterday,
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:33.760]  who've been sent to run torture operations working with Rumsfeld from Chicago, and then
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:40.240]  they come back to this facility. You cannot make that up and see all these cops probably think
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:45.600]  they're good guys. They watched Jack Bauer for 10 years on 24, where he tortured someone every
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:53.520]  episode with drills or whatever the case was to always stop the terrorist. And now they take you,
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.400]  non terror related, be bad enough if you were supposed terrorist, and they take you to a black
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:04.720]  site. And let me tell you, I was in Chicago in 2006 at a meeting speaking, and we were on the
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.200]  street videotaping an interview just with a hand on camera and the cops walked over and said,
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:14.720]  don't videotape on the street. And I said, listen, I'm just, you know, doing like a five
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.320]  an interview with this guy, we're not blocking anything. And he says, he just said, listen,
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:21.760]  I'm not going to tell you again. And I could tell he was a criminal. I mean, I knew somebody was
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:25.280]  serious. He wanted to hurt me. He said a nonchalant way. He's looking at me, he goes, listen,
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:30.880]  don't do it again, put that camera up, you're not going to like what happens. And I could tell he
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:36.000]  wanted to hurt me. He knew who I was. He was a gangster. And I went, man, I said, I'm going to
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.280]  go down the street into this interview because I got stuff to do. And I decided not to fight this
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:43.840]  battle now. And by that, he was arguing with me. I said, I just said, Hey, your kids got to live
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:48.080]  in this country too. Are you threatening my kids? And I go, you know what I did, you're threatening
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:53.520]  your kids. And he said, I just, he goes, you did the right thing, Mac, not turning that camera back
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:29:03.920]  on. I mean, what a thug. What North Korea, man. I mean, holy Toledo. What a dishonorable sack of
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:08.880]  traitorous puss that you disgrace everybody else in the uniform. And let me tell you, Chicago's got
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:14.800]  a problem. And I'll tell you why they got a problem. It's a bunch of hard working immigrants from
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:18.960]  all over the world. Even when Chicago, I started by Irish and German and Polish and Czech and,
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:22.880]  you know, then all the Mexican immigrants and the Italians and all of them, it's a really cool city
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:29.440]  and everybody's real nice in ways. I like Chicago has a good feel in a lot of its areas. LA has
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:34.400]  a horrible one to me. Sorry. South of that feels great. North of that feels great. But it's because
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:40.160]  the people are so nice. They put up with it. So see, it's almost like they've had hospitality
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:45.920]  to the tyranny and the cops think they're God and it's a shame. It's disgusting. We'll be back. Stay
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:53.760]  with us. We're on the March black sites in America run. I mean, come on, Alex Jones and the GCN
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:30:00.160]  where's the US media? That's why we're in so much trouble. Where are they? The month of February
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:06.160]  is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart shaped boxes filled with delicious candy. What if we,
[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:11.760]  the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment.
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:16.240]  I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual being empowered. The establishment
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:20.160]  is the opposite. That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen,
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:24.800]  mimicers and the rest of the garbage. Info Wars is striking back in the month of February with

[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:17.760]  You let one ant stand up to us then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:25.920]  us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life. It's not about food.
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:35.920]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:41.160]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:49.400]  Well, the huge news that I'm going to your phone calls, FCC votes yes on strongest net
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:52.080]  neutrality rules, but they won't release what the rules are.
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:56.200]  I mean, this is a giant screw job because they want to just announce the FCC protected
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:59.960]  it when it really just took it over.
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:00.960]  That's the tactic.
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:02.320]  You know, they call it Obamacare free health care.
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:07.400]  It's the opposite and let's insurance companies take over health care so they can really hammer
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:14.480]  everybody and screw everybody over and now you're seeing the results of it.
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:18.080]  We've now in deeply investigated the article that shocked me an hour and a half ago that
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:20.480]  I saw go up at drudgereport.com.
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:27.280]  We haven't linked up at infowars.com with some added background and videos for folks
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:38.640]  to get the full picture and right now we are adding some to this story so that folks understand
[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:40.720]  exactly what's happening.
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:50.280]  That 223 is a very versatile round, but for game hunting, it doesn't go out as far.
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:55.160]  It starts losing its trajectory and so these particular green tips as they call them that
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:00.600]  they call armor piercing have a tungsten tip and more lead in them so that they'll go further.
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:03.720]  So it's not designed to be a quote cop killer, but it doesn't matter.
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.240]  All bullets are cop killers.
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:09.840]  So once you start banning certain bullets calling them cop killers, it's Katie bar the doors.
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:13.840]  There's articles up on infowars.com right now.
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:18.760]  I want to get our own articles out explaining how this is a camel's nose under the tent
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:24.560]  flap like everything else they do to set the precedent that by executive action, Obama
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:26.960]  can restrict guns and ammo.
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.160]  There's no law here.
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:33.240]  They're just doing this comprende.
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:34.520]  So it's on.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:39.440]  Notice Obama's moving on every front with executive power, open borders, internet takeover,
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:46.880]  oil switches, energy wars, military operations and the Republican leadership in Congress
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:49.360]  went along with this and said they wouldn't block it.
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:57.520]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com with that info because there's a war on for
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:58.520]  your mind.
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:03.640]  I'm actually speechless at this point.
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:04.900]  Absolutely speechless at this point.
[02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:06.760]  It's all just moving into high gear.
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:09.360]  More is happening in a few months now than what happened in a year previously.
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:10.360]  More is happening in a year.
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:11.360]  What happened in 10 years?
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:14.720]  And it's just going to accelerate and accelerate every expert agrees.
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:18.000]  That's where we're going and they're getting ready for a total takeover.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.720]  They admit black sites, FEMA centers, emergency centers, establishment act, civilian inmate
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:24.840]  labor camp program.
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:29.320]  They got forced labor plans on the books and they've got them set up at army bases and
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.480]  listed at army.mil.
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:36.200]  And I sent all this to the talk show host five years ago that was saying I was a liar
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:41.000]  and then I learned from their people that their crew got the info and was like, yeah,
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  it's real.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  And the host said, no, it's not.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.800]  And went on air and said I was full of bull and showed some debunked FEMA camp that we
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:49.800]  hadn't reported on to say we were debunked.
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:53.080]  And I'm not even attacking those hosts, man.
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:58.680]  I want to get all these main line conservative hosts to save the country.
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:03.480]  I mean, if we all just start saying no, we're very close to the tipping point here.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.680]  In fact, I know a lot of these hosts are telling the truth and I'm more and more because they
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:11.480]  realize they're going to have to leave the country of the globalist when just because
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:15.240]  you claimed you were a conservative, just because you claimed you were a patriot, you're
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:17.160]  an enemy of the globalist.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:19.240]  You don't make deals with these people.
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:23.600]  How could anybody sleep at night working with the globalist and then thinking they're going
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:27.480]  to leave you alone?
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:31.240]  The only reason I'm still alive is the grace of God, your prayers, a lot of reasons.
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:34.840]  They don't want to highlight everything I've said and done, make me a martyr, blah, blah,
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:35.840]  blah.
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:38.600]  They just want to assassinate my name first.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:42.200]  They just want to destroy the idea of a liberty movement first.
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.440]  That's what we stand for.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:50.280]  Other activists, they're trying to destroy because we're all in this together.
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:59.080]  But one of the biggest reasons too is they know there's good people throughout the system
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:02.680]  that are watching and are leaking info on what the criminal government's doing.
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:07.040]  So what's scary is they've gone from trying to cover this stuff up in just the last five
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:10.800]  years to just admitting it now.
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:17.400]  I mean, they basically came out in Chile or was Argentina and admitted that the government
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:22.320]  was connected to killing that investigator that was about to go public.
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:26.640]  They just come out now and go, yeah, fluoride makes you depressed and fat and bad thyroid
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:36.000]  and suicide, top journals, top newspapers, and it still just stays in the water.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.120]  I mean, their tactic now is they can't cover it all up, so you say, yeah, black site, yeah,
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:41.120]  people have died in there.
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:45.160]  Yeah, we don't let you talk to lawyers or anyone know where you went sometimes for days.
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:47.480]  Yeah, yeah, it's total felony, totally illegal.
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:48.480]  We're just doing it.
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  Yeah, we're doing it.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:50.480]  That's right.
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:56.120]  And if they could Chicago eyes, we're on two stations in Chicago, so that's a paradox.
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:00.240]  We got two stations there, great listeners, awake people, but the system doesn't care.
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:09.240]  It's entrenched doing whatever it wants.
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:10.960]  But they're coming after all the alternative media.
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:15.400]  I'm going to your calls here in about 45 seconds, I just want to say this first.
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:19.160]  We have 20% off super male and super female vitality.
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:25.600]  The super male at current rates will sell out in about three, four days, and it looks
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:33.360]  like it'll be a couple weeks till we get more of the super male produced cold press prepared.
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:36.360]  We have enough super female to keep selling it for a few weeks.
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:38.200]  We're going to have to remanufacture that.
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:39.720]  We're in that process right now.
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:41.200]  So the sales been so successful.
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.040]  There's two days officially left in it.
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:46.480]  I may just continue it if it doesn't sell out in two days, you know, a couple more days
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:51.120]  till the super male is completely sold out.
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.020]  And you've heard the reviews, you've heard what it does, just try it.
[02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:57.640]  And then you know your support in the broadcast.
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:02.160]  Regardless, now it took me about a year and a half to get my tolerance up.
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:03.720]  I would take half the recommended dose.
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:05.360]  Now I take more than recommended dose.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:07.920]  You do what you want.
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:21.120]  But it's a whole bunch of known concentrated cold pressed stuff that knocks your socks off.
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:36.400]  We also have the free bottle of herbal defense, ancient defense herbal immunity booster by
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  right side.
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.560]  Our discount brand line that we're coming out with it's well-known documented concentrated
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:46.520]  organic herbs and other extracts, but that aren't super, super fancy pants and hard to
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:52.120]  get that are easy to source, we can give you it for $14.95, that similar formula is about
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:53.120]  $30.
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:54.120]  So it's about half off.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:58.000]  We're going to have an entire discount line called right side.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  Part of infowarslives.com.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.760]  You can get a free bottle of that when you get two bottles of the nascent iodine X2.
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:05.880]  There's no iodine like it out there.
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:10.500]  And quite frankly, the X2 is set to sell out of this sale continues because these sales
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:15.400]  go so well that then we don't produce enough, then we got to make enough, then we got too
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.400]  much.
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  We can't ever judge the public because we buy a bunch and nobody buys it and we don't
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.560]  have a lot and everybody buys it.
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:26.920]  There's no telling the public's taste, as has been said many, many times, but the public
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:30.680]  like stuff that works, we salute you and thank you for all your support because your support
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:34.440]  getting the nutraceuticals, the Made in America t-shirts, the videos, the books, the President
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:37.400]  Planet dot TV memberships, it funds this independent operation.
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  We don't get big global sponsors, so you have us sponsoring us with a high quality
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:42.400]  water filters.
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  That special ends in two days, 15% off the promo code water.
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:49.920]  Okay, let's go to William in North Carolina, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:55.920]  Well, since you just did a plug on your products, I've got a nice little slogan for SuperMail
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:56.920]  Vitality.
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:00.880]  I promise it's clean, but it goes something like this, do you want to wake up every morning
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:02.680]  with a great big smile?
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:03.680]  SuperMail Vitality.
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:13.360]  Hey, I've got a couple of ideas that I think would work really well for you and one would
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:20.840]  be a Terra Drive, okay, that you could sell as a product, an InfoWars Terra Drive and
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:25.600]  have it basically kind of a time capsule just in case the internet gets totally censored
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:28.920]  and have this Terra Drive totally packed with vital information.
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:32.800]  Or it could be a thumb drive with compressed stuff like key documents, key crimes of the
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:33.800]  globalist.
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:34.800]  Absolutely.
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.840]  Yeah, yeah, even the thumb drive, but you know, some documentaries, you know, they wouldn't
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:42.640]  even have to be yours because you can just download that stuff off YouTube, you know,
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.720]  have some of yours, have just some vital documentaries.
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:48.520]  That is a fabulous idea.
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:51.000]  We should produce like 30 of those.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:55.520]  It wouldn't mind any of you a whole Terra Drive, but hard drives with all of InfoWars,
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.200]  all our films, other key documents so that people have that information.
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:03.800]  Everybody should be saving stuff now though because we knew this was always coming, now
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:09.440]  it's here and I'm telling you, they're getting all this lined up and in law before they set
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.080]  off the weapons and blaming on the Patriots.
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:16.240]  And then my goodness, they got the police all dressed up for combat to play red code
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:18.080]  and I just don't think it'll be a very fun thing.
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:19.080]  What do you think?
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:22.320]  Yeah, I've been doing that very thing for the past several years.
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:26.200]  I've been downloading YouTube videos and PDFs and any kind of documentary I can find,
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:28.680]  but I got a couple other ideas for you.
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:34.920]  Another thing would be maybe a line InfoWars household because you know, the cleaning products
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:38.240]  everybody uses are totally toxic and, you know, full of garbage.
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:40.480]  So that might be something for you to consider.
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:45.400]  And then the other idea that I had was, you know, you talked about all these internet
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:49.960]  censorship tactics where they claim copyright and they censor a video because you used a
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:53.720]  clip of like Anderson Cooper or something from CNN.
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:59.760]  I think it'd be a good idea to make some YouTube videos that are actually playlist instead
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:04.120]  of a YouTube video because that way if you wanted to show a clip that you thought might
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:08.600]  be something they would try to censor it for, it would actually just be part of your playlist
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:10.640]  and then you could actually include footage.
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.640]  Exactly.
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:13.360]  I mean, the key is exposes as a Trojan horse.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:17.400]  Why aren't they releasing it even after they announced it so they can now lie and say what's
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:18.400]  in it?
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:20.720]  They're telling us what's in the book, but not letting us read it.
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:23.360]  It's just standard George Soros operation.
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:24.360]  Thank you so much, William.
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:25.360]  Great points.
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:27.280]  Let's go now to another caller.
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:29.120]  Let's talk to John in Canada.
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:32.640]  John, they're trying to pass a Patriot Act up there as well.
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:35.480]  The worldwide system moves forward against free humanity.
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:38.480]  Yes, it does, doesn't it?
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:45.280]  You have the FCC down there, and we have the CRTC up here, and with the new Terreville,
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:48.480]  they can suppress any alternate media.
[02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:53.640]  They actually say they can break in your house, do illegal things, shut down media.
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:55.920]  We were covering that legislation yesterday.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:57.560]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:59.240]  Even I can't believe they're actually doing it.
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:03.200]  I mean, they're really going to try to start rounding people up and stuff.
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.040]  It's going to get crazy.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:11.000]  The thing is, I looked at the history of the FCC, and the FCC was basically started by
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.440]  big corporations that wanted to push out these little independent radio stations that were
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.000]  all across America, right?
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.040]  So it's the same thing with the pharmaceutical industry, it's the same with everything.
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:25.560]  It's just America, I noticed that the government, your federal government, is actually a corporation
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:26.560]  that was incorporated.
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:27.560]  That's right.
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.000]  The big corporations can't get regular end of net neutrality, so now they're having the
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.720]  government act like they're trying to save it, and so the very Republicans that don't
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:40.200]  want net neutrality are now supposedly supporting this because it gives them what they want.
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:43.240]  It's a total screw job, and everybody's going to find out.
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:44.240]  Exactly.
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:48.880]  And this is how corporations treat people, right?
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:52.240]  So what can you do, right?
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:57.840]  Well, the problem with these predatory corporations is they're discrediting reasonable companies
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:45:59.120]  and free market.
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:02.960]  They're monopoly capitalists that are using government to shut down their competition,
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:04.320]  and people better get mad.
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:06.520]  It doesn't mean they're going to get this now.
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.800]  The FCC, let's get one thing clear, thanks for the call, John, great points.
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:12.880]  Let's get something clear here right now.
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:17.440]  They're not releasing these pages still so they can lie to everybody and tell them what
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:23.560]  was just passed, but it's worse than that.
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:28.080]  Congress is who makes law, not the FCC with some reg.
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:33.120]  Obama now says he's going to go after the bullets and the guns with announcements.
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:34.480]  This does that.
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:37.400]  The president executes the law, not the ATF.
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:42.760]  The FCC, the ATF, they're not the law givers.
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:47.880]  We elect our representatives, our servants, who then pass constitutional laws, which they
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:48.880]  don't.
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:50.000]  They're passing a bunch of garbage.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.760]  But they couldn't even get Congress to do this because the bill, or at least parts of
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:56.600]  it from committee, would be public.
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.160]  Just like the last six amnesty plans under Bush and Obama were secret.
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:04.240]  Senator Sessions, who's a hero in my view, has released it every time.
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:08.480]  Well, this time they won't give Congress the 320 pages, and now it hasn't been released.
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:10.080]  Why is that?
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:15.440]  Because they couldn't get this agenda through if they didn't have the public unaware of
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.440]  it.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:18.120]  And now, here's the bigger secret.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:23.200]  It shows how weak they are with all these global treaties and this FCC power grab that
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.240]  they still haven't released it.
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:31.360]  So Time Magazine and CNN can announce Obama saved the Internet, long live our king.
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:33.680]  It shows that the fight goes on.
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:38.240]  We need to make Congress move in and block this and go after companies that are lobbying
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:39.240]  for it.
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:40.240]  We're going to watch all this.
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:41.440]  We're going to give you the intel.
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:43.680]  This is the war for free speech.
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.040]  This is the war for the Internet you're seeing unfold right now.
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:50.000]  And that's the talking point for everybody because it's the truth.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.920]  This is a war on our free speech.
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:54.680]  And folks, if they get that, they're going to get the second.
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:55.680]  They're going to get the fourth.
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:57.680]  They're going to get the fifth, the tenth, the ninth.
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:59.080]  They're going to get everything.
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:00.160]  We're being usurped.
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:01.240]  We're being conquered.
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:04.280]  We're being overtaken right now.
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:11.160]  But we're kicking their butt on fluoride and GMO and homeschooling and 1,000 other fronts.
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:13.480]  Joe in New York, you're up next.
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:14.480]  Thanks for calling.
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:17.280]  Uh, FEMA region two, that is Alex.
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:18.280]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:19.280]  Formerly, New York.
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:20.280]  That is correct.
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:26.040]  I badgered my reps of trying to get them to vote being, I'll be in from New York, you
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:32.280]  know, need a lowly Elliot Angle Chuck Schumer, Christine Gillibrand, you know, basically
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:33.280]  a waste of time.
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:38.280]  Basically a toilet bowl full of, you know what, yeah, that is absolutely correct.
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:42.600]  And every issue that is pending with them is just like a wasted phone call for me when
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:43.600]  they do that.
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:50.000]  And, um, uh, my quick question is this, I, uh, I see the end of the Internet freedom
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  coming as we speak.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:56.920]  Um, what, what I'd like to do is once this show, the judge report shot down on record
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:48:58.080]  and now he funded this.
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:00.080]  What does that tell you?
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:04.080]  Well, George Soros, the character himself, I used to admire him.
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:09.440]  I was going for my MBA in banking and financing when he wrote books like, uh, uh, being ahead
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:12.680]  of the curve and how naive I was at that time.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:14.200]  Well, we were all naive once, brother.
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  So don't feel bad.
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.600]  Just, just, just your, your man to admit it.
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:18.600]  Yeah.
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:24.440]  Indeed, in fact, uh, you know, he's a just total tool joke and nobody knew he was a Nazi
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:25.440]  collaborator.
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:27.080]  That didn't come out until the late nineties.
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:29.880]  And then he came out and admitted it and said he wasn't sorry.
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:34.600]  Well, he's probably good friends with, uh, what's his name, uh, Prince Bernhardt of the
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:35.920]  field to build the burgers.
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:36.920]  Oh yeah.
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:39.320]  So that's probably the reason behind that.
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:41.120]  Anyway, I'm looking ahead.
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:46.320]  I see right now in the low, the calm before the storm, before they start tampering with
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:47.320]  the Internet as we know.
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:48.320]  I agree.
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:50.440]  And so the question is, why are they lining it all up now?
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:51.440]  Go ahead.
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:56.240]  No, actually, this is a medic question, uh, that, yes, uh, but one more, I do remember
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:02.680]  when mayor Bloomberg was running for mayor, they actually handed out radios to anyone
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:09.880]  for free with a Bloomberg radio station that was just up for him during the election time.
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:13.480]  So you would turn it on, it would be one station with a Bloomberg station, you'd listen to
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:16.840]  Bloomberg crap and then you could go vote for Bloomberg.
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:18.400]  I remember that.
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:23.640]  My idea is this, um, I'm sure the people are thinking about it too.
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:28.880]  Having an alternative Internet, maybe an underground Internet on a different frequency or different
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:31.320]  something or other that might be allowed.
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:35.560]  We should launch our own Manhattan project that's public, where everyone races to build
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:40.080]  alternatives for when their censorship comes in and then we'll have the jump on them.
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:41.080]  Absolutely.
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:43.400]  Plus the Internet was designed, so it's hard to shut down.
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:49.520]  If we use alternative systems and then that will basically, and don't ever use Internet
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:50.520]  too.
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:51.760]  That's their new fake Internet.
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:54.600]  Once they have that, that's when they'll try to kill the real web.
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:56.320]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:50:56.320 --> 02:50:57.320]  Great call, Joe.
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:27.280]  Well, Dave and others, you're straight ahead.
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:46.520]  Let's go.
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:48.160]  Let's go get some.
[02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:59.040]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653, that's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:00.040]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:01.600]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:03.160]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:05.960]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:08.200]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:12.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  case.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.920]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:20.720]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:27.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.280]  This is an alert.
[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:33.440]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:37.440]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church or warehouse.
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:42.280]  A general steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:43.280]  construction.
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:46.560]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:49.800]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:58.360]  Call 866-91-Steel, 866-91-Steel, that's 866-917-8335.
[02:52:58.360 --> 02:53:01.840]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less
[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:04.920]  you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:09.280]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:12.920]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:13.920]  Not fun.
[02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:18.040]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:22.320]  able to gain back some strength, muscle and speed of recovery.
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:26.680]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer
[02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:27.680]  for you.
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:28.680]  My name is Errol.
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:30.160]  I'm 74 years old.
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:32.560]  You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing.
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:36.960]  I play pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement, I have
[02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:40.440]  more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:53:40.440 --> 02:53:45.200]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:54:13.200]  using One World Way.
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:20.400]  Everybody, and he decides who to pray and who to blame.
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:24.720]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:28.800]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:34.680]  You could feel the man coming around when the man comes around.
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:35.800]  We're living in epic times.
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:38.200]  I don't want to hear from anybody that is boring.
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:40.200]  The hands on your arm will stand up.
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  I mean, look at this headline.
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:42.200]  I didn't get to today.
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:44.200]  I'm going to do a special report for the nightly news on this.
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:48.520]  I did about, what, 10 minutes of commentary after Gikari last night?
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:51.560]  Then I wasn't even aware that Gikari had covered the gun issue.
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.000]  I knew he covered it with Cargill, but I didn't hear the whole interview.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:00.120]  Full-body transplants will be possible within two years, says controversial surgeon.
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:03.720]  The Italian believes the technique could save the lives, and he is a top surgeon, and people
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:07.520]  riddled with cancer whose nerves and muscles have wasted away, but then there'll be a huge
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.640]  market in getting bodies.
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:14.200]  The world's first full-body transplant, in which someone's head would be sewn to the
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:17.680]  donor body, could take place in just two years, according to controversial surgeon.
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:18.760]  We'll cover this more.
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:21.240]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:22.240]  Philip and then Dave.
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:24.480]  Philip, you're on the air from Virginia.
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:25.480]  Welcome.
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:26.480]  Thank you.
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:36.400]  In the run-up to this tyrannical maneuver by the FCC, so-called net neutrality, I thought
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:43.520]  I heard, I didn't read it, but I thought I heard some information come out about this,
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:50.240]  basically that the White House was consulting with the Communist Chinese.
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:51.240]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:57.120]  That was in AP Reuters, Leningardian, the White House in Zuckerberg, brought them there.
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:02.280]  They met with the Chinese Internet censorship czar, and he endorsed Chinese censorship while
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:07.280]  putting out the, I'm Charlie, ebdo thing.
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:08.280]  So I love free speech.
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:11.320]  I want to take your free speech, and my users are dumb efforts.
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:15.480]  And yes, I mean, it was in the news yesterday, this is Chinese style net censorship.
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:18.720]  But again, they're just going to protect the Internet.
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:21.560]  People go, but they say they're going to protect it, and they said they were going to give you
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:24.840]  free health care, and they weren't going to come after your guns, and raising the debt
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.320]  limit didn't raise the debt limit.
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:30.080]  They're a pack of liars, and now they won't release the provisions.
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:32.360]  Can you imagine what's in them?
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:36.480]  They want to pair it for weeks, how wonderful it is, and how great it is, and how it gives
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:39.680]  you free lollipops, and tucks you in at night.
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:42.720]  And then when it finally comes out, it's going to be a nightmare like Obamacare.
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  Just watch.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:49.800]  All right, man, well, I appreciate that, because it's not an urban legend, and that is confirmed.
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:50.800]  No, it's not.
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:57.240]  The way to find it is Zuckerberg meets with Chinese Internet head, or censor head, and
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:02.160]  then you'll read and met with White House officials, and you're like, that, that, that,
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:06.680]  that psycho sound, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, it's like alert.
[02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:09.280]  This is serious.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:12.080]  And again, it's every week now, some new nightmare.
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:13.080]  What's coming next?
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:17.680]  It's like we're going down the roller coaster here, into the abyss, Dave and Canada, last
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:19.880]  caller, sorry to John and Josh and Gene.
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:20.880]  I'm just out of time.
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:22.360]  Go ahead, Dave, you'll be our tail gunner.
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:25.360]  Good, brother.
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:28.920]  Yeah, I just like to bring this to your attention here.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:33.000]  We've got our old pal Bill Gates, he's been up in Canada yesterday, and he's meeting with
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.480]  Stephen Harper and the other two leaders of our opposition parties.
[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:41.800]  And it's all to do with the UN's millennium development that's said to be implemented
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:44.880]  this fall, plus there's new guidelines to be set.
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:45.880]  Yep.
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:48.200]  And this is all agenda 21, global government treaty, yep.
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:53.880]  It's all about improved data collection and vital statistics, keeping track of everybody
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:57.160]  if this doesn't tie into population agenda, I don't know what does.
[02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:00.560]  Oh, they're getting everybody on a standardized system, just like every car producer in the
[02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:07.080]  world, except for some Eastern European country I read about, every car producer in the world
[02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:09.000]  has boxes to tax you in them now.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.520]  It's all unified continuity of agenda.
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:14.160]  I wonder how this ties into Codex Elementary as well.
[02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:19.840]  Oh, it does, when they can surveil everything, they can control it and cut it off.
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:23.560]  After this, Harper comes out on the news and he says, for God's sake, we have a responsibility
[02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:24.560]  to set an example.
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:27.800]  It's all right, medical interventions work and we have to do this.
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:30.080]  I see legislation coming down the pipe here.
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:31.080]  It's all over the news.
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:32.080]  That's it, brother.
[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:33.080]  Absolutely.
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:34.080]  God bless you.
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:35.080]  Sorry to everybody else.
[02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:36.080]  We're out of time.
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:37.080]  Great job, crew.

[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:39.080]  live.
[02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:42.080]  But don't count info wars always to be here.
[02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:44.000]  I've been warned and everybody forever.
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.080]  They're coming after all your freedoms.
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:47.080]  Stand with us.

[02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:50.080]  Alex Jones here.
[02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:54.360]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:59.280]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:58:59.280 --> 02:59:03.680]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and
[02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:09.160]  even GMOs, introducing the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend crafted with
[02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:14.880]  over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what
[02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:18.120]  experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:23.160]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the
[02:59:23.160 --> 02:59:28.280]  most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm
[02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:30.160]  of herbal immunity.
[02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:35.200]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting
[02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:37.880]  new advances in nutraceutical science.
[02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:41.480]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your family.
