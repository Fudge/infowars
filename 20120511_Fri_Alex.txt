[01:02.960 --> 01:08.760]  coming up we are going to be covering the rapidly deteriorating Fukushima
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.680]  Daiichi nuclear power plant situation in Japan where we have literally thousands
[01:14.680 --> 01:21.000]  of spent fuel rods that are now just accessing or releasing radiation into
[01:21.000 --> 01:29.240]  the open air and a another criticality event a meltdown is possible an
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.120]  earthquake or a tsunami could unleash another massive plume of radiation that
[01:34.120 --> 01:41.760]  within 10 days would land in North America spreading cesium 137 a very toxic
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.120]  obviously radioactive substance with a 30-year half-life all across North
[01:46.120 --> 01:51.360]  America and I've looked at the wind patterns and no no state in America is
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.840]  safe from that that would drop cesium 137 everywhere from Alaska down to Miami
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.440]  and and and everywhere in between and to join us today and talk about that we do
[02:02.440 --> 02:07.920]  have Arnie Gunderson he's going to be joining us in the at the bottom of this
[02:07.920 --> 02:14.600]  hour to cover his view he is of course a an expert on the nuclear industry and
[02:14.600 --> 02:18.920]  he's going to tell us what his view is on the warnings and what might happen and
[02:18.920 --> 02:23.600]  what we can do to help stop this situation remember it's not just us
[02:23.600 --> 02:28.560]  raising the alarm about this also US senator Ron Wyden from Oregon has raised
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.960]  the alarm on this issue and kudos to senator Wyden for taking the step of
[02:33.960 --> 02:37.360]  actually going to visit the facility and then spreading the alarm so we're
[02:37.360 --> 02:41.160]  going to cover that then we've also got after that in the second hour dr.
[02:41.160 --> 02:45.120]  Lynn Saputo is going to be joining us to talk about how we can protect
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.080]  ourselves from radiation so there are some things that we can do in terms of
[02:50.080 --> 02:55.240]  nutrition and detox and food selection lots of important things that we can do
[02:55.240 --> 03:00.720]  and he's the expert on that in fact he's a he's a holistic doctor he's into
[03:00.720 --> 03:04.960]  healing he's into all kinds of nutritional strategies many of those
[03:04.960 --> 03:09.160]  strategies are now being used by people here at the info wars team info wars
[03:09.160 --> 03:15.160]  studio to improve their health and prevent any kind of degenerative disease
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.160]  from taking hold so dr. Lynn Saputo joins us that's going to be an amazing
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.920]  report and then also in the third hour we have breaking news on the situation in

[03:37.720 --> 03:42.640]  Minnesota and those moms are now being threatened by the state of Minnesota with
[03:42.640 --> 03:47.760]  criminal prosecution if they allow their homes to be used as drop-off points for
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.480]  fresh milk from a farm yes indeed what California did to James Stewart and
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.560]  Sharon Palmer the state of Minnesota is now doing to moms and farmers and that

[04:20.600 --> 04:25.800]  all the feds the Food and Drug Administration is giving money to the
[04:25.800 --> 04:29.160]  state departments of agriculture in order to create these special
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.840]  prosecutorial task forces that go after farmers and moms with the threat of
[04:34.840 --> 04:38.680]  guns drawn sometimes they do draw their guns sometimes they go in with armed

[06:32.000 --> 06:36.560]  lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[06:36.560 --> 06:40.760]  which is key save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches
[06:40.760 --> 06:44.600]  from the plastic propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there it's what

[07:04.880 --> 07:08.240]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[07:08.240 --> 07:12.080]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[07:12.080 --> 07:15.240]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[07:15.240 --> 07:19.160]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[07:19.160 --> 07:23.280]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[07:23.280 --> 07:28.160]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[07:28.160 --> 07:31.720]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[07:31.720 --> 07:35.560]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a

[07:56.600 --> 08:03.760]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com from his central Texas command center
[08:03.760 --> 08:09.840]  deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the
[08:09.840 --> 08:13.320]  GCN radio network
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.400]  it is Friday May 11th 2012 this is Mike Adams the health ranger the editor of
[08:22.400 --> 08:28.560]  naturalnews.com filling in for Alex Jones today from occupied America FEMA
[08:28.560 --> 08:34.240]  region 6 here behind enemy lines as they say in Austin Texas bringing you
[08:34.240 --> 08:40.080]  today's breaking news which is as usual extraordinary absolutely extraordinary
[08:40.080 --> 08:48.960]  Geraldo Rivera has just announced well yesterday he talked at about the TSA he
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.640]  was covering the story of how the TSA considered an 18 month old toddler to be
[08:54.640 --> 08:59.800]  a terrorist and they forced the toddler and the family off of the airplane and
[08:59.800 --> 09:05.240]  detained them for quite some time and humiliated them in the airport this was
[09:05.240 --> 09:10.280]  this is again as part of the MO of the TSA which has nothing to do with security
[09:10.280 --> 09:16.560]  and everything to do with enforcing a police state mentality so in talking
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.640]  about that Rivera appeared on Fox and Friends yesterday and he said that he
[09:21.640 --> 09:27.520]  was raped by the TSA his words quote the last time I flew to Afghanistan I got
[09:27.520 --> 09:33.080]  manually raped by a guy who the scanner wasn't working these are his own words
[09:33.080 --> 09:38.880]  he then said that his quote junk was junked by a TSA screener I apologize for
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.080]  the graphic nature of these this language but this is her all those language
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.640]  himself I'm not paraphrasing I'm quoting him exactly quote this guy it seemed was
[09:48.640 --> 09:54.080]  getting off on it and the more and the tighter I got and the angrier I got you
[09:54.080 --> 10:02.000]  know he just wanted to be a little more intimate of course he did oh my and I
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.720]  was so frustrated for all though continues I called the TSA and I called
[10:05.720 --> 10:08.960]  and I called I went on television I exposed them I embarrassed them I said
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.120]  can't you and they just could not remove my name from the computer they had a no
[10:13.120 --> 10:21.160]  flight the no-fly list yeah see this is why I don't fly see the TSA punishes
[10:21.160 --> 10:24.880]  anyone who dares to speak out about them this is exactly what her all though
[10:24.880 --> 10:28.280]  just experienced they put them on the no-fly list which is of course is a
[10:28.280 --> 10:32.120]  secret completely unconstitutional list you don't know how you got on the list
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.160]  you don't know how to get your name removed from the list there's no
[10:35.160 --> 10:40.360]  procedure for it there's no it's it's a giant secret government black box which
[10:40.360 --> 10:44.400]  is what that's how the entire government works now in America welcome to the new
[10:44.400 --> 10:51.760]  occupied America the banker occupied America and so in exposing all of this
[10:51.760 --> 10:55.960]  Rivera has been punished by them isn't there a congressman in Texas that's
[10:55.960 --> 11:00.240]  also gone on the record and said that every time he flies they squeeze his
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.600]  genitals they they actually punish him by squeezing him a little extra this is
[11:05.600 --> 11:10.520]  why I don't fly because I put out the the TSA that don't touch my junk music
[11:10.520 --> 11:16.880]  video song and also of course the TSA help wanted animation parody video that
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.000]  makes fun of the TSA then exposes them as being the total perverts and thugs
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  that they truly are so I don't fly because I know they're gonna drop a bag
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.320]  of cocaine in my luggage and then arrest me for drugs that I've never even
[11:29.320 --> 11:34.560]  used so I'm sure the TSA is just waiting to find me in the airport so I'm not
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.360]  going to give him that opportunity so I'm supporting Senator Rand Paul's effort
[11:38.360 --> 11:43.120]  to of course eliminate and shut down the TSA in fact another US congressman I
[11:43.120 --> 11:46.640]  don't recall his name at the moment just in the last few days called for the
[11:46.640 --> 11:53.720]  resignation of pistoli the head of the TSA who of course not only needs to be not
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.160]  only needs to resign I think needs to be arrested that's my opinion I think it
[11:57.160 --> 12:01.200]  needs to be investigated and arrested but that's just the beginning of the
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.680]  crazy breaking news I'm going to talk to you about the Pentagon's new technology
[12:04.680 --> 12:10.360]  which is trying to build a neurolinguistic programming engine so that
[12:10.360 --> 12:16.240]  they can contrive the right story that the public will buy that's the Pentagon's
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.240]  new weapon it's a neurolinguistic weapon that's been reported by the BBC I'll
[12:21.240 --> 12:24.840]  talk about that in a minute but first let's get to some other a little a little
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.520]  more mild news here's some stuff for everybody who owns a car changing the
[12:29.520 --> 12:35.480]  oil on your car every 3,000 miles may not be necessary in fact I'm calling that
[12:35.480 --> 12:41.040]  idea a scam because it's really not necessary for most cars in fact Toyota
[12:41.040 --> 12:46.200]  and other manufacturers many of their cars can go 7,500 10,000 or even 15,000
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.800]  miles without needing an oil change oh here it is so there's a website out
[12:50.800 --> 12:54.360]  there where you can check and see how often you actually need to change the
[12:54.360 --> 12:59.200]  oil on your car and oh man I'm going to get that website for you after the break
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.680]  it's I'm sorry I don't have that for you right now I'll get that website for you
[13:03.680 --> 13:09.400]  but let me go to the next news I will come back to that Washington State
[13:09.400 --> 13:15.560]  declares whooping cough an epidemic after just a few a few hundred people
[13:15.560 --> 13:19.360]  have symptoms of the whooping cough and and almost no deaths from it but here's
[13:19.360 --> 13:23.040]  the deal they always declare these epidemics and then they use it to push
[13:23.040 --> 13:27.840]  vaccines in the state but what they don't tell you is that the outbreaks of
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.160]  whooping cough are higher among children who have been vaccinated against whooping
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.120]  cough this is on on daily news for those of you watching on the prison planet
[13:38.120 --> 13:42.560]  TV whooping cough epidemic hits Washington State boy these states these
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.000]  vaccine pushers they love to declare epidemics so does the CDC but they never
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.840]  tell you the truth well we've published on natural news the truth about how the
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.160]  outbreaks are higher among children who are vaccinated in other words if you get
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.720]  the whooping cough vaccine your risk of contracting the whooping cough goes up
[13:59.720 --> 14:06.240]  it goes up so not getting vaccinated is the best protection against the whooping
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.200]  cough actually vitamin D is a much better protection also whooping cough
[14:10.200 --> 14:15.200]  vaccines have been linked to seizures and we've got that story also posted on
[14:15.200 --> 14:21.440]  natural news as well and info wars of course covers all of this the in fact
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.240]  the polio vaccines in India that are causing paralysis Aaron Dixon an
[14:25.240 --> 14:28.760]  excellent story on that Kurt Nemo Paul Watson are all over that story check
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.000]  this out here's some actually let me let me go to this sheet right here and for
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.400]  those of you watching on prison planet TV I've got a new prop in the studio today
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.560]  we've got the Liberty Eagle Liberty flag right here I want to get I want to get a
[14:41.560 --> 14:46.640]  big don't tread on me kind of flag situation I'm going to start bringing
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.400]  props in the studio every time I'm here I want to I want to put a copy of the
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.120]  Constitution on the wall behind me here or at least the Bill of Rights there it
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.920]  is look at that isn't that beautiful Liberty right there I know for those of
[14:57.920 --> 15:04.840]  you on the radio you're going what you can watch on prisonplanet.tv but here
[15:04.840 --> 15:07.760]  it is the combination tetanus and whooping cough vaccine linked to
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.960]  seizures in babies and this was published in the Journal of the American
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.480]  Medical Association so even the conventional medical system openly
[15:16.480 --> 15:22.920]  admits that these vaccines cause seizures and then here's the story about
[15:22.920 --> 15:26.920]  how whooping cough outbreaks are higher among children who have been
[15:26.920 --> 15:32.320]  vaccinated it actually causes the disease and then here's Washington State
[15:32.320 --> 15:39.520]  declaring an actual epidemic and they're seeking the CDC help oh yes the CDC
[15:39.520 --> 15:43.840]  Centers for Disease Control should be called Centers for Disease Contradiction
[15:43.840 --> 15:51.240]  because they actually promote more disease than they ever prevent oh yeah
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.320]  the CDC loves to push new diseases out there with those weaponized vaccines
[15:55.320 --> 15:59.440]  check this out military training in the middle of Miami jolts residents out of
[15:59.440 --> 16:06.160]  bed the Grand Bay Hotel was attacked wait never mind this is in the Miami
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.000]  Herald.com it was just a military training exercise so if you woke up
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.720]  when this was just a few days ago in fact if you woke up on Tuesday May 8th
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.360]  and you you saw a bunch of black helicopters and military troops jumping
[16:21.360 --> 16:25.240]  out of them and raiding this hotel and firing off a bunch of blank rounds
[16:25.240 --> 16:28.760]  obviously they weren't live ammunition but they sounded like it to the to the
[16:28.760 --> 16:34.840]  residents of the city oh guess what it's just another military exercise to get
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.640]  everybody used to the idea that the US military is going to be on the streets
[16:39.640 --> 16:46.880]  on the streets as usual just to get you used to it so that when DHS brings in
[16:46.880 --> 16:53.000]  the bulletproof pill boxes and the roadside checkpoints and what the 450
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.240]  million rounds of 40 caliber hollow point ammo not to mention all the 223 rounds
[16:57.240 --> 17:01.360]  or the 556 rounds or whatever else they're buying that all the Americans
[17:01.360 --> 17:04.440]  just kind of sit back and say oh yeah they've been doing that for the last
[17:04.440 --> 17:07.480]  couple of years that's normal there's nothing wrong with that we see you
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.040]  military people raiding hotels and shooting up city streets all the time
[17:11.040 --> 17:17.200]  it must be okay must be another training exercise they're gonna say yeah
[17:17.200 --> 17:23.600]  and an honest subject of mind control check this out this is in the BBC search
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.160]  for this title guys building the pentagons like me weapon building the
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.400]  pentagons like me weapon I'm gonna read you right from this article this is a
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.460]  fascinating story I don't think it's really been covered that much in the
[17:37.460 --> 17:41.920]  alternative media the military is creating a device and this is quoting
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.720]  from the story that could advise them what to say generating a story based on
[17:47.720 --> 17:52.480]  a scientific understanding of the brain's inner workings to sooth tempers
[17:52.480 --> 17:57.480]  and calm the mood of the population it sounds like something from a science
[17:57.480 --> 18:01.960]  fiction blockbuster the BBC reports but is in fact the premise behind the
[18:01.960 --> 18:07.520]  pentagons growing interest in the neurobiology of political violence a
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.680]  relatively new field that combines neuroscience with more traditional
[18:11.680 --> 18:16.080]  social science-based approaches to understanding human behavior do you
[18:16.080 --> 18:19.360]  understand what this is really saying this is a neurolinguistic social
[18:19.360 --> 18:24.840]  engineering brain hack this is propaganda at the level of the neural
[18:24.840 --> 18:29.800]  processors in your brain this is a way to create a story to have a a computer
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.560]  actually spit out a story that they know the people will believe like oh we
[18:34.560 --> 18:38.280]  killed bin Laden and threw his body in the ocean because that's what they do in
[18:38.280 --> 18:44.040]  that religion total nonsense complete just a complete fiction but people bought
[18:44.040 --> 18:47.920]  it I mean why do they need computers to come up with this stuff it seems like
[18:47.920 --> 18:51.800]  whoever is running things at the globalist agenda level they're already
[18:51.800 --> 18:54.880]  coming up with stories that people will buy and besides it seems like there's
[18:54.880 --> 19:00.320]  no skepticism out there anyway anymore people will buy almost anything have you
[19:00.320 --> 19:05.600]  noticed that they'll buy almost anything like they they could make up a crazy
[19:05.600 --> 19:12.680]  story up bin Laden was using his wife as a shield and then he launched little
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.680]  miniature pumpkin grenades like the green goblin from spider-man and so we
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.680]  had to shoot him and we dunked his head three times in the water and bubbles
[19:20.680 --> 19:26.560]  still came up so then we we put his feet and led and led bricks and led him
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.000]  sink to the bottom of the ocean where he started glowing so we had to launch a
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.800]  nuclear weapon this is the kind of stuff they come up with and people actually
[19:34.800 --> 19:40.400]  will believe it as long as it's pushed out there by CNN and NPR and all these
[19:40.400 --> 19:45.080]  mainstream media websites doesn't matter if it's fiction people buy it anyway it's

[24:24.240 --> 24:29.120]  North America in fact the entire northern hemisphere because of the global
[24:29.120 --> 24:35.400]  wind patterns but before we have a sobering story about Kelly Thomas and
[24:35.400 --> 24:39.880]  many of you may already be aware of who is Kelly Thomas he is the homeless man
[24:39.880 --> 24:47.960]  who was beat to death in Fullerton California by police officers he was
[24:47.960 --> 24:55.040]  begging for his life begging for his daddy he was just beat beat to a pulp
[24:55.040 --> 24:59.320]  by I believe if it was up to eight officers it started with just two
[24:59.320 --> 25:02.800]  officers we're showing a little bit of the footage keep showing as much as you
[25:02.800 --> 25:06.960]  can there guys this is the first time I'm seeing this particular footage we
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.040]  can't show it all because it's just too graphic it's too heart-wrenching it is
[25:11.040 --> 25:19.760]  an absolute anti-humanitarian abuse of a human being by police officers who have
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.000]  lost it and again the man's name is Kelly Thomas go ahead and search
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.120]  prismplanet.com for stories about Kelly Thomas search YouTube look for the
[25:30.120 --> 25:35.360]  video yourself if you want to see it what happened is this started with two
[25:35.360 --> 25:41.200]  officers one of them tasering the man and then the taser after the taser was
[25:41.200 --> 25:47.400]  fired at him disabling him he was struck with the taser weapon itself as a as a
[25:47.400 --> 25:58.200]  blunt object and then he was essentially gang beat by a gang of other of other
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.880]  police officers who are supposed to be law enforcement officers I'm sorry I'm
[26:03.880 --> 26:07.920]  I'm a little bit this video is absolutely horrific and I'm looking at the
[26:07.920 --> 26:11.360]  picture of the man you can hardly recognize that it's a face at all it's
[26:11.360 --> 26:18.220]  it is it is a mass of blood and bone and and sinew and skin and this man was
[26:18.220 --> 26:23.680]  beat to death by these police officers in California and those those officers
[26:23.680 --> 26:30.480]  are now facing prosecution and I want to be clear that not all police officers
[26:30.480 --> 26:35.120]  are bad that most members of law enforcement especially those in the
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.120]  sheriffs and deputies departments are very honest honorable individuals many
[26:40.120 --> 26:44.160]  of them are patriots many of them are going to do the right thing when the
[26:44.160 --> 26:47.760]  time comes they will make the right decision to protect liberty and to
[26:47.760 --> 26:53.520]  protect the innocent in America and yet across America today we do have rogue
[26:53.520 --> 26:59.360]  gang units of police off police departments now this is true in every
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.960]  major city it's true in Miami it's true in Chicago it's it's true in LA
[27:03.960 --> 27:13.840]  obviously it's true in in San Diego it is this is an epidemic of police violence
[27:13.840 --> 27:16.720]  against individuals and you know where it comes from you know you know where
[27:16.720 --> 27:21.160]  what makes this possible it is that the federal government is setting the
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.840]  example of brutality and sexual molestation of the people so when the
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.400]  TSA reaches down your pants and squeezes your genitals and punishes people
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.440]  like Geraldo Rivera just went public and said he was raped by the TSA when that
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.280]  is allowed in America and when the people don't stand up against it and
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.280]  say enough is enough and we're not going to be raped we're not going to be
[27:42.280 --> 27:46.240]  treated to this kind of violence by the government then the local the police
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.080]  departments they start getting the idea well hey we can do it too we can rape
[27:51.080 --> 27:55.960]  people we can commit violence against people we can just beat whoever we want
[27:55.960 --> 27:59.240]  beat them to death and that's exactly what they did information from the court
[27:59.240 --> 28:04.680]  case this is from the ocregister.com right out of Orange Orange County it was
[28:04.680 --> 28:09.120]  a 33-minute surveillance video of the confrontation that has surfaced and of
[28:09.120 --> 28:11.920]  course without that surveillance video none of these cops ever probably would
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.120]  have faced any prosecution because they could just beat people to death in dark
[28:15.120 --> 28:18.760]  alleys where no one's looking and they get away with it routinely and these
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.560]  cops obviously need need to go to jail and and it looks like they're going to
[28:23.560 --> 28:26.880]  if this case moves forward as expected let me read you some other details from
[28:26.880 --> 28:30.800]  from the case here because it's absolutely it's heart-wrenching and it
[28:30.800 --> 28:37.320]  it is a big warning that one one officer Cicinelli or Cicinelli I'm not
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.360]  sure the pronunciation stunned stunned Thomas with a taser and then hit him in
[28:42.360 --> 28:45.680]  the face with a plastic gun he's charged with involuntary manslaughter and
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.880]  excessive force under the color of authority free on $25,000 bail now
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.400]  remember this in California they gave James Stewart a million dollars bail for
[28:54.400 --> 29:01.400]  distributing raw milk so if you beat a man to death your bail is only $25,000
[29:01.400 --> 29:08.280]  but if you distribute real food oh my god fresh raw milk you get a million
[29:08.280 --> 29:13.440]  dollars bail that's justice in California and this officer is facing four
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.160]  years in prison James Stewart's facing 40 years in prison for
[29:17.160 --> 29:23.280]  distributing raw milk this videotape shown in public for the first time
[29:23.280 --> 29:26.680]  showed an escalating situation that abruptly became violent when one of
[29:26.680 --> 29:30.000]  the officer says he puts on rubber gloves and says now you see my fist
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.120]  they're getting ready to eff you up if you don't start eff listening he says
[29:34.120 --> 29:37.360]  those are the words of the officer in the surveillance tape that's what it has
[29:37.360 --> 29:40.880]  come to in America today that's what happened to Kelly Thomas a lot more

[33:03.840 --> 33:18.640]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind the
[33:18.640 --> 33:23.880]  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has become yet a renewed concern for the
[33:23.880 --> 33:28.640]  fate of life on our planet especially in the northern hemisphere which is of
[33:28.640 --> 33:32.440]  course strongly affected by the wind patterns of whatever radiation might be
[33:32.440 --> 33:37.320]  released from Fukushima in fact some are claiming that a very large amount of
[33:37.320 --> 33:41.160]  radiation has already been released and by claiming I say that with a bit of
[33:41.160 --> 33:44.440]  satire because of course it's happened is our multiple meltdowns already
[33:44.440 --> 33:50.760]  happened and the that the that cover-up is being called plume gate so just
[33:50.760 --> 33:54.360]  search that term if you want to learn more plume gate and now senator Ron
[33:54.360 --> 33:59.960]  Wyden who actually is a pretty decent guy I used to live in Oregon in his
[33:59.960 --> 34:03.280]  district when he was a congressman and I'm you know is I don't agree with all
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.040]  his politics obviously but pretty decent guy you know really within the system he
[34:08.040 --> 34:12.400]  tries to help people a more than most I would say and he went out and visited
[34:12.400 --> 34:16.880]  he went out and visited the Fukushima facility to have a look for himself and
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.720]  when he came back he issued an urgent warning he put it right on his own website
[34:20.720 --> 34:27.040]  the government website sent it website and he said that it is a precarious
[34:27.040 --> 34:31.760]  situation and he said that the entire facility is only protected from a second
[34:31.760 --> 34:38.040]  tsunami by something to be called the bags of rocks placed there a makeshift
[34:38.040 --> 34:42.880]  wall he said made by bags of rocks placed there by hand that's not going to
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.880]  survive a tsunami that's not going to stop a giant tidal wave coming in not
[34:47.880 --> 34:53.240]  even a chance now at the same time a former Japan ambassador has gone on the
[34:53.240 --> 34:57.840]  record and made a statement saying that quote the fate of the world depends on
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.680]  reactor number four those are his words so there's been a lot of increasing
[35:02.680 --> 35:07.000]  concern about the fuel rod the spent fuel rods that are in the pools that are
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.600]  now have open access to the environment and what might happen if there is a
[35:10.600 --> 35:15.240]  subsequent earthquake or a tsunami which could happen theoretically at any time
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.240]  it's a it's largely unpredictable what will happen and to help answer that
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.120]  question is Arne Gunnerson joining us today by Skype video an amazing expert
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.680]  he's been one of the most courageous scientific voices speaking out about the
[35:29.680 --> 35:33.080]  reality of what's happening in Fukushima even as others try to cover up and
[35:33.080 --> 35:36.640]  downplay Arne Gunnerson has been actually reporting the truth from his
[35:36.640 --> 35:43.600]  website fairwinds.com that's F-A-I-R-E winds.com but I get that right is that
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.460]  that the right website you got it yeah okay all right Arne thank you for
[35:47.460 --> 35:50.200]  joining us today it's a pleasure to have you on the Alex Jones show how you
[35:50.200 --> 35:55.040]  doing today hi thanks for having me I'm great well it's it's it's an honor to
[35:55.040 --> 35:59.680]  have you on you are one of the the most widely known voices out there in the
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.920]  truth movement and also among the scientific followers of what's happening
[36:04.920 --> 36:09.480]  in Fukushima can you begin by telling us what is your understanding of the
[36:09.480 --> 36:13.240]  status the current status of the situation in Fukushima and in particular
[36:13.240 --> 36:19.200]  reactor number four and it's spent fuel rod pool I think you hit the nail on the
[36:19.200 --> 36:26.480]  head at the beginning of the hour here the unit four is has always been since
[36:26.480 --> 36:31.320]  the very first week or two of the accident in my mind the biggest concern
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.320]  and the term I used a year ago was that if the unit four fuel pool goes will
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.880]  have Chernobyl and steroids and and I still believe that today that the
[36:41.880 --> 36:48.600]  problem with that pool is that there's an entire nuclear cores worth of hot
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.800]  fuel and by that I mean physically hot because it just ran and four or five
[36:53.800 --> 37:01.000]  more years of spent fuel the combination means that if it were to go dry that
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.680]  it would burn and liberating enormous amount of radiation
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.720]  Brookhaven National Lab said that the fuel pool fire like could be
[37:10.720 --> 37:18.280]  experienced that the Fukushima Daiichi four would kill 186,000 people from
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.800]  cancer no is that is that just a fire situation if the let's say the pool the
[37:22.800 --> 37:26.680]  the containment concrete cracks the water drains out or another earthquake
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.680]  happens it all collapses is it is it a fire that releases that or is there the
[37:30.680 --> 37:35.800]  possibility of it achieving again criticality or a meltdown scenario no it
[37:35.800 --> 37:40.760]  can't yet low and rich fuel like in a power reactor has to have water around
[37:40.760 --> 37:46.400]  it to have a fission to you know for a chain reaction to occur now what would
[37:46.400 --> 37:52.200]  happen if you know what I'm postulating is if there's a if there's a 775
[37:52.200 --> 37:56.360]  earthquake and the pool cracks or the building topples but let's say the pool
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.920]  cracks the pool runs dry the zirculoid clad it would become hot enough to burn
[38:03.920 --> 38:11.280]  in air and it's called a pyrophoric reaction the once it starts you can't
[38:11.280 --> 38:15.760]  put it out by throwing water on it because it takes the oxygen out of the
[38:15.760 --> 38:19.160]  water and just gets hotter so this would be like a massive dirty bomb
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.920]  essentially being set off and it would just burn and release into the atmosphere
[38:22.920 --> 38:25.760]  and then the wind takes it from there is that what you're saying yeah that's a
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.280]  great analogy so if let me ask you this if a terrorist group had this much
[38:31.280 --> 38:37.320]  nuclear material in their hands how do you think America's response would be
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.200]  different because I find it interesting that this is essentially a dirty bomb a
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.840]  ticking time dirty bomb and it was America's doing essentially nothing but
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.640]  if a terrorist had this much material how bad would that be Arnie you know we've
[38:49.640 --> 38:53.160]  been saying that here in the States and you know I'm on record is saying that
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.760]  this type of reactor this mark one reactor when you know this fuel pole is
[38:57.760 --> 39:03.440]  up in the air about a hundred feet high and it's a terrorist target and this
[39:03.440 --> 39:09.520]  isn't since Fukushima this I've been saying this for ten years the the problem
[39:09.520 --> 39:15.360]  is if a terrorist were to broach the side of the of the fuel pole with you
[39:15.360 --> 39:20.120]  know some kind of a guided weapon that's not a rifle like an RPG or something
[39:20.120 --> 39:27.440]  like that yeah that you would drain the pool here in the States and I and it
[39:27.440 --> 39:32.200]  would create the same scenario so this isn't something that the NRC in the
[39:32.200 --> 39:36.920]  nuclear community hasn't heard they've just ignored it what's this what's the
[39:36.920 --> 39:41.960]  deal with the other pool of stored fuel rods that's located reportedly about
[39:41.960 --> 39:46.200]  50 meters away from this reactor number four pool what's what's the interaction
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.640]  between those two pools the the Japanese unlike the Americans have kept all
[39:51.640 --> 39:55.760]  their nuclear fuel in the fuel pole you know so you've got a plant like pilgrim
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.840]  pilgrim with 37 years worth whereas Fukushima only has seven or eight the
[40:00.840 --> 40:05.640]  Japanese took the fuel down out of these precarious pools when they got to five
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.960]  six seven years and put them in a common pool so they have an enormous common
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.600]  pool but it's at grade level so from a seismic standpoint it's much more rigid
[40:16.600 --> 40:21.240]  that the Fukushima 4 pool is way up in the air so it's like an upside down
[40:21.240 --> 40:26.880]  pendulum in the event of an accident my you know in addition to unit 4 and and
[40:26.880 --> 40:32.680]  I'm clearly on record that's saying both these units 3 is not much better so
[40:32.680 --> 40:38.040]  there's actually two fuel pools that could that could cause you know certainly
[40:38.040 --> 40:44.400]  the the evacuation of Tokyo would be plausible if that pool were to were to
[40:44.400 --> 40:49.360]  catch fire what about the evacuation of California would it would how much of a
[40:49.360 --> 40:55.200]  concern would it be if that pool the if the fuel rods in pool 4 caught on fire
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.640]  and that that radiation was released and all the isotopes the iodine 131 the
[40:59.640 --> 41:04.920]  cesium 137 I think is a bigger concern how what in your estimation what is the
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.920]  range of possibilities of impacts on states like California Oregon Alaska
[41:09.920 --> 41:14.760]  Washington especially West Coast USA yeah you will first of you're not going to
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.800]  find any iodine because that only has an eight day half-life so it's been gone
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.760]  for years but the the amount of cesium in those pools is roughly comparable to
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.240]  what's gone up in nuclear weapons testing above ground nuclear weapons
[41:27.240 --> 41:34.080]  testing for the you know three for 30 years my my I'm telling my friends that
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.400]  on the West Coast you got to watch it like a hawk every day go up and make
[41:38.400 --> 41:44.240]  sure your uniform is standing and if it's not you know we'll watch the plume
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.600]  but but have a have a plan B to you know to move somewhere well that's great
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.200]  advice Arnie and I want to encourage viewers and listeners to visit your
[41:53.200 --> 41:58.600]  website fair wins dot com again that's spelled F-A-I-R-E fair almost fair
[41:58.600 --> 42:06.520]  Farry wins dot com might be the the the phonetic way to say it but the the
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.440]  problem with what you just said I should say the challenge is that the mainstream
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.480]  media has already demonstrated it's going to lie about this so if the average
[42:15.480 --> 42:19.600]  person out there in California let's say says well I'm going to watch CNN and I'm
[42:19.600 --> 42:23.400]  going to wait for CNN to tell me whether or not there's been a big release of
[42:23.400 --> 42:28.240]  radiation from Fukushima isn't it possible that CNN may just never cover
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.760]  it or they may downplay it or the the U.S. government may come up with some
[42:32.760 --> 42:37.760]  kind of weird cover story it hasn't the truth already been manipulated so much
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.560]  that we can't really trust the media to tell us the future of what's going on
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.240]  there well I I don't trust the mainstream media actually though I mean
[42:46.240 --> 42:50.880]  CNN had me on 20 times so I probably they've done better than most of the
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.040]  others oh I wasn't aware of that that's actually to their credit to have you on
[42:54.040 --> 42:58.360]  then well thank you but but you're absolutely right the mainstream media
[42:58.360 --> 43:06.280]  has underplayed the Fukushima disaster of you know since since it began and you
[43:06.280 --> 43:09.640]  know it's through alternative shows like yours it's through alternative sites
[43:09.640 --> 43:15.520]  like mine that that people are getting the knowledge that experts have you know
[43:15.520 --> 43:20.480]  all the things I've been saying for the last year are turning up in a request
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.000]  from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission they were thinking it they just weren't
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.400]  telling the public right you nailed it the FOIA requests have revealed a lot
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.600]  of interesting information where wasn't one of the documents from the NRC
[43:32.600 --> 43:37.040]  showing that by their calculations they had already estimated that eight was at
[43:37.040 --> 43:42.160]  18,000 infant deaths had occurred in the USA due to the radiation or am I
[43:42.160 --> 43:45.560]  getting that right I don't remember seeing that one but there were so many
[43:45.560 --> 43:51.000]  that were terrifying you know they they had data from the roof of the embassy in
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.840]  Tokyo in the first week that was terrifying and yet they never made that
[43:55.840 --> 44:01.520]  that information public we had a businessman in Tokyo who was staying on
[44:01.520 --> 44:07.120]  the same block as the US Embassy take a sample from the roof of his hotel and
[44:07.120 --> 44:12.400]  it was hotter than a pistol then this was six months after the accident so you
[44:12.400 --> 44:16.400]  know we have known that Tokyo was jeopardized at the beginning of this
[44:16.400 --> 44:22.120]  accident since it was happening and really didn't do much to to warn the
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.080]  citizens wow for those watching prisonplanet.tv they just showed the
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.120]  footage of one of the explosions of one of the reactors I don't was that reactor
[44:30.120 --> 44:35.280]  number two that was being shown I don't know but it looks like a massive
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.640]  explosion some there's been conjecture that perhaps it was a nuclear explosion
[44:40.640 --> 44:47.400]  I'm not I'm not sure what are your thoughts on that Arnie? Yeah it it was a
[44:47.400 --> 44:53.360]  prompt moderated criticality okay you're gonna have to break that down for us
[44:53.360 --> 45:02.480]  all well a bomb is the prompt fast criticality a nuclear reactor is usually
[45:02.480 --> 45:10.920]  never prompt yeah fortunately I'll be this could take an hour but I'll try to
[45:10.920 --> 45:14.240]  knock it out in 30 seconds imagine like all the power that would power the city
[45:14.240 --> 45:17.360]  of Tokyo for 10 years being released in two seconds is what kind of what you're
[45:17.360 --> 45:21.800]  getting at well that that's what a bomb is right if your readers want to go your
[45:21.800 --> 45:26.640]  listeners want to go up and watch this you can see that we tested this 40 years
[45:26.640 --> 45:34.200]  ago in an experiment called borax borax just like the 20 mules the borax
[45:34.200 --> 45:39.120]  experiments look almost exactly like the explosion of Fukushima units 3 and
[45:39.120 --> 45:45.960]  those were prompt moderated criticalities okay so it's not not the
[45:45.960 --> 45:49.240]  same as a detonation of a nuclear warhead obviously but it's certainly a
[45:49.240 --> 45:53.320]  much faster release than was planned by the engineers who built the facility
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.560]  now one of the things I really respect about you Arnie is that you visited
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.440]  Japan you took some soil samples and I believe on your website fair winds.com
[46:00.440 --> 46:05.440]  you even mentioned that in the United States those soil samples they are so
[46:05.440 --> 46:08.680]  contaminated with radiation that they would be considered what what was the
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.280]  term you used oh they be considered radioactive waste and they'd have to be
[46:12.280 --> 46:17.520]  you know stored in a in the controlled facility yeah so that soil how far out
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.400]  from Fukushima did you sample that soil well you know that's the point I was
[46:21.400 --> 46:26.280]  trying to make in the video Tokyo is depending on where you are 150 miles
[46:26.280 --> 46:32.640]  away from from the accident and and yet I mean these people were gardening in
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.280]  soil that was in the States that could would be considered radioactive waste
[46:37.280 --> 46:43.760]  but I was I shot the video when I was at a meeting in Washington DC and my point
[46:43.760 --> 46:50.200]  was Tokyo is the capital of Japan and within 50 within a hundred miles of
[46:50.200 --> 46:56.320]  Washington are a dozen nuclear reactors how would we feel if if our capital was
[46:56.320 --> 47:00.440]  so contaminated that it should be considered nuclear waste I think the
[47:00.440 --> 47:04.600]  public reaction would be dramatic you know we've got to shut these things down
[47:04.600 --> 47:09.520]  whereas because it's happened in the other guys country mainstream media has
[47:09.520 --> 47:13.560]  totally ignored it but you hit on something really crucial right there you
[47:13.560 --> 47:18.840]  said that the soils are so contaminated and that was with with cesium 137
[47:18.840 --> 47:24.960]  correct cesium 137 and 134 that's how you know it came from Fukushima it was
[47:24.960 --> 47:31.040]  just cesium 137 it could be bomb it could be Chernobyl but when you see 134
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.720]  and 137 together that's the signature from Fukushima that's because every
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.040]  every fuel source in the nuclear industry has a particular elemental
[47:41.040 --> 47:46.280]  signature or fingerprint you might say that can identify its source in what's
[47:46.280 --> 47:49.520]  what's crucial about what you just said also is that if the soils are
[47:49.520 --> 47:56.360]  contaminated cesium is very close to the the mineral action of potassium in
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.720]  plants so I believe that when plants are grown when food crops are grown in soil
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.280]  contaminated by cesium to the extent that those plants would normally uptake
[48:04.280 --> 48:08.440]  potassium which is a common mineral in many many crops including potatoes for
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.880]  example they would uptake that cesium which would go into the food so that the
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.560]  people who grew their food on that land would then be eating radioactive food
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.080]  yeah cesium is exactly chemically a like potassium if you remember your high
[48:22.080 --> 48:26.440]  school chemistry they're right above each other in the periodic chart but the
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.600]  so they're both muscle seekers and what we find with with with cesium poisoning
[48:32.600 --> 48:37.440]  is that especially in kids that are growing illnesses like something called
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.800]  Chernobyl heart where the cesium builds up in a muscle that's rapidly growing
[48:42.800 --> 48:49.160]  like an infant or a fetus's heart and causes heart damage or heart holes that
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.760]  while the the infant may live for the rest of their life after surgery you
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.440]  know their their life is expectancy is shortened and the quality of life is
[48:58.440 --> 49:04.360]  minimal so cesium is a muscle seeker it it also produces cancers obviously but
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.880]  because it's radioactive but in addition it can do damage to muscles
[49:08.880 --> 49:13.040]  especially in kids that are rapidly growing so this this yeah this is an
[49:13.040 --> 49:18.120]  indiscriminate obviously it can be used as a weapon by terrorists or or even
[49:18.120 --> 49:21.360]  false flag attacks that which is another concern of many of the listeners here on
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.880]  the Alex Jones show we had a report from Mike Bundrant who's one of our
[49:25.880 --> 49:30.720]  contributing writers over at Natural News he was in Tokyo recently and he
[49:30.720 --> 49:34.760]  discovered that many families are eating this contaminated food because their
[49:34.760 --> 49:38.600]  parents or their other family members are living in a state of denial they've
[49:38.600 --> 49:42.240]  been told by the Japanese government that this is safe so they're planting
[49:42.240 --> 49:47.280]  food on this contaminated soil they're eating this radioactive food and they
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.240]  they are doing so knowing it's radioactive but they're they can't go
[49:51.240 --> 49:54.520]  against their other family members because of the very powerful you know
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.360]  parental family structure often in that you find in Japanese families and these
[49:59.360 --> 50:04.880]  middle-aged Japanese citizens are they're gonna die of cancer from it you
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.600]  know you're actually right that it's a cultural problem there and the government
[50:08.600 --> 50:12.800]  is playing on the cultural problem there's a there's a ray of hope here
[50:12.800 --> 50:18.080]  because the women of Japan aren't buying it the men seem to be saying well my
[50:18.080 --> 50:22.520]  government told me it's safe therefore it's safe whereas the women especially
[50:22.520 --> 50:28.040]  the young child-bearing age women are just saying you know hell no we won't
[50:28.040 --> 50:34.840]  glow I guess is the old term that's a good one but they the the women in Japan
[50:34.840 --> 50:40.240]  are a significant majority in all of these marches that you see which is
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.160]  unheard of for Japan I mean the word aren't you sorry to interrupt you we
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.400]  got to go to break but stay with us I want to ask you on the other side of
[50:46.400 --> 50:50.840]  this break about the 85 times Chernobyl radiation figure that's been floating
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.080]  around that and much more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones show we'll be
[50:54.080 --> 51:03.080]  right back after this break a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of
[51:03.080 --> 51:06.960]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[51:06.960 --> 51:11.480]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[51:11.480 --> 51:14.320]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[51:14.320 --> 51:18.600]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.640]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[51:23.640 --> 51:28.560]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral

[54:20.000 --> 54:23.800]  hemisphere doesn't mean it's gonna kill us all but it does mean it could
[54:23.800 --> 54:28.800]  threaten the the the the healthy continuation of life as we know it it
[54:28.800 --> 54:34.080]  could threaten crops it could threaten literally millions of acres of farming
[54:34.080 --> 54:38.520]  land across North America if a worst-case scenario happens and and sadly
[54:38.520 --> 54:42.560]  the worst-case scenario could be unleashed in many ways from another
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.000]  earthquake another tsunami that hits the Fukushima facility this is an issue
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.680]  that affects North America it affects Europe it affects Russia it affects China
[54:52.680 --> 54:56.320]  it's not just Japan that's affected by this and that's why we're featuring this
[54:56.320 --> 55:02.880]  information here we've got Arne Gunnison joining us from Fairwinds and he is one
[55:02.880 --> 55:08.080]  of the top nuclear experts and very outspoken but also very considered in
[55:08.080 --> 55:11.240]  his information that's what I really respect about Arne that he is
[55:11.240 --> 55:15.840]  methodical in his research and he's very considered in his statements about
[55:15.840 --> 55:20.280]  Fukushima before we bring him back in very quickly in the next hour we're
[55:20.280 --> 55:24.120]  going to be joined by Dr. Len Zaputo to talk to us about some solutions for
[55:24.120 --> 55:29.080]  protecting our bodies from radiation in case that worst-case scenario happens
[55:29.080 --> 55:35.160]  and then also we've got Alex Jones calling in at the well what about half an
[55:35.160 --> 55:37.720]  hour from now Alex is going to call in and give us some comments on current
[55:37.720 --> 55:42.720]  events as well now back to Arne Gunnison from Fairwinds.com Arne before the
[55:42.720 --> 55:46.960]  break I asked you about this figure that's been floating around this 85 times
[55:46.960 --> 55:51.800]  I guess there's been a calculation of the total amount of of unspent fuel or
[55:51.800 --> 55:56.720]  partially spent fuel in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility and that was
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.880]  calculated to be 85 times roughly 85 times the amount of of energy released
[56:02.880 --> 56:08.560]  in the Chernobyl accident in I believe 1986 is that figure accurate or does it
[56:08.560 --> 56:14.200]  need to be fact-checked? Yeah I'm not sure where they got that it I believe
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.800]  Fukushima is worse than Chernobyl and I think I can prove that I think that
[56:19.800 --> 56:24.800]  that number may also include the possibility of the meltdown of the
[56:24.800 --> 56:30.720]  fuel in the fuel pools which hasn't occurred yet so if you look at the three
[56:30.720 --> 56:37.240]  reactors that melt it down clearly they released more noble gases things like
[56:37.240 --> 56:42.560]  xenon and krypton at least triple what what Chernobyl released and they
[56:42.560 --> 56:48.320]  actually picked that up in in Seattle this is separate from the hot particles
[56:48.320 --> 56:52.520]  in Seattle but there was a xenon and krypton picked up to the tune of a
[56:52.520 --> 56:57.880]  hundred thousand times normal in Seattle in March and April after the accident
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.960]  published peer-reviewed stuff but that so that's one kind of isotope and that
[57:02.960 --> 57:09.520]  doesn't react if anything it pops right out of the fuel but the this the cesium
[57:09.520 --> 57:15.160]  and the iodine and things like that are probably roughly on the order maybe
[57:15.160 --> 57:20.600]  twice as much as Fukushima you know yes this is such a horrific accident but
[57:20.600 --> 57:24.040]  it's hard to believe the Japanese were lucky but there's there's two things
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.800]  they were lucky about one is that 80% of the time the wind blew out to sea now
[57:28.800 --> 57:34.160]  until most of this 78% of this radiation wound up in the ocean that's not good
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.640]  for the fish and ultimately not good for us but it's good for the people in
[57:37.640 --> 57:42.480]  Japan the other piece of it was it happened on a Friday and they had a
[57:42.480 --> 57:49.880]  thousand people at Daiichi and another thousand at Daini had that not happen if
[57:49.880 --> 57:54.480]  it happened on a weekend Daini would have melt it down as well there's four
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.640]  reactors there that would have melted down as well so we could have had ten
[57:58.640 --> 58:04.000]  nuclear reactors melting down if this thing had happened on a Saturday well
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.880]  this gets back to the the whole thing called Murphy's Law and I'm really
[58:09.880 --> 58:15.480]  starting to question the the ability of science to anticipate the long-term
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.760]  implications of its present-day actions I want to ask you about that and how can
[58:19.760 --> 58:23.720]  science be made safer when we return on the other side of this break you are
[58:23.720 --> 58:27.040]  listening to the Alex Jones show an interview with Arnie Gunnerson about
[58:27.040 --> 58:32.640]  Fukushima and radiation and the next hour begins in just minutes so stay with
[58:32.640 --> 58:49.000]  us we'll be right back this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:09.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:17.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:24.120]  Alex Jones welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones show Mike Adams
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.520]  filling in for Alex today but he will be joining us in approximately 25 minutes
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.600]  with some announcements about Bilderberg so that's gonna be interesting he's got
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.360]  some some major announcements to make and between now and then we continue to
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.280]  be joined by arnie gunderson nuclear industry expert an outspoken scientist
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.480]  I don't know if outspoken is the right word just just somebody who's willing to
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.000]  tell the truth you know which is so rare today that it almost seems extraordinary
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.520]  but it is just someone willing to tell the truth he continues with us arnie
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.800]  are you still there yeah I'm still here okay great great so you in the last
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.640]  segment we talked about how the amount of radiation released from Fukushima has
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.040]  already vastly exceeded the amount released from Chernobyl and that
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.120]  catastrophic accident in Ukraine but what about the amount of energy contained
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.640]  in these these these partially spent fuel rods that that could conceivably burn
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.320]  is there any estimation of how much energy is in that fuel compared to
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.160]  Chernobyl oh that would be 20 times Chernobyl but I'm sure you know so
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.560]  you're suddenly that 85 doesn't look too unrealistic when you start looking at
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.440]  any single fuel pool you know I said earlier you know everybody's focused on
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.920]  unit 4 and rightfully so but unit 3 had a more severe explosion and it's like
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.720]  you're likely structurally weakened even more than unit 4 and the unit 3 pool
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.960]  has about half as much nuclear fuel as the unit 4 pool so it's not it's not
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:07.360]  clear to me that units 3 is a whole heck of a lot better what is the thinking
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.760]  behind this idea of whoever engineered these these nuclear power plants and I
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.360]  know US corporations I think General Electric was one was part of the key
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.240]  designer you can correct me if I'm wrong about that but what is this idea of
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.080]  let's store nuclear fuel 30 meters above the ground in a pool why not always
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.000]  store it at ground level or underground even on site that's a great question I
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.440]  asked that question 40 years ago when I started my career and at the time they
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.760]  don't do that anymore it's just this mark one reactor and a few mark twos that
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.320]  do that all the other boiling water reactors the mark threes and all the
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.880]  other pressurized water reactors do store it down low then that at the time
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.720]  this thing was designed you got to remember this was designed in the mid
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:01.360]  sixties they were afraid that if they opened gates and and and the fuel pool
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.520]  was lower than a nuclear reactor they could drain the nuclear reactor so if
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.520]  they put the pool on the same elevation as the reactor that wouldn't happen so
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.720]  there was a logic behind it but then they they basically developed a better
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.960]  fuel transfer mechanism that that doesn't happen I see you know that the you
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.320]  can get this fuel out of these pools that the technology is there that this
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.320]  dry cast storage is available and there were dry casts of Fukushima they all
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:37.080]  survived the tsunami just fine in the US we could take all of our fuel pools that
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:43.160]  are totally overcrowded and put them on the ground but the problem is the the
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.080]  NRC is letting the utilities that own them get away with it because they don't
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:52.000]  want to spend the money well of course it's isn't it always about saving money
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.840]  even if they put the population at risk and that's the sad part about this but
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.600]  if you get back to the 1960s when this was being designed this this is this is
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.400]  this a mark one facility or mark two this is a mark one mark one certainly in
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.080]  the 1960s the scientists at that time must have known that Japan that whole
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.520]  region was geologically extremely active that was that's not a big secret even
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.520]  in the 1960s how could they I'm not asking I'm not accusing you obviously you
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.120]  didn't put it there but I'm asking you to try to help us understand what kind of
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.840]  weird thinking went on how could they even place a nuclear facility right on
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.520]  the coast where it would be hit by a tsunami 10 seconds and we got to go
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.880]  break and we'll answer it on the other side okay great okay sorry I didn't mean
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.000]  to set you up like that Arnie I'm fine my timing mistake there but we'll be back
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.560]  with an answer to that question and much more straight ahead on the Alex Jones
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.320]  show this is Mike Adams filling in stay with us a lot more straight ahead we'll
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.640]  be right back
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.240]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.560]  amazing is it what's happening in our world and the lack of a reasonable
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.280]  reaction to it we've got a Fukushima situation that quite literally
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.320]  threatens life as we know it in the northern hemisphere it doesn't mean it
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.600]  would instantly kill us all but it could unleash radiation that could kill us
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.440]  slowly it's the big slow kill situation it could contaminate our food supply for
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.240]  literally centuries if if the worst case happens so we want to prevent that we
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.840]  want to solve this problem and just before the break Arne Gunnerson from
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:49.400]  fairwinds.com who is probably arguably the most respected expert who's
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.280]  speaking out on this issue he said that we have the technology to remove the
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  fuel from these precarious fuel pools and put them in a safer storage location
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.720]  so my question to you Arne and thank you for your continued time with us here I
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.280]  know you're extremely busy and I really honor your your your time here on the
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.000]  show why isn't the international community and the US in particular on
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.840]  all hands-on deck red alert let's go over there and solve this problem
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:25.760]  immediately and eliminate this danger now. My one word answer is money the you
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:32.080]  know and it's not we didn't have to wait for Fukushima to know that that a
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.600]  problem of this nature was was looking over our shoulder there there have been
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:42.800]  experts out there saying it for years might myself include it there there's
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.040]  this stuff called dry cast storage where after the fuels about three or four
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.200]  years old it will camp can be cooled in air and so it gets put in these castes
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.160]  still hotter than a pistol from a radiation standpoint but the physical
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.880]  heat is down they put them in these huge casts that way a hundred or more tons
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:07.480]  and they set them on the ground and until we get a long-term storage solution
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.520]  the best place is out of those pools and on the ground the the Nuclear
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.280]  Regulatory Commission is playing games with this and they're saying well we
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.800]  need to consider all of the costs as well as the benefit of getting it out of
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.680]  the pool. Wait a minute let me interrupt you there and I apologize Arnie but when
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.440]  they needed to bail out Goldman Sachs they came up with the money they just
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.520]  created a trillion dollars out of nothing and they bailed out the banks so how
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.200]  is it that that banks that saving the banks is more important than saving
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.640]  humanity potentially I mean does the NRC does the US government not
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.080]  understand a scale of dangers I don't get this why aren't the why the banks
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.840]  more important than saving humanity. No I think you're absolutely right you know
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.880]  and the money's there it's not like you know for the banks we had to create the
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.880]  money sort of but there's a thirty twenty seven billion dollar fund for a
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.840]  long-term storage now that set aside for looking for geological storage and
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.800]  things like that but we could use that fund so we have been putting in a tenth
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.000]  of a penny per kilowatt of nuclear power we use for years and years and years and
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.400]  so this fund has developed over twenty billion dollars we could use that fund
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:28.760]  to put it all into put all these fuel pools in the dry cast storage and this
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.840]  problem would be solved both from a terrorism standpoint as well as from
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.720]  you know an act of God like at Fukushima this is solvable. What kind of
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.600]  timeframe if the money were made available today let's say if the Federal
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.280]  Reserve actually wanted to solve this problem and they went into the little
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.640]  computer and they typed in some digits and created another trillion dollars
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.880]  like they did every time they wanted to bail out Wall Street that money were
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.080]  available what are we talking in terms of total cleanup like ten weeks longer
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.680]  six months what what's the what do you think it is. You just have to fabricate
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.960]  the containers and it would probably take a year or two to fabricate enough
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.400]  containers so you know certainly within three years it's solvable and and it
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.040]  doesn't even take an act of Congress or the Federal Reserve it just takes the
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.120]  Nuclear Regulatory Commission saying do it. But even okay if you say two or
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.640]  three years to create these containers but in that timeframe then between now
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.360]  and the time that this has solved an earthquake that you said a seven or a
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.640]  seven point five magnitude earthquake with an epicenter near Fukushima could
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.080]  bring this pool down before the problem is solved and thereby unleash this
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.080]  massive amount of radiation it seems like we are at risk for this time period
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.880]  and and the government has that the NRC hasn't even announced that it's going to
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.120]  take these steps to solve it so we could be facing this risk for a decade
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.720]  couldn't we. Well we've got yeah there's two two questions there one I like what I
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.800]  was talking about is in the US we could solve this in three years and just pray
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.680]  there's no earthquake you know in Fukushima I was on I was on Chris
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.720]  Martinson a year ago and I explained how you could solve this problem which was
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.000]  to build a building outside the building to lift the nuclear fuel out and just
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.280]  last week Tokyo Electric said you know we're gonna build a building around the
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.040]  building they are taking way too long to solve this problem because of exactly
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.760]  the concerns that you know another earthquake could come. But it so it
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.720]  seems like we are being smothered by red tape here we are it's it's like
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.920]  humanity is hanging on the edge of a cliff by our fingernails figuratively
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.000]  speaking this radiation of release could happen at any moment if if mother
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.400]  nature if an earthquake takes place and yet governments everywhere Japan and
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.200]  US in particular are dragging their feet on this and and doing nothing they're
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.120]  not taking responsibility they're not even they're not even serving the
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.120]  interests of the people that they claim to represent this this is pathetic this
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.400]  is sad because it's a case of almost another you know demo side death by
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.480]  government if the worst case happens. Well I think it's you know death by the
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.680]  nuclear industry deeply infused into government here this is a you know they
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.800]  the regulator the Japanese have a great word when when people working for the
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.840]  regulator go to work at a high level and well-paying jobs at the utility they
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:29.400]  call it ascent into heaven. So there's this this is coziness and it's with the
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:36.000]  the IAEA who I've seen papers say that they're a watchdog in fact article two
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.560]  of their charter says their goal is to promote nuclear power. So the industry
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.560]  and the government are essentially one no matter where you go. The Prime Minister
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.000]  of Japan now was the finance minister during the accident and one of his
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.560]  email surfaced about about a month ago and it said it was from three weeks
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:02.360]  after the accident and he said whatever you do do not affect TEPCO. So you know
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.080]  they've been more interested in protecting TEPCO and in their own
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.800]  bureaucratic butts than they have been about protecting the people of Japan.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.240]  Well what's new and what what government body or department doesn't want to
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.400]  cover its own butt or in hey in the case of the ATF or the DEA in America they
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.520]  actually create problems so they get bigger budgets and and become more
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.440]  powerful. The CDC did that the FBI does that running these false terror events
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.240]  but that's that's a different topic. Let me ask you this I noticed that the the
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.480]  general public it has a very poor understanding of what I would call
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:43.880]  relative risk. I was trained as in a scientific way as an engineer very
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.240]  strong background in mathematics and I often think about the relative risk of
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.920]  events a lot of people are concerned about let's say Yellowstone exploding well
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.520]  that happens once every 600,000 years or they're they're concerned about a
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.920]  comet or an asteroid hitting the planet that's possible but in terms of
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:05.600]  relative risk the Fukushima event is here now it is it is orders of
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.520]  magnitude more likely than many of these other concerns that tend to dominate
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.040]  people's psychological focus. Can you speak to this issue of relative risk and
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.000]  having an appropriate perception of what risks really exist? Yeah I have a
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.480]  saying sooner or later in any foolproof system the fools are going to exceed the
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:31.480]  proofs and I think that we fooled ourselves at Fukushima we as a world
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.280]  and essentially this concept is for any reactor but let's look at Fukushima
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.840]  you know we knew we could build a power plant that could withstand the Richter
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:49.400]  7 and a 3 meter a 9 foot tsunami so that's what we built and we fooled
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.280]  ourselves into thinking that that's what mother nature was going to give us a
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:17:01.120]  7 Richter 3 foot 3 meter tsunami. The economics to build a plant to withstand
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.760]  the Richter 8 or a 60 foot tsunami would have made it so you wouldn't have
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.400]  built that nuclear plant you couldn't have afforded to build that nuclear plant
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.880]  so I think that in the back of the people's minds who are advocates of the
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:20.200]  technology they convinced themselves that mother nature is going to be benign
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.680]  yeah go ahead. No I'm just laughing keep going that because they're so
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.200]  they're so wrong mother nature always gives you it hands you something that's
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.560]  completely unanticipated in fact you cannot even imagine the human mind even
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.440]  even a brilliant nuclear engineer nuclear physicist cannot accurately
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:44.440]  anticipate the the unexpected nature of mother nature. You know my my journey has
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.040]  been from you know pro nuclear senior vice president and then I got to the
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.400]  point when I blew the whistle and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.760]  bribes and deliberately botched inspection I still believed in the
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.360]  technology but I didn't believe in government and now the Fukushima
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.080]  accident has pushed me over and I'm at a point where just like what you said I
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.760]  don't believe that mankind can build something strong enough that mother
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:13.320]  nature can't knock it down and considering the consequences you know
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:17.520]  it's not just the risk the the if it was you know one person getting knocked
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.680]  over a tsunami that's one thing but the risk of this and and the consequences
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.760]  yeah yeah there has to be risk versus consequences because that that's the
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:32.400]  other side of the equation yeah you know Gorbachev said that in his memoir so
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.600]  this is a smart guy he's been around a while he said that it wasn't perestroika
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.480]  that ruined the the Soviet Union it was Chernobyl I think we're seeing the same
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.040]  thing here with Fukushima this is going to be a half a trillion or more dollars
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.920]  and that works out to be about four thousand dollars for every man woman and
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:56.400]  child in Japan and it's gonna bring that country to its knees to is do we want
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.760]  a technology that can be perfect for 40 years and then have one bad day and wipe
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.360]  you out very good question arnie gutterson we're almost out of time I

[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.560]  and we can store the nuclear waste for a quarter of a million years but those
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:30.120]  same people are saying we can't use solar because we can't store the solar
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.480]  electricity overnight and that doesn't make sense to me if we can develop a
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.600]  technology to store nuclear waste for a quarter of a million years we can
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.320]  certainly develop batteries or something to store the Sun overnight

[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.280]  oh Mike you're so great thank you for thank you for sitting on the show here
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:53.160]  no yeah I just realized yesterday that the end of this month is creeping up on
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:59.520]  us very very fast racing towards us and so over the weekend and then on Monday
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.840]  up at info wars.com we're going to have some breakdowns almost coming up with
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.360]  Bilderberg this year I mean these are the people running our military openly
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.880]  growing the opium in Afghanistan think about that public view these are the
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.600]  people worldwide installing continuity of agenda TSA groping with a roller
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:25.200]  of air and now saying he was raped by the DSA that's what this is legally is
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.280]  rape what they're doing but they they take him out and brutalize him
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:32.640]  particularly just like many congressmen this is about getting away with
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.760]  whatever they want the Bilderberg crowd are the people that are running all of
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.240]  this they are at the very top of the pyramid there's other powerful creeps
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:46.440]  but those are all run by Bilderberg attendees as well and so who's the big
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:51.480]  announcement a lot of folks know Kim's getting old and he's kind of passed the
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.880]  baton over to Mr. Anderson over America pre-pressed doing a great job I in the
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.440]  last two years was contacted by somebody inside Bilderberg I'll just leave it
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.960]  that I won't say that the member or one of their assistant secretaries whatever
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:10.520]  I'm not gonna say I then got another source earlier well last week and folks
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.280]  noticed I was able to call and do the name of the conference palm tree conference
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.520]  that Bilderberg is booked under so right now Bilderberg is 100% at the Westfield
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.120]  Marriott I was talking to a national journalist last week and they're like
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:28.200]  is it really gonna be there and I said yeah I mean they're booked because
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.520]  there's a slight chance that he's only done this once before they could know
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.560]  that a big crowd's coming to protest them and move it somewhere but that's
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.680]  probably not gonna happen and I'll know by actually today I've got to make some
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.480]  phone calls but today and tomorrow is when the Bilderberg group people all
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.680]  officially fill the slots they've had the invitation the code word and they have
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:55.480]  the call and get booked under the palm tree group but the hotel in Virginia is
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.520]  shut down for those days the 31st of May is the third of June so for those three
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.640]  and a half four days I'm gonna be there and it's also important to ask
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:10.440]  completely peacefully in the info war protesting and also alternative media
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.920]  coverage our guys just on Justin TV last year Paul Watanair and I said three
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:19.680]  and a half million views in three days just on a Justin TV account that we
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.400]  never even used so we're gonna be live on Justin TV we're gonna be live at
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.560]  Prism Planet dot TV in higher quality we're gonna be all over the place this
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.840]  is gonna be a very special year and unless they back off and move somewhere
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.520]  else to go to Canada or go back to Europe and I'm just gonna have that they
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.000]  are there it is confirmed and I now have a source I've had it the last few years
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.480]  but it's definitely confirmed I now have a source in Bilderberg something that
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.000]  only Jim Tucker has really had I think people have had some on the sidelines
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.760]  this is a big victory for us and now I just don't have one I have two so yeah
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:06.400]  it's it's a pretty big victory a lot of boffins die to bring us this
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.840]  information to close our wars to both we've got the plans now we've got to
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.080]  rally everyone yes be there I want to see thousands of people if we can get
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:23.480]  Europeans over 500 at one time go up in the middle of nowhere in St. Moritz and
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.240]  he was about to block the trains to go into the area for any activists or
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:32.280]  foreigners then we should be able to get a few thousand people peacefully to
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:36.520]  demand media coverage and make the corporate or media cover it because
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.760]  remember all these decades it didn't exist we were crazy now they have to
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.400]  admit it but they don't want to cover it and Alex I'm I'm glad you mentioned
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.480]  peacefully in terms of the protest because that's crucial to send that
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.480]  message out to those who are going to be there joining you in the protest are you
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:55.120]  expecting instigators to come in and try to cause problems to be blamed on you
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.000]  you know I don't think so we've seen some of this at other big G20s and
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.720]  things because that's about showing you you're a slave it's a martial law drill
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.720]  whether it's in England whether it's in Italy whether it's in Germany whether
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.080]  it's in the US or Canada G20 always standardized letting you know that you're
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.480]  a slave you're a piece of felt basically martial law is what they have in
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:21.000]  Chicago with NATO coming up they want you to know that you're a slave and set
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.480]  that precedent when it's a real elite Bilderberg meeting where real decisions
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.800]  are being made not just in public policy stuff like the NATO and G20 meeting
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.800]  20 seconds

[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.920]  seven zero three six five remember in a real crisis non hybrid seeds are the
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:33:09.680]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com we're
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.440]  back on the Alex Jones show on this Friday May 11 thank you for joining us
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:17.680]  a lot of hard-hitting issues straight ahead and we continue to be joined by
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.320]  Alex Jones himself via phone with his continued announcements about the
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.920]  Builder burrs go ahead Alex get to finish up and get back to the incredibly
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.960]  important issue of the Pashima that the elite aren't worried about you know 80
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:36.560]  plus times Chernobyl no that's no big deal again these are the globalists that
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.600]  think they're God four years ago Madeline Albright pulled in the wrong turn and was
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:46.040]  panicking and basically crying lucratowski and others saw her so scared
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.840]  of just maybe 150 people that were out there at one time and that's another
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.080]  issue I've got to think about this to come up with a plan people are welcome
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:57.840]  to their own plans but in the next few days maybe even today I'm making an
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.920]  article out of info wars calm but definitely this weekend I'm gonna call
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:06.160]  them and work on with Watson to just have some basic rally times and points
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.800]  so we can all rally at one point and then also you know protest and do live
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.840]  coverage we must continually through the day and the night there from the 31st
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.040]  through the third again they're gonna arrive that Thursday afternoon the hotel
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:23.800]  will be shut down that morning and then they start meeting Friday and Saturday
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:29.720]  then they play golf on Sunday at least that's another issue we know which
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.880]  golf course nearby they go through so there's just a lot of things we're gonna
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.040]  be there covering it and four years ago there of course Obama and Hillary were
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.880]  meeting in secret was the number one story in the country where they
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:44.480]  disappeared to for a day we were there we knew they were there secret service
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:48.680]  was there getting in our face pointing guns at us you know driving by in their
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:54.120]  motor cage showing us their HK 9 millimeter submachine gun like like
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.640]  that would scare us just US citizens trying to cover public officials breaking
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.800]  the Logan Act meeting in secret with Royal D and others and Rockefellers and
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.840]  Rothschilds and him because and you're setting the destiny of our world trying
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:12.280]  to bring it in 21 I'm just a free man who wants my freedom and so I'm I'm
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:18.720]  a provocateur's intent just to recap we'd be at the hotel you know while
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.120]  billard was going on at our hotel at night just in a hamburger in the bar
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.440]  they'd have big FBI guys you know come and sit down on each side of us and say
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:31.760]  let's attack something I'm just like come on guys I mean what are you secret
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.440]  service what are you FBI and then later we learned they were they were assigned
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.800]  diplomatic security corps assigned to the State Department and they had plain
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:47.240]  clothes Marines out there all of this like we're bad as Americans on a bunch
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:52.320]  of criminals are meeting in there and aren't supposed to exist we're here
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.280]  covering the real issue they might provocateur something they might stage
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:00.840]  something they might do something but I I seriously doubt it because they don't
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:06.000]  want to draw attention to this real meeting G20s and things like that are
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.320]  about global standardization of the exact same police state snatch and grabs
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.320]  no First Amendment no free speech Soviet system comes to America it comes to
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.680]  Canada it comes to Australia wherever they have these meetings global
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:24.960]  standardization they do not want that at these meetings and again it is it is on
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:31.120]  it is set it is it is happening and everybody needs to be there if you can
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.680]  take off work in the morning Thursday and some still arrive late on Friday they'll
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.800]  be arriving all day that's always a great time to cover all the entrances so
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.800]  that we can get videos and criminals like Osama bin Bernanke and others
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:52.920]  arriving but undoubtedly we need some big rally point and I'm thinking that
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:57.280]  should be something like Saturday evening that like six o'clock and just rally
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:02.040]  and bullhorn right through into the dark at like eight o'clock at night I think
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.440]  that's an important thing to do but again I'm gonna put out a basic battle plan
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.880]  of what I plan to be building the info or and if you want to rally at those
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.680]  points that's great but everybody needs to be there you know I had through the
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.800]  term out a few weeks ago occupied Bilderberg and some people came out and
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.920]  said well you know that's kind of the socialist occupy movement it doesn't
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.280]  matter the word occupy just simply gets immediate attention we can call it
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.760]  confront Bilderberg with the truth or rally you know against globalist it
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.400]  doesn't matter the point is we're gonna be there having a protest having
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.000]  demonstrations for three and a half four days because it will get international
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.480]  press coverage it will get huge alternative media coverage it will be
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.520]  absolutely huge and it will probably force the US media to cover it as well
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.040]  enough people are there and then that exposes the fact that Obama is just a
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.600]  puppet and admit Romney's just a puppet and there's a real power behind the
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.480]  throne and thanks the drug report glass four or five years it's been forced in
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.720]  the mainstream media that's why three weeks ago the Washington Post admitted
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:08.560]  that basically Bilderberg group grooms both political candidate and vice
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.560]  presidential candidate an amazing admission from a paper that's been
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.800]  part of the meeting going back to 1954 and it was your back home when it first
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.000]  kicked off but listen get to your next guest I just wanted to make this
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.520]  announcement here that guess it's on guess it's in Chantilly and now we're
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:30.120]  only like 20 days or less away from the kickoff of this so folks don't say you
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:35.840]  didn't have a chance to really go protest and expose some real globalists
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.840]  you know the advertised nature of the advertised RNC DNC you go there the
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.600]  cops are all waiting for you they billy club you they found again and yet they're
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.440]  there to treat everybody like slaves teach everybody there's no freedom in
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.720]  America same thing in Europe but they don't do that at these because they
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:58.040]  don't want the media attention the police quite frankly will be there with
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:02.800]  red carpets and be asking you you need to eliminate I mean not quite but they
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:07.240]  have been told in Canada once you actually get through the court and they've
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.160]  been told in Virginia do not arrest anybody because then the media will
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.000]  have to report on it so again I think the safety level is very high but we a
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.040]  lot of media monitors cameras on at all times to cover whatever happens if the
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:25.080]  feds try to provocateur some stuff they did do one little thing as a test four
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.720]  years ago when I was in Virginia we are going to be on them exposing their
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.960]  criminal false flags because their their their garbage doesn't work anymore but
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.400]  these are the criminals these are the enemies of America this is one of the
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.760]  most important concepts and it's right here in the US we have got a real chance
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.720]  to force this out there Mike Adams and the whole crew there God bless you get
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.680]  your next guest and we'll have more info wars calm in the next few days on
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.080]  this and I'll see all of you in Virginia all right thank you Alex
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.640]  outstanding information sounds like it's going to be not just a powerful rally
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:59.440]  but actually just a great time to meet other like-minded people out there at
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.440]  this peaceful rally that Alex Jones is calling for once again check info wars
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:09.000]  calm for the details about the rally points at the rally times out there at
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.320]  the event bring your recording devices your video recorders your audio
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.800]  recorders your hidden video recorders whatever it takes to get put three or
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.360]  four cameras on your body mount them everywhere and get video and upload it
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:24.240]  to YouTube this is the time to get the word out about that and Alex if you need
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.760]  my help here to hold down the home base in Austin I'll be happy to come in and
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.000]  help coordinate during that time if you've got reporters on the road and you
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.880]  need someone to fill in locally to fill in the the gaps in the reports let me
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.040]  know this is this is about all of us working together for this right here
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.240]  Liberty I've got it got the symbol of liberty on our desk here if you're if
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.600]  you're watching a prison planet TV now moving on yeah there it is nice nice
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:55.200]  little statuette there I tried to find one made in America and that was a
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:59.880]  challenge so I'm looking for an American made statuette that I can put on this
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:04.040]  desk and bring it with me so if anybody has got one I'd be happy to buy it from
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.840]  you please I'd like an American artist to have a statuette here of the American
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:11.360]  Eagle and the flags and the freedom and everything that's what I'm really looking

[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.800]  to show tips at info wars.com now we're moving on to our next guest at Dr. Len
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:28.720]  saputo and his website is dr saputo.com and he joins us to talk about the
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.520]  solutions for what happens if the Fukushima radiation is unleashed in
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.400]  the ways that we talked about during our interview with Arne Gunderson North
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.800]  America in fact the entire northern hemisphere could be just drastically
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.680]  affected in a hugely negative way. Dr. Saputo thank you for joining me today
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.440]  with some solutions it's great to have you on. Thank you Mike it's always a
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.480]  pleasure being your show I really enjoyed listening to Arne Gunderson talk
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:57.960]  about the magnitude of the problem. Yeah he really laid it out for us didn't he
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.520]  this is not a small deal this is a globally impacting event we are on the
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.080]  edge of a cliff as a race as human civilization so hanging on by our
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.600]  fingernails as I said this thing could go terribly wrong if that happens we're
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.120]  going to see a massive amount of radiation released much of it falling
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.800]  on to North America that's going to put people in a situation where they need
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.960]  protection from radiation many people don't realize there are lots of things
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.800]  they can do what would you like to start with Dr. Saputo? Well first of all talk
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:34.600]  about how little radiation it takes to cause problems I mean we're looking at
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.840]  a massive amount of radiation we don't know the amount that's going to come
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.240]  across this country but there are a lot of things we can do to prepare that are
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.720]  really safe and easy to do I mean the things like diet and supplements
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:51.040]  exercise we forget about the value of lifestyle measures you're trying to
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.960]  really fight here against the effects of the ionizing radiation which cause a
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.280]  lot of free radical damage which is what destroys our tissue and what causes the
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.640]  problem for radiation now we can combat that by building up our own
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.320]  antioxidant levels and we can do that endogenously meaning inside of our body
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.640]  with our own defenses by doing a lot of exercise and that's not a small thing if
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.920]  we do hard exercise we build a lot of free radicals in our body and our body
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.080]  adapts to it beautifully that's what happens when we get into shape but
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.480]  there are also a lot of foods we can use and a lot of supplements that I think
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:31.920]  are outstanding can you name some of the best foods and some of the best
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:35.960]  supplements that you know of yeah absolutely we've got foods that are
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.800]  rich in sulfur like garlic and onions ginger the brassica vegetables are out
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.680]  there eggs are very good and these all make glutathione which is the most
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:48.960]  important interest in our oxidant and the oxidant we have in our body and then
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:54.000]  there are foods that are rich in in ECGC you know the green and white teas if you
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.960]  juice that's probably the best way to get the most debt nutrient dense food
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.360]  that's on the planet and that'll do a lot to build up your antioxidants
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.920]  particularly if you add berries to that and then we look at things like the
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:08.240]  fermented foods that are rich in probiotics you know those friendly
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.880]  bacteria it's an interesting study on this done Mike that shows that if you
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:18.080]  have the right probiotics right microflory and the intestinal tract that
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.520]  it actually protects against radiation damage that was a shock to me when I saw
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.320]  that but indeed it's published in the mainstream medicine yeah well you're
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.640]  absolutely right I want to comment on that you know radiation damages you by
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:36.520]  when the the ionizing radiation strikes your DNA it causes it can knock out a
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:41.480]  piece of the code of the DNA code that then causes your cells to replicate in
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.120]  a cancerous type of way but there are nutritional and biological mechanisms
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:52.040]  that the human body has built in in its blueprint to repair DNA right exactly
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.280]  exactly and then there are a whole bunch of supplements you know that are
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.040]  wonderful that in concert can do a lot it's always better to do the things
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.600]  that you can to build up your own defenses but when you're looking at
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:07.720]  massive amounts of radiation I mean if it's enough you can forget it because
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:11.120]  there's not going to be much of anything you can do yeah but you can add some
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.280]  things that will make a difference things like vitamin A maybe 5,000 I use a
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:21.120]  day and a little beta carotene of 25,000 I use a day and vitamin E and vitamin D
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.480]  another one that is really important maybe up to 10,000 units a day oh yeah
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.640]  they've done some studies on on rats where they poisoned them with radiation
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.360]  poisoning enough to kill them and when they gave them just a couple of grams of
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.320]  vitamin C only about half of the rats died so if we took ourselves to what's
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.000]  called bowel tolerance with vitamin C that would be a tremendously potent way
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.600]  to protect against the the effects of radiation and that might be something
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.080]  like 10,000 milligrams a day I mean a big large dose of vitamin C which is
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.560]  perfectly safe it's a water soluble vitamin right all it's going to do is
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.040]  perhaps give you a little bit of loose stools if you overdo it but there's no
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.560]  real harm from from there's a whole protocol on my website that takes you
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.040]  to what's called bowel tolerance and some people can take as much as 40 or
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:12.520]  50,000 units a day and if you're going to be exposed to radiation and you were
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.200]  exposed to it then your ability to tolerate the vitamin C would even go
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.920]  up it's called tolerance to vitamin C so take it at the bowel tolerance is really
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:25.120]  an important thing to do and it's a it's an amazingly potent anti-radiation
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.480]  protective mechanism all right now I think it's important what you just said
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.360]  and I want to encourage people to visit your website doctorsaputo.com just like
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:37.160]  it sounds S-A-P-U-T-O.com doctorsaputo.com you've got some protocols
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.840]  described there you said that essentially is something very important you
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.560]  can't just take some vitamins chug some juice and then go walk through Chernobyl
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.520]  and expect to survive it's not this is not a bulletproof nutritional suit you've
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:57.600]  got to build up this nutrition over time right exactly that's why lifestyle is so
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.960]  important and why fitness is so important and what you eat is so important
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.000]  getting enough sleep is important all the things that are in our usual lifestyle
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.560]  are important to do the right way I mean if we did that it wouldn't just be
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.080]  protection against radiation and be protection against almost every chronic
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.280]  disease there is that's right heart disease cancer diabetes yeah yeah we
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:23.120]  also have some other direct firsthand observations on nutrition versus
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:27.680]  radiation because I I know lots of people who have family members or
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.480]  friends who have gone into radiotherapy for cancer you know radiation
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.400]  treatments for cancer and if you look at what kinds of nutritional protocols
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.440]  they follow before they go into that you've got two groups you've got the
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:42.640]  junk food group that normally do terribly and they suffer all kinds of
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.320]  terrible side effects from the radiation and then you've got the holistic
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:49.720]  nutrition group that normally recovers and goes on to live a long life they do
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:53.160]  a lot better particularly if you're on an alkaline diet and you're adding some
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:56.240]  of the supplements we're talking about and we didn't actually there's some
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.480]  others that I want to mention that I think are really powerful things like
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:03.600]  for as veratrol I mean that's actually been tested and mice who've been
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.400]  poisoned with radiation and the ones that around about 500 milligram or
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.240]  equivalent dose that we would take them about 500 milligrams a day do really
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:16.320]  well and things like L. glutamine another really important nutrient to take
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.800]  because see the damage from acute radiation poisoning comes from two
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:24.520]  sources what and and these are all cells that turn over fast rapidly and those
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:29.440]  are in the gut and and that's what really kills most people and that's if
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:32.920]  it's acute enough it just wipes out the cells because they only have a three day
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.720]  turnover there yeah when you're getting poisoned by radiation if you throw in
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.840]  some L. glutamine which is a major metabolic fuel of the gut and if you are
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.680]  the nutrients that the gut likes it's got a much better chance of surviving
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:49.840]  same thing with probiotics like I was mentioning before so all these things
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:53.560]  when they're taken together in concert maybe throw a little quercision in there
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:58.480]  as well a great anti-inflammatory bioflavonoid that protects against
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:03.400]  inflammation you can do a lot to protect yourself yeah I want to have some go
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:06.440]  ahead I want to mention a couple I went back to the info wars store actually
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:09.520]  before the show here to grab a couple of supplements that I'm personally
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:14.320]  familiar with that are also well known to help protect against radiation I just
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.760]  want to mention those the first is called thyro say if this is just your
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.240]  standard potassium iodide tablets in the ki that's you know protector thyroid
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:25.680]  that's well known but the other one that's not so well known that I've
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.920]  actually covered I actually interviewed the founder of this company in 2008 and
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:35.440]  the company the product is called muddy feeling muddy feeling it is a brown
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.360]  seaweed extract this is an extraordinary nutritional product it has
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:45.520]  been used in other not necessarily in this brand name but this the the actual
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.760]  seaweed itself the brown seaweed was used following the nuclear attacks the
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.480]  the atomic bomb attacks of World War two it was used following Chernobyl and I
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.400]  don't have any financial ties to this company by the way I just know this to
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:03.200]  be very very useful for protecting against radiation and that is available
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.440]  at the info wars store by the way and in fact you can read my interview with the
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.800]  founder of that company just go to naturalnews.com and search for muddy
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.720]  feeling m-o-d-i-f-i-l-a-n or search for brown seaweed extract you can read that
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.640]  interview so I just want to add that in Dr. Seputo because there's so many great
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:23.000]  supplements available for protecting yourself you're not totally helpless
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.160]  right you know all this can be kind of overwhelming because we're really giving
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:31.240]  out a ton of information here I've got it all outlined on my site if you go to
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.320]  Dr. Seputo.com on the home page you have a section there where it talks
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:38.560]  about all the things we've talked about in the show and all the supplements and
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:42.160]  foods that we've reviewed yeah thank you that's very useful information we're
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:46.560]  going to talk about more solutions as we continue here on the Alex Jones show so
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:50.520]  stay with us we'll be right back in just a couple of minutes with more solutions
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:56.480]  for radiation protection all across the world stay with us
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:02.720]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.760]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:11.200]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:16.080]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.440]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team.com but

[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.800]  battle for saving humanity from all the various forces of darkness and evil and
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:27.800]  destruction and death that are trying to destroy us all there's so many it's
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.240]  it's it's almost hard to know where to you know where to begin some days but we
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.360]  were just talking about supplements we've got Dr. Len Seputo on the line with
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:40.480]  us with some solutions of what can we do if the Fukushima reactor goes into
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.920]  another burnout situation that was just described to us by Arne Gunderson where
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.720]  it actually bursts into flames the the spent fuel rods are partially spent
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:54.360]  fuel rods burst into flames and release masses of radiation and even he said you
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:58.160]  know this is way way worse than Chernobyl in terms of the amount of
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:03.960]  radiation that would be released in the cesium 137 and 134 isotopes both that
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:10.320]  would head into North America and then I was just thinking during the break that
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:16.400]  if that happened we would have maybe a 10-day window between the the the actual
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:22.680]  fire event in Fukushima and the arrival of the cesium on the land on on the on
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.360]  North America so in that 10-day window you know what's gonna happen
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.320]  everybody and their brother is gonna rush out and buy health foods and
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.480]  everybody's gonna buy this stuff thyro safe potassium iodide you remember you
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.720]  couldn't get you could not get this last year during the actual following the
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:44.800]  Fukushima meltdown situation you could not get this this box I don't know what
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.240]  this cost it's probably a few bucks some people were selling this on ebay for
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:56.640]  $600 a box so if you don't have Ki or potassium iodide in your emergency
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.240]  medical kit right now this is the time to get it because you can get it because
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:06.440]  nobody's paying attention it's the only time to get it because once once it
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.960]  goes up with Fukushima this is gone this will sell out believe me here on
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:14.280]  info wars this would be gone in 24 hours absolutely gone and Alex would be on the
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.640]  show telling you it's gone sorry you should have got it six months ago when
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.600]  you could when it was cheap and we had the same situation over at natural news
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.520]  we couldn't get any more it was sold out but getting back to Dr. Len Seputo
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:30.240]  thank you again for joining me Dr. Seputo always great to have you on what
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.920]  other let's talk about the junk food diet of the typical American consumer
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:40.840]  isn't that diet then making them more susceptible to radiation damage and we
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.600]  talked about the nutrition side what about the anti nutrition side well
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:49.040]  there's no question when you when you look at your cells as a microscopic
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.360]  industrial plant and their job is to make product okay all the things that we
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.120]  need to make our cells function to keep us healthy and if all of our cells are
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.960]  healthy you can't be sick but if you don't put the raw materials into that
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.760]  microscopic industrial plant it can't make products out of thin air so if you're
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.400]  taking junk food in that has empty calories or has things that are harmful
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:12.680]  to your health then that the bottom line is going to be that you're not going to
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:16.520]  be able to respond when there's any kind of need for the products that your
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.360]  cells are supposed to make to keep you healthy so it's pretty straightforward I
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.280]  think one of the things we forget about is that we we need to be prepared
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:30.000]  be prepared now for what would be happening in the future so your point is
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.200]  well taken there we need to be doing the things like buying the thyroid or
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:40.440]  the that's I wrote thyroid SSKI substance today we need to be living a
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.280]  healthy lifestyle today you need to build up your antioxidant levels you
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.440]  need to do all the things that you can do to make your body as stronger so that
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.760]  you can fight against the radiation when it comes across that's absolutely right
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:54.960]  doctors would all show this on camera once again this is my famous jar of
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.920]  superfood I always have one here at the studio this is got this is absolutely
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.800]  loaded with nutrition and you can't you can't just take this
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:08.360]  thyro safe potassium iodide you can't just eat a junk food diet and take this
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:12.400]  and think now you're safe it's not enough you got to have a healthy
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.880]  nutritional diet you got to follow what Aaron Dykes is doing and what Alex is
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:19.160]  doing with the nutrition with the mineralization if you want to be safe
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:22.200]  from radiation that's got to start right now Dr. Seputo sorry to be
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:25.240]  interrupting you so much but stay with us we'll continue with you on the other
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:29.520]  side I just I get passionate about this stuff we'll be right back more here on

[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:51.760]  would blow it all across North America within 10 days they would hit Alaska in
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.960]  as just as little as five days this is a very serious threat to us in fact if you

[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:32.400]  drink right here people ask me what is that stuff that's actually living fuel
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:37.320]  is what that is that's a living fuel.com the Maudi Fee land here on top of the
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.960]  tangy tangerine you guys can pan up perhaps and get there you go that is at
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:46.520]  the InfoWars store the brown seaweed extract we're not went out and bought

[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.440]  minerals and all these supplements all these products these are highly
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.760]  protective of the human body these keep you safe Dr. Saputo your comments on
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:15.680]  nutritional victory in America. Well see Mike you're doing a great job here that
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:20.040]  no one else is much doing on natural news and of course on this show you're
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.120]  spreading information that the American public needs to know and it's not being
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:28.080]  popularized the press is hiding a lot of this stuff I don't know if they want
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:31.800]  us to be sick or what but I think a lot of it has to do with just the money it's
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:35.800]  in the industry that gives us fast foods and foods that are nutritionally
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:40.440]  deficient so I just I want to thank you so much for what you're doing here
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.800]  because it's the education that makes the change possible you know how we
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:49.880]  spend our money has a big effect on what business are going to come and be
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:55.120]  popular because money talks so we have a tremendous amount of power just in the
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:59.680]  way we spend our dollars and I think the nutrition that we were eating in this
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:05.080]  country in the standard American diet is exactly that it's s.a.d. for sad yeah
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:09.880]  when the USDA did studies on tens of thousands of people and looked at the
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:13.840]  malnutrition in this country even though we're overweight it's stunning because
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:18.240]  we get calories but no nutrition but this is what's so cool about the
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:22.480]  Info Wars team they are into nutrition Alex Jones gets it one of their key
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:27.440]  sponsors was inner food or continues to be inner food can we get a canister of
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.320]  inner food out here just to show that Alex is on tangy tangerine and Aaron
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.960]  dykes had a massive incredible weight loss and and health recovery on that
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:41.960]  product which is high in minerals I practice nutrition you know a lot of a
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.120]  lot of Info Wars listeners don't realize I used to be borderline obese
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.040]  borderline diabetic type 2 I was hypoglycemic I suffered from chronic
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:52.720]  pain dr. Seputo you went through your own health crisis you got healthy with
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.080]  nutrition tell us about that I almost died about eight months ago I was
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:00.560]  having a hip replaced you know I'm a tennis player and I couldn't walk
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.120]  anymore so I had it replaced with a hip resurfacing and unfortunately trusted
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:08.560]  that everything that the doctors are doing was safe and of course it turned
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.720]  out not to be because I got poisoned by the cobalt that's in the hip replacement
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.440]  and that led to my just being as sick as I've ever seen anybody and I I did my
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:24.120]  last will I made peace with God and I thought I was done and I couldn't get
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:27.480]  my doctors to understand what was going on because this was such a new concept
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:32.600]  and so what we did is finally convince somebody to put in a new hip which made
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:38.000]  up all the difference in the world about stopping the cobalt poisoning so I'm
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.400]  doing well now and a lot of it has been about eating the right foods exercising
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.400]  intelligently getting a right amount of sleep all the lifestyle all right well
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:48.800]  said stay with us dr. Seputo more on the other side of this break stay with us

[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:17.560]  war and we have been talking about how to achieve victory in the war on your
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:21.760]  nutrition and on your body and also how to protect yourself from radiation that
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:25.400]  could be headed our way if things go wrong in Fukushima I want to make this
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.760]  point and we continue to be joined by Dr. Len Seputo who is a holistic
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:34.240]  nutritionist and healing doctor who's given us a lot of great information he's
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:39.960]  going to continue with us if you you want to foul up the globalist plans stop
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:44.880]  buying globalist food stop buying globalist chemicals obviously you know
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:48.360]  about Monsanto but did you know that the second largest GMO seed company in
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:52.600]  America is DuPont how many DuPont products are you buying did you know
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:57.360]  that Tyson chicken is really a big corporate factory farm are you still
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.600]  buying Tyson chicken have you looked at the campaign contributions of Tyson
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:04.400]  chicken and who they who they donate to mm-hmm ever looked at that if you buy
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:09.920]  aspartame if you buy GMOs if you buy factory meat now I'm not the free range
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:13.560]  stuff the good stuff but the factory meat these these factory produced foods
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:18.200]  you are supporting globalist corporations you're supporting the globalist
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:23.520]  agenda so one of the most powerful ways to fight back is to deny revenues to
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.840]  those companies and at the same time by shifting what you buy in terms of your
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:31.840]  diet and your health you'll be protecting your body and your family from
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.520]  radiation and from cancer and from heart disease and from degenerative Alzheimer's
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:40.360]  disease from all these disorders you win against the globalist and you save
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:44.840]  your life at the same time by turning to nutrition it's that powerful dr.
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:49.120]  Seputo your thoughts on this subject go ahead well you know we take a lot of
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:53.160]  these things for granted and we forget about how much power we have the power
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:58.120]  of our of our dollar and how we spend our money it's fantastic and as a there's
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:02.120]  a lot that we can do to change what manufacturers are gonna are gonna sell
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:06.200]  they will only produce products that they think that you'll be silly enough to
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.720]  buy if they're not any good but if you're if you're smart and you're listening
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:14.120]  to what Mike is telling us here there's a lot we can do I mean I even the
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.920]  business about water you know I was listening to a commercial they were
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.120]  talking about a word water filtration system how important would that be if
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:26.320]  there's a nuclear disaster it'd be tremendous because it filters out the
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.160]  cesium okay and it's in particulate form so that you wouldn't have that in the
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.400]  water you're drinking and that's of course one of the commonest ways that we
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.720]  get poisoned by the radiation that's fallout that's right so so you're right
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:44.080]  what a good point well and part of me wonders too if the the the feet dragging
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.640]  on the part of the US government and the NRC the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:50.840]  which could solve this problem they've got the funds as Arnie Gunnerson told us
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.160]  in the last hour they could solve this problem in Japan why aren't they doing
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:11:00.360]  so maybe they want a nuclear catastrophe in America maybe they want the
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:05.080]  population poisoned I mean look at the vaccines look at the fluoride look at the
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:10.440]  GMOs and the collusion between the Obama administration the USDA and Monsanto
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.040]  look at that it's like they are literally trying to kill Americans they
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.560]  probably welcome Fukushima going into another dirty bomb outburst another plume
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.000]  of radioactivity they probably welcome mass death across America and the only
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.960]  way that you can protect yourself from that death agenda which is part of
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:33.360]  agenda 21 let's just be honest about it is to get healthy and make your body
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:38.000]  immune to the or not not immune but better protected against those things go
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.880]  ahead you're so right I mean there if you take all those factors into
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.520]  consideration it becomes obvious that there's a pattern that's forming here
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:49.600]  there's a picture that's being painted there's a puzzle that's being put
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:53.320]  together and you're seeing all these things that are that are not good for
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:57.080]  us and you'd like to think it's just about economics and some of it certainly
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:01.200]  is because America is an economy it's not a democracy anymore it's corporate
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:05.720]  America that's running Congress and it's not as if you're all right about that so
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:09.600]  what do you do is you have to take responsibility yourself like you're
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:14.680]  saying and make the right choices so I'm on board with you there Mike hey are you
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.760]  willing to share your age with people because you you you look healthy you
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.800]  sound healthy I think I know how old you are because you told me the other day I
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:25.160]  think people would be surprised you want to go public with that you bet I'm 72
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.680]  years young and I'm still playing competitive tennis you know I you know
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:33.160]  you 50 year olds that aren't trying on players you better watch out it really is
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:38.200]  is good to be healthy and to be vibrant and to get engaged in something that
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:42.680]  that keeps you having a multiple a purpose in your life if you do all those
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:46.000]  things you're not going to get old your mind's going to stay young your body's
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.480]  going to stay young I'd love life and and all the things that we're doing in
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:54.760]  our life here is is so busy it's more than when I was 20 years old but it's
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.320]  great well wow you you deserve a lot of credit for that let's shift gears here
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:05.560]  though and talk about the CDC and the researching of bio weapons and even what
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.640]  I call weaponized vaccines I don't know if you agree with that term what do you
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.960]  think about the CDC the Centers for Disease Contradiction and you're
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:18.480]  right I mean it should we should just get rid of it it's like the FDA when they
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:21.880]  stop serving the people and they're serving private interest and there's
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:25.760]  conflict of interest all up all over the place you have to get rid of it
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:29.080]  except that's not what's happening in fact it's not happening in a lot of
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:33.360]  areas where that needs to happen in this country I mean in my view we should be
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:37.160]  voting out all the incumbents because we can't trust them I mean I would start
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:40.960]  over from scratch and I don't know how much of it's just a conspiracy but a
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.520]  lot of it is pointing that way big time but we have to wake up as individual
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:48.640]  people and start taking responsibility ourselves for some of the things we're
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:53.120]  seeing now the CDC is a disgrace to humanity I mean look at Julie
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:57.280]  Geberding I've we mentioned that on your show last time Mrs. Gerber yeah
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.440]  Dr. Geberding is working now for whom Merck and what does she do she runs their
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.040]  vaccine department probably making a ton of money why because she did all the
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:14.440]  things she did to support that the dumbass swine flu let's be clear about
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:19.920]  this Dr. Gerberding was the head of the CDC she hyped up the scare story of the
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:24.080]  false pandemic of the swine flu and then she was rewarded with a top position
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.880]  in the multinational firm Merck running their international vaccine division
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:33.040]  yeah business is business Mike right and well of course it is the CDC exists
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:36.240]  today to just scare everybody into thinking they have this these diseases
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:39.840]  like we covered the whooping cough earlier and there's another outbreak of
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.280]  whooping cough they don't tell you that it's the kids that got vaccinated that
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:47.160]  have the outbreak those are the ones more vulnerable to whooping cough well
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:50.400]  it makes you wonder who they're serving because it certainly isn't the American
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:55.040]  public I mean there's so much money and and conflict of interest involved here
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.320]  and and there's a conspiracy stuff too you know we don't like to think in terms
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.240]  of conspiracies particularly as doctors we don't but it's kind of hard to
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.520]  ignore it when you see all these things happening that are painting this
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:11.400]  picture this puzzle that we're seeing that's frightening well the you know
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.120]  conspiracy in some people's mind that's a that's a dirty word for some reason
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:18.800]  like what two people never got together in a room and plan something that's a
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:22.600]  conspiracy that that's that's that's called a meeting of the board at every
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:26.160]  major corporation in America it's always a conspiracy are you kidding me it's
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:29.560]  global and you look at some of the bigger organizations you know Alex was
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:34.480]  talking about the Bilderberg stuff holy smoke I mean we don't we plug up our
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.840]  ears and close our eyes and say this is America that can't be happening but
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.720]  guess what folks this stuff is out there and it's happening yeah we're just
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:45.280]  we're asleep at the wheel okay let's talk about false flag attacks possibly
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:49.080]  using bio weapons I want your professional expert opinion on this
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.760]  the conjecture on this has been that in terms of the next false flag attack it's
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:58.320]  got to be big bigger than 9-11 bigger than Oklahoma City it's got to be huge
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:02.240]  in order for them to grab more power some people speculate it might be a dirty
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.600]  bomb nuclear type of event other people speculate it might be a bio weapons
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:10.160]  release my question to you Dr. Seputo is do you believe that there is bio weapons
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:14.560]  research taking place in America today that could be used either in good hands
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:18.560]  or bad hands against the American people to drastically reduce the population
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:22.520]  well we know that's happening that's that's no secret I mean they're they're
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:27.280]  perfecting all kinds of biological weapons that can be used that cause
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:31.440]  disease and it's and it's like there's they're they're doing it anyway it's
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:37.280]  like making a a pandemic virus like they did in 19 or in 1918 and replicating
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:42.600]  that or making it even worse to use as bio warfare of course that could be a
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:47.000]  problem and and it shouldn't even be I mean if people think that way what are
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.160]  they thinking I mean it's it's like they're anti-humanists they are they
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:55.680]  are damn merchants they are straight from hell if you don't mind me using that
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:00.320]  term I mean yeah they they worship death well I'm beginning to think that you
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:04.600]  know I guess I've had kind of a comfortable life not thinking too much
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:08.560]  about that because I've just been involved in in my work and in my sport
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:13.360]  and in my family and you don't like to think about things like that but it
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.040]  you get it gets to a point where you see enough of it you have to be silly you
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:20.880]  have to ignore it you have to almost almost close your eyes and ears because
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.240]  it's all over the place around us and if you don't put the pieces of the puzzle
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:29.640]  together you're just being silly well that's exactly what we are doing right
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:32.200]  here we're putting the pieces of the puzzle together that's why I appreciate
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:36.480]  you joining us but yeah a lot of people do live in total denial the denial is
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:41.400]  the worst epidemic in America it should be called I don't know American denial
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:46.520]  disease ADD probably have a psychiatric drug for that you know we don't want to
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:50.280]  think about that because it seems like it's unthinkable and yet when you see
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:53.680]  what's happening in this country you know we spend all this money on Goldman
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.200]  Sachs we spend money on wars and we know we're how the economy is built and then
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:01.120]  we see people on the streets of our major cities that are homeless that are
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:04.960]  vets from previous wars or have psychiatric disorders because of things
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:08.400]  that have happened and we don't come to the rescue what kind of a humanity are
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:12.600]  we turning into we have to start taking care of ourselves you've nailed it
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:16.960]  sales you've nailed it that is the question we've got to have a future in
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.600]  humanity where we have a philosophical foundation a religious foundation a
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.800]  spiritual foundation that respects life that respects fellow human beings we've
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:29.680]  got to have morals and ethics we have technology and science without ethics
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:35.960]  we've got we've got GMOs without wisdom we have we have bullets and bombs like
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.520]  and nukes that can kill people but we don't have consciousness yeah well see
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:43.600]  we haven't evolved we what we have done is have revolution after revolution
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.480]  because we get sick and tired of the system that's in power we have a
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:50.880]  revolution new people come into power they do the same damn thing that the one
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:55.000]  before did and how are you going to ever make a change you have to evolve to a
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.720]  higher level of consciousness it was Einstein who said you can't solve a
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:02.200]  problem at the same level at which it was created right so you have to evolve
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:06.480]  to another level to do it in a different way and if you do that you evolve
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.760]  instead of revolve and that's a concept that is the biggest one because that's
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.720]  what we're lacking and we don't realize that we have the power yeah each
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:19.720]  individual has the power but we're we're sitting on our fat butts going oh what
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:23.240]  the heck is happening oh I don't believe this oh no there are no conspiracies oh
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:28.240]  no trust the CDC in the FDA come on wake up America you know I think this is the
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:32.440]  key difference you and I people like us we want education we want knowledge and
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:39.640]  awareness Obama and his minions want reeducation in a camp it looks like
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.800]  that's happening it's fancy yeah thank you Dr. Seputo we're out of time any last

[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:37.440]  there and give you some commentary on it one one book is called one nation under
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:42.240]  arrest this is really good reading this talks about the total criminalization
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:48.080]  of America and how these laws are being used and abused in terms of making
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:53.160]  innocent people look like criminals so that's a great book it's got an intro by
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:25:00.440]  Edwin Meese the third wow not sure he belongs that book but in any case it's
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:03.960]  a good book the next book is by Joe nobody who's been a guest here on the
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.800]  Alex Jones show it's called holding their own to this is the sequel to his
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:11.600]  very popular fiction novel holding their own the cool thing about that novel
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:16.520]  holding their own is that it talks about a couple escaping from Houston a
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:20.040]  family escaping from Houston during a collapsed scenario and everything in the
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:24.440]  book is factual in terms of what kind of equipment and gear you would use to
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:28.240]  survive so it's kind of like a you can learn about survival while you read
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:33.320]  fiction then I found this product in H.E.B. the other day this is a new drink
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:41.040]  called neuro sleep neuro sleep put your brain to sleep it actually has these
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:46.160]  right here on the bottle go to sleep now and if you look at the
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:51.560]  ingredients guess what's in it sucralose the chemical sweetener and sodium
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:55.640]  benzoate the chemical designed to turn everything in this bottle in a come into
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:00.200]  a complete dead zone its job is to kill everything in the bottle and make it
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:07.720]  sterile neuro sleep in case you're too awake drink some of this okay enough of
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:14.480]  that toss that out of here get it get it all right next we have some unpasteurized
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:20.200]  fresh juice from central market oh look at this warning I don't know if you can
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.120]  even see the label but it says warning this product has not been pasteurized
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:29.720]  and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that may cause serious illness
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:34.200]  in children the elderly in persons with weakened immune systems now notice that
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:40.880]  if you sell unpasteurized milk you get arrested thrown in prison raided at gun
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:46.560]  point and given a million dollar bail in California but here in Texas you can
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:52.640]  sell unpasteurized products just by having a warning label on them gee so
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.960]  why can't we have raw milk with a warning label and have our choice okay the
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:02.000]  government doesn't want to give you a choice so they selectively outlaw the
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:07.400]  raw milk while they let corporations like HEB sell raw juice just with a
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.740]  little warning label fact I think I'm gonna drink this juice and see if it
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:16.240]  kills me because that's what that's what the FDA says you drink unpasteurized
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:21.520]  products you might die I'm gonna drink this on the break it's making me drool
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:24.800]  it's so good it's got beet juice in it oh it might protect me from Fukushima
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:32.240]  fallout too that's that should be a crime all right next next item is an SOS
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:37.560]  we're sending out an SOS for humanity this is something that we've just
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:43.160]  released on natural news SOS stands for stop out of control science and you can
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.760]  find that information at sos.naturalnews.com this is an infographic
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:52.560]  highly informative infographic I encourage you to read and share and the
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.400]  point of this is that it distinguishes between good science which is a quest
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.920]  for understanding and I am a huge proponent of good science I'm
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:04.880]  scientifically trained and it distinguishes between good science and
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:09.020]  then dangerous science which is science that is done in the quest for
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:14.280]  profits and power at the expense of humanity I'm not gonna go through every
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:19.840]  single element of this but if you go to that infographic at sos.naturalnews.com
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:24.280]  you are going to get the five levels of dangerous science there's there it is on
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:28.920]  prismplanet.tv level one through level five stay there on that slide for a
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:35.520]  second I want to talk about level four dangers these are self replicating
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:42.440]  systems that are a danger to humanity GMOs my friends are self replicating
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:47.680]  genetic pollution so it's different from chemical pollution chemical pollution
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:52.200]  is like core exit in the Gulf of Mexico that's bad but it doesn't replicate
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:56.600]  itself if you dump core exit into the Gulf it doesn't make more core exit but
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:01.080]  if you dump GMOs into the open environment they replicate they make
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:05.000]  more GMOs they they cross pollinate with the crops and make more seeds that are
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.440]  contaminated genetically and that can never be recalled it can't be put back
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:13.480]  in the box we're going to be dealing with genetic pollution on this planet for
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:17.840]  the for all of you the rest of life on this planet we're going to be dealing
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:21.520]  with that and nanotechnology could become self replicating in the near
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:25.400]  future weaponized vaccines are self replicating because they contain live
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:29.960]  viral strains sometimes and that replicates in your body dangerous stuff
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:35.160]  science when it's misused is a danger to humanity and that's the point of that
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:38.440]  infographics so spread the word on that thank you for helping to protect
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:41.200]  humanity we've got a lot more straight ahead we're going to be talking to a
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:45.880]  raw milk mom under attack by the state of Minnesota straight ahead we're on the

[02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:13.640]  to speed on a couple of topics here since we have been covering Fukushima
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:18.920]  today when I mentioned these two websites ENENews.com got some good
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:22.440]  information there of course you're always going to find them the just the most
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:27.720]  breaking stories on info wars.com or prisonplanet.com I'm stunned at how fast
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:32.240]  Kurt Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and everybody is there they sometimes are
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:36.160]  days ahead of when I can even get a story posted but another website out there
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:43.000]  is called Enformable.com Enformable.com that's a pretty good
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.680]  website also we're getting ready to go on to the topic of raw milk and the
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:51.840]  assault on the rights of American citizens in Minnesota even the raw milk
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:56.160]  moms this is a whole new event I know we've covered this issue in California
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:00.160]  before and other other states Pennsylvania for example but this is a
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:05.160]  whole new deal this is a new attack in Minnesota and a website where you can
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:10.800]  get great information on that is called thecompletepatient.com thecomplete
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:17.240] patient.com I read his website I use that guy as a source gumpert for some of my
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:20.720]  reporting as well in naturalnews.com and you'll probably see some of his stories
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:24.200]  quoted on info wars.com as well what's great is you know we all cooperate we're
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:27.920]  all patriots for freedom for liberty for truth for you know just the
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:31.480]  fundamental American liberties and I love how we all cooperate in this
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:35.160]  alternative news industry there's a little bit of infighting but you know
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:39.080]  those people are just really insignificant in the big picture those of
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.240]  us who cooperate and work together for a common truth and justice liberty for the
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:47.360]  people that's what really matters and so those are some of the websites that are
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:50.960]  important to see along those lines now in this segment we're going to be joined
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:57.560]  by Melinda Olson she is one of the four moms I believe it's four in Minnesota
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:02.080]  that has received a threatening warning letter from the Minnesota Department is
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.920]  it Department of Agriculture we'll find out if a government department and they
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:10.360]  are warning her they're gonna criminally prosecute her if she continues to allow
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:16.200]  her home to be used as a drop-off point for raw fresh milk being delivered by a
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:20.480]  local Minnesota farmer and she joins us by phone today to tell us about this
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:23.960]  experience and how she's being threatened and how she's standing her
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:28.640]  ground and and calling the bluff of the government to say no you're not going to
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.320]  take away our rights to choose our own healthy food Melinda Olson welcome to
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.920]  the Alice Jones show hi and thank you very much hey thank you for joining us
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.360]  you prefer to be called Mel or Melinda now works great okay now all right tell
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:48.360]  us what happened what led to you receiving this letter and what does the
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:56.560]  letters say well as you stated previously I provide a space in my garage as a
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:01.480]  drop-off point and a picking up point for people in my community and my friends
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:07.960]  family neighbors to pick up food from a farmer of their choice so that it's you
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:13.200]  know it's a convenient place for them to be able to pick up on and and it allows
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:18.280]  for people to get the food that they want to feed for their families in a
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:23.920]  convenient way I have to say Mike that actually it's ten individuals in
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:28.360]  Minnesota ten separate people have gotten a warning letter from the Minnesota
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.680]  Department of Agriculture oh wow okay the MDA that's that's the acronym I was
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:36.960]  looking for tell us what is in this letter because I've read it and maybe
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:40.680]  you guys can post it for prisonplan.tv members it's linked from from my story
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:45.840]  on that this letter specifically talks about criminal charges or investigation
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:51.200]  what does it say that's right after citing several statutes that the state or
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:56.600]  the MDA believes that I am in violation of they state toward the end of the
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:01.720]  letter after reviewing the evidence gathered during the investigation MDA
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:06.600]  has determined that the issuance of this notice of warning is appropriate MDA
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:11.280]  warned that should you continue to sell or distribute unpasteurized or other
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:16.120]  foods illegally in the future you will be subject to administrative penalties
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:21.560]  criminal prosecution or other enforcement remedies available to MDA
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:27.000]  gunpoint raids I was interrupting with gunpoint raids that's what they mean
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.480]  when they say other they mean rated at gunpoint that's what they mean well you
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:35.640]  know Mike there was a friend of mine who has the exact same role for a farmer in
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:41.960]  Bloomington which is a town just at the city south of me it's about less than 10
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:47.400]  miles away and in June of 2010 she had armed officers with a criminal warrant
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:54.000]  investigating you know harassing invading her home for two and a half hours
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.040]  for the exact same unbelievable absolutely unbelievable that this is
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:04.160]  happening in America today Mel I appreciate you having the courage to
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:07.440]  get on the air and describe the situation I've got a lot more questions for
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.880]  you but overall this is unbelievable you are farmers are delivering food just to
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:18.120]  your garage so that your neighbors other moms who want to feed their children
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:22.840]  fresh raw unpasteurized wholesome milk they can just pick it up because there's
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.520]  not a retail store anywhere you're just a drop-off point and and then the state
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:34.880]  of Minnesota is saying this is a crime right conducted investigation and they
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:41.160]  they they cite me for distributing and selling milk well I don't ever touch
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:46.480]  anyone else's product I don't touch the money I you know so I don't I don't see
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:53.720]  how I qualify as a criminal for providing space in my home when you know
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:57.760]  no of course not you there probably be less of a penalty if you were
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:02.040]  distributing meth out of your garage I mean the cops would probably just ask
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:07.160]  for a cut and then leave you alone but boy if you do food oh my god raw food

[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:15.680]  investigated you told me on the phone the other day that family-based farming
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.280]  is becoming criminalized in America what exactly did you mean by that well I have
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:26.680]  in front of me I have some charges against a farmer that I respect and and I
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:32.640]  have a lot of honor for him he's I'm looking at the counts that he's facing
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:37.480]  nine criminal misdemeanor charges let me just read some of them they live in
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.840]  properly labeled frozen food sale of unpasteurized milk sale of adulterated
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.920]  food sale of ungraded butter sale of unpasteurized cheese sale of food without
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:52.160]  a license in the last one operation of a dairy plant without a permit what this
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:57.840]  farmer's name are criminalizing farmers for a poor honest toriel that has been
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:03.480]  the backbone of our country for 200 200 plus years yes yes well that's it it's
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:07.120]  the it's the war on America's farmers it's the war on America's family it's the
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:11.080]  war on America's culture the Obama administration tried to outlaw a family
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:16.800]  farms where you couldn't have a 14 year old son learning drive a tractor I
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:22.800]  drove tractors for my granddad when I was 14 this is part of America's culture
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:27.560]  and it's under attack just as you say Mel you know the last count that he has
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:31.640]  against him is operation of a dairy plant without a permit and can I just say
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:38.080]  that dairy plant is on his property it it's private it's a milking station
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:42.600]  there is produced for private contractual relationships between consenting
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:48.120]  adults people who have deliberately thoughtfully intentionally made a point
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:52.640]  to seek out products that are healthy for their families that's the kind of food
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:56.240]  that he's producing and that's what is currently if we continue on this
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:00.280]  trajectory it will be against the law to produce no this is outright complete
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.840]  communist takeover of America's farms that's what it is it's total communism
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:09.440]  it's it's in America America has been taken over by the banksters America is
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:13.600]  being led by someone who isn't even qualified to be president America has
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:17.560]  been occupied we are occupied in the communist takeover of the farms has
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:22.200]  begun it's happening in California it's happened in Michigan we with the Julie
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:26.320]  Bass issue the front yard gardening the the pigs the Farrell pigs issue with
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:29.840]  Mark Baker at Baker's Green Acres it's happening now in Minnesota it's happened
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:34.000]  in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin all over the country farms are under attack it's
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.920]  outrageous there but I want to get there is a rally Monday morning at the
[02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:43.040]  Minneapolis courthouse in defense of this farmer please Mel tell us about
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:47.120]  that rally so we can get some patriots out there to help support this farmer
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:52.520]  okay the farmer who's on trial in Minnesota on Monday morning at 9 a.m. in
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:56.280]  Hennepin County his name is Alvin Schlangen and he faces four counts of
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:02.560]  criminal misdemeanors which each come with a possibility of fines and several
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:06.200]  I think up to 90 days in jail for each count if he's found guilty and his
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:10.520]  charges are extremely similar to the one faced by another farmer that I that I
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:15.120]  read to you just previously we have a rally in support of him at 7 a.m. on
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:18.480]  Monday morning on the grounds of the Hennepin County government Center and
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.040]  this is a chance for Minnesota moms and others to join us and to take a stand and
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:27.160]  just say we will not comply we will not back down and we will not be
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:34.360]  intimidated or or or because to fear that the you know sourcing food for our
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:41.460]  family that we believe has integrity is whole is locally produced lovingly
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:45.360]  raised we will not back down from keep continuing to get those foods for our
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.680]  family it's the best what regulatory oversight tries to stay absolutely good

[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.080]  capital of Minnesota Mel what what else is happening at that rally do you know
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:40.520]  exactly what the plan is are they unveiling a declaration of food
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:43.840]  independence or something like that that's right there'll be a declaration of
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:50.680]  food independence and it will be revealed read aloud and attendees in
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:54.720]  Minnesota and anyone else who would like to join us and would like to sign

[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:08.760]  absolutely well said very well said Mel now what what do you are how are you
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:13.080]  going to challenge this letter have you replied to the Michigan government the
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:17.880]  the communist tyrants who are threatening you have you replied to the
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:21.680]  letter yet or do you plan to what actions are you taking to protect your
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:27.600]  family against their threats well you know it's funny you should ask in the
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:30.560]  immediate future of course we have the rally and we have a really exciting
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:34.840]  workshop I think one of the things that strengths that we have here in Minnesota
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:39.040]  and around the nation is solidarity and one of the ways it will be showing
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:43.760]  solidarity is the rally and we're also building unity and in a workshop and I'm
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:48.320]  really excited about that because it equips us it inspires us it will give
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:53.160]  us tools to use as we stand up for our right and what I'm doing on a personal
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:57.960]  level you know it's funny Mike but I found myself I find myself like today
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:02.680]  especially wandering around making sure all my doors are locked making sure my
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:08.280]  back door is secure and I find my eyes roving up and down the street wondering
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:12.720]  who's driving by I have happened to see you know local police force driving up
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.800]  and down my road I would say a little more frequently than usual yeah well
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:19.920]  because you have the right intuition you have mother's intuition that the
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:24.760]  government is the criminal element you know that they're the danger to you your
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:27.720]  family or freedoms you are right to do that lock your doors the government
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:31.600]  might be out there it's they're worse than the criminals they are the
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.200]  criminals they're taking away your rights taking away your food threatening
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:39.160]  you with with ridiculous letters destroying America's farms they have
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:42.960]  become the criminal communist element that's trying to take over America today
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:46.440]  they've got to be stopped and this rally could be part of it so I'm glad
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:49.960]  you're on board with this I'm thank you for being here Mel for for being on the
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:55.080]  air well it's you know what it's absolutely my honor to be able to stand up
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:46:01.600]  and and advocate for for the freedom to choose food of our choice and to
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:05.680]  advocate for these farmers there's persecution going on here in the United
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:11.160]  States and I'm I don't know how a waiter the public is that we have a group of
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:16.000]  people who are being vilified who are being criminalized and marginalized
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.200]  intimidated and forced out of business and these are the people who have been
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:24.360]  the backbone of our country and what our freedom was founded on I have so much
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:28.960]  respect and so much honor for these men and these women who's who day after day
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:35.560]  continue to produce these amazing nutrient-dense wonderful food yes and
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:39.840]  they do it and farming is not easy anyway and they do it in the face of this
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:45.040]  daily persecution and the threat of intimidation harassment and criminalization
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.840]  of their effort absolutely and I want to send a prayer out right now to a man who
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.880]  I know is listening James Stewart in in California today's continue he continues
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:58.800]  to face persecution in California as well as Sharon Palmer there that's the
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:03.520]  raw some food case I can tell you that there will be breaking news about the
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:08.600]  raw some case next week breaking I don't want to get into the details it will be
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:11.680]  shared on info wars I'll get the information over to Kurt and Paul
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:16.080]  Watson and Alex Jones there will be breaking information coming out to to
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:20.360]  help those individuals we are being pure persecuted you're exactly right
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:25.840]  Melinda and and I this morning I milked goats before I came in I bought goats I
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:30.320]  am now I guess I have a raw dairy operation on my own farm now I guess
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.120]  they could come in and arrest me for having a dairy plant without a license
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:38.360]  you know because I milked a goat right did you know in Wisconsin if you produce
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:42.880]  milk it's my understanding that the current climate there is that if you
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:48.120]  produce milk and it's raw you are not allowed to bring it to a private like if
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.240]  you let's say you have a farm in the country or the rural area and then you
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:56.120]  you have a private property in a skin town it's against the law for you to bring
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:59.160]  milk that you've produced yourself on your own property and drink it on your
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:02.320]  own property if you're inside city lines
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:08.120]  wow so so now you're gonna be arrested and imprisoned for food smuggling your
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.040]  own food right I've heard the word fascist applied in to these kinds of
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:18.560]  circumstances and and it really is amazing I you know I I wonder someday it
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:23.600]  if I will end up laughing about this right now it's so serious I can't but
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.360]  we're talking about milk yeah well no you're right fascism is the right word
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:33.520]  I it even reminds me of Naomi Wolf who who warned about the 10 steps to
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:38.120]  fascism and she's been a very very popular speaker about those issues from
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:42.600]  the left side of the of the false political paradigm but she was right as
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:47.000]  well and this takeover of America's farms this is one of the 10 signs
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:51.800]  essentially of the rise of fascism the corporate controlled oppressive police
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:57.240]  state government running theater theater security events all over the country to
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:00.200]  scare everybody into submission you know herald the Rivera just went on the
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:03.920]  record said he was raped by the TSA I don't know if that's the right exact
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:07.880]  word for it I don't know exactly what went on in his pants there but I maybe
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:11.360]  it's not a rape maybe it's a sexual assault but those are his words this is
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:16.080]  all coming out now about how oppressive and brutal and completely illegal the
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:21.520]  government has become that's right and and it's up to us you know it's really
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:28.080]  it's up to us to set the standard to say no and to take a stand for what we know
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:32.480]  to be our rights and our personal freedoms and our personal liberties the
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:37.160]  time is now once it's gone it's a lot harder to get back the time is now
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:41.640]  absolutely Mel once again a call for everybody in Minnesota to join this

[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:41.760]  here because I want to I want to offer some personal commentary about the
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:47.280]  Second Amendment and I haven't spoken out enough on the Second Amendment in the
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:53.240]  past and I want to be on the record with my absolute support for not just the
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:56.440]  Second Amendment but of course the First Amendment the Fourth Amendment all of
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:59.740]  these are very important but none of them would be possible without the Second
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:05.000]  Amendment I am a firearms owner I have been licensed to conceal Kerry since
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:10.040]  1996 I've taken training all over the country for firearms I'm I'm competent
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:15.120]  and I abide by all the firearms laws and regulations that do exist so I don't
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:21.120]  have any illegal you know firearms if there is such a thing I guess there is
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.880]  under current law but I I do abide by all the rules and I own firearms legally
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:31.680]  and I want to give out a message to those who maybe aren't in the firearms the
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:37.000]  right yet you have no idea how many people are concealed carrying out there
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:42.360]  and thereby keeping you safe when you go out to the Walmart or the grocery
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:46.760]  store or the gas station there are people all around you with concealed
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:51.640]  Kerry firearms people like me and others like me who are law-abiding citizens many
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:57.520]  are former active-duty military many are active or off-duty police officers many
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:03.960]  are just intelligent informed patriotic supporters of America who are into
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:08.880]  protecting innocent people and we carry firearms and by doing so we help keep
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:12.120]  everybody safe we're not trying to be cops we're just citizens who are
[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:16.520]  informed and who understand the Second Amendment and who support it I'm a very
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:19.120]  strong supporter of the Second Amendment and that's what's going to keep our
[02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:23.680]  country safe so keep it legal man that's that's crucial thank you for
