[00:00.000 --> 00:17.840]  What he's trying to do, because he's a weak person, and not a very smart person, what
[00:17.840 --> 00:25.560]  he's trying to do is end, and it's very simple, he's got himself a big prison sentence, and
[00:25.560 --> 00:30.480]  he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story.
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.600]  Now here's the thing, even if he was right, it doesn't matter, because I was allowed to
[00:36.600 --> 00:38.560]  do whatever I wanted during the campaign.
[00:38.560 --> 00:42.600]  I was running my business, a lot of different things during the campaign.
[00:42.600 --> 00:48.920]  So very simply, Michael Cohn is lying, and he's trying to get a reduced sentence for
[00:48.920 --> 00:59.800]  the things that have nothing to do with me.
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.680]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:04.680 --> 01:15.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:15.480 --> 01:23.320]  Welcome to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:27.040 --> 01:41.920]  If you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.920]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion, it's a group of migrants
[01:47.920 --> 01:55.160]  moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S., and why did you characterize
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.160]  it as such?
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.360]  Because I consider it an invasion, you and I have a difference of opinion.
[02:00.360 --> 02:05.040]  But do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election to try to keep them?
[02:05.040 --> 02:08.280]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally, they have to
[02:08.280 --> 02:10.040]  come in jib through a process.
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.640]  The president, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the looming
[02:14.640 --> 02:17.080]  so-called invasion, as they put it.
[02:17.080 --> 02:19.840]  The programming on the caravan was propaganda.
[02:19.840 --> 02:22.600]  It was political campaign-motivated propaganda.
[02:22.600 --> 02:26.440]  Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know, the migrants are coming, the migrants are
[02:26.440 --> 02:27.440]  coming.
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.760]  Your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[02:31.760 --> 02:32.760]  Well, that's true.
[02:32.760 --> 02:33.760]  But they weren't actors.
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.760]  They're not going to be doing that.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.760]  They weren't actors.
[02:35.760 --> 02:36.760]  Oh, no, it's true.
[02:36.760 --> 02:37.760]  Do you think they were actors?
[02:37.760 --> 02:38.760]  They weren't actors.
[02:38.760 --> 02:39.760]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[02:39.760 --> 02:43.640]  He's calling it an invasion, yes, an invasion of strollers.
[02:43.640 --> 02:48.880]  He made news by ratcheting up the caravan, scare talk, and the troop numbers he believes
[02:48.880 --> 02:51.040]  are needed to meet this alleged threat.
[02:51.040 --> 02:52.360]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[02:52.360 --> 02:54.400]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[02:54.400 --> 02:55.400]  That's not an invasion.
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.080]  Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.080]  You run CNN.
[02:59.080 --> 03:00.080]  All right.
[03:00.080 --> 03:02.080]  And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.080]  If I may ask one other question.
[03:03.080 --> 03:08.560]  Tonight, the first 800 migrants from the Central American Caravan are at America's doorstep
[03:08.560 --> 03:10.240]  in Tijuana, Mexico.
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.920]  The first wave of the migrant caravan arrived unexpectedly early at the U.S. border in Tijuana,
[03:15.920 --> 03:18.760]  where there's been a fortified wall for decades.
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.920]  They've been looking through the barricade, and some have been climbing it.
[03:21.920 --> 03:26.920]  They split off from a larger group of about 5,000 and are planning to request asylum here
[03:26.920 --> 03:27.920]  in the U.S.
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.080]  So the Democrats want open borders.
[03:31.080 --> 03:33.080]  Let everybody come in.
[03:33.080 --> 03:35.440]  Let everybody pour in.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.440]  We don't care.
[03:36.440 --> 03:38.680]  Let them come in from the Middle East.
[03:38.680 --> 03:41.480]  Let them come in from all over the place.
[03:41.480 --> 03:42.480]  We don't care.
[03:42.480 --> 03:44.600]  We're not going to let it happen.
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.600]  A group of Central American migrants fleeing north to safety, a.k.a. the caravan.
[03:50.600 --> 03:52.720]  That's called an invasion of our country.
[03:52.720 --> 03:53.720]  It's pretty obvious.
[03:53.720 --> 03:54.720]  You don't need me to tell you this, but I will.
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.600]  The president's firing up his base with the issue that helped propel him into the White
[03:59.600 --> 04:06.720]  House in 2016, which is slamming undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border with
[04:06.720 --> 04:07.720]  Mexico.
[04:07.720 --> 04:09.360]  He keeps calling it an invasion.
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.360]  What would you call it?
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.600]  When Trump said that there was a caravan, LaCosta said, no, it's hundreds of miles away
[04:16.600 --> 04:17.600]  from here.
[04:17.600 --> 04:18.600]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[04:18.600 --> 04:20.680]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[04:20.680 --> 04:21.680]  That's not an invasion.
[04:21.680 --> 04:27.280]  As many as 4,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Tijuana as soon as tomorrow.
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.640]  And security has even said the caravan approaching the border is harboring more than 200 folks
[04:32.640 --> 04:33.640]  with criminal history.
[04:33.640 --> 04:34.640]  That's called an invasion.
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.960]  Folks, we're going to come back live on this Friday, Global Transmission.
[04:40.960 --> 04:43.960]  David Knight's coming up as well, and so much more.
[04:43.960 --> 04:45.760]  This is the most censored show in the world.
[04:45.760 --> 04:50.160]  Without you spreading the word, without you taking action, they're going to destroy info
[04:50.160 --> 04:53.240]  wars, and they're going to destroy the country, and they're going to destroy every free person
[04:53.240 --> 04:54.240]  on this planet.
[04:54.240 --> 05:00.600]  And remember, the government's run by pedophiles, they want to rape their kids.
[05:00.600 --> 05:04.400]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.960]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[05:08.960 --> 05:14.360]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.760]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.280]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.280 --> 05:27.840]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.800]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.800 --> 05:33.200]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexipur gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.520 --> 05:44.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.600 --> 05:50.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexipur raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.240 --> 05:55.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.560 --> 06:21.560]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:21.560 --> 06:41.640]  Well, it's hard to believe it's already Friday, November 30th, 2018, and the year is almost
[06:41.640 --> 06:42.640]  over.
[06:42.640 --> 06:45.920]  And what have we seen?
[06:45.920 --> 06:48.760]  What have we seen unfold?
[06:48.760 --> 06:55.320]  You can see the private corporate world government allied with the Chi Coms and the EU and Hollywood
[06:55.320 --> 07:03.120]  and all their paid-off minions trying to whip this country and other nation states into
[07:03.120 --> 07:08.160]  submission to their globalist tyranny.
[07:08.160 --> 07:15.320]  Right now, our president is in South America trying to negotiate a more equitable, fair
[07:15.320 --> 07:21.600]  deal with Communist China and others, and I'll have to go into how China has a totally
[07:21.600 --> 07:28.480]  one-sided deal set up that way by Western elites 50 years ago, and how they've used
[07:28.480 --> 07:33.560]  it to take China from a country with almost no running water or electricity 50 years ago
[07:33.560 --> 07:38.640]  to an industrial juggernaut more powerful than the United States.
[07:38.640 --> 07:44.240]  They're not more powerful intellectually, they're not more powerful economically, they're not
[07:44.240 --> 07:50.360]  more powerful militarily, but they are industrially way more powerful in the U.S.
[07:50.360 --> 07:56.320]  The globalist strategically said Europe and the U.S. will be service economies.
[07:56.320 --> 08:02.200]  Well, the global balance of power, where China doesn't have a big military and doesn't expand
[08:02.200 --> 08:06.360]  outside their borders, but they're giving the Deepwater Point ports, they're giving
[08:06.360 --> 08:13.360]  the Panama Canal, they're giving all the rare earth minerals, that's a global UN agreement
[08:13.360 --> 08:14.360]  framework.
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.640]  How do you think China has 98% of rare earth minerals, with stuff you need for all the
[08:18.640 --> 08:22.480]  semiconductors and for all the computers and all the devices?
[08:22.480 --> 08:25.560]  Because globally, they've been given that.
[08:25.560 --> 08:30.400]  By the U.S., by Europe, by the globalist, they have been set up to win to have the Chinese
[08:30.400 --> 08:31.400]  century.
[08:31.400 --> 08:38.880]  That's what the CFR teaches in colleges, and then along came Donald Trump, along came
[08:38.880 --> 08:44.960]  Nigel Farage, along came all these other patriots now, who said, wait a minute, we didn't vote
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.480]  to enter these things, and it's all one-sided, and Canada has a 280% tariff on dairy, and
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.640]  we have no tariff, and China has a couple hundred percent tariffs on our goods, we have
[08:55.640 --> 08:57.040]  nothing on them.
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.640]  No wonder they've built everything up.
[08:58.640 --> 09:03.160]  No wonder this has all happened, but the Communist Party then takes all that money and parlays
[09:03.160 --> 09:10.840]  it into taking over other parts of the world, not even giving their people anything.
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.120]  That's an easy choice to say, we're going to side with America and with Trump and with
[09:15.120 --> 09:20.400]  our own self-interest and with prosperity and with freedom.
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.800]  China is the most evil nation in the world ever seen by a long shot, but it's almost
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.560]  like in the media, they don't exist.
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.360]  Well, they're Asian, so if they kill 100 million people, it's no big deal, or if they have human
[09:32.360 --> 09:37.040]  clones, it's no big deal, or if they have cows 25 years ago growing humanoids in them
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.560]  for organ harvesting, it's no big deal, or if they 20 years ago had cows with human
[09:42.560 --> 09:49.520]  udder cells that produce human milk that's been drunk on Chinese shelves for decades,
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.520]  it's no big deal.
[09:50.520 --> 09:56.080]  If they've got goats that are part spider that create body armor, it's no big deal.
[09:56.080 --> 09:59.680]  If they let homeless people just starve to death on the side of the street, it's no big
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.040]  deal, if they take Christians to death camps and work them to death, it's no big deal.
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.840]  If they kill Buddhists, it's no big deal.
[10:05.840 --> 10:11.960]  If they shell Buddhist monasteries into bed, it's no big deal because only white people
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.640]  are bad.
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.640]  And that's the sick culture and that's what we face is a billion 400 million slaves in
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.320]  China with almost every party member, only a few thousand of them being billionaires
[10:25.320 --> 10:30.880]  in China, communism with ultra rich people with a bunch of slaves and our own establishment
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.480]  allied with them because our own establishment owns a piece of China.
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.160]  You can move to China and pay zero tax as long as you become state run.
[10:40.160 --> 10:45.640]  The US company should not be allowed when we built them, we paid for them to leave
[10:45.640 --> 10:50.320]  and to give all of their strategic information to the chai comms and become state run.
[10:50.320 --> 10:52.640]  That's treason.
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.520]  If I tried that at the arrested and I should, but when it's done under the IMF and World
[10:56.520 --> 11:02.000]  Bank and TPP and agreements and governments signed off on it, they claim it's legal.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.680]  No, it's not legal, even if you pass some damn piece of paper.
[11:05.680 --> 11:13.640]  I say it's treason and Trump says it's treason and we're reversing it, period.
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.640]  It's time for Americans to not be intimidated by the thugs that have hijacked our government
[11:18.640 --> 11:22.120]  and to realize they're a very small group in the command and control position and almost
[11:22.120 --> 11:24.920]  everyone below them hates their guts.
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.760]  The most awake group in this country is the US government.
[11:29.760 --> 11:35.680]  90% of the people below it are really freaked out about the fraud, wastes and abuse and
[11:35.680 --> 11:42.680]  the leftist and the SJW is being hired to incompetently come in who are obsessed.
[11:42.680 --> 11:45.400]  Their religion is defecating in the halls.
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.520]  By the way, if you think I'm joking and it's in psychology and it always shows up when
[11:49.520 --> 11:59.240]  a society starts to collapse, they caught all over Portland on the local news, businessmen
[11:59.240 --> 12:07.800]  coming out and pooping on the street to be naughty, white liberal businessmen.
[12:07.800 --> 12:10.160]  I'm not kidding.
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.080]  And they thought they would shame them, but the left came out and said, no, we celebrate
[12:13.080 --> 12:14.080]  public defecation.
[12:14.080 --> 12:21.240]  It's in Paul Joseph Watson's report, Portland is a SH, you know what hole, it's on infowars.com.
[12:21.240 --> 12:26.360]  You want to see the undercover videos of it, it is a sacrament for them of religion to
[12:26.360 --> 12:30.080]  crap on the street and make you smell their filth.
[12:30.080 --> 12:35.720]  Now, why am I starting the show like that?
[12:35.720 --> 12:37.120]  Because that's who these people are.
[12:37.120 --> 12:39.160]  They want to hurt your kids.
[12:39.160 --> 12:40.920]  They want to brain damage your kids.
[12:40.920 --> 12:42.440]  They want to groom your children.
[12:42.440 --> 12:43.800]  They want control.
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.320]  They want to defile things.
[12:48.320 --> 12:55.160]  And until you start standing up to them, it's only going to get worse.
[12:55.160 --> 13:02.000]  Now, coming up, Roger Stone and I have a battle plan for Trump to take action to defeat these
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  people.
[13:03.000 --> 13:13.040]  And finally, they admit Robert Mueller has filed paperwork in the Michael Cohen case
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.080]  that says Trump is person number one, like we told you years ago, like he's a mafia
[13:18.080 --> 13:20.960]  don and that the plan is to indict Trump.
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.040]  Now, under the Constitution, that indictment will go nowhere, separation of powers, but
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.560]  it will be held up like it is.
[13:28.560 --> 13:30.280]  And that's always been the plan.
[13:30.280 --> 13:31.280]  There's no obstruction.
[13:31.280 --> 13:32.280]  There's no lying.
[13:32.280 --> 13:33.280]  There's no nothing.
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.080]  All of it is by Robert Mueller and Hillary Clinton and these criminals.
[13:37.080 --> 13:40.440]  But now, individual number one, clues of Mueller.
[13:40.440 --> 13:44.000]  They're getting the building blocks, we're told, of what they have.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  Yeah, it's called raiding hundreds of lawyers that work for Trump and it's hundreds of properties.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.080]  If you got a higher lawyer that works in the town you're at or is under that state bar,
[13:53.080 --> 13:57.520]  finding dirt on a lawyer that has nothing to do with Trump, they've so far what rated
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.200]  like 20 of Trump's lawyers, and then saying 50 years in the penitentiary for the 15 million
[14:03.200 --> 14:07.720]  you laundered, Michael Cohen, or flip on all the testimony you said that Trump was never
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.920]  involved in this stuff or will put you in prison.
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.360]  We're going to go to break, we're going to come back, we're going to go through all of
[14:18.360 --> 14:19.960]  this on the other side.
[14:19.960 --> 14:25.080]  Please remember that without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[14:25.080 --> 14:29.000]  Please remember that we're under attack because we're on target and that the videos and the
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.880]  books and the t-shirts and the water filtration and all of it is 50 to 75 percent off biggest

[15:45.400 --> 15:51.640]  All right, coming up, Roger Stone with the biggest news yet, that they filed their intention
[15:51.640 --> 15:56.640]  to indict the president and how do we counter strike against these clear and present enemies
[15:56.640 --> 16:03.640]  of this nation, or declared enemies.
[16:26.640 --> 16:27.640]  Fearful.
[16:27.640 --> 16:56.640]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll see you in the next video.

[17:49.640 --> 17:56.640]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll see you in the next video.
[18:19.640 --> 18:48.640]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll see you in the next video.

[18:56.200 --> 18:59.640]  at infowarstore.com.
[18:59.640 --> 19:20.640]  I'm Roger Stone.
[19:20.640 --> 19:47.640]  I'm Roger Stone.
[19:47.640 --> 19:54.640]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll see you in the next video.
[20:17.640 --> 20:36.400]  Right before we went on air this morning, I was talking to Roger Stone about the dire
[20:36.400 --> 20:45.980]  straits this country is in, and he laid into a very cutting spot on five minute analysis
[20:45.980 --> 20:50.880]  to me that I, a thousand percent, a trillion percent, agree with.
[20:50.880 --> 20:56.040]  And this is what we must do, what Trump must do to block the horrible globalist deep staters
[20:56.040 --> 21:00.280]  that openly work with foreign powers, that have openly raised interest rates and tried
[21:00.280 --> 21:03.240]  to talk down the economy to kill the recovery.
[21:03.240 --> 21:04.480]  These people are the globalists.
[21:04.480 --> 21:05.480]  They are the plague.
[21:05.480 --> 21:07.400]  They are the enemy.
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.120]  And we've told Trump everything that was going to happen, how he was illegally spied on, how
[21:12.120 --> 21:17.920]  Hillary still had her emails, how the NSA has them, how he was always known as individual
[21:17.920 --> 21:19.240]  number one.
[21:19.240 --> 21:21.320]  We broke that over a year and a half ago.
[21:21.320 --> 21:27.240]  And now the Houston Chronicle is the big top story, individual number one, the president's
[21:27.240 --> 21:29.360]  the target.
[21:29.360 --> 21:33.240]  Mueller and all the Democrats told Trump, oh, you're not the target.
[21:33.240 --> 21:34.240]  We know.
[21:34.240 --> 21:38.280]  And Rosenstein a few months ago told Trump, sir, we've looked, no evidence, we know there's
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.280]  no Russia.
[21:39.280 --> 21:41.880]  But they never were going after Russia.
[21:41.880 --> 21:46.560]  They never were going after all his lawyers, trying to find dirt on them to then get them
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.600]  to do a plea bargain to get out of it, to lie about the president.
[21:50.600 --> 21:54.480]  And that is what is going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:54.480 --> 21:58.000]  So without getting into all the minutiae of the latest bull, which is total garbage,
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.680]  and the fact we have the stool pigeon, pled guilty to 15 million and laundered my money,
[22:02.680 --> 22:07.200]  nothing to do with Trump, changing all the stories now and saying, Trump knew about trying
[22:07.200 --> 22:10.560]  to build a tower, he's got hundreds of towers from the planet.
[22:10.560 --> 22:13.960]  And Russia, and that's the big proof.
[22:13.960 --> 22:15.440]  And oh, they got to impeach him now.
[22:15.440 --> 22:16.440]  This is outrageous.
[22:16.440 --> 22:19.440]  So Trump now knows they're going to move against him.
[22:19.440 --> 22:24.640]  But there is a clear way constitutionally, it's not just President Trump's right, it's
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.520]  his duty to stand against these people.
[22:28.520 --> 22:33.000]  And so in the next six and a half minutes, we're going to lay out what has to happen
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.160]  to this illegitimate house, this illegitimate system, this illegitimate election and these
[22:38.160 --> 22:39.160]  criminals.
[22:39.160 --> 22:42.200]  And what we should do with the subpoenas, what Trump should do with the subpoenas that are
[22:42.200 --> 22:45.720]  coming will always fake investigations and how he goes on the offense now.
[22:45.720 --> 22:50.240]  Roger Stone, former Chief Advisor to the President, break it down for us.
[22:50.240 --> 22:56.520]  Okay, I think this interview that the President gave to the New York Post is really quite
[22:56.520 --> 23:02.120]  incredible because what it shows you is the President has the detonator in his hands.
[23:02.120 --> 23:09.840]  He now has the goods on their abuse of use of FISA warrants, the implications, the treasonous
[23:09.840 --> 23:17.400]  implications of Uranium One, the illegitimate efforts by the Obama administration's FBI
[23:17.400 --> 23:21.400]  to infiltrate the Trump campaign.
[23:21.400 --> 23:26.920]  And he also now finally has control of his own Justice Department.
[23:26.920 --> 23:34.840]  Now, clearly the President will release the classified information at a time of his choosing,
[23:34.840 --> 23:36.600]  but I think he has been woke.
[23:36.600 --> 23:42.600]  I think he now understands, despite being lulled by Rod Rosenstein and his own initial
[23:42.600 --> 23:49.320]  attorneys, that he is the target, that the big old target is right on his back.
[23:49.320 --> 23:57.720]  It's not Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or Michael Cohn or Alex Jones or it's none of these
[23:57.720 --> 23:58.720]  people they want.
[23:58.720 --> 24:04.680]  They want Donald Trump and they're trying to euker him into some kind of perjury trap.
[24:04.680 --> 24:09.000]  Short of declassifying the documents, what can he do today?
[24:09.000 --> 24:16.600]  Easy, direct the acting Attorney General, Mr. Whitaker, to name a special counsel on
[24:16.600 --> 24:23.840]  the matter of Uranium One and on the matter of the illegal and unconstitutional use of
[24:23.840 --> 24:32.000]  FISA warrants, have him immediately convene a grand jury, have that grand jury issue indictments
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.800]  of those involved and they'll then authorize their arrest.
[24:37.800 --> 24:40.520]  That will bust this wide open.
[24:40.520 --> 24:47.840]  Is it incidental that the prosecutor leading the investigation into me, Aaron Zelinski,
[24:47.840 --> 24:54.200]  is the same man who led the cover up of the Clinton's involvement in Uranium One?
[24:54.200 --> 24:56.240]  Is that a coincidence?
[24:56.240 --> 25:03.240]  Is it a coincidence that the other chief prosecutor in the potential prosecution of Roger Stone
[25:03.240 --> 25:09.240]  is Jeannie Rhee, a woman who represented the Clinton Foundation in the matter of the missing
[25:09.240 --> 25:16.840]  emails in which I am being unfairly investigated since I know nothing about them?
[25:16.840 --> 25:19.840]  The president needs to go on the offense.
[25:19.840 --> 25:26.000]  He controls the machinery of the Justice Department now and it must be turned on these criminals
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  immediately.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.160]  And he signals he's going to do that and separately in the next two months before they, or the
[25:31.160 --> 25:38.200]  next month and after they get this lame duck group in an early January, we need, and the
[25:38.200 --> 25:41.940]  reason I call these Democrats lame duck is this was illegitimate.
[25:41.940 --> 25:49.320]  They stole these house races in front of God and country and the Democrats accused Trump
[25:49.320 --> 25:51.240]  of stealing an election with no evidence.
[25:51.240 --> 25:52.720]  We have total evidence.
[25:52.720 --> 25:59.000]  So break down also following precedent of what Eric Holder did on Fast and Furious, what
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  Trump should do.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.680]  Well, there's two very important precedents that have now been said.
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.960]  The president, in my opinion, should regard any subpoena from the New House Democrats
[26:09.960 --> 26:15.840]  the exact same way that Eric Holder regarded subpoenas from the Republican House regarding
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.880]  Fast and Furious, ignore them, challenge them to try to enforce them.
[26:21.880 --> 26:27.320]  Secondarily, however, Mr. Comey, the former FBI director, now refuses to testify before
[26:27.320 --> 26:28.320]  the Congress.
[26:28.320 --> 26:35.560]  Yesterday, he went to court to try to seek to block a subpoena requiring him to testify.
[26:35.560 --> 26:40.080]  So if Comey doesn't have to testify, why should anyone in the Trump administration have to
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.160]  testify?
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.560]  The election of the House majority is illegitimate.
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.480]  Just as you don't recognize the election of Donald Trump, we don't recognize the election
[26:49.480 --> 26:51.080]  of a Democratic House.
[26:51.080 --> 26:56.240]  Sorry, Adam Schiff, you are the chairman of nothing, of zero.
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.440]  Your majority is stolen, it is done on the basis of illegitimacy, that's what you said
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.320]  about Donald Trump's presidency, so you are the chairman of nothing.
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.560]  We don't recognize your authority to do anything.
[27:09.560 --> 27:13.720]  And to be clear, this country is a total war with collaborators working with offshore corporations,
[27:13.720 --> 27:18.280]  the Chai Combs and others, with Hollywood to demoralize and break down this country.
[27:18.280 --> 27:24.000]  They have publicly, the Democrats and the Hollywood scum like Bill Maher have said,
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.200]  let's plunge the economy to stop Trump, and now they've raised interest rates, they brag
[27:28.200 --> 27:30.680]  that they've done it, they're trying to suppress it further.
[27:30.680 --> 27:37.400]  The president must start having weekly state of the nation speeches, building up the next
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.600]  month or so to an emergency state of the union.
[27:40.600 --> 27:47.600]  He has to just lay it all out, lay out Bob Mueller and the uranium one, lay out Hillary
[27:47.600 --> 27:49.640]  and the emails and just do it.
[27:49.640 --> 27:55.800]  If they want to fight, they've got one, it's now do or die, Trump was lied to by his lawyers,
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.880]  that he wasn't the target, and now he knows they're a bunch of double dealing cowards,
[27:59.880 --> 28:05.520]  and so he's taken the gloves off, and Roger, that itself is the really good news, isn't
[28:05.520 --> 28:06.520]  it?
[28:06.520 --> 28:11.360]  Well, it is, and the president should not allow this media created myth of Robert Mueller
[28:11.360 --> 28:12.920]  as some kind of saying.
[28:12.920 --> 28:18.000]  The president should go on national TV and outline Mr. Mueller's involvement in 9-11,
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.440]  his involvement in BCCI, his involvement in Pan Am 103, Lockerbie, his involvement in
[28:24.440 --> 28:29.720]  the anthrax scandal, his involvement with Whitey Bonjur, and I think the American people
[28:29.720 --> 28:30.720]  see-
[28:30.720 --> 28:34.080]  His involvement with the Russians, his involvement with the Saudis, his involvement with everything.
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.840]  He is Mr. Dirt, he is Mr. Corruption, it's, I mean, we didn't even list half the crap.
[28:40.840 --> 28:47.200]  You're absolutely right, there are two keys to this, iso-warrants and uranium one, follow
[28:47.200 --> 28:48.200]  my money.
[28:48.200 --> 28:51.960]  Go on the attack, or they will destroy, not just Trump, but the whole country.

[31:00.640 --> 31:06.240]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[31:06.240 --> 31:09.760]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing, and I've had water filtration
[31:09.760 --> 31:14.040]  sponsors since the day I got on air, and over the years I learned a lot about water
[31:14.040 --> 31:16.240]  filtration, I learned what the best was.
[31:16.240 --> 31:20.840]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro's their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons
[31:20.840 --> 31:21.840]  an hour.
[31:21.840 --> 31:22.840]  It's amazing.
[31:22.840 --> 31:24.760]  It cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[31:24.760 --> 31:29.440]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters
[31:29.440 --> 31:31.480]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[31:31.480 --> 31:33.200]  He has a glut of them.
[31:33.200 --> 31:37.040]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[31:37.040 --> 31:38.600]  When it's discounted, it uses $200.
[31:38.600 --> 31:39.600]  It's $127.
[31:39.600 --> 31:45.960]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $20-something bucks on them, so they're
[31:45.960 --> 31:47.920]  going to sell out very, very quickly.
[31:47.920 --> 31:50.120]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[31:50.120 --> 31:51.120]  It's amazing.

[32:00.560 --> 32:04.640]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[32:04.640 --> 32:09.840]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[32:09.840 --> 32:14.960]  It literally dumbs the population down, and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[32:14.960 --> 32:19.680]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[32:19.680 --> 32:23.800]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[32:23.800 --> 32:25.760]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[32:25.760 --> 32:30.600]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine, and brought you X2.
[32:30.600 --> 32:31.600]  That's been incredible.
[32:31.600 --> 32:36.960]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[32:36.960 --> 32:41.680]  of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[32:41.680 --> 32:46.680]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[32:46.680 --> 32:53.200]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[32:53.200 --> 32:56.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[32:56.360 --> 32:57.360]  discovery.
[32:57.360 --> 33:24.360]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Inforal War.
[33:24.360 --> 33:36.400]  Epic times we're all living in, it's Friday, November 30th, 2018, this incredibly dangerous
[33:36.400 --> 33:41.080]  out-of-control year is now almost over.
[33:41.080 --> 33:47.520]  And you imagine what's coming in 2019, a real year of decisions about whether we're
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.480]  going to let the globalist counter-offensive work and take over society or whether all
[33:51.480 --> 33:57.040]  of us are going to really put our heads down and take action.
[33:57.040 --> 34:03.000]  I want to, for TV viewers especially, but for radio listeners I'll describe it, roll
[34:03.000 --> 34:10.840]  some of the incredible raw footage that our team down on the Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego,
[34:10.840 --> 34:15.880]  California, U.S. border have shot with drones and handheld.
[34:15.880 --> 34:23.880]  It is unbelievably illustrative of how the U.N. knowingly brings refugees into nations,
[34:23.880 --> 34:30.200]  builds these horrible open air camps, creates the crisis of disease and crime, and then
[34:30.200 --> 34:36.120]  demands that the countries then sign treaties giving the U.N. more money and more power and
[34:36.120 --> 34:42.480]  more control over the very crisis they admit they've engineered.
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.000]  The answers always give them more money than they pull in our heartstrings when we know
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.400]  that it's all part of a larger program and we have interviews that are posted at infowars.com
[34:51.400 --> 34:55.920]  where the illegal alien invaders are saying, we were promised everything would be free,
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.400]  we were promised we'd get right in, the U.N. lied to us.
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.320]  This is how world government conquers nation states and right now they're getting set
[35:04.320 --> 35:11.200]  next week to try to ratify a new global treaty where borders don't even exist, even if countries
[35:11.200 --> 35:18.360]  say it does, other nations will gang up against you, like the EU, and will send in their Navy
[35:18.360 --> 35:20.000]  to stop you.
[35:20.000 --> 35:28.600]  So this is 21st century warfare, ladies and gentlemen, with now over 50,000 people marching
[35:28.600 --> 35:35.920]  or already now on the border with California and the United States, where if they get through,
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.080]  Democrat judges will then shove a welfare spoon in their mouth, which Democrats will
[35:40.080 --> 35:46.840]  then skim money off the top and then put them into labor so that they can get money on every
[35:46.840 --> 35:50.880]  level of these people's misery, a new permanent underclass.
[35:50.880 --> 35:53.880]  This is the globalist program.
[35:53.880 --> 36:01.000]  It's cut and dry and it's all based on squeezing the third world, never allowing it to industrialize,
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.280]  never allowing it to become free, that's on record, IMF and World Bank are on record,
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.200]  suppressing the third world and keeping them in corruption and squalor as a political tool.
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.920]  And then you look at the Democrats and the blue cities they control, they're all third
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.720]  world as well, because it's a form you'll lay, it's a system.
[36:18.720 --> 36:22.840]  The globalists want to kill you in the womb, but if they can't, they're going to then try
[36:22.840 --> 36:30.040]  to kill your brain with vaccines and GMO and cultural brainwashing and confusing your gender
[36:30.040 --> 36:35.120]  if you get out of the womb, destabilization, being predatory is their plan, and our own
[36:35.120 --> 36:42.920]  shroyer went to the Austin City Council yesterday to point out on record that they are illegally
[36:42.920 --> 36:48.120]  giving tens of millions of dollars of value to Planned Parenthood just at one facility,
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.520]  sapping all over the country, and then Planned Parenthood gives them political contributions.
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.000]  And these Democrats were up on the city council stage laughing at him while he talked about
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.640]  baby's hearts being stopped.
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.360]  This is the sick attitude and behavior of these people and it illustrates how at every
[37:05.360 --> 37:07.640]  level they're feeding on humanity.
[37:07.640 --> 37:10.880]  Here is Owen Shroyer's powerful report.
[37:10.880 --> 37:12.800]  This is Owen Shroyer for Infowars.com.
[37:12.800 --> 37:18.520]  I'm in front of the Austin City Council building where I am set to speak where they have public
[37:18.520 --> 37:19.520]  communications here.
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.880]  And I'm going to bring up a big issue of Planned Parenthood getting a government-owned
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.400]  property to rent for $1 a year.
[37:28.400 --> 37:31.160]  Now this has been going on since 1972.
[37:31.160 --> 37:38.480]  They just voted to extend this for up to 40 years, a major advantage for Planned Parenthood.
[37:38.480 --> 37:40.360]  But that's not all there is to the story.
[37:40.360 --> 37:43.240]  So I went to City Council today to raise awareness for this.
[37:43.240 --> 37:44.800]  I gave them all the facts.
[37:44.800 --> 37:46.800]  Let's see how it went.
[37:46.800 --> 37:50.760]  Thank you, Mayor Adler, the members of the City Council present today.
[37:50.760 --> 37:54.720]  Mr. Renteria, last time I saw you, you were illegally campaigning outside of a polling
[37:54.720 --> 37:55.720]  place.
[37:55.720 --> 37:58.000]  That's not what I'm here to talk about today.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.680]  What I'm here to talk about today is a giant pay-for-play scam at the very least happening
[38:03.680 --> 38:06.720]  in the state of Texas and Austin.
[38:06.720 --> 38:11.280]  This month, this City Council voted to once again allow Planned Parenthood to rent government-owned
[38:11.280 --> 38:14.720]  property for free for $1 a year.
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.520]  This property is valued at a fair market price per year of $110,000.
[38:19.520 --> 38:25.400]  This property is also about to receive renovations with a price tag of $1.2 million.
[38:25.400 --> 38:31.280]  This property had a bidder, Austin Life Care, who made a fair market bid to rent the property,
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.720]  and Austin Life Care offers the same services as Planned Parenthood minus the abortions.
[38:36.720 --> 38:39.120]  That bid was ignored.
[38:39.120 --> 38:44.280]  Now, Planned Parenthood has been receiving this advantage since 1972.
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.240]  And thanks to this City Council, that could go on for another 40 years.
[38:48.240 --> 38:53.640]  So it is fair to say that this Planned Parenthood clinic is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.560]  This on top of the millions of taxpayer dollars Planned Parenthood receives a year, half a
[38:57.560 --> 39:02.320]  billion this calendar year, one and a half billion over the last three years, yet this
[39:02.320 --> 39:05.280]  clinic needs free rent.
[39:05.280 --> 39:08.760]  Before I ask this City Council to justify this decision, which goes against millions
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.560]  of Texan spiritual, religious, and political beliefs, I will point out what to me is criminal
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.720]  pay-for-play activity happening between the Democrats, some of which are on this City
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.400]  Council, mind you, you identify as Democrats, and Planned Parenthood.
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.000]  In 2018, according to FEC filings and Open Secrets, reports the following Texas Democrats
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.760]  in Congress received campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood.
[39:30.760 --> 39:37.720]  Alrit Collin, $1,500, Gina Jones, $3,000, Joseph Cosper, $1,500, Sylvia Garcia, $2,500,
[39:37.720 --> 39:41.400]  Lizzie Fletcher, $2,200, Joaquin Castro, $1,000.
[39:41.400 --> 39:45.440]  So if this is untrue, I'm waiting to hear these Democrats disavow it, or I think this
[39:45.440 --> 39:48.240]  requires I file a federal complaint.
[39:48.240 --> 39:54.920]  How can any entity that receives government money be contributing to campaigns specifically
[39:54.920 --> 39:56.040]  to only one party?
[39:56.040 --> 40:01.480]  So not to mention the millions of hearts, beating hearts, stops by Planned Parenthood
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.060]  every year, they receive billions of dollars in taxpayer funds, they contribute politically
[40:06.060 --> 40:10.360]  to only the Democrat Party, and this City Council decides to give them free rent.
[40:10.360 --> 40:13.080]  We just voted to expand government spending in Austin.
[40:13.080 --> 40:17.640]  We can't afford giving millions of dollars away in free rent, let alone to Planned Parenthood
[40:17.640 --> 40:20.840]  when a similar organization offered to pay a fair price.
[40:20.840 --> 40:25.120]  So I ask, and I'd like to get an answer today from this City Council, how do you justify
[40:25.120 --> 40:31.640]  the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[40:31.640 --> 40:34.640]  Laughing.
[40:34.640 --> 40:36.920]  And that's funny to Mr. Renteria.
[40:36.920 --> 40:41.000]  Do you realize that Planned Parenthood has admitted that they stop beating hearts?
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.280]  And we're going to fund that?
[40:43.280 --> 40:45.400]  So there's no comment from this City Council.
[40:45.400 --> 40:49.000]  Mayor Adler, can you justify that decision for the City of Austin?
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.720]  It's your time.
[40:51.720 --> 40:52.720]  Thank you.
[40:52.720 --> 41:02.240]  Next speaker, there we have Mr. Clinton, and then after Mr. Clinton, Mr. Leon.
[41:02.240 --> 41:05.520]  Now the full report, there's more, is up on infowars.com.
[41:05.520 --> 41:06.600]  Get it.
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.240]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[41:10.240 --> 41:11.240]  Lawsuits need to be filed.
[41:11.240 --> 41:12.240]  This is all illegal.
[41:12.240 --> 41:14.240]  You see, conservatives and Christians don't do it.
[41:14.240 --> 41:18.480]  There's more than one way to stop these death facilities.
[41:18.480 --> 41:19.480]  You sue them.
[41:19.480 --> 41:24.480]  In fact, you know what, I'm a taxpayer in here in Austin.
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.400]  Maybe I should follow that lawsuit, but it takes money to do that, and that's why we
[41:28.400 --> 41:33.080]  need your financial support, infowars.com, with this week and being the last days of
[41:33.080 --> 41:35.760]  the Cyber Week sales.
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.160]  We'll have sales continuing through Christmas, but these are our biggest ever, a lot of stuff
[41:39.160 --> 41:40.840]  selling out to take advantage of those.
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.520]  Speaking of our children, here's just a few days ago in Lafayette, Louisiana, a man who
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.600]  dresses like a woman who wants to come talk to your kids saying, I'm there grooming your
[41:49.600 --> 41:50.600]  children.
[41:50.600 --> 41:53.080]  This is the stuff going on in city councils all over the country.
[41:53.080 --> 41:55.760]  He wants to groom your children about LGBT.
[41:55.760 --> 41:59.320]  Imagine if a heterosexual man wanted to go to your school and groom your daughters about
[41:59.320 --> 42:00.320]  heterosexual sex.
[42:00.320 --> 42:03.480]  He keeps saying it's disgusting that you don't want us to do this.
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.120]  No, you being obsessed with our children is disgusting.
[42:07.120 --> 42:08.120]  You monster.
[42:08.120 --> 42:09.120]  Here he is.
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.040]  I just let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful, and for
[42:13.040 --> 42:16.200]  the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to
[42:16.200 --> 42:18.640]  be the grooming of the next generation.
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.440]  We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[42:23.440 --> 42:25.920]  Now you're going to come talk to our kids about sex.
[42:25.920 --> 42:29.120]  What an over the top obviousness of this.
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.040]  By the way, I'm going to show you something.
[42:31.040 --> 42:32.040]  Here's David Knight's notes.
[42:32.040 --> 42:33.040]  He's about to take over live here.
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.040]  This is the type of notes he does for each show.
[42:36.040 --> 42:37.800]  Look at these amazing topics.
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.240]  David Knight's taking over today, the rest of Friday broadcast, a bunch of huge guests.

[42:47.800 --> 42:48.800]  We need your help folks.
[42:48.800 --> 42:49.800]  The children need your help.

[44:15.960 --> 44:20.560]  InfoWarsStore.com, the biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory
[44:20.560 --> 44:24.040]  so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into
[44:24.040 --> 44:25.040]  next year.
[44:25.040 --> 44:28.040]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment and attacks.
[44:28.040 --> 44:30.440]  It would take an hour to go over to some of it.
[44:30.440 --> 44:35.280]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com there is the revolution of products that are excellent
[44:35.280 --> 44:41.120]  and the revolution of funding Info Wars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.600]  fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all
[44:45.600 --> 44:47.880]  of our shared futures together.

[45:06.240 --> 45:11.240]  now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider
[45:11.240 --> 45:12.800]  a contribution.
[45:12.800 --> 45:20.880]  $25, $50, $100, $250, even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat
[45:20.880 --> 45:27.200]  back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle
[45:27.200 --> 45:34.200]  our first amendment rights.
[45:34.200 --> 46:01.560]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[46:01.560 --> 46:06.640]  All of the world at rain of censorship is coming in in a perfect storm of dying corporate
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.640]  media, big mega corporations, authoritarian regimes like communist China, the EU, the
[46:11.640 --> 46:17.360]  Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down loyal Americans and other loyal
[46:17.360 --> 46:18.360]  nationalists.
[46:18.360 --> 46:20.160]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[46:20.160 --> 46:24.880]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas, all of you remember that without you supporting
[46:24.880 --> 46:28.240]  Info Wars financially, we will be shut down and we make it easy to do.
[46:28.240 --> 46:32.560]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales for Black Friday, Wall
[46:32.560 --> 46:37.640]  Supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements, t-shirts, books, films,
[46:37.640 --> 46:40.880]  it's all there and it makes the information work possible against the globalists.
[46:40.880 --> 46:43.880]  So I want to thank you this Christmas for your support and I want to ask you for your
[46:43.880 --> 46:44.880]  continued support.

[47:03.560 --> 47:13.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:13.320 --> 47:21.320]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your
[47:21.320 --> 47:25.520]  host, David Knight.
[47:25.520 --> 47:34.600]  All right, welcome on this Friday, November 30th, 2018.
[47:34.600 --> 47:39.160]  For the remainder of the program, I'm going to be your host to talk about a lot of things
[47:39.160 --> 47:40.160]  today.
[47:40.160 --> 47:43.680]  We're going to have, coming up in the next hour, we're going to have a whistleblower
[47:43.680 --> 47:46.760]  from the Ukraine, Andrei Telushenko.
[47:46.760 --> 47:55.040]  Now he is somebody who has been closely involved in Ukrainian efforts to rig the election.
[47:55.040 --> 48:02.600]  There was actually collusion between a political party and a foreign government, but nobody
[48:02.600 --> 48:05.120]  wants to talk about that.
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.240]  And as people talked about it, we had HR McMaster tell Bob Woodward in his book, famously In
[48:10.240 --> 48:11.240]  Fear.
[48:11.240 --> 48:14.640]  Oh, this is just a Russian propaganda that Trump is tweeting out there when he's talking
[48:14.640 --> 48:15.640]  about this.
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.000]  We're going to talk to him about what's going on right now in Ukraine because it is now
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.200]  a flashpoint that has been created by the military industrial complex, the neocon never
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.680]  Trumpers who are trying to overthrow our election, who have overthrown that country's government.
[48:30.680 --> 48:35.640]  And now he is in hiding because he's kind of caught between the two forces there.
[48:35.640 --> 48:36.720]  He was loyal to Ukraine.
[48:36.720 --> 48:39.440]  He's not a Russian propagandist by any means.
[48:39.440 --> 48:41.240]  He doesn't like Russia.
[48:41.240 --> 48:46.560]  He is a Ukrainian nationalist, but we're going to talk to him about what's going on in Ukraine.
[48:46.560 --> 48:51.320]  Now that government is manipulating things and how he has now become an enemy of the
[48:51.320 --> 48:53.840]  state there because he told the truth about what was going on.
[48:53.840 --> 49:00.240]  It's very dangerous now all over the West, even here in the US, to tell the truth about
[49:00.240 --> 49:01.760]  what our governments are doing.
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.240]  It's a very dangerous thing, and we want to congratulate him for doing that, but he's
[49:06.240 --> 49:07.480]  got a lot of information to tell us.
[49:07.480 --> 49:12.320]  We're also going to be talking about some updates on gun control.
[49:12.320 --> 49:15.840]  We have a back-and-forth questioning that happened two days ago.
[49:15.840 --> 49:19.840]  Nobody's picked up on this yet except for New American, a back-and-forth questioning
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.800]  on a case of civil asset forfeiture before the Supreme Court.
[49:24.800 --> 49:30.280]  And you actually had the Attorney General of Indiana tell a Supreme Court justice in
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.760]  questioning that, yes, they could confiscate your car if you were going five miles per
[49:34.760 --> 49:38.840]  hour over the speed limit under civil asset forfeiture.
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.440]  This is what it has come to for the slaves here in America.
[49:44.440 --> 49:50.360]  I've talked about this for a very long time, the danger of destroying the rule of law and
[49:50.360 --> 49:55.160]  our fundamental liberties in order to pursue this insane failed war on drugs prohibition
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.000]  that has no constitutional basis.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.320]  It is a UN agenda conservative, you need to understand that.
[50:02.320 --> 50:05.160]  And now it has come to this.
[50:05.160 --> 50:09.320]  And so we'll talk about that also coming up, the billionaire space race that is developing
[50:09.320 --> 50:15.440]  as NASA tries to make this a private-public partnership, how did that work out for us
[50:15.440 --> 50:17.600]  with free speech?
[50:17.600 --> 50:22.720]  We had these corporations that DARPA, the military industrial complex and the government,
[50:22.720 --> 50:25.800]  helped to get started, helped to give them a monopoly.
[50:25.800 --> 50:27.160]  A lot of people don't understand that.
[50:27.160 --> 50:31.080]  People at Reason, people at Cato Institute, a lot of people who call themselves libertarians
[50:31.080 --> 50:33.160]  or conservatives don't understand that.
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.600]  They don't understand how these technological monsters came into being, they don't understand
[50:37.600 --> 50:39.080]  the political partnership with them.
[50:39.080 --> 50:42.560]  And so now they're controlling cyberspace, are we going to let them control outer space
[50:42.560 --> 50:44.060]  as well?
[50:44.060 --> 50:49.360]  They will be controlling urban space if we don't stop this Agenda 21 issue.
[50:49.360 --> 50:52.160]  So we'll talk a little bit about that as well.
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.440]  And I want to start out by talking about the so-called war on Christmas.
[50:56.440 --> 50:59.000]  Folks, there is no war on Christmas.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.100]  There really isn't.
[51:00.100 --> 51:05.240]  This is something that's created, it's very handy little slogan by Fox News, it kind of
[51:05.240 --> 51:10.000]  sounds like a rank and bass production, the year without Santa Claus.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.600]  And that's going to be the year without Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
[51:12.600 --> 51:14.840]  Oh, no, there is a war.
[51:14.840 --> 51:15.840]  There is a war.
[51:15.840 --> 51:17.800]  It is a cultural war.
[51:17.800 --> 51:23.040]  And we need to understand that I think it trivializes it to call it a war on Christmas.
[51:23.040 --> 51:29.880]  Folks, what they are trying to do is deconstruct every aspect of Western civilization, even
[51:29.880 --> 51:31.880]  down to our cartoons.
[51:31.880 --> 51:33.880]  It was Thanksgiving.
[51:33.880 --> 51:36.160]  They were coming after Charlie Brown Christmas.
[51:36.160 --> 51:37.160]  This racist.
[51:37.160 --> 51:39.440]  Well, your Charlie Brown Christmas is racist.
[51:39.440 --> 51:43.760]  I mean, it began with Nikki Haley and the Confederate generals because of a mass murder.
[51:43.760 --> 51:45.760]  They said, look, he's got a Confederate flag there in the back.
[51:45.760 --> 51:46.760]  So let's go after the Confederate generals.
[51:46.760 --> 51:50.000]  Then they go after the Union generals, then they go after Lincoln.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.440]  Then they go after Christopher Columbus.
[51:52.440 --> 51:55.200]  They were going after the pilgrims every year.
[51:55.200 --> 51:57.880]  And now they come after the cartoons.
[51:57.880 --> 52:00.000]  Even will the insanity end?
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  Let's play a little.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.880]  A lot of people have written stories about this tweet from Huffington Post.
[52:05.880 --> 52:09.480]  They put together a little video explaining to you how horrible Rudolph the red-nosed
[52:09.480 --> 52:10.480]  reindeer is.
[52:10.480 --> 52:14.840]  Now, we also had talked about it two days ago.
[52:14.840 --> 52:21.120]  We had a guy, a science fiction writer, who is using JRR tokens, Lord of the Rings, as
[52:21.120 --> 52:24.960]  a metaphor for their political correctness, their agenda, and so forth.
[52:24.960 --> 52:33.320]  He actually got on and made the inane comment that the orcs were like migrants, or the migrants
[52:33.320 --> 52:34.480]  were like orcs.
[52:34.480 --> 52:39.360]  And he was trying to defend the migrants, actually, by comparing them to these man-eating
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.600]  goblins, these fictional goblins.
[52:42.600 --> 52:44.120]  It was actually an invasion.
[52:44.120 --> 52:45.120]  It really was.
[52:45.120 --> 52:51.440]  Don't worry, the orcs are not anywhere near their shire yet, but they're coming and they're
[52:51.440 --> 52:52.600]  climbing over the walls.
[52:52.600 --> 52:59.040]  But they're just misunderstood, and so is Lord Sauron, or Soros, whoever, just fill
[52:59.040 --> 53:00.040]  in the blank.
[53:00.040 --> 53:05.320]  He absolutely didn't realize that he was throwing his own argument under the bus.
[53:05.320 --> 53:10.240]  But this is how insane these people are, and they want to seize and deconstruct every
[53:10.240 --> 53:11.760]  aspect of our culture.
[53:11.760 --> 53:14.320]  Gone off the white, that's racist imagery.
[53:14.320 --> 53:17.960]  No, it's Christian imagery that you don't understand anymore.
[53:17.960 --> 53:22.320]  But let's talk a little bit about this cartoon, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.120]  And it's just a cartoon.
[53:26.120 --> 53:27.120]  It's a cartoon.
[53:27.120 --> 53:29.400]  Like I said with Charlie Brown, good grief.
[53:29.400 --> 53:30.760]  Give us a break.
[53:30.760 --> 53:37.080]  But they won't give us a break until they break up and destroy everything about our culture.
[53:37.080 --> 53:39.320]  They are not multicultural.
[53:39.320 --> 53:40.920]  They don't embrace that at all.
[53:40.920 --> 53:44.920]  They want one monoculture that they will define.
[53:44.920 --> 53:49.080]  So let's take a look at their objections to Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
[53:49.080 --> 53:56.080]  This is what Huffington Post tweeted out.
[53:56.080 --> 54:03.320]  Okay, so they're making fun of Rudolph, isn't that horrible?
[54:03.320 --> 54:04.320]  They're bullying him.
[54:04.320 --> 54:06.320]  Rudolph the marginalized reindeer.
[54:06.320 --> 54:11.000]  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is a holiday classic, they say, that returns to TV each
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.320]  holiday season.
[54:12.320 --> 54:16.960]  But lately, viewers are noticing the tale may not be so jolly after all.
[54:16.960 --> 54:21.320]  Because of all of these microaggressions that have been found in it.
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.640]  A yearly reminder that Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is a parable of racism and homophobia.
[54:25.640 --> 54:28.320]  People are cheating out.
[54:28.320 --> 54:32.840]  Santa's operation is a human resources nightmare.
[54:32.840 --> 54:35.480]  Seriously needs diversity and inclusion.
[54:35.480 --> 54:38.800]  Former fans are pointing out Rudolph's father verbally abuses him.
[54:38.800 --> 54:40.800]  Alright, son, try it on.
[54:40.800 --> 54:41.800]  I don't want it.
[54:41.800 --> 54:42.800]  Daddy, I don't like it.
[54:42.800 --> 54:45.800]  You don't like it and wear it.
[54:45.800 --> 54:59.480]  Santa Claus also breaks Donner for his son's nose.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.480]  You get the idea.
[55:00.480 --> 55:01.480]  It goes on and on.
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.240]  Donner, you should be ashamed of yourself and so forth.
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.240]  And it goes on.
[55:07.240 --> 55:08.240]  We'll stop it there.
[55:08.240 --> 55:12.360]  As some person tweeted out, I think The Onion made a fake Huffington Post video and hacked
[55:12.360 --> 55:13.360]  their Twitter.
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.440]  Now, if I would put up something like that, they would have shut me down because I did
[55:18.440 --> 55:24.440]  put out Babel and Bee making a joke when everybody was talking about the folk of Hannes'
[55:24.440 --> 55:25.440]  DNA.
[55:25.440 --> 55:26.440]  They said, Hillary Clinton, get a test.
[55:26.440 --> 55:27.440]  And she said, see conservatives?
[55:27.440 --> 55:29.240]  I'm only 50% reptilian DNA.
[55:29.240 --> 55:36.040]  They took down the real news Twitter feed for that, the program I have in the morning.
[55:36.040 --> 55:40.440]  So this is the way there's double standards here, folks, for this kind of stuff.
[55:40.440 --> 55:46.280]  Then as one person pointed out who actually got it, Paul Joseph Watson put up a story
[55:46.280 --> 55:51.360]  on Infowars going through all the different comments that people had about this.
[55:51.360 --> 55:55.600]  One person said, what is it with the left that makes them try and destroy everything
[55:55.600 --> 55:56.600]  and anything?
[55:56.600 --> 56:00.880]  It's like they have to suck out the joy of life by looking for things to be angry or
[56:00.880 --> 56:02.800]  outraged about 24-7.
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.720]  Well, maybe you realize, he's starting to realize there's a pattern here.
[56:07.720 --> 56:09.680]  And it's not just a personality flaw.
[56:09.680 --> 56:11.400]  This is training.
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.480]  This is what they've been training children to do for the last several decades from kindergarten
[56:16.480 --> 56:19.160]  through college.
[56:19.160 --> 56:20.160]  And now it is bearing fruit.
[56:20.160 --> 56:22.400]  Now, this is something that's been going on for a long time.
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.760]  Jesus is now banned from a Christmas program at a Virginia middle school, reports a New
[56:26.760 --> 56:30.400]  American, a Robius middle school in Midlothian, Virginia.
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.960]  They have nixed the inclusion of Christmas carols that refer to Jesus or the Christian
[56:35.960 --> 56:36.960]  faith.
[56:36.960 --> 56:39.400]  Rudolph, however, is okay for now.
[56:39.400 --> 56:41.520]  Rudolph and Santa Claus, they're okay.
[56:41.520 --> 56:47.840]  But their days are numbered if these people who want to drag our culture to the ground
[56:47.840 --> 56:50.080]  are not stopped.
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.840]  One person says, I'm trying to rationalize how you can encourage diversity and yet be
[56:53.840 --> 56:56.360]  exclusionary in one specific area.
[56:56.360 --> 56:59.440]  Yeah, a little bit of cognitive dissonance there, isn't it?
[56:59.440 --> 57:02.400]  As I said, it's not multiculturalism.
[57:02.400 --> 57:06.600]  It is monoculturalism, the culture that they define.
[57:06.600 --> 57:10.520]  And here is how they are defining it, folks.
[57:10.520 --> 57:17.000]  As we've talked many times about this drag queen story hour, where you have transgenders
[57:17.000 --> 57:25.480]  going from school to school, talking to very, very young children, showing them how to dress
[57:25.480 --> 57:27.160]  up and so forth.
[57:27.160 --> 57:34.360]  This one individual, who typically he performs in a R rated situation, he says, it's okay,
[57:34.360 --> 57:36.240]  I can control myself.
[57:36.240 --> 57:37.240]  I know how to filter myself.
[57:37.240 --> 57:38.240]  Well, you know what?
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.240]  I know how to filter this guy, too, to keep him out of the school.
[57:42.240 --> 57:46.200]  But he says that he is grooming the next generation.
[57:46.200 --> 57:48.320]  And he mentions that several times, grooming him.
[57:48.320 --> 57:50.080]  That's exactly what it is.
[57:50.080 --> 57:54.760]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[59:26.120 --> 59:32.000]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[59:47.040 --> 59:53.520]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.520 --> 01:00:19.520]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:27.240]  Welcome back, you know, we're just talking about how the left is having a lot of problems
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:32.200]  with Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer because unfortunately, the fictional character is
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.200]  bullied.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.800]  Well, it is a story of bullying and how he overcomes it, how he embraces his differences
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.360]  and so forth, but that's not good enough for them.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.720]  And they use the idea of bullying.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.560]  They don't want kids to see Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.400]  What they want them to see is a drag queen story hour.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.800]  That is their prescription on how to overcome bullying.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.480]  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, definitely out.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.200]  Drag queens now in.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.200]  And so you have a guy in Louisiana because this is a national issue, folks, that's happening
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.200]  all over the country.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.160]  There's probably one close to you here in Texas, in Louisiana, back in North Carolina.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:20.280]  This guy in Louisiana at the Lafayette Public Library where he goes to talk to very, very
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280]  young children.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.680]  You have a problem with that?
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.040]  I do.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.480]  And I'll tell you why I have a problem with it.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.840]  It's what this guy has to say.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.600]  He says, well, I'm not here to push any kind of agenda.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.960]  I'm here to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.440]  and for the children and the people that are supporting it are going to realize this is
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.560]  going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:47.920]  They're trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.000]  These people are trying to get access to your children and you have to understand that they're
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  trying to groom them.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.480]  Now, he says, he typically does this as an R-rated show, but he says, I should have access
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.240]  to preschool children because I can filter myself.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.880]  I'm able to do that because I'm an adult and I'm able to filter myself.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.880]  Well, these kids are not adults and these kids can't filter and process what you're
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.380]  doing.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:21.720]  And I have a real problem with predators like this who put themselves in a position to come
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.760]  after young children.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.080]  They are not capable of making these decisions.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.880]  Quite frankly, I don't like strangers talking to my kids about sex, especially men who are
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.560]  dressed like women and are obviously into some other activities.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.120]  I don't think they should be engaged in this.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.600]  I don't think strangers should be talking to kids about sex.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.520]  That should be their parents, introducing it to them when they are ready.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.280]  But these people want to groom the kids because if these kids can make decisions about gender,
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.680]  they can make decisions about consensual sex.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.840]  That's the whole game behind this, folks.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.840]  That and the destruction of the family.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.440]  You only look at the fact that these people are not about tolerance.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.840]  Just look at this story from Daily Mail.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.560]  You've got the guy who runs Grindr, which is basically a gay dating app, Grindr.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.720]  His name is Scott Chin.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.720]  He's Asian.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.600]  He's in Taiwan.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.160]  They just had a referendum on the definition of marriage.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:23.560]  And he was upset about the fact that there was another CEO that was supporting anti-LGBTQ
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:32.800]  causes and had contributed in favor of this agenda that would define marriage as between
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]  a man and a woman.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.200]  Now, this guy is saying he runs a gay dating app.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.880]  He says, I don't want the government to define this or prohibit this in any way.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.640]  And he was actually saying he was going to boycott this other person.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:49.080]  But in the process of talking about this, he made remarks saying that he said there
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.280]  are people like me that believe that marriage is holy matrimony between a man and a woman.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.720]  And he's got a couple of kids.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.800]  And so now the people that he was defending and showing tolerance for are now coming after
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.120]  him because they're not about tolerance.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.000]  They have an agenda.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.200]  They do not want you to merely tolerate what they do.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.720]  See, that's the problem.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.760]  They want to demand that you conform to them and celebrate what they do and change your
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.200]  way of life.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.280]  Somebody that doesn't embrace what they do, celebrate what they do, will be purged out
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.400]  of the public square.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.200]  And quite frankly, we have something even more dangerous coming, and I'll tell you about
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.160]  that later in the program.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:42.840]  As James Dobson, a focus on the family, points out, the new renegotiated NAFTA has got language
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.520]  in it about Jim that Obama and his administration would be proud of.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:55.280]  What is that doing is another example of why we should have gotten rid of NAFTA altogether
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.280]  instead of reforming it.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:02.280]  I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.600]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support, and I wanted just to remind you that
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.880]  InfoWars isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can, and without you, we won't
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.880]  be here.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.080]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week, and it's happening now at
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.680]  InfoWarsStore.com, the biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.200]  so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.200]  next year.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.480]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment and attacks, it
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.280]  would take an hour to go over to some of it.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.160]  So right now, at InfoWarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.280]  and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.760]  fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.960]  of our shared futures together.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.480]  InfoWars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.840]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny, and we will fight until the end.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.600]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:25.760]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760]  Welcome back.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.480]  You know we've had a lot of news in the last week about what's going on between the Ukraine
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.480]  and Russia.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:37.840]  Four years ago, we had the revolution there, and there was a lot of discussion about Victoria
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.440]  Newland State Department involvement there and so forth, but there were revelations
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:53.440]  that came out in Politico talking about the efforts of the DNC to work with a foreign
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.600]  country and to rig our elections.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:01.280]  And we're not talking about the Trump campaign and Russia.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:08.080]  We're talking about the DNC, Alexandria Chalupa, and the Ukrainian government at the time.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.600]  And we have a guy on with us now, Andrei Telushenko.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.840]  He was quoted by Politico, many other organizations.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:22.000]  Actually, he's held quite a number of high-ranking positions in the Ukrainian government.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.120]  But he is an honest whistleblower, and he's had to pay the price on that.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.960]  I want to talk to him about what the current situation in the Ukraine is.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:37.200]  But I also want to get back to talk a little bit about this overlooked conspiracy as part
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200]  of this.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.720]  You know, it's another example of how we investigate one thing for which there is no evidence
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:49.200]  now, even after a couple of years, as Jake Tapper was even saying when he was talking
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:54.480]  to Gerald Nadler, he said, but okay, you may not like these hotel deals that are going
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.680]  on in Russia.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.400]  But there's no evidence of a conspiracy, even Jake Tapper is saying that.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.040]  But there is quite a bit of evidence of conspiracy in the Ukraine.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.680]  And I want to talk to Andrei Telushenko about that.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:11.960]  Again, he has had a number of positions there in the Ukrainian government.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.040]  He was an advisor in foreign affairs, the former prosecutor general of Ukraine.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.040]  He was associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ukraine.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.880]  He was also part of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, part of the Prosecutor General's
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880]  Office.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.400]  I'm going back many years of experience in government there.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.600]  He was also with the Ukrainian Embassy here in the United States.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.600]  Thank you for joining us, Andrei.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.600]  Thank you, David.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.880]  Did I leave anything out?
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:43.000]  Tell me, in terms of your resume, primarily at the time that this was happening, you were
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.920]  aware of what was going on with Alexandria Chalupa and her work for the DNC in your
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.160]  official capacity at that time, right?
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:59.520]  Yes, I personally had a chance to meet her in the end of March beginning of April 2016.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:05.520]  And it was, I was recommended to meet with her by DCM, at the Embassy of Ksenia Shullar
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.720]  and one of the lunch meetings.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.680]  And that's when I got introduced to her.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.720]  We met, we talked, and she introduced what she was doing and her work.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.400]  And of course, that was reported in detail by Politico.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.120]  We got documents from WikiLeaks, Alexandria Chalupa openly talked about what she was doing.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.640]  You talked about it.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.960]  But we just saw a couple of months ago when Bob Woodward's book Fear came out.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.320]  He had quotes there where he said, as President Trump tweeted out, isn't anybody going to
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.720]  look at this other effort by a foreign government to work with a political party, the Democrats,
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.720]  to rig the election?
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.400]  Nobody's going to look at that.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:47.640]  And HR McMaster, according to Bob Woodward in his book Fear, said, this is nothing but
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.840]  the president pushing out another Russian conspiracy, essentially accusing you of being
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.880]  a Russian agent.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.640]  But right now you're not in the Ukraine, are you?
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:04.560]  No, I had to leave Ukraine due to political threats and pressure.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.080]  And I went to the United States first now and back in Europe, in Austria for some business,
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.800]  but I'm going to be back in the United States in a couple of weeks.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:18.840]  And so you're not a Russian agent, but the Ukrainian government is, again, and that's
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.640]  what I want to talk about because of what happened this last weekend, actually a couple
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:31.640]  of weeks ago before this incident at the Kerch Strait that has escalated tensions there and
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.960]  has caused Ukraine to go into martial law.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:42.760]  We had the foreign minister of Ukraine come and meet with Mike Pompeo, and they were talking
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.720]  about how they had to pay special attention to this particular strait.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.960]  As I talked about this on Monday, it appeared to me to be an act of provocation.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:11:01.040]  But regardless of that, tell us a little bit about the conditions in Ukraine.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.560]  Many of us are suspicious about martial law being imposed there because of the low popularity
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.160]  of the current president there.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.560]  What is his popularity rating there, approximately?
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:18.400]  Yeah, the problem with that, with the Zofi and the Kerch Strait is that it has to be first
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.480]  fully investigated by all sides, and then taken that into action, you have to get further
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.560]  results done.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.200]  But what happened with martial law this Monday, it was total chaos.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:37.680]  The president, Pleschenko, with an 8% rating, tried to impose martial law all over Ukraine,
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.720]  which would give him a chance to stay in power for six more months.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.640]  I knew about this process since spring this year, and I spoke about this when I was in
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:54.000]  Kiev to embassy officials from European, US embassies, and nobody would take it into
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.960]  real action that this might have happened, but it happened this Monday, and without
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:06.240]  any other problem we had, we had more worse issues before we had people die every day
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.920]  on the east of Donetsk, of Ukraine, and we have people die, more important people died
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:19.360]  in one day during the Baltseva, Ilovaisk, and nothing was imposed on such matter before.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:27.080]  But today, because 36 days before the election, they tried to impose martial law all over
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.280]  Ukraine, and to postpone the election for six months, having the president win more
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.080]  time, and with the fear of war over the people, try to build up his rating.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:44.040]  This would be the first election since the Medan Revolution four years ago, back in 2014.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040]  Right?
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:52.200]  Presidential, yes, there was election to the parliament before, which went pretty smoothly,
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.120]  but this is going to be the first election as for the president as of Medan.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.880]  And so he's at 8% in the opinion polls, and again, something else that is happening there,
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.680]  and was talked about when the foreign minister of Ukraine came here and talked to Pompeo,
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.320]  was the gas pipeline that Russia and Turkey are trying to run through.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.000]  That was something that was about to happen four years ago, back in 2014, when the revolution
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  happened.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.600]  It was starting to start up again.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:28.200]  So there were multiple things that were going on that the US and Poroshenko were aware of,
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:33.880]  and this allows him to stop the election that he's not in too good a shape for, but talk
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.640]  to us a little bit about the economy.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:41.600]  How has the economy been over the last four years under his leadership in the Ukraine?
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.160]  The economy started to default a couple of times.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.560]  We had a process of default a couple of times in Ukraine.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.920]  Last one was this October before the IMF gave us the latest tranche of virtual money to
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:03.000]  Ukraine, and that's when Ukraine was basically almost an economic shutdown.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.480]  And the economy, because of the war, it is bad.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:14.600]  But we are seeing that Ukraine and government is trying to listen more and more to IMF.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:21.200]  They're just bending over, I apologize for my words, to IMF and just asking for money
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.000]  every time, even though they're spending them all over the place.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.360]  There's also a lot of spending into such agency as Naboo, where the US is financing,
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.960]  but still there's no results.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:42.320]  And as we can see today, the Persian government with his, as he says, best financial financiers
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.040]  who are working with the West is not capable of doing anything.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:51.680]  The dollar is rising every time, and it rose to 30 percent the first year.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.600]  And now it's risen 45, 55 percent as of this year.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.080]  And people's salaries are less and less every time.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.560]  They have to pay more money for communal services, which they don't have money to pay.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:09.800]  The salary in Ukraine now is $300 a month, the minimum salary in Ukraine.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800]  Wow.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]  Wow.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.840]  Ukraine is one of the poorest countries in Europe at this point, is it?
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:21.080]  Unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, as I'm a Ukrainian and I'm a person who worked with
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.440]  the government, for me it's hard break to see that our economy is one of the poorest
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.320]  and one of the worst economies in Europe.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.200]  And you've been quoted by Newsweek.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.920]  We've got to take a quick break and we'll come back, but you've been quoted by Newsweek
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:42.360]  concerned at not only the level of the economy, but the fact that ties with Russia were actually
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360]  building.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.640]  And you were saying we need to be breaking away from Russia and establishing our economic
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.640]  independence.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.480]  So we'll talk a little bit more about that, and then we'll get back into some of the other
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.720]  politics that are still bubbling below the surface.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.920]  Here we are a couple of years after the election.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.840]  You hear that, that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840]  the place.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.400]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.880]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.080]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.840]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.040]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.560]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.840]  faketv.com The United States of Empire is a book that
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.720]  claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.760]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:42.720]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.560]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.560]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.080]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:55.240]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunne.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.840]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.960]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.160]  food and boil water.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.840]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.040]  a much better way.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.880]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.520]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.600]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.800]  I'm talking thick meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.800]  I buy some.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.800]  I use some.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800]  I store some.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.800]  Awesome.

[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.080]  Bacon.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.440]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and served.

[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.200]  Make it easy to do.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:30.400]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales from Black Friday, wall
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.480]  supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements, t-shirts, books, films.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.760]  It's all there, and it makes the information work possible against the globalists.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.120]  So I want to thank you this Christmas for your support, and I want to ask you for your continued
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.120]  support.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.280]  It's a 360-win because these products are great, free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.120]  across the board, and double-patriot points.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:55.360]  Right now, at m4store.com, we call toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three, three-one-three-nine,
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.120]  because when you take action, nothing on Earth can stop you.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.160]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.400]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.320]  literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.440]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.440]  gone through two permutations.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.320]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.280]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.280]  So we discovered deep Earth crystals of pure nascent iodine, and brought you X2 that's
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.280]  been incredible.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.480]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.720]  of the deep Earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.200]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:47.280]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.760]  it even more bioavailable.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  discovery.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:20.840]  Thanks for watching X3, now available at M4sLive.com.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:32.560]  Welcome back, we're talking to Andrei Tolashenko.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.240]  He has worked in many government positions for the Ukraine government, who is with the
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.200]  Ukraine's U.S. Embassy here in the United States.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:51.280]  As part of his involvement with the Ukrainian government, he was aware of efforts to try
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.320]  to rig the election against President Trump.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:00.360]  They were trying to use, the Democrats were trying to get Ukraine involved in trying to
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.960]  rig the election against President Trump.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:06.640]  Now, of course, it was reported by WikiLeaks, it was reported by Politico, they did a very
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.040]  in-depth article.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040]  He talked about it.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.680]  Alexandra Chalupa had no problem talking about it.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:18.840]  But of course, HR McMaster and the Ukrainian Embassy, those people who are the neocons
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.920]  trying to overthrow the election here in this country, pushed back against it.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.160]  They said, oh, it's nothing but Russian propaganda and a conspiracy theory.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.040]  It isn't.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.360]  Andrei is an honest man.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.520]  Quite frankly, Lee Stranahan tracked him down, took him quite a while to track him down after
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.520]  seeing the reports, talking to him and Politico, as well as others with Newsweek.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.520]  He said, let's get some more information from this guy, it took him a very long time.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:53.480]  And what Lee told me, he had to get to Andrei through some common Christian friends, find
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]  a network there.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.880]  And now he's had to pay the price for talking honestly about what was going on.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.760]  But I want to get back to the current state right now before we go back into the politics
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.520]  of what happened in 2016.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:14.000]  Andrei, you talked to Newsweek and you were talking about the economic ties that continued
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.240]  to escalate between Ukraine and Russia at the time, just a year or so ago, I guess.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.400]  And you said, from your point of view, it was a step backwards.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:26.000]  Tell us a little bit about that, what your concern is about the fact that there was increased
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.280]  trade between Russia, that the Russian sphere of influence was continuing to actually increase
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.720]  even after the Revolution four years ago.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.800]  It's the problem not with Russia or any other country that we're growing our trade with
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.720]  is the problem that we're in a war with a country which is fighting against us and which
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:52.040]  asking other countries to sanction them and not to trade with them, not to have any economic
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.040]  ties with them.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.880]  But on the other side, official Kiev in Ukraine, under the president of Poroshenko, is building
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:06.600]  up its trade with Russia, that official aggressor as they portrayed to the people here in Ukraine.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.040]  So you've had border skirmishes continue to go on at the border, today they announced
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:17.200]  that they're going to block any Russian men between the ages of 16 and 60 from coming
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.440]  across the border, the Ukrainian border service has switched, they said, to the first level
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.120]  of full combat readiness.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:28.680]  And again, we recognize that when they talk about men between the ages of 16 and 60, that
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.120]  is universally been understood for hundreds of years as the militia.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.360]  We talk about the Second Amendment here in this country, people go, well, what is a militia?
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.960]  Well, it's not the National Guard, it's everybody between the ages of 16 and 60.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:44.400]  And that's exactly what they're looking at in the Ukrainian situation.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:50.240]  They are beating the drums of war saying there is an imminent Russian invasion that is coming
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.560]  and that's the justification for martial law.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.480]  I'm not sure that's the case.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:00.560]  I think it's more likely an attempt to manipulate the election, you know, and I think that Pompeo
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.960]  is going to return the favor in the deep state here in the United States.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:08.760]  The Ukrainians tried to manipulate our election two years ago, now we're returning the favor
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760]  trying to help them.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.440]  They also want to stop the pipeline that is about to go through again, just like the pipeline
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:18.440]  is a big part of what's going on in Syria.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:24.760]  And I think it was very effective at this particular time for them to be able to stop
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.680]  any communication between President Trump and Putin at the G20 that began today.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.760]  He is now backed off of that because of allegations from Mueller and because of what happened this
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760]  last weekend.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.720]  As we have in the past, we've always said that it's a good thing for the superpowers,
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.920]  the United States and Russia, to have discussion between each other.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:49.640]  You know, they got 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, so daytime is a good thing.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.720]  But no longer, we can't have that kind of discussion.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.400]  So they've now been able to shut that down.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:00.000]  They've got a lot of goals here that seem to be served by this narrative that came out
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.200]  of this situation over the weekend.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]  Your comments?
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.680]  First of all, there's no threat right now, a Russian raid in Ukraine.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.880]  Nobody wants war today.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.280]  There was a big threat in 2014 when I was in government and we were working on this issue
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:21.280]  over seeing security services in Ukraine and the military.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280]  There was a threat then.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:29.640]  Today, there's a stable military presence of Russian military on the border of Ukraine,
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.720]  but there's no imminent threat of invasion.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:37.720]  So this is what we're doing today, blocking anybody going into Ukraine, age of 16 to 60
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.720]  is just to make a show for the people that they're doing something and to have opposed
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:47.280]  the threat and people being fear of war, which is this total chaos.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.480]  And this is unacceptable in a democratic country.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.360]  And I think the West should at least oppose to this.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.280]  And I was trying to let this go through the other news channels and official and official
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:05.240]  channels here in Ukraine and in the Washington police stop Porchenko of using dictatorship
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.760]  methods, which even the undercoach didn't use, which we fought against.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.760]  This is one of the oldest plots that we've ever seen.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.680]  Anybody that has got a shaky regime or whatever, they can always appeal and consolidate everybody
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.640]  around them if they start a war or if they say that a war is imminent.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.120]  That's the oldest ploy on the book.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.440]  We've seen this over and over again.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.040]  I'm very suspicious that that is the key goal behind all of this.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.240]  And it would be a shame, it'd be a tragedy to see war being pushed.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.040]  We've got Nikki Haley out there saying, we're going to slap the Russians around anytime
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.040]  we want to.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.400]  They really do want war.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.680]  They really want to get us involved in the war, but especially the people there on the
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.680]  ground.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.280]  I mean, we've seen the tragedy in Syria when people like Nikki Haley get involved.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.480]  And I don't want to see that happening again here in the Ukraine.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.800]  I'm sure you don't either.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:58.040]  Now, nobody wants a new war here happening, everyone's peace talks and this to end for
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:04.680]  both countries, as for Russia, as for Ukraine to stop this war and to everybody live their
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:10.360]  own lives, which I was trying to also, but the United States has had to join the Normandy
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:15.760]  format in 2014 for us to end it much faster today, as you said already, than trying to
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.760]  break away those ties between President Trump and Putin and to have those countries not
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.120]  talk, which can deal with this issue as more faster than the European countries involved
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.120]  with Ukraine.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.160]  Yeah, that would be one way to diffuse this, but they don't want it to fuse.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.840]  You're saying nobody wants this.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.680]  Well, that's nobody in Ukraine that wants this.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.640]  Nobody who's actually going to be involved in this.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.560]  But there's a lot of people at the upper levels of our government and the Ukrainian government
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560]  who do want this.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.040]  Now, when we got to take a break coming up in a few minutes, but let's start to talk
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:55.040]  a little bit about what you saw going back in the 2016 election, because we've had this
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:01.200]  dismissed by HR McMaster as nothing but a Russian conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.840]  were working with the Democrats against Trump to try to rig the election against Trump.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:12.680]  Tell us a little bit about what you saw there as you were, as Alexandra Chalupa, the DNC
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.400]  operative, was coming to the Ukraine.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.400]  What was she looking for?
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.840]  A couple words on the Woodward Book and McMaster's response to President Trump that I'm a Russian
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.160]  propaganda or this article was part of Russian propaganda.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:27.960]  First of all, I was never even reached out by anybody, no any authorities in U.S. or
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.240]  here in Ukraine to talk about this issue.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.400]  And what I was telling you about what Chalupa told me in that meeting, it was total interference
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:40.680]  within elections, asking the foreign government to help and have to find dirt on one of the
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.280]  presidential candidates at that time, Donald Trump.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.480]  We're going to have more about that, we got to take a quick break, but more about that,
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.720]  he saw what was going on and he said, this is very dangerous, it's highly illegal, I'm
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.640]  not going to be a part of it, and got out of that and blew the whistle on it and he's
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.000]  now paying the price, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.520]  Want revenge on the common house fly?

[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.560]  sponsors since the day I got on air, and over the years, I learned a lot about water
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.560]  filtration.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560]  I learned what the best was.

[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.400]  going to sell out very, very quickly.

[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:23.400]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:26.400]  And now your host, David Knight.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.400]  Welcome back.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:36.760]  I'm David Knight, and we're talking to Andrei Talashenko, someone who worked at high levels
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.000]  in the Ukrainian diplomatic corps.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.600]  He was there when Andrei Chalupa was trying to get information to help rig the election
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]  against President Trump.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:53.200]  But as we've been talking about in the last couple of segments, at this particular time,
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:00.120]  as things are so desperate in Ukraine economically, and of course, because of the bad economic
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.120]  situation there, the president is not in a good situation.
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.560]  The Ukrainian president is now at an 8% approval rating.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.160]  They have elections coming up in a couple of months by declaring martial law.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.960]  He's now been able to delay these elections for another six months.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.560]  Now they've been demanding sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, and yet, as Andrei has
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.160]  pointed out to Newsweek and other places, it is counterproductive for the Ukrainian government
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.960]  to be increasing trade with the Russians as they call on everybody else to do sanctions.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.640]  As they've had a lot of fighting in the border, and people have really haven't paid any attention
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.320]  to that in the past, at the moment, even though things are tense, there is no fighting, no
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.800]  incursion that's going on.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.400]  And yet they are trying to build this up as if there is an imminent invasion, while,
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.880]  at the same time, putting pressure on President Trump not to talk to Putin at the G20 and
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:57.920]  try to defuse this in a situation that could be very productive.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.360]  It apparently looks like people want to, the president wants to delay this election.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.920]  They want to escalate war.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.200]  There's other things involved as well, the pipeline there.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:16.000]  But I want to go back to what Andrei Telushenko saw in the 2016 election as we had the DNC
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  operative, the Ukrainian-American Alexandra Chalupa, go to the Ukraine.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.040]  Andrei, what did you witness firsthand?
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  What was she trying to do?
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:31.080]  What was she asking when she came to the Ukraine and was talking to people there about getting
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.640]  information about President Trump, about Paul Manafort?
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:39.520]  First, as I said, I first met her end of March, beginning of April 2016.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.240]  I was at the embassy in Ukraine in Washington overseeing the elections process.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.800]  It's a normal procedure.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:53.240]  But when I met her with her, which I was introduced by DC Alexander Shudard, the right-hand man
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:36:00.080]  of Ambassador Charlie, Chalupa asked me to get fine dirt on presidential candidate Donald
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:06.720]  Trump because I used to work with the prosecutor's office before and I had contacts in the security
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.720]  service of Ukraine, which maybe she thought I would be more helpful.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.320]  Unfortunately, after that meeting with Alexander Chalupa, I started investigating and negotiating
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.600]  with, talking to Ambassador Charlie that what are we doing?
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.840]  Is this just a one-time meeting or were there were works done before by Chalupa in Ukraine
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:26.960]  or at the embassy?
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.440]  And he told me that they talked to her pretty often, she's at the embassy every week.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:36.600]  And she even went to Ukraine trying to look and find dirt on President candidate Donald
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.880]  Trump, which she even told me they wanted to take him off the elections in October,
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.600]  September, 2016, through a committee in Congress.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.880]  And that's what she was trying to prepare all that information on.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:55.120]  For me, that was a total shock because as a foreign government, that's illegal to interfere
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:00.240]  not only, not illegally politically, but also illegal to interfere in elections.
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.440]  And I got into a big dispute with the embassy and our government and I had to leave, I left
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.400]  on my own, went back to Ukraine and tried to push this issue through unofficial channels,
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.720]  but I was not heard.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:17.520]  And before the elections, I was talked to political journalists and that's when I revealed
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.400]  the story publicly, which there's more to it, but I don't want to talk to it without
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.760]  any authorities involved because there's more to it and there's not only Senator Lupa
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.720]  Chowley, there's more government officials from Ukraine involved in this story.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.240]  And that's the key thing.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.240]  This story has been buried.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.840]  And I think President Trump, even though he understands, because a little bit of this
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.440]  has been reported by Politico and some other sources, he hasn't really seen the full extent
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  of this.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:50.000]  I think that we understand that Master and other people in the Trump administration have
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.720]  been very effective in terms of hiding information from him.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.320]  I would even say, go so far as to say, he's been gaslighted on a lot of this stuff, been
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.880]  given misinformation about a lot of this.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.320]  You saw this firsthand.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.920]  You pulled back from this because you realized that it was illegal, it was unethical.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.600]  And you became a whistleblower.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.920]  And as we typically see, whistleblowers become the targets of investigation.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.240]  Whenever you expose criminal activity, the criminal activity, it doesn't stop.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.480]  When the activity comes after the criminals, the system typically comes after you.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.120]  What happened to you as you exposed this information?
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.800]  Basically, I was not even talked to or investigated.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.400]  I know a lot of people do too.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:36.400]  My line of work at the embassy of the United States here in Kiev, which, no, I tried to
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.160]  reach out to them to say, we don't want to talk about this topic at all because there's
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.800]  an FBI office in every embassy in the United States around the world.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.160]  And they basically blocked me and they started to block me through my line of work.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:54.080]  And the president and his team, Poroshenko's team, tried to block my contacts.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.200]  They tried to threaten people who I work with.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.800]  But I was never investigated, nor in US, nor in Kiev.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.280]  And I know a lot of people in Washington also do my line of work from the Democratic
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.080]  Party, the Republican Party.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.240]  Nobody would want to listen to this because they tried to portray me as a Russian spy,
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:17.280]  which I'm not because the last time I was in Russia was 2006, as I believe I was still
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.880]  a student.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.680]  And after this, I'm actually not able to go to Russia because I'm really good contacts
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:29.400]  with Boris himself who passed away, as we know, a couple of years ago and who was killed.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.880]  And after this, I could not go to Russia because I would be imprisoned or not be in a lot of
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.880]  the war.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.960]  Well, it's gotten to the point where anybody that opposes the narrative of the Democrats
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.640]  or the establishment is accused of being a Russian agent.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.920]  If you are talking on Twitter, they immediately accuse you of being a Russian bot.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:52.600]  They have the DNC, passes your name to Twitter, and Twitter takes you off of suspends or bans
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.600]  your account.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.840]  I mean, this is the kind of repression that we're now seeing, and I think it'd be very
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.760]  important for President Trump, people in his administration, to find out what you have
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760]  to say.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.920]  That's the amazing thing to me about it, is that the press is not that interested in
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:11.520]  general in your story, and that there's not any investigation even coming from the Trump
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.800]  side to find out what the DNC was doing there.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.920]  Tell us a little bit.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.400]  Did you see anything about the Steele dossier or find out what Chalupa was doing, any involvement
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.080]  there with the Steele dossier?
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.840]  Yeah, before also the Steele dossier, I just want to say that the example of Ukrainian
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.120]  interference in the election, it was not only with the Chalupas, which probably was
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:37.040]  partly, partially, is the Black Ledger book, which came from Ukraine, and which got Paul
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.480]  Manafort in prison, as we know right now.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.840]  This is a great example, and it's still not being talked about Ukrainian interference
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.840]  in the election.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.280]  My part is just a part of it.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.160]  The Steele dossier itself, from the sources I know and people I know who were part of
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:41:01.520]  writing it, who worked for Orbus, they had to write false statements in 2016 and 2015
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.720]  while working for Orbus, and they didn't know it was going to be the Steele dossier, they
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.400]  didn't know it was going to be against presidential candidate or the president after he gets elected.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.720]  They're just paid to write fake articles and fake data, which now is being used at the
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720]  Steele dossier.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:23.200]  And I think after meeting Alexander Chalupa, her involvement in this is probably a big
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.200]  part.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.740]  And we talk about what they did to Paul Manafort, of course, the Podestas were also there.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:36.200]  They were also working with the previous corrupt administration there in the Ukraine.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:40.200]  And a lot of people said at the time, they said, well, if they come after Manafort, they're
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:43.760]  going to have to come after the Podestas and probably a lot of people who are K Street
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.760]  lobbyists.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.600]  And yet that never seems to happen.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:52.000]  We have an amazing double standard that continues to go on and on and on.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.720]  That's the most amazing thing to me about it.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:56.520]  But also the fact that, as you just pointed out, with the Steele dossier, they've got
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:00.320]  a crew there that is just writing fiction.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.840]  And they can, I guess, fill in the blank of whoever they want to attach this fiction
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.520]  to at a later date, right?
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:12.120]  Yeah, that's the big part of it, and nobody wants to hear it from both sides, nor the
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.240]  Democrats, nor the Republicans in Washington.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.240]  This is what amazes me.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.880]  I don't want to interfere in anybody's lives, my life was interfered in, and I had to leave
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:22.880]  because of all this.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.280]  I waited, and after the article came out for a year, I didn't talk about it publicly.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.240]  But then when I started to get political pressure, I started talking about it more and more until
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:37.160]  the point I had to leave the country, and still nobody wants to hear it, at least investigate
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.160]  what happened.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.160]  Maybe if I'm true or not, but investigate, I'm open.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.200]  Well, we want to hear about it, and hopefully this will get some other people interested
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.200]  in it as well.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.800]  Your story needs to be told, people need to start looking at both sides of this and do
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]  an honest investigation.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.200]  That's all we're asking for.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.760]  People want to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth, find out what's going
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.440]  on before we have a war there as well.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:03.520]  All over the world, a rain of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.520]  media, big mega corporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:14.240]  Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down loyal Americans and other loyal
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.240]  nationalists.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.040]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.760]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas, all of you remember that without you supporting
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.960]  InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.

[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  been incredible.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.360]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.600]  of the Deep Earth Crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:41.080]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:47.120]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.560]  it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible

[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:29.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.200]  Welcome back as we're talking to Andre Coloschenko about what has happened to him as he blew
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:41.600]  the whistle on criminal activity between the Ukrainian government and the Democrat Party.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.320]  We just had news of a raid reported by Daily Caller against a whistleblower here in the
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.320]  United States.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:54.920]  16 FBI agents raided the home of a whistleblower, acknowledged working for the Department of
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:48:00.720]  Justice this whistleblower, Dennis Nathan, had already given these documents to Inspector
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.600]  General Horowitz, both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees as well.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:13.120]  But over a dozen FBI agents got into his home, went through it for over six hours, even though
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.320]  as I said, he'd already given these documents to the proper channels.
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.600]  He was already acknowledged as a whistleblower by them.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:27.080]  His lawyer said the Bureau raided my client to seize what he legally gave Congress about
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.200]  the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.680]  He said it is an outrageous disregard of whistleblower protections.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.280]  I'm not sure that there is much in terms of whistleblower protection.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.680]  Yeah, there's laws that are supposed to protect whistleblowers.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.040]  You know, there's laws that are supposed to protect us as well, things like the Bill
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.680]  of Rights, but it doesn't seem like they are paid much attention to anymore.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:55.040]  President Trump, I think it was two days ago, as they talk was escalating about charges
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:01.840]  and counter charges and so forth in the wake of Cohen talking, said I've got a lot of information
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:02.840]  I can dump.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.760]  Well, it's really bad.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.560]  I don't think I should dump all this because I don't know the American public can handle
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.560]  it.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:10.560]  No, we can handle it, President Trump.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:20.280]  What we can't handle is a government that acts like Stalin or the Stasi or some kind
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:25.080]  of Kafkaist dystopian police state.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:29.120]  We do not need to have everything hidden from the American people.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:33.720]  As a matter of fact, that's the one thing the American people cannot handle because
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.320]  that is destroying the entire credibility of the government.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.080]  I don't understand why people, including President Trump, can't see this.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.360]  You need to reveal all this information, declassify this, put this out, the sooner the better.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:52.840]  He was told that basically people said his lawyer advised him that he should hold on
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.120]  to this information for a while.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.200]  I don't agree with that.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.840]  Maybe that's to his political advantage and maybe that's a calculus of his lawyer.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.800]  You could argue whether that is to his political advantage or not.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:10.840]  But at some point, we're going to start looking what's in the interest of America.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:16.200]  And to have this deep state being able to operate, commit crimes, never have them exposed.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:20.840]  And to intimidate and to harass whistleblowers like this, as they said, the FBI agents raid
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:24.760]  the home of a recognized Department of Justice whistleblower, this is reported by the Daily
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.760]  Caller.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:29.920]  They have the exclusive on this, who privately delivered documents pertaining to the Clinton
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:35.800]  Foundation and Uranium One to a government watchdog, according to whistleblowers attorney.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.040]  The Justice Department's Inspector General was informed that the documents showed that
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.800]  federal officials failed to investigate potential criminal activity regarding former Secretary
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:50.880]  of State Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and Rosatom, the Russian company that purchased
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:57.000]  Uranium One, a document reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation, alleges.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:03.920]  The delivered documents also show that then FBI Director Robert Mueller failed to investigate
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:08.200]  allegations of criminal misconduct pertaining to Rosatom and to other Russian government
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.000]  entities attached to Uranium One.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.480]  We know all this, but these are the documents.
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.300]  And now they're harassing this individual.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.000]  We know these people were all involved in this.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.760]  We know that there was a pay for play.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:25.080]  We have Bill Clinton as this is happening, getting a half million dollar speech to the
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:28.480]  Russians and so forth, and yet none of this is investigated.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.160]  When you have a whistleblower that comes up with this, and then you have him still being
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:36.680]  harassed by the corrupt Department of Justice and the FBI, President Trump, we know it's
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.680]  bad.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.560]  And it's only going to get worse if we don't shine the light on these cockroaches.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.720]  They're just multiplying.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:51.520]  You know, when you don't purge the bad actors out of this, any system will have bad people
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.520]  in it.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.400]  As long as you've got people that make up a system, you're going to have some bad actors
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.720]  in there.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:03.000]  And the question is, as Frank Serpico has said so many times, regardless of what this
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.240]  is, whether it's the police in the local police station, whether it's the Department
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:14.680]  of Justice or the FBI, whatever it is, CIA, if you don't purge out the bad people, if
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:19.280]  you embrace that, then the entire institution becomes corrupt.
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:21.760]  And that's really what has happened with our federal government.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:29.320]  We've also had news, before we change topic here and get into something else, I wanted
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:36.040]  to talk about Second Amendment issues that are there, as well as a Supreme Court argument
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:41.800]  that shows that the government has absolutely no respect for due process.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:48.160]  They have no respect for excessive fine protections that are in the Bill of Rights.
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.720]  It's amazing, back and forth, in the Supreme Court that came out on Wednesday, that's
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.760]  just been reported by the New America.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.600]  Most people don't really care that government officials say they can confiscate your car
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:05.120]  if you're going more than five miles over the speed limit.
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.240]  Is that an excessive punishment?
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:10.600]  Do you get due process, even, or no, they just take your car.
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.560]  That's what civil asset forfeiture is really about.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:15.640]  So just take all the drug stuff out of the equation.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.560]  That's really the principle that's involved here.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.640]  Before we get to all that, I just want to tell you about an earthquake that has been
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.640]  reported.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:33.640]  It's been reported anywhere from 6.6 magnitude to 7.0, just outside of Anchorage, Alaska.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:39.040]  AP reported it as 6.6 to 6.7 magnitude.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.320]  The US Geological Survey has reported as a 7.0.
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:47.560]  That's a big difference because, of course, this is a logarithmic scale.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:56.040]  They have issued a tsunami warning for southern Alaska coastal areas of Cook's Inlet.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:59.560]  So they're concerned about secondary effects of that.
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:04.200]  No other information at this time about that earthquake.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.720]  And before we get into other news, I just want to remind you of our Cyber Week specials

[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:17.160]  And again, free shipping store-wide as part of our Cyber Week specials.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:26.400]  Let's talk a little bit about this situation with the Supreme Court and the questioning
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.520]  going back and forth between Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and the Indiana Solicitor
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520]  General.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:39.040]  Now, at the center of this, yes, there is a drug charge.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:47.480]  However, the person's property was confiscated as it is so frequently done without a conviction.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.920]  As a matter of fact, when we look at civil asset forfeiture, not this particular person's
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:59.240]  case, but civil asset forfeiture in general, in many cases, a charge is never even brought
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:01.760]  against an individual.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.440]  What they do is they bring the charge against the property.
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.840]  They call this rim jurisdiction.
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.320]  This is what, when we talk about the back and forth going on between the two lawyers
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:17.720]  here at the Supreme Court, they talk about rim jurisdiction.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:23.560]  That is defined as something that is against the thing.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.760]  So you'll see in these civil asset forfeiture cases, you'll see this legal fiction, the
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:35.680]  United States government versus $9,000 cash, as if the $9,000 cash committed a crime.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.400]  Or the U.S. government versus Learjet serial number, blah, blah, blah.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:41.120]  That was one of the earliest cases that I saw.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:49.480]  It was a guy who had a charter service, he had a charter plane, he picked up two executives.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.640]  They just had briefcases.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.640]  They're wearing suits.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:55.880]  He flew them from the U.S. to Canada for a business meeting and then he flew them back.
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.960]  He landed the plane, he had the DEA surround the plane.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:02.640]  They arrested these two individuals and he's like, what's going on?
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:08.280]  They said, they were talking about a drug deal when they went to Canada and we got the evidence
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.280]  on them.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.120]  So we're arresting them and charging them and we're taking your plane.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.120]  He goes, what are you talking about?
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:15.440]  He goes, well, we know that you didn't have anything to do with this.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:19.000]  But your plane was involved in the commission of this act.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.840]  And so we're going to take your plane.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.720]  Now that was that guy's entire business.
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:27.280]  They just confiscated it because of that tangential involvement there.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:29.080]  He had to fight them in court.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.320]  He had to sue them in court and he had to prove that he was innocent and it bankrupted
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  him.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.360]  Took him out of business for a couple of years.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.120]  But most people don't have the resources to do that because typically they come against
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.480]  poor people doing this type of thing.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:46.800]  But they're destroying all of our rights and will give the amazing back and forth when
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.800]  we come back.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:48.800]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:53.880]  We're launching its newest product, we're really, really proud of it, it's a best source
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:58:01.120]  prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits

[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.200]  and so much more.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:12.920]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture for a life as well as
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.120]  myco ZX that targets the yeast, the mold and the funguses in the gut.

[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:22.880]  other products.

[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:31.040]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.

[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:42.320]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.840]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:55.720]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.840]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:01.520]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:05.880]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:11.960]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.360]  from us as individuals.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:19.200]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.000]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.400]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.800]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:27.640]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.440]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:34.360]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.360]  to control everyone.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.360]  It's The David Knight Show.
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:44.360]  I've never missed your show, any day, and I mean, what?
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.360]  I mean, never.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:51.360]  EditForce.com forward slash show.
[01:59:51.360 --> 02:00:19.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:25.360]  So can the government seize your car for driving five miles per hour over the speed limit?
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:31.360]  Well, the Indiana Solicitor General told the Supreme Court, yes.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:38.360]  Now, without getting into the specifics of this case, because we've talked many times,
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:44.360]  I've talked on my program as well as on this program, about how obscene it is that the
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:50.000]  federal government would charge inanimate objects with crimes just so that it can steal.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.840]  Folks, this is nothing other than highway robbery, in most cases, it's cars.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:02.720]  And in a lot of jurisdictions where they do this outside of Detroit, for example, most
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:08.960]  of the cars that they're taking are around $1,000 because even if you come after them,
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:16.200]  you have to file a $900 fee in order to challenge them because you don't get any due process.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.720]  They don't have to prove that you're guilty.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.120]  They don't even charge you with a crime, they just take your stuff, and then you have to
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:25.560]  come back and prove that your stuff didn't do anything.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:30.440]  This is the insanity that they've created for us when they put charges against the thing.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.320]  That's what they call when this rem jurisdiction.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:40.520]  The idea that the property is the primary object of the action rather than the person
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:43.440]  that owns the property.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.120]  This is just absolute insanity, it's like something out of a Kafka novel, and yet this
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.720]  is the way our government operates right now.
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:59.600]  Century and a half ago, we had Lysander Spooner say the difference between the government
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:05.480]  and a highway robber is that a highway robber just steals your purse and then leaves you
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.480]  alone.
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:09.480]  The government steals your purse and then follows you down the road nagging you.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:15.520]  Well, no, they take everything now and they still nag you.
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:20.000]  Things really haven't changed, but the highway robbery has gotten much, much worse because
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.400]  it has become a very, very lucrative business.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:28.720]  And Lysander Spooner's day, they didn't have anything like civil asset forfeiture.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.320]  What he was talking about was more of a metaphor, but it has quite literally become true.
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:37.280]  The government has quite literally become highway robbers.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.680]  And so in this particular case, it is not a cheap car.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:53.400]  It was a $42,000 land rover that was purchased with money that this individual inherited.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:54.480]  He had a drug problem.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:00.920]  He also purchased drugs with this particular, with the money that he inherited.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:05.960]  And he also sold some drugs to some undercover officers.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:14.360]  He sold $500 worth of drugs and so they confiscated his $42,000 land rover.
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.760]  Now a lot of you, if you think that the Warren drugs is going to save people from addiction
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:25.320]  in spite of 47 years of experience to the contrary, you would say, well, he violated
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:26.320]  the law.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.320]  He was selling drugs.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:28.320]  So yeah, penalize him.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:34.240]  Well, the problem is that he wasn't convicted of anything at the time they took his property.
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:37.720]  And there's also an issue of excessive punishment.
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:40.800]  But if we talk about excessive punishment, and that's really where Justice Breyer was
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:43.960]  going, here's how the dialogue kind of unfolded here.
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:46.160]  I'll read you just a little bit of what he had to say.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:52.760]  He asks Mr. Fisher, who is the representative, let's see, he is a solicitor general.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.480]  That's his title for Indiana, the state of Indiana.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.160]  Justice Breyer says, so what is to happen if a state that needs revenue says that anyone
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.240]  who speeds has to forfeit the Bugatti, the Mercedes, or the Special Ferrari, or even
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:09.320]  a Jalopy?
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.640]  And Mr. Fisher comes back and says, well, I think it's important to remember that there
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:17.240]  is a constitutional limit, which is the proof of instrumentality.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.200]  Now, there is nothing like that in the Constitution.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.480]  This is something that has been invented just like this rim jurisdiction that he's going
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.160]  to be talking about, folks.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:32.760]  This is just pure legal BS pretending that they have some kind of a law or a system that
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:40.480]  they're following, so that they can undermine the clear statement of protection of our rights
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.640]  that's outlined in the Constitution.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:48.400]  It is a legal fiction, it is maneuvering, and basically Justice Breyer calls him on it.
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:56.640]  I'll have the rest of this one come back, say with us.

[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:26.480]  Do you really have any rights?
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:33.840]  There's a back and forth between Justice Breyer and the Solicitor General for Indiana, Mr.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:34.840]  Fisher.
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:41.600]  He's doing a civil assets forfeiture case, and in the questioning, Justice Breyer led
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:46.440]  him down the path and got him to admit that, yes, he would confiscate your car, no matter
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:53.120]  the value if it was a Jalopy or if it was a Bugatti that maybe cost a million dollars.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.320]  They would confiscate your car if you're going, they would have the right to confiscate
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:59.360]  it if you're going more than five miles over the speed limit, for example, because you
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:02.840]  violated the law, right?
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:08.280]  You don't have to find you guilty of anything, it was the car that was violating the law.
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:13.640]  That car was going five miles over the speed limit.
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:16.320]  This is where we're headed, folks.
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:19.720]  We have no rights and you own nothing.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:24.480]  You are nothing but a slave, you're their property, you're their livestock.
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.760]  And so as he's questioning him, he goes, so you could take it for speeding, right?
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.640]  He goes, well, I think it's important to remember that there is a constitutional limit,
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.920]  because the lawyer from Indiana, he says, which is the proof of instrumentality?
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:39.480]  And Justice Breyer says, well, that isn't a problem, because the Bugatti that he was
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:40.480]  in was speeding.
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:42.120]  And he goes, yeah, right.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:45.240]  And he goes, so there's your nexus right there for your instrumentality.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:49.520]  And he goes, well, historically, he goes, now, I just wonder, what is it?
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:50.520]  What is it?
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:54.160]  Is that permissible under the Constitution?
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:59.560]  And the Solicitor General from Indiana says, to forfeit the Bugatti for speeding?
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:01.080]  And Justice Breyer says, yeah.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:07.040]  And by the way, it was only five miles an hour over the speed limit.
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:13.040]  And then the Inspector General for Indiana says, yeah.
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:14.520]  And he says, well, you know, the answer is yes.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:20.120]  And I would call your attention to Justice Breyer says, is it yes?
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:23.480]  And Mr. Fisher says, yes, it is forfeitable.
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:26.760]  Justice Breyer says, it's forfeitable?
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:29.040]  And Fisher from Indiana says, yeah.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:36.080]  The Louisa Barber case, one person over the passenger limit and the entire ship is forfeit.
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.320]  This is history.
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:41.680]  History shows us this in rim forfeiture.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.120]  And Justice Breyer says, so if the airplane is speeding, and Mr. Fisher from Indiana
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:53.880]  says, well, and rim forfeitures have always been with us, and they have always been harsh,
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:54.880]  harsh.
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:57.000]  They have always been excessive.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.160]  And so he goes back and he quotes a case where, evidently, somebody lost their entire
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:06.040]  ship because they had one person over the passenger limit.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.560]  You know, I kind of came close to experiencing this after I graduated from high school.
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:16.120]  A bunch of my friends and I went down to the John Penicamp State Park down in the Keys.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:19.080]  We were going to go snorkeling and scuba diving.
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:22.680]  I had some scuba equipment, some of the other guys were going to go snorkeling.
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:28.080]  We rented, we kind of broke up, we were doing different things, and a couple of guys went
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:32.320]  to rent the boat and they met the rest of us.
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:36.480]  And I forget how many of us there was, but it wasn't that excessive.
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.480]  We had one person more than we had a life jacket.
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:47.480]  We got stopped by a park official, I guess, because it was an underwater state park.
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:49.360]  He wanted to know how many life jackets we had.
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:53.160]  He had enough life jackets if you counted my buoyancy compensator, but he didn't want
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:54.480]  to count that.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.440]  It wasn't an official life jacket.
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:03.880]  And so what they did was they officially confiscated our rental.
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.520]  We didn't own the boat, but they made us take it back.
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:13.600]  And he said, well, you got to return this and tell these guys, go back and get another
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.600]  life jacket or whatever.
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.040]  He knew that they weren't going to let the guys take it back out again.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:23.680]  And so a couple of us didn't want to take the trip back, so we hopped overboard and
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:24.880]  we swam over to an island.
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:28.000]  We waited for the other guys to come back and pick us up.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.720]  And they didn't come, and they didn't come, and finally the law enforcement officer came
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:34.720]  back.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.040]  He was very upset with us.
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:42.720]  He had put my friend who had rented this thing in jail and had come back and picked
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:43.720]  us up.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:45.880]  And he said, I knew they weren't going to let you take this thing back out again.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.840]  Basically, they confiscated our money because we'd spent all of our money in renting that
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:51.840]  boat for the day.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.120]  We just had graduated high school.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:55.520]  We didn't have that much money.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.120]  And I said, I knew they weren't going to let you guys take this back out again.
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:00.800]  But we were one person over the limit.
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:07.040]  So evidently, there was a case where they confiscated an entire ship, forfeited it, because that
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.160]  ship had committed a crime.
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.840]  This is the kind of insanity that we're letting them get away with.
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:14.840]  It isn't going to stop there.
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:16.040]  I mean, here's some more insanity.
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:21.860]  You don't think that a 163% meat tax could be coming?
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:26.200]  This is a story coming out of DC clothesline and others talking about this.
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:27.200]  Think about this, folks.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:35.520]  If you get a $5 hamburger, and they put a 163% tax on it, which is what's been proposed
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.020]  by a study coming out of the University of Oxford.
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:41.360]  So you have a $5 hamburger.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.600]  They put a 163% tax on it.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:51.560]  That means for that $5 hamburger, you got an $8.15 tax.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:59.000]  And so your total hamburger then goes from $5 to $13.15.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.040]  And as they point out the DC clothesline, you think this isn't going to happen?
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:08.680]  Remember, when smoking was the only socially engineered target, then they came after fat,
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.240]  then they came after sugar, then caffeine, then soda, now they're coming after meat.
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:19.800]  You know when this came out, and they started coming after cigarettes really hard back in
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.360]  the late 80s, and it's working with libertarians, and we started telling people, you know they're
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:30.680]  going to come through your kitchen, and they're going to tell you can't have sugar and things
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.680]  like that.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.680]  They're going to put a tax on that people.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.000]  Oh, come on, you stupid conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.560]  You're taking this to the extreme.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:40.120]  Nobody is ever going to tell you can't have sugar.
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.640]  Well, we've seen how that works in New York and elsewhere.
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:50.800]  So they've decided that according to these people at the University of Oxford, they
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.000]  actually came up with optimal tax rates for things.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:00.280]  For red meat, maybe they'll only give you a 34% tax.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:06.840]  If it's a processed meat, things like sausage and bacon and salami, things like that, they
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:13.440]  propose for the United States at least to tax people 163%.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:22.040]  And then they come out and say, well, that could save 52,500 American lives per year.
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.920]  Same way that by taking away your cars and making you all ride in electric golf carts
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.120]  that are tracked and taxed every inch by the federal government, they're going to save
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:32.120]  50,000 lives a year there as well.
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:37.000]  It's always 50,000 lives you're going to save everywhere.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.120]  But of course, it only costs you all of your freedom.
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.560]  This is the way they justify this.
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.840]  But if they can take any property of yours, again, without ever even charging with a crime,
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:52.800]  if they can take a million-dollar car, that was the case that the Supreme Court Justice
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:59.120]  offered to the Solicitor General of Indiana, said, so somebody's got a million-dollar car
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:02.360]  and he's driving five miles per hour over the speed limit, the guy says, yeah, that
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:03.360]  would be okay.
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.720]  Yeah, we can take airplanes, we can take ships, we can take it, because they commit crimes.
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:15.440]  And they call it civil folks because it is a rule, not a law.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:20.560]  It is a rule that was passed by bureaucrats that are not elected by you.
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:26.120]  So it's kind of a taxation without representation, it's also a regulation without representation.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:32.600]  And by saying that it is a regulation and saying that it is civil, you don't have a
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.960]  presumption of innocence, just like they use that same kind of maneuvering to say that
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:41.080]  the IRS doesn't have to give you due process.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:46.160]  The IRS can say, we assess you this amount of tax and you're going to have to sue us
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.600]  in court and prove that you're innocent.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.000]  Now, it was outrageous when the IRS did that.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.720]  Now we've got all the government bureaucracies doing that and assessing any level of penalty
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:55.720]  that they wish.
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:00.720]  They were in the FAA, said we're going to charge people a $25,000 fine if they don't
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:04.800]  register their little micro drones with us.
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.560]  Now they eventually backed down from that as people pushed back against it.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:13.200]  But again, these people can make any kind of mandate or dictate that they wish these
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:15.880]  unelected bureaucrats in Washington.
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:19.520]  They can then enforce that against people.
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:22.920]  And you don't have the presumption of innocence, you don't have protection against excessive
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:23.920]  fines.
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:28.080]  I don't know if this is going to stand in the Supreme Court or not.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:29.800]  Why are we standing for this?
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:31.080]  I really don't understand.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:32.600]  How much longer is this going to go on?
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:34.720]  It's been going on for decades.
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:37.680]  This was enacted in the Reagan administration.
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:40.680]  And a lot of people have talked about this in a lot of different areas.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:42.960]  Of course, Jeff Sessions is all for it.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.680]  Thankfully, he's gone now.
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:46.760]  But President Trump needs to wake up.
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:48.800]  Actually, the American people need to wake up.
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:51.120]  It's coming against us.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:57.080]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.360]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:04.280]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:11.080]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.080]  There is.
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.080]  It's rightsocial.net.

[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:06.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.440]  Welcome back.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:35.520]  You know we've had an earthquake just outside of Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:40.400]  It's been reported anywhere from 6.6, 6.7 I think is what AP reported.
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:47.880]  The US Geological Service reported it as a 7.0, put out a tsunami warning.
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:52.880]  Not really sure which report is more accurate or up to date, nevertheless it's a fairly
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:57.200]  large earthquake at that size.
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:02.800]  And it comes as there was an interesting article, it was up on the Drudge Report, picked up
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:10.800]  by several sources about a worldwide tremor that moved an island a couple of inches in
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:14.640]  one direction and a couple of inches in another direction.
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:19.680]  And the strange thing about this tremor, it wasn't noticed by most people, it was a small
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:28.680]  island between Madagascar, Mozambique, on November the 11th that had the movement.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:34.680]  They said it slid 2.4 inches to the east and 1.2 inches to the south.
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:40.680]  This report from November 12th from the French government, this small island of Mayotte,
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.960]  I guess is the way it pronounced this.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:49.640]  But the strange thing was, as National Geographic says, it was strange for a number of reasons
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:56.040]  but not only did this small tremor move it, but it was also the nature of the tremor.
[02:21:56.040 --> 02:22:02.800]  They said first it rang at just a single ultra low frequency, like a well-tuned bell.
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:06.520]  Seismic waves, when you typically have an earthquake or something like we just had today
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:12.600]  in Anchorage, Alaska, usually involve a lot of different frequencies.
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:16.560]  And we've seen this type of thing before, secondly they said the wave emerged and circled
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:21.640]  the entire planet without the usual signs of an earthquake.
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:22.640]  So very, very strange.
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:28.320]  And again, it appeared because it only had a single ultra low frequency.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:33.120]  They said, well, it looks like perhaps it is man-made, something like that.
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:34.280]  We've seen this in the past.
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:43.000]  Again, remember when we had those earthquakes, I think it was, was it 2011, I think?
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.680]  I think it was before I came here to Info Wars, just before I came here.
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:52.480]  We had the East Coast earthquake that was really strange just outside of Washington,
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:56.080]  D.C., and it went up the East Coast.
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:57.480]  And it was strange for a number of reasons.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:59.240]  It was strange because of the depth.
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:06.240]  It was only about a 5.0 on the Richter scale, which was about the amount that you usually
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:10.240]  see for an underground explosion.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:14.040]  And then it was like a week or two weeks later.
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:16.720]  I'm just going from memory now, I can't remember exactly.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:25.200]  There was another one in Colorado, not too far from Denver, another underground earthquake
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.680]  about the same magnitude, and it also had the same seismic envelope.
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:32.640]  And it was different from a natural earthquake.
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:34.040]  Now this particular one was unusual.
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:37.800]  I've never heard of this before, where you have just a single ultra low frequency instead
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:40.680]  of a broad spectrum like you would have with a natural event.
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:47.160]  The other thing about a natural event is other than the frequencies present is the envelope.
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:53.920]  Typically with an underground explosion like a nuclear detonation, you see an impulse.
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:58.840]  Whereas with a natural earthquake, you see a gradual ramping up.
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:04.920]  You see a sustained buildup, and then it comes down, it isn't just an immediate impulse if
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:08.440]  you look at the waveform.
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:16.280]  Now what we saw with those earthquakes that happened in Washington and in D.C. were spikes
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:18.640]  that looked like a man-made situation.
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:22.320]  The magnitude of it was about what you would expect from an underground nuclear explosion
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.320]  as well.
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:30.680]  It did not have that envelope, but this is another unusual thing that I don't think anybody
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:33.560]  that is reporting on this says that they have seen before.
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:38.760]  When we look at this type of thing, it was a couple of weeks ago I was talking to Richard
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:43.400]  Sacks of Lost Arts Radio about the fires out in California.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:50.360]  A lot of people have pointed out the possible connections and involvement of geoengineering
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:52.880]  in that.
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.400]  Certainly President Trump was right.
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.040]  I've talked about this for years.
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:04.720]  My uncle was a forestry professor, he talked about the changes in forestry management,
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:10.360]  the philosophy that had changed with government management, not removing any deadwood out
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:13.080]  of the forest, whether it's standing or fallen.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:20.720]  The accumulation of firewood that causes any kind of fire to basically be out of control.
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:28.640]  When I went to Oregon, I talked to, in the aftermath of the death of La Voie Finnecombe,
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:34.840]  we were talking to people in that area that they were talking to about land management
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.960]  issues and the mismanagement of the federal government over lands that they claim ownership
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:40.960]  of.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.320]  Of course, they don't have ownership under the Constitution.
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.440]  But they claim ownership of it and they're supposed to be managing it, but they are mismanaging
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:58.240]  it and I talked to a lumberjack whose life savings was invested in land that he had picked
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:25:59.800]  out timberland.
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:04.280]  The mismanagement of the public lands, if you want to call them that, had spilled over
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.760]  and destroyed everything that he had.
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:13.360]  He was talking about how intense the fires build because of all this stored fuel there.
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:19.120]  So President Trump is right and they are contributing with their policies to these fires.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:22.360]  We've seen that same type of thing happen here in Texas.
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:26.480]  But we've also seen droughts and of course that is a big contributing factor.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:30.320]  And there's also chemicals that are on the ground because there's a lot of geoengineering
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:33.680]  that is already happening just in the last week or so.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:39.080]  We have seen reports and I talked about this as well at the beginning of this week, how
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:45.040]  they're now normalizing the idea, they used to pour, let's say, cold water on the idea
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:46.040]  of chemtrails.
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:47.560]  Oh, nobody's doing any of that.
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:51.640]  Even though we had videos, we had whistleblowers talking about how that was their mission,
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:57.520]  we had videos showing specially designed nozzles on special planes that were putting out very
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:04.800]  heavy persistent contrails, if you will, something very different than the usual contrails.
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:08.680]  But of course, they would deny that even as they were having geoengineering conferences
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:10.520]  where they'd say, who's going to set the thermostat?
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:11.520]  How do we decide?
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.960]  I mean, you know, some people, you know, Russia would like to have the world warmer, whereas
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.760]  people that are near the equator, they would like to see a cooler.
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.680]  So who's going to get to set the thermostat?
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:23.640]  And now they're openly talking about this.
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:28.440]  They had, in this month, they had a new study published in Environmental Research Letters,
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:32.880]  talks about how they could do it as if they aren't already doing it.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:36.560]  We've reported for years that they already are doing this.
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:38.760]  Getting droughts in certain areas.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.120]  We had the Skyder Alert program.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:44.840]  It was an app that you could get on your phone.
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.320]  You could take a picture when you saw cross-hatching contrails that were persistent.
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:52.560]  Take a picture of it, and it sends your location to these people.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:55.440]  They started doing crowd sourcing research on this.
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:01.840]  They found that where they would see these cross-hatching patterns of persistent contrails,
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:04.240]  that they would see a rise in the temperature there.
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.520]  So yeah, they can use this to increase the temperature, to manipulate the temperature.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.560]  Now they're saying, you know, we've got an idea.
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:14.360]  We could put up a fleet of 100 planes that make 4,000 worldwide missions per year to
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:18.160]  save the world from climate change.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:22.520]  Now China has already been bragging about the fact that they're doing this.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:29.520]  As a matter of fact, they're bragging about how they used it to modify the weather for
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:30.840]  the Beijing Olympics.
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:36.520]  But while they're doing all this and denying that they're doing any climate modification,
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:40.200]  that they're doing any geoengineering, that they are creating conditions that lead to
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:46.760]  drought, that they are putting down chemicals that are accelerants and pollutants into our
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:48.280]  environment.
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:55.680]  They are out there virtue signaling and saying, you know, climate change is going to be affected
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:56.680]  by national.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:57.680]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.560]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.120]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:05.080]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:08.360]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:10.600]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:11.920]  I can help you too.
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:14.920]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:17.120]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:25.360]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.520]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:31.880]  purest for you and your family.
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:35.640]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on Berkey clean water.
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:40.360]  The Berkey guy has you covered at home, work and on the go with water filtration systems
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:42.400]  of every size for every budget.
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:48.920]  Now GCN listeners receive 10% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN at goberkey.com
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:56.360]  or call 877-886-3653, goberkey.com.
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:02.160]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:05.560]  Obviously water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing and I've had water filtration
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:10.400]  sponsors since the day I got on air and over the years I learned a lot about water filtration,
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:12.000]  I learned what the best was.
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.600]  Now the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons
[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:17.600]  an hour.
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.600]  It's amazing.
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:20.440]  That's not all the bad stuff, it leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:25.240]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:27.280]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:29.000]  He has a glut of them.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.840]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:34.400]  When it's discounted it's $200.
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:35.400]  It's $127.
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:41.480]  He's selling them to us at cost and we're making 27 bucks on them.
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:43.720]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:45.960]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:46.960]  It's amazing.
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:56.600]  This is your pro at m4warslife.com or m4store.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:59.040]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:03.120]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:05.760]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:11.240]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to

[02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:23.040]  with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.

[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:33.360]  and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.120]  brain growth spurts.

[02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:44.280]  refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.

[02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:02.400]  All of the world at rain of censorship is coming in in a perfect storm of dying corporate
[02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:07.400]  media, big mega corporations, authoritarian regimes like communist China and the EU, the
[02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:13.120]  Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down loyal Americans and other loyal
[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:14.120]  nationalists.
[02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:15.920]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:20.640]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas, all of you remember that without you supporting
[02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:22.840]  m4wars financially, we will be shut down.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.000]  We make it easy to do.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.280]  We've got cyber week going right now, extending our big mega sales from Black Friday, wall
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:33.400]  supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements, t-shirts, books, films.
[02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:36.640]  It's all there and it makes the information war possible against the globalist.
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:39.640]  So I want to thank you this Christmas for your support and I want to ask you for your
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.640]  continued support.
[02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:45.200]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off
[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:48.000]  across the board and double-patriot points.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:53.040]  Right now at m4warsstore.com, recall toll-free, triple-A, two-five-three, three-one-three-nine
[02:32:53.040 --> 02:33:16.040]  because when you take action, nothing on Earth can stop you.
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:37.160]  Welcome back, you know, we're talking about the hypocrisy of the Democrats, especially
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:38.840]  when we're talking about what happened at the border.
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:46.120]  We've got a presenter, the co-host, Sonny Poston, I guess is way-pronounced, but I don't
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:47.120]  watch the view.
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:52.560]  I don't know who this person is, but she's co-host of the view on ABC and on Wednesday,
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:56.520]  she said, I don't care what Obama did.
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:59.800]  Trump used tear gas at the border.
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:04.400]  It doesn't matter that Obama did it 80 times or whatever.
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:11.240]  And the conservative press pushes back and, you know, we should push back against this
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:12.240]  kind of hypocrisy.
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:18.320]  You know, I was just talking about the environmentalism in the last segment.
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:19.680]  We've got Legoland.
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:24.920]  This is a place, as Reason Magazine points out, a theme park, but it's dedicated to celebrating
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:30.880]  plastic, plastic toy bricks, Legoland in the U.K., has said that they're no longer going
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:35.680]  to have single-use plastic straws.
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:39.360]  You know, this is the kind of virtue signaling that we see, the kind of hypocrisy.
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:41.920]  But of course, these people out here are saying, we don't care, and obviously we know they
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:42.920]  don't care.
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:47.200]  We know that they don't care that there is a double standard, and we defend that.
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:52.240]  We say, well, that is hypocrisy, and it's right to point out that hypocrisy.
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:57.640]  But at the same time, as I said a couple of days ago, I said, but don't you see a problem
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:02.320]  with that when we double down and say, President Trump is not doing anything that President
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:04.880]  Obama didn't do at the border?
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:07.200]  And that's true in many ways.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:11.040]  I mean, we've got the military there, but they're going to be coming home.
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:13.440]  They're not there actually enforcing the border.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:20.880]  We've got people all over the press in Washington wringing their hands and saying, how dare you
[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:22.760]  use the U.S. military to protect our border?
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:25.720]  You know, it's for empire purposes, right?
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:32.600]  They should be protecting the border between Turkey and Syria, or they should, whatever.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:38.640]  I mean, put them up there in the Kurdish area, but don't have them protect our border.
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:40.240]  Don't have them protect our country.
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:46.000]  They can protect Iraq and Afghanistan, but not our country.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.960]  That's the insanity.
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:54.000]  Nobody ever questions the U.S. military being sent anywhere, of course, in terms of the
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.280]  mainstream media or the people in Washington.
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:02.640]  They never question any directive of the president to send troops anywhere for any reason, except
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:05.800]  at the U.S. border, to protect our country.
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:10.520]  And when we come back and we say, he's okay, he's not doing anything that President Obama
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:12.920]  did, that I think is a problem.
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:15.280]  He needs to do a lot more.
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:19.800]  And I think it shows that we have lost a lot of our resolve when we can't get in their
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:23.400]  face and say that it's not a problem.
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:27.280]  We have to appeal to the fact that President Obama did it.
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:32.720]  We had the Democrats, even though they've now won in the House, they're now $18 million
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:34.240]  in debt already.
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:38.320]  Remember, Hillary Clinton got control of the DNC because they were so heavily in debt.
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:43.000]  She was able to buy them with corrupt winnings that she got out of the Clinton Foundation,
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.200]  wound up owning them, and now they're already in that situation again, right after this
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  election.
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.960]  Yeah, they won, but they are now in debt, and they're going to put all of us in a lot
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.000]  more debt very quickly.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:58.520]  And then we have our new speaker, same as the old speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:00.600]  I pointed out a couple of days ago.
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:05.800]  Let's remember, she's already been caught doing some suspicious trades, buying futures
[02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:14.840]  that are going to expire at the beginning of 2020, and Nancy Pelosi was featured as
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:23.800]  the key person in an exposé back in November 2011 of insider trading.
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:30.560]  They came up with the stock act that was supposed to stop that, they even had the Pelosi provision
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:31.560]  as part of that.
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:35.680]  I mean, she was supposed to child for that thing, and yet she cleverly turned that around
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:38.320]  and complained that the Republicans hadn't done enough.
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:44.480]  Well, a year after they got that passed, they eviscerated it.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:46.360]  That basically didn't apply anymore.
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:48.640]  See, Congress can do insider trading.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:55.760]  The people who can subsidize a particular corporation, or they can target a particular
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:01.480]  corporation, or they can reward or destroy an entire industry, as Barack Obama and Hillary
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:04.320]  Clinton wanted to do, the coal industry.
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:09.640]  Or they can say, we're going to move towards electric cars, or we're going to subsidize
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:15.800]  a cylinder or whatever, these people who have that kind of power can, without any threat
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:23.400]  of criminal prosecution, engage in insider trading, and still can, thanks to Nancy Pelosi.
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:26.640]  And of course, that's where most of her wealth has come from.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:33.160]  And so now as Speaker of the House, she had this to say, I want you to hear what she had,
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:37.600]  because we have a new speaker who really can't speak anymore.
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:43.840]  Here's Nancy Pelosi.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:46.640]  I couldn't be more honored.
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:53.560]  That is a figure of speech, but it's in fact, in this case, as true as any statement anyone
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:39:00.040]  could ever make, to be honored by the nominations of those who place my name in nomination
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:04.720]  and the sport that I have from our colleagues in this caucus.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:12.880]  We will, as I say, our diversity is our strength, but our unity is our power, and we will use
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:17.840]  that power again in a unifying way for our country.
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:19.320]  I'm very proud.
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:21.880]  We look forward to the results, whatever they are.
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:27.680]  They will be intense, and they will be a vote of confidence to send me my name to the floor
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:31.840]  that I'm proud to be the nominee of the House Democratic Caucus.
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:35.520]  There you go, there you go, $18 million in debt already.
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:39.600]  The Democrat Party is, they have a speaker who cannot speak, as President Trump was saying.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.360]  I'd like to see Nancy Pelosi's speaker.
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.480]  That's evidence as to why he would like her to be speaker.
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.760]  And what she does exhibit is a death grip on power.
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:54.360]  She is not going to give it up for any way, shape, or form, folks.
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:57.200]  She said, I'm not going to say when I'm going to leave, because that would put me in the
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:00.760]  position of being a lame duck speaker.
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.720]  Well she is a lame speaker if she's not a lame duck.
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:06.560]  But the Clintons are not really much better.
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:09.720]  And again, they have that death grip on power.
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:14.040]  They've begun, Hillary and Bill have begun their tour.
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:19.800]  They had a problem selling tickets, even though they were going as low as $6.55.
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:27.840]  They were only able to sell 3,300 tickets in an arena that holds $19,800.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:33.200]  They were only able to fill, in other words, 17% of the seats.
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:38.520]  And like Nancy Pelosi, Hillary had a great deal of trouble speaking.
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:40.800]  She had another coughing fit.
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:45.040]  Even as nobody was coughing up money to go here with him speak.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:52.280]  Even Paul Ryan is talking about the bizarre results of the California midterm elections.
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:55.120]  He said, this really just defies logic to me.
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:41:00.960]  And as I look at what he had to say about this, it kind of reminds me of the back and
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:08.520]  forth between Jeff Sessions when he was a senator and Leon Panetta when he was a Secretary
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:10.400]  of State.
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:15.320]  And I'm sorry, not Secretary of Defense, he was talking about whether or not they would
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:19.560]  send troops into Syria without getting the Congress's approval.
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:22.280]  And Leon Panetta is saying, we'll let you know what we decide.
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:23.520]  We'll talk to the UN and NATO.
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:24.720]  We'll decide and let you know.
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:29.480]  And he goes, well, golly, shucks, I can't even believe what you're telling me that.
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:32.440]  You know what the Constitution says, and so we got the same type of thing going on with
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:33.440]  Paul Ryan.
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:35.640]  He says, this just defies logic to me.
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:38.360]  We were only down 26 seats the night of the election.
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:41.560]  Three weeks later, we lost basically every California race.
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:47.480]  This election system they have, I can't begin to understand what ballot harvesting is.
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:52.280]  Of course, he's from Wisconsin, so he doesn't talk like Gomer Pyle, but he acts like Gomer
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:53.280]  Pyle.
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:56.840]  People just go along with this stuff, they don't call it for what it is.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.680]  He says, the way this absentee ballot program used to work, the way it works now, it seems
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:01.680]  pretty loosey-goosey.
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:05.200]  It seems pretty corrupt to me.
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:08.600]  We all understand what's going on, and we all understand that these guys aren't going
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:10.640]  to do anything to fix it.
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.800]  That's the most amazing thing to me is that they're not going to do anything to fix it.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:20.240]  We've got coming up in the next segment, we're going to be talking to Harrison Smith, he's
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:25.440]  up in New York, he's going to give us an update on what's going on with the Laura Lumer protest
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:31.480]  there at Twitter, where she handcuffed herself to the front door of Twitter and refused
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:32.480]  to leave.
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:36.120]  They eventually arrested her, removed her from the site, he's going to give us an update
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:37.120]  on that.
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.720]  He was there on the scene.
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:55.400]  So say with us, we'll be right back, and we'll talk about the first amendment.
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:59.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:04.480]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:06.000]  to detoxify the body.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:10.840]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:16.040]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:19.120]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:21.400]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:25.880]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.560]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:31.560]  get.
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:34.760]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:39.800]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:45.040]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:47.760]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:51.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:55.040]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and in FullWarsLife.com.
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:59.120]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:04.320]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:07.240]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:11.400]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.160]  gone through two permutations.
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:18.280]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:22.880]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:25.040]  nascent iodine, and brought you X2.
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:26.040]  That's been incredible.
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:31.400]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:36.120]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:41.120]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:47.640]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:50.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:51.760]  discovery.
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:56.440]  This is the X3, now available at InfoWordsLive.com.
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:01.440]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:05.760]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:09.440]  corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:13.400]  People say, well, I would just sort of fight with them, because they were already dominating
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:17.800]  and running America into the ground, and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:22.840]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:27.640]  is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:34.040]  if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWords.com,
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:38.960]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:43.240]  We have huge sales at InfoWordsLive.com right now, and we're still able to operate the
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:48.040]  shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:49.040]  block our commerce, and you're right to the market.
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:52.240]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Global will swing
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:53.240]  win.
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:54.240]  This is InfoWords Darker Sour.
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:55.240]  We're your support.
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:56.240]  I'm counting on you.
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:00.520]  I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018, and I
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:04.480]  wanted to thank you for all of your support, and I wanted just to remind you that InfoWords
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:08.000]  isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can, and without you, we won't be here.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.160]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week, and it's happening now
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.160]  at InfoWordsStore.com, the biggest sales ever, as we attempt to sell all the great inventory
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:20.680]  so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:21.680]  next year.
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:24.680]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment and attacks.
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:26.760]  It would take an hour to go over to some of it.
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:31.880]  So right now, at InfoWordsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:37.760]  and the revolution of funding InfoWords that is now in the absolute thick of the battle
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:42.140]  fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all
[02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:44.280]  of our shared futures together.
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:47.920]  InfoWords will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:52.280]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny, and we will fight until the end.
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:54.040]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:59.000]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:26.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:31.020]  Welcome back, we're going to be going to Harrison Smith in New York, our own InfoWords reporter.
[02:47:31.020 --> 02:47:36.940]  He's been covering Laura Loomer's protest for the First Amendment and how it is being
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:39.820]  shut down by these people in social media.
[02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:43.340]  We're going to get an update as to what's going on up there with Laura.
[02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:46.620]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to tell you about some of the specials that we have
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:50.300]  as part of our Cyber Week specials at InfoWordsStore.com.
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:52.620]  You know, we were talking earlier about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:56.540]  If you're noticing that your nose is getting a bit red, maybe it's because you've got
[02:47:56.540 --> 02:48:03.740]  a lot of allergies, dander, asthma, smoke, germs, a lot of things in the home.
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:09.380]  As we shut it up this time of year, trying to keep the house warm, it can be some of
[02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:11.980]  the most polluted air you come across.
[02:48:11.980 --> 02:48:15.540]  We have the answer for that, and we've got it on massive discount right now.
[02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:20.180]  You can save $127 off the Alexa Pure Breeze air purifier.
[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:23.020]  We have them all over the office here.
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:26.220]  These things are wonderful.
[02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:27.220]  They're silent.
[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:28.220]  You don't hear them.
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:29.220]  But they're very, very effective.
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:31.540]  And they're also kind of entertaining to watch.
[02:48:31.540 --> 02:48:35.180]  You can see, if you see that picture there, they've got like a wave at the top that's
[02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:36.860]  lit up.
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:42.780]  It changes color if it detects anything in the environment, and it can also pick up and
[02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:44.580]  start moving there a little bit quicker.
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:46.740]  But even in the highest mode, you don't really hear it.
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:51.780]  It'll change color from blue to on the other extreme red.
[02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:55.220]  And in between, you'll see purple, and that sort of thing is it detects something there.
[02:48:55.220 --> 02:49:00.100]  It removes 99.97% of airborne toxins and contaminants in your home.
[02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:03.060]  Things like dust, pollen, smoke, dander, many other things.
[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:10.580]  It's got a patented ion cluster technology, true HEPA filter system that is 33% more effective
[02:49:10.580 --> 02:49:13.220]  than HEPA type imitators.
[02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:15.060]  And again, I use this in my home.
[02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:16.580]  It's very, very effective.
[02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:19.820]  You can get this as part of the specials that we have at InfoWars, part of our Cyber Week
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:20.820]  Specials.
[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:24.700]  We have up to 75% off-store wide, plus free shipping, double-patriot points.
[02:49:24.700 --> 02:49:25.700]  That's our reward system.
[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:28.220]  We have things set aside there.
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:32.780]  We have GIFs under $25, under $50, under $100.
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:38.340]  We even have a section where we have broken down GIFs by gender, by both of them.
[02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:42.340]  You can see GIFs for him, GIFs for her, even stocking stuffers.
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:45.940]  Take an opportunity to look at the massive discount specials and free shipping that we
[02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:47.780]  have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:49.980]  We really do appreciate your support.
[02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:54.980]  All right, let's go to New York right now and get an update on the situation with Laura
[02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:55.980]  Loomer.
[02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:56.980]  Thank you for joining us, Harrison.
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:49:59.140]  Harrison Smith is our reporter on site.
[02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:01.140]  What's going on with Laura?
[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:02.140]  Harrison?
[02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:03.140]  Absolutely.
[02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:04.980]  Well, I'm not sure what's going on with Laura right now.
[02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:09.980]  I can tell you that the protest yesterday was just a massive success.
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:12.980]  I can tell you that Twitter is still absolutely a buzz.
[02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:17.300]  I mean, literally everybody I follow is talking about Laura Loomer.
[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:19.420]  This protest was a success on all fronts.
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:22.340]  Now, I apologize if it's a little bit hard to hear me.
[02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:25.900]  We're here on the corner of, you know, on the corner of the street in New York.
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:26.900]  Oh, no.
[02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:27.900]  You're coming across fine.
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:28.900]  It turns out there isn't one.
[02:50:28.900 --> 02:50:29.900]  Okay, great.
[02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:30.900]  Yeah, coming across fine.
[02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:33.900]  You know, it's good too that we get out there and we protest this.
[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:36.860]  There's a lot of different approaches that we can take to this.
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:44.860]  And I saw an article on Reason Magazine today taking people to task for saying that we should
[02:50:44.860 --> 02:50:48.020]  come after these people in terms of antitrust.
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:50.700]  I think we ought to be coming after them in every regard.
[02:50:50.700 --> 02:50:56.740]  You know, I think that we need to be looking at coming up with other platforms and trying
[02:50:56.740 --> 02:50:57.860]  to move things over to that.
[02:50:57.860 --> 02:50:59.860]  But we also should come after them with antitrust.
[02:50:59.860 --> 02:51:04.580]  We should make a point of saying that we've had a Supreme Court decision saying even if
[02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:10.380]  they own the public square, if a private corporation owns a public square, they still can't take
[02:51:10.380 --> 02:51:11.740]  our free speech off of that.
[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:17.460]  But I see a lot of people out there, and this is the reasoning of Reason Magazine.
[02:51:17.460 --> 02:51:20.300]  And I said censorship is only when the government limits free speech.
[02:51:20.300 --> 02:51:21.700]  I don't agree with that.
[02:51:21.700 --> 02:51:22.700]  I don't agree with that at all.
[02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:26.460]  I think that that's a human right, and I don't think that the government, that corporations
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:29.500]  should be allowed to take that any more than should be allowed to take any of our other
[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:30.500]  property.
[02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:31.500]  Do you agree?
[02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:32.500]  Right.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:33.500]  No, that's exactly right.
[02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:35.980]  And actually, that was one of the arguments that we had with some of the counter protesters.
[02:51:35.980 --> 02:51:37.780]  That's the protest yesterday.
[02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:41.220]  And if you want to see that video, it's on the InfoWars Live at Facebook.
[02:51:41.220 --> 02:51:44.660]  It's about two hours long, but scroll through and find the parts where people are just people
[02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:48.740]  on the side who walk up and see the protest, or people who saw it on Twitter and show up
[02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:50.220]  when they're arguing with each other.
[02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:52.220]  It's really good stuff.
[02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:54.060]  It's really good arguments, honestly.
[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:57.780]  And that was the argument that I made, these people saying, well, the First Amendment only
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:00.420]  stops the government from blocking your speech.
[02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:03.620]  And so my argument is, well, don't you have a right to property, and if someone comes
[02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:08.900]  and takes your property, isn't it the government's job to help you regain that property?
[02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:12.220]  And so why would that not apply to the First Amendment?
[02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:15.900]  That you're trying to express yourself and someone comes up to forcibly stop you.
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:19.540]  That's when the government is there to stop them from doing that and to ensure your rights
[02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:24.540]  are not blocked by anybody, the government, corporations, people.
[02:52:24.540 --> 02:52:28.180]  I think this is like a very basic argument that I don't hear from anybody else except
[02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:29.180]  on InfoWars.
[02:52:29.180 --> 02:52:30.180]  Yeah.
[02:52:30.180 --> 02:52:33.380]  Well, we heard it from Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers when they wrote the Declaration
[02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:34.380]  of Independence.
[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:38.020]  They said, we've got certain rights that we possess as human beings, whether you want
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:41.780]  to acknowledge a creator or just acknowledge your humanity.
[02:52:41.780 --> 02:52:47.620]  We have these inherent rights, and we create governments to protect those rights.
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:49.660]  And it's not just protecting.
[02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:53.200]  We don't just have the government to protect our rights from the government.
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:57.860]  The government is there to protect our rights from taken by anybody, and that includes somebody
[02:52:57.860 --> 02:53:03.420]  coming up and holding you up or at the point of a gun or whether they use a lawyer to take
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:05.500]  away your stuff.
[02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:06.620]  That's the issue there.
[02:53:06.620 --> 02:53:11.020]  And so when a big corporation, when the biggest corporations are out there robbing us of our
[02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:16.260]  God-given rights to free speech and to be able to communicate with other people in the
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.700]  public square because they privately own it, that's something where the government should
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:25.220]  get involved, and the government should get involved not by making up rules, but just
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:26.620]  by saying, don't do that.
[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:28.380]  We're going to have complete freedom.
[02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:29.380]  Right.
[02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:33.700]  And with things like Twitter and Facebook, there is no recourse through them.
[02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:37.660]  I mean, you can appeal to them, but if they say no, well, you're screwed.
[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:41.100]  I mean, that's basically as far as you can go with them.
[02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:43.940]  So people are asking, well, Lord, do you think they'll ever reinstate you?
[02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:48.740]  Do you think this protest that you did yesterday will get you any closer to regaining your
[02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:49.740]  Twitter account?
[02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:54.100]  It's kind of like, well, it's really at the whim of these liberals in New York who can
[02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:55.100]  do whatever they want.
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:56.100]  There's no oversight.
[02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:59.940]  There's no one telling them, oh, you have to let people have free speech.
[02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:03.580]  If they say no, that's it, and it's over.
[02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:07.820]  So what Laura did yesterday was really important in just bringing awareness to the fact that
[02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:12.180]  this is happening, to try to prevent it from happening in the future, try to raise people's
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:15.060]  awareness so people can hear people honk in the horn there.
[02:54:15.060 --> 02:54:19.020]  I know that from being in New York, we're out there once and they have these signs all
[02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:24.260]  over the place, $300 fine if you honk your horn, and everybody's doing that constantly
[02:54:24.260 --> 02:54:25.260]  in New York.
[02:54:25.260 --> 02:54:29.420]  And my family was all laughing about that, like they can make a fortune if they just wanted
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:30.420]  to enforce that.
[02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:31.420]  But that's the thing.
[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:36.060]  We have rules, and the rules are not typically enforced even by the government, but certainly
[02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:39.780]  not by Twitter and these other, they have different standards for different people.
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:40.780]  We know that.
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:42.340]  We've seen that over and over again.
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:47.380]  And when I'm very distressed to see libertarians or conservatives come out, many cases they
[02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:51.620]  believe that corporations can do no wrong, just like socialists believe that government
[02:54:51.620 --> 02:54:52.820]  can do no wrong.
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:54.620]  And quite frankly, they all can do wrong.
[02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:57.180]  You can have wrong acts committed by all of them.
[02:54:57.180 --> 02:55:03.340]  And we've already had a Supreme Court decision back in 1946 saying that even if, and it was
[02:55:03.340 --> 02:55:08.940]  a literal case where they had a company own a town and they shut down a woman who was
[02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:14.100]  handing out literature, she was a Jehovah's Witness, I think, and she was handing out
[02:55:14.100 --> 02:55:15.100]  literature.
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:17.100]  It was Marsh versus Alabama in 1946.
[02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:21.140]  They said, even though they own the public square, you can't shut down people's free
[02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:22.140]  speech.
[02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:23.140]  It's just that simple.
[02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:24.740]  But the government wants this.
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:28.100]  And that's the other thing that's missing in this equation.
[02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:32.300]  Libertarians and conservatives believe that Twitter and these other people were not created
[02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:34.500]  in a public-private partnership.
[02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:39.100]  They don't understand that the government is directing this censorship in many cases.
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:44.660]  It's the NATO, Atlantic Council, these other organizations, these neocon, never-Trump organizations
[02:55:44.660 --> 02:55:49.220]  are the ones that are pushing this, and liberals don't understand that it's, many times, it's
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:52.820]  these neocon conservatives that are pushing this kind of censorship.
[02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:57.260]  Right, and you can understand from the government's perspective why they would want to do this,
[02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:00.900]  because as corrupt as our system is, and as controlled as our governmental system is,
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:04.660]  at least we still have the semblance of control over it, because we still have a vote, we
[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:09.820]  can still, in theory, elect people who will represent us and will uphold our rights.
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:14.260]  Whereas, of course, if you're in the government, you want to clamp down on people's free speech,
[02:56:14.260 --> 02:56:19.260]  but you're going to go to the corporations where people have absolutely no recompense.
[02:56:19.260 --> 02:56:23.180]  They have absolutely no way of leveraging power against those control systems and against
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:24.180]  those power structures.
[02:56:24.180 --> 02:56:27.980]  So, you know, it makes perfect sense, from their point of view, to say, well, we're going
[02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:31.540]  to use the corporations because, again, we can pretty much do whatever we want, and the
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:36.860]  only risk is lawsuits, and we can hold those up in court, and it's just a matter of convenience
[02:56:36.860 --> 02:56:40.900]  for them that this is the easiest way to censor people, so, of course, that's the way that
[02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:43.300]  they're going to do it, and they've been incredibly effective at it.
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:46.300]  And I'll just say, the protest yesterday, the most poignant thing to me was just to see
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:50.180]  people walking up, walking by, reading the signs, reading the pieces of paper, and they
[02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:51.980]  had no idea that this was going on.
[02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:55.340]  If you were saying, yeah, these conservatives are being censored, and you can see the looks
[02:56:55.340 --> 02:56:59.660]  on these people's faces were like, wait, what, they are, and they just don't know this, and
[02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:04.300]  once they know, their instinctual American ideals kick in, and they go, wait, censorship,
[02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:08.020]  that's bad, I don't care who's doing it, I don't care what the reason is, I'm going
[02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:10.980]  to stand up against this, I'm going to find out more about this.
[02:57:10.980 --> 02:57:11.980]  That's good.
[02:57:11.980 --> 02:57:16.820]  I've seen too many times for people, excuse it, because they don't like your speech, and
[02:57:16.820 --> 02:57:20.220]  that basically is a test of whether or not you believe in free speech.
[02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:24.020]  You're going to believe in free speech if you are going to put it out there for people
[02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:25.700]  that you don't agree with.
[02:57:25.700 --> 02:57:30.860]  Well, that's very interesting, I'm glad to hear that there are still people walking
[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:35.060]  by that even if they haven't heard this, they haven't heard it spun, I guess, by Stephen
[02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:41.500]  Colbert and people on the left, so they still are kicking into supporting free speech.
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:44.860]  Thank you for joining us, Harrison Smith, and that's our program, thank you for joining
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:45.860]  us.
[02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:51.260]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:54.580]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing, and I've had water filtration
[02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:58.900]  sponsors since the day I got on air, and over the years I learned a lot about water
[02:57:58.900 --> 02:58:00.780]  filtration, I learned what the best was.
[02:58:00.780 --> 02:58:05.660]  Now, the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:06.660]  an hour.
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.580]  It's amazing, cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:14.540]  Like Red Hawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters,
[02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:16.300]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:20.900]  He has a glut of them, he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:58:20.900 --> 02:58:28.700]  When it's discounted, it's $200, it's $127, he's selling them to us at cost, and we're
[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:32.740]  making 20-something bucks on them, so they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:35.540]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health, it's amazing.
[02:58:35.540 --> 02:58:44.060]  Alexa Pure pro at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:51.180]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship,
[02:58:51.180 --> 02:58:54.940]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes, some of them
[02:58:54.940 --> 02:58:58.620]  are like little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWarsStore that just showed
[02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:03.380]  our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump
[02:59:03.380 --> 02:59:06.380]  rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:09.940]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:14.740]  and the world back from the brink, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[02:59:14.740 --> 02:59:17.620]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.620 --> 02:59:23.380]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[02:59:23.380 --> 02:59:28.140]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way, I've committed
[02:59:28.140 --> 02:59:32.220]  to do that, I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've
[02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:37.300]  got to back it, and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:41.740]  spiritual level, I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support
[02:59:41.740 --> 02:59:50.060]  us at InfoWarsStore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:50.060 --> 02:59:54.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:54.980 --> 03:00:00.300]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars, and in the
[03:00:00.300 --> 03:00:06.820]  decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates,
[03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:12.700]  tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting
[03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:15.660]  from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[03:00:15.660 --> 03:00:20.900]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:26.500]  breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere
[03:00:26.500 --> 03:00:27.500]  else.
[03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:32.540]  While the old-guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape rocked by innovation
[03:00:32.540 --> 03:00:38.340]  and technology, InfoWars has been at the forefront of the Information Revolution.
[03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:43.940]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views
[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:49.980]  of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:56.260]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis for high-profile interviews and bombshell
[03:00:56.260 --> 03:01:09.940]  revelations accept no substitutes, demand truth, demand InfoWars.
[03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:18.940]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex
[03:01:18.940 --> 03:01:32.900]  Jones.
[03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:50.700]  Thank you for
[03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:54.700]  And as I consider an invasion, you and I have a difference of opinion.
[03:01:54.700 --> 03:01:58.700]  But do you think that you demonized immigrants, not as election, to try to keep...
[03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:02.700]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally.
[03:02:02.700 --> 03:02:04.700]  You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process.
[03:02:04.700 --> 03:02:06.700]  The president, along with his favorite TV network,
[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:11.700]  repeating the drum on the looming so-called invasion, as they put it.
[03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:14.700]  The programming on the caravan was propaganda.
[03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:16.700]  It was political campaign-motivated propaganda.
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:21.700]  Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know, the migrants are coming, the migrants are coming.
[03:02:21.700 --> 03:02:25.700]  Your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:26.700]  Well, that's true.
[03:02:26.700 --> 03:02:27.700]  They weren't actors.
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:28.700]  They're not going to be doing that.
[03:02:28.700 --> 03:02:29.700]  They weren't actors.
[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:30.700]  No, it's true.
[03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:31.700]  Do you think they were actors?
[03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:32.700]  I do want actors.
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:33.700]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:35.700]  It keeps calling it an invasion.
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:38.700]  Yes, an invasion of strollers.
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:42.700]  We made news by ratcheting up the caravan, scare talk, and the troop numbers.
[03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:45.700]  He believes they're needed to meet this alleged threat.
[03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:46.700]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:48.700]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:49.700]  You know what?
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:50.700]  That's not an invasion.
[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:52.700]  Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
[03:02:52.700 --> 03:02:53.700]  You run CNN.
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:54.700]  All right.
[03:02:54.700 --> 03:02:56.700]  And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
[03:02:56.700 --> 03:02:57.700]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:58.700]  Let me ask you another question.
[03:02:58.700 --> 03:03:04.700]  The first 800 migrants from the Central American Caravan are at America's doorstep in Tijuana, Mexico.
[03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:10.700]  The first wave of the migrant caravan arrived unexpectedly early at the U.S. border in Tijuana,
[03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:12.700]  where there's been a fortified wall for decades.
[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:16.700]  They've been looking through the barricade, and some have been climbing it.
[03:03:16.700 --> 03:03:21.700]  They split off from a larger group of about 5,000 and are planning to request asylum here in the U.S.
[03:03:21.700 --> 03:03:24.700]  So the Democrats want open borders.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:27.700]  Let everybody come in.
[03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:29.700]  Let everybody pour in.
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:30.700]  We don't care.
[03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:32.700]  Let them come in from the Middle East.
[03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:35.700]  Let them come in from all over the place.
[03:03:35.700 --> 03:03:36.700]  We don't care.
[03:03:36.700 --> 03:03:38.700]  We're not going to let it happen.
[03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:44.700]  A group of Central American migrants fleeing north to safety, a.k.a. the caravan.
[03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:46.700]  That's called an invasion of our country.
[03:03:46.700 --> 03:03:47.700]  It's pretty obvious.
[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:49.700]  You don't need me to tell you this, but I will.
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:55.700]  The president's firing up his base with the issue that helped propel him into the White House in 2016,
[03:03:55.700 --> 03:04:01.700]  which is slamming undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border with Mexico.
[03:04:01.700 --> 03:04:03.700]  He keeps calling it an invasion.
[03:04:03.700 --> 03:04:04.700]  What would you call it?
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:08.700]  When Trump said that there was a caravan, La Casa said,
[03:04:08.700 --> 03:04:11.700]  No, it's hundreds of miles away from here.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:12.700]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[03:04:12.700 --> 03:04:14.700]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[03:04:14.700 --> 03:04:15.700]  That's not an invasion.
[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:21.700]  As many as 4,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Tijuana as soon as tomorrow.
[03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:28.700]  Homeland security has even said that caravan approaching the border is harboring more than 200 folks with criminal history.
[03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:31.700]  That's called an invasion.
[03:04:31.700 --> 03:04:35.700]  Folks, we're going to come back live on this Friday Global Transmission.
[03:04:35.700 --> 03:04:38.700]  David Knight's coming up as well and so much more.
[03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:43.700]  This is the most censored show in the world without you spreading the word, without you taking action.
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:46.700]  They're going to destroy Info Wars, and they're going to destroy the country,
[03:04:46.700 --> 03:04:48.700]  and they're going to destroy every free person on this planet.
[03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:51.700]  And remember, the governments run by pedophiles.
[03:04:51.700 --> 03:04:53.700]  They want to rape your kids.
[03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:58.700]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an alternative,
[03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:01.700]  Info Wars Life has the formula for you.
[03:05:01.700 --> 03:05:07.700]  Ultimate Crill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s
[03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:10.700]  found in our high-quality, ultra-pure Crill Oil concentrate.
[03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:14.700]  Containing powerful antioxidants, such as Azazanthin and Omega-3s,
[03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:20.700]  Ultimate Crill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:05:20.700 --> 03:05:27.700]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health,
[03:05:27.700 --> 03:05:31.700]  treating and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[03:05:31.700 --> 03:05:35.700]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[03:05:35.700 --> 03:05:41.700]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality Crill Oil concentrate,
[03:05:41.700 --> 03:05:44.700]  paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.
[03:05:44.700 --> 03:06:05.700]  It's time to see what Crill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil, now available at infowarstore.com.
[03:06:05.700 --> 03:06:34.700]  Well, it's hard to believe it's already Friday, November 30th, 2018, and the year is almost over.
[03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:40.700]  And what have we seen? What have we seen unfold?
[03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:48.700]  We can see the private corporate world government ally with the Chicoms, the EU, and Hollywood,
[03:06:48.700 --> 03:06:59.700]  and all their paid-off minions trying to whip this country and other nation-states into submission to their globalist tyranny.
[03:06:59.700 --> 03:07:10.700]  Right now, our president is in South America, crying to negotiate a more equitable, fair deal with Communist China and others.
[03:07:10.700 --> 03:07:19.700]  I'm about to go into how China has a totally one-sided deal set up that way by Western elites 50 years ago.
[03:07:19.700 --> 03:07:30.700]  And how they've used it to take China from a country with almost no running water or electricity 50 years ago to an industrial juggernaut more powerful than the United States.
[03:07:30.700 --> 03:07:38.700]  They're not more powerful intellectually, they're not more powerful economically, they're not more powerful militarily,
[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:49.700]  but they are industrially way more powerful in the U.S. The globalist strategically said Europe and the U.S. will be service economies.
[03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:56.700]  But a global balance of power where China doesn't have a big military and doesn't expand outside their borders,
[03:07:56.700 --> 03:08:03.700]  but they're given the Deepwater Point ports, they're given the Panama Canal, they're given all the rare earth minerals.
[03:08:03.700 --> 03:08:10.700]  And that's a global UN agreement, framework. How do you think China has 98% of rare earth minerals?
[03:08:10.700 --> 03:08:15.700]  The stuff you need for all the semiconductors and for all the computers and all the devices.
[03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:21.700]  Because globally, they've been given that by the U.S., by Europe, by the globalist.
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:29.700]  They have been set up to win at the Chinese Century. That's what the CFR teaches in colleges.
[03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:36.700]  Along came Donald Trump, along came Nigel Farage, along came all these other patriots now who said wait a minute,
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:44.700]  we didn't vote to enter these things and it's all one-sided and Canada has a 280% tariff on dairy and we have no tariff.
[03:08:44.700 --> 03:08:49.700]  And China has a couple hundred percent tariffs on our goods, we have nothing on them.
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:53.700]  No wonder they've built everything up. No wonder this has all happened.
[03:08:53.700 --> 03:09:03.700]  But the Communist Party then takes all that money and parlays it into taking over other parts of the world, not even giving their people anything.
[03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:12.700]  That's an easy choice to say we're going to side with America and with Trump and with our own self-interest and with prosperity and with freedom.
[03:09:12.700 --> 03:09:17.700]  China is the most evil nation the world's ever seen by a long shot.
[03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:24.700]  But it's almost like in the media they don't exist. Well, they're Asian, so if they kill 100 million people, it's no big deal.
[03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:31.700]  Or if they have human clones, it's no big deal. Or if they have cows 25 years ago growing humanoids in them for organ harvesting, it's no big deal.
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:43.700]  Or if they 20 years ago had cows with human udder cells that produced human milk that's been drunk on Chinese shelves for decades, it's no big deal.
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:48.700]  If they've got goats that are part spider that create body armor, it's no big deal.
[03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:52.700]  If they let homeless people just starve to death on the side of the street, it's no big deal.
[03:09:52.700 --> 03:09:56.700]  If they take Christians to death camps and work them to death, it's no big deal.
[03:09:56.700 --> 03:10:02.700]  If they kill Buddhists, it's no big deal. If they shell Buddhist monasteries into bed, it's no big deal.
[03:10:02.700 --> 03:10:06.700]  Because only white people are bad.
[03:10:06.700 --> 03:10:18.700]  And that's the sick culture. And that's what we face is a billion, 400 million slaves in China with almost every party member, only a few thousand of them being billionaires in China.
[03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:27.700]  Communism with ultra-rich people with a bunch of slaves and our own establishment allied with them because our own establishment owns a piece of China.
[03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:32.700]  You can move to China and pay zero tax as long as you become state-run.
[03:10:32.700 --> 03:10:42.700]  U.S. companies should not be allowed when we built them, we paid for them to leave and to give all of their strategic information to the Chai comms and become state-run.
[03:10:42.700 --> 03:10:46.700]  That's treason. If I tried that I'd be arrested and I should.
[03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:54.700]  But when it's done under the IMF and World Bank and TPP and agreements and governments signed off on it, they claim it's legal.
[03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:59.700]  No, it's not legal. Even if you pass some damn piece of paper, I say it's treason.
[03:10:59.700 --> 03:11:05.700]  And Trump says it's treason. And we're reversing it, period.
[03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:10.700]  It's time for Americans to not be intimidated by the thugs that have hijacked our government.
[03:11:10.700 --> 03:11:17.700]  And to realize they're a very small group in the command and control positions and almost everyone below them hates their guts.
[03:11:17.700 --> 03:11:22.700]  The most awake group in this country is the U.S. government.
[03:11:22.700 --> 03:11:34.700]  90% of the people below it are really freaked out about the fraud, wastes and abuse and the leftist and the SJW is being hired to incompetently come in who are obsessed.
[03:11:34.700 --> 03:11:46.700]  Their religion is defecating in the halls. By the way, if you think I'm joking and it's in psychology and it always shows up when a society starts to collapse.
[03:11:46.700 --> 03:11:59.700]  They caught all over Portland on the local news, businessman coming out and pooping on the street to be naughty, white liberal businessman.
[03:11:59.700 --> 03:12:07.700]  I'm not kidding. And they thought they would shame them, but the left came out and said, no, we celebrate public defecation.
[03:12:07.700 --> 03:12:24.700]  And Paul Joseph Watson's report, Portland is a SH, you know what hole, it's on infowars.com. You want to see the undercover videos of it, it is a sacrament for them, a religion to crap on the street and make you smell their filth.
[03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:33.700]  Now, why am I starting the show like that? Because that's who these people are. They want to hurt your kids. They want to brain damage your kids.
[03:12:33.700 --> 03:12:40.700]  They want to groom your children. They want control. They want to defile things.
[03:12:40.700 --> 03:12:50.700]  And until you start standing up to them, it's only going to get worse.
[03:12:50.700 --> 03:13:13.700]  Now, coming up, Roger Stone and I have a battle plan for Trump to take action to defeat these people. And finally, they admit Robert Mueller has filed paperwork in the Michael Cohen case that says Trump is person number one, like we told years ago, like he's a mafia don and that the plan is to indict Trump.
[03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:25.700]  Now, under the Constitution, that indictment will go nowhere, separation of powers, but it will be held up like it is. And that's always been the plan. There's no obstruction. There's no lying. There's no nothing.
[03:13:25.700 --> 03:13:36.700]  All of it is by Robert Mueller and Hillary Clinton and these criminals. But now, individual number one, clues of Mueller. We're getting the building blocks, we're told, of what they have.
[03:13:36.700 --> 03:13:45.700]  Yeah, it's called raiding hundreds of lawyers that work for Trump and it's hundreds of properties. You've got to hire a lawyer that works in the town you're at or is under that state bar.
[03:13:45.700 --> 03:14:07.700]  Finding dirt on a lawyer that has nothing to do with Trump, they've so far rated like 20 of Trump's lawyers and then saying 50 years in the penitentiary for the 15 million you laundered, Michael Cohen, or flip on all the testimony you said that Trump was never involved in this stuff, or we'll put you in prison.
[03:14:07.700 --> 03:14:17.700]  We're going to go to Bright. We're going to come back. We're going to go through all of this on the other side. Please remember that without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[03:14:17.700 --> 03:14:31.700]  Please remember that we're under attack because we're on target and that the videos and the books and the t-shirts and the water filtration and all of it is 50 to 75% off biggest clearance sale ever for Cyber Week.
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:37.700]  And we're going to continue the sale right through until Christmas, but a lot of it won't be there because it's going to be sold out.
[03:14:37.700 --> 03:14:42.700]  So whether it's BrainForce or X3 or X2 or Super Bowl Vitality, it's all about to sell out.
[03:14:42.700 --> 03:15:01.700]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, without you supporting us, we will not be here. We will not be on air. And I want to thank you all for your support, but please don't fight the crowds. Don't go through all that garbage. Don't fight the traffic.

[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:38.700]  But without you, ladies and gentlemen, funding us, without you supporting us, we will not be here. These are great products you need. Don't fight the crowds. Support the infowar and get great products that you and your family need at infowarthelife.com or triple A 253 3139.
[03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:52.700]  All right, coming up, Roger Stone with the biggest news yet, that they filed their intention to indict the president and how do we counter-strike against these clear and present enemies of this nation who are declared enemies.
[03:16:08.700 --> 03:16:21.700]  It's never a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away. Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution. Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[03:17:38.700 --> 03:18:05.700]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down.
[03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:18.700]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodide in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:32.700]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:46.700]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.700 --> 03:18:50.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it. It's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.700 --> 03:19:03.700]  X3, now available at enforcelife.com.
[03:19:20.700 --> 03:19:34.700]  Back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:20:16.700 --> 03:20:45.700]  Right before we went on air this morning, I was talking to Roger Stone about the dire straits this country is in, and he laid into a very cutting spot on five-minute analysis to me that I, a thousand percent, a trillion percent agree with.
[03:20:45.700 --> 03:20:57.700]  So this is what we must do, what Trump must do to block the horrible globalist deep staters that openly work with foreign powers, that have openly raised interest rates and tried to talk down the economy to kill the recovery.
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:21:13.700]  These people are the globalists. They are the plague. They are the enemy. And we've told Trump everything that was going to happen, how he was illegally spied on, how Hillary still had her emails, how the NSA has them, how he was always known as individual number one.
[03:21:13.700 --> 03:21:27.700]  He broke that over a year and a half ago, and now the Houston Chronicle is the big top story. Individual number one is the president's the target. Mueller and all the Democrats told Trump, oh, you're not the target.
[03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:42.700]  We know. And Rosenstein a few months ago told Trump, sir, we've looked. No evidence. We know there's no Russia. But they never were going after Russia. They're going after all his lawyers, trying to find dirt on them to then get them to do a plea bargain to get out of it,
[03:21:42.700 --> 03:21:57.700]  and why about the president? And that is what is going on right now, ladies and gentlemen. So without getting into all the minutiae of the latest bull, which is total garbage, and the fact we have the stool pigeon, pled guilty to 15 million and laundered my money,
[03:21:57.700 --> 03:22:08.700]  nothing to do with Trump, changing all the stories now and saying Trump knew about trying to build a tower. He's got hundreds of towers from the planet in Russia. And that's the big proof.
[03:22:08.700 --> 03:22:22.700]  They've got to impeach him now. This is outrageous. So Trump now knows they're going to move against him. But there is a clear way constitutionally. It's not just President Trump's right. It's his duty to stand against these people.
[03:22:22.700 --> 03:22:34.700]  And so in the next six and a half minutes, we're going to lay out what has to happen to this illegitimate house, this illegitimate system, this illegitimate election and these criminals and what we should do with the subpoenas.
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:39.700]  What Trump should do with the subpoenas that are coming with all these fake investigations and how he goes on the offense now.
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:45.700]  Roger Stone, former chief advisor to the president, break it down for us.
[03:22:45.700 --> 03:23:06.700]  Okay, I think this interview that the president gave to the New York Post is really quite incredible because what it shows you is the president has the detonator in his hands. He now has the goods on their abuse of use of vice warrants, the implications, the treasonous implications of uranium one,
[03:23:06.700 --> 03:23:20.700]  the illegitimate efforts by the Obama administration's FBI to infiltrate the Trump campaign. And he also now finally has control of his own Justice Department.
[03:23:20.700 --> 03:23:39.700]  Now, clearly the president will release the classified information at a time of his choosing, but I think he has been woke. I think he now understands, despite being lulled by Rod Rosenstein and his own initial attorneys, that he is the target.
[03:23:39.700 --> 03:23:57.700]  That the big old target is right on his back. It's not Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or Michael Cohn or Alex Jones or it's none of these people they want. They want Donald Trump and they're trying to euker him into some kind of perjury trap.
[03:23:57.700 --> 03:24:18.700]  Short of declassifying the documents, what can he do today? Easy. Direct the acting Attorney General, Mr. Whitaker, to name a special counsel on the matter of uranium one and on the matter of the illegal and unconstitutional use of vice warrants.
[03:24:18.700 --> 03:24:33.700]  Have him immediately convene a grand jury, have that grand jury issue indictments of those involved, and they'll then authorize their arrest. That will bust this wide open.
[03:24:33.700 --> 03:24:49.700]  Is it incidental that the prosecutor leading the investigation into me, Aaron Zelinski, is the same man who led the cover up of the Clinton's involvement in uranium one? Is that a coincidence?
[03:24:49.700 --> 03:25:10.700]  Is it a coincidence that the other chief prosecutor in the potential prosecution of Roger Stone is Jeannie Rhee, a woman who represented the Clinton Foundation in the matter of the missing emails in which I am being unfairly investigated since I know nothing about them.
[03:25:10.700 --> 03:25:21.700]  The president needs to go on the offense. He controls the machinery of the Justice Department now and it must be turned on these criminals immediately.
[03:25:21.700 --> 03:25:45.700]  These signals he's going to do that and separately in the next two months before they, or the next month of that before they have this lame duck group in an early January, we need, and the reason I call these Democrats lame duck is this was illegitimate. They stole these house races in front of God and country and the Democrats accused Trump of stealing an election with no evidence.
[03:25:45.700 --> 03:25:54.700]  We have total evidence, so break down also following precedent of what Eric Holder did on Fast and Furious, what Trump should do.
[03:25:54.700 --> 03:26:15.700]  Well, there's two very important precedents that have now been said. The president, in my opinion, should regard any subpoena from the Newhouse Democrats the exact same way that Eric Holder regarded subpoenas from the Republican House regarding Fast and Furious, ignore them, challenge them to try to enforce them.
[03:26:15.700 --> 03:26:29.700]  Secondarily, however, Mr. Comey, the former FBI director now refuses to testify before the Congress. In fact, yesterday he went to court to try to seek to block a subpoena requiring him to testify.
[03:26:29.700 --> 03:26:44.700]  So if Comey doesn't have to testify, why should anyone in the Trump administration have to testify? The election of the House majority is illegitimate, just as you don't recognize the election of Donald Trump, we don't recognize the election of a Democratic House.
[03:26:44.700 --> 03:26:59.700]  Sorry, Adam Schiff, you are the chairman of nothing, of zero. Your majority is stolen, it is done on the basis of illegitimacy, that's what you said about Donald Trump's presidency, so you are the chairman of nothing.
[03:26:59.700 --> 03:27:02.700]  We don't recognize your authority to do anything.
[03:27:02.700 --> 03:27:20.700]  And to be clear, this country is in total war with collaborators working with offshore corporations, the Chitcoms and others, with Hollywood to demoralize and break down this country. They have publicly, the Democrats and the Hollywood scum like Bill Maher have said, let's plunge the economy to stop Trump.
[03:27:20.700 --> 03:27:34.700]  Now they've raised interest rates, they brag that they've done it, they're trying to suppress it further, the president must start having weekly state of the nation speeches, building up the next month or so to an emergency state of the union.
[03:27:34.700 --> 03:27:47.700]  He has to just lay it all out, lay out Bob Mueller and the uranium one, lay out Hillary and the emails and just do it. If they want to fight, they've got one. It's now do or die.
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:59.700]  Trump was lied to by his lawyers that he wasn't the target and now he knows they're a bunch of double dealing cowards. And so he's taken the gloves off and Roger that itself is the really good news, isn't it?
[03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:11.700]  Well, it is. And the president should not allow this media created myth of Robert Mueller is some kind of saying the president should go on national TV and outline Mr. Mueller's involvement in 911.
[03:28:11.700 --> 03:28:23.700]  His involvement VCCI, his involvement in Pan Am 103 Lockerbie, his involvement in the anthrax scandal, his involvement with Whitey Bolger, and I think the American people.
[03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:32.700]  His involvement with the Russians, his involvement with the Saudis, his involvement with everything. He is Mr. Dirt. He is Mr. Corruption.
[03:28:32.700 --> 03:28:42.700]  I mean, we didn't even list half the crap. You're absolutely right. There are two keys to this. My so warrants and uranium one. Follow the money.
[03:28:42.700 --> 03:28:50.700]  Go on the attack or they will destroy not just Trump but the whole country. America's fighting for its life from our champion. Roger Stone, God bless you.
[03:28:50.700 --> 03:28:53.700]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[03:30:53.700 --> 03:30:59.700]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:30:59.700 --> 03:31:05.700]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing. It's a good thing, and I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:31:05.700 --> 03:31:09.700]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration. I learned what the best was.
[03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:15.700]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro's their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing.
[03:31:15.700 --> 03:31:17.700]  It's got all the bad stuff. It leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[03:31:17.700 --> 03:31:24.700]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:31:24.700 --> 03:31:29.700]  He has a glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:31:29.700 --> 03:31:34.700]  When it's discounted using $200, it's $127.
[03:31:34.700 --> 03:31:38.700]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $27 bucks on them.
[03:31:38.700 --> 03:31:43.700]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[03:31:43.700 --> 03:31:53.700]  It's amazing. Alexa Pure Pro at infowarstore.com or call AAA-253-3139.
[03:31:53.700 --> 03:31:57.700]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.700 --> 03:32:00.700]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:00.700 --> 03:32:07.700]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.700 --> 03:32:14.700]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.700 --> 03:32:21.700]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.700 --> 03:32:26.700]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.700 --> 03:32:34.700]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[03:32:34.700 --> 03:32:37.700]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:37.700 --> 03:32:43.700]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.700 --> 03:32:48.700]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.700 --> 03:32:53.700]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:33:18.700 --> 03:33:27.700]  Epic times we're all living in is Friday, November 30th, 2018.
[03:33:27.700 --> 03:33:35.700]  This incredibly dangerous, out-of-control year is now almost over.
[03:33:35.700 --> 03:33:38.700]  And you imagine what's coming in 2019.
[03:33:38.700 --> 03:33:45.700]  A real year of decisions about whether we're going to let the globalist counter-offensive work and take over society,
[03:33:45.700 --> 03:33:51.700]  or whether all of us are going to really put our heads down and take action.
[03:33:51.700 --> 03:33:56.700]  I want to, for TV viewers especially, but for radio listeners I'll describe it,
[03:33:56.700 --> 03:34:06.700]  roll some of the incredible raw footage that our team down on the Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, California, U.S. border
[03:34:06.700 --> 03:34:10.700]  have shot with drones and handheld.
[03:34:10.700 --> 03:34:18.700]  This is unbelievably illustrative of how the U.N. knowingly brings refugees into nations,
[03:34:18.700 --> 03:34:24.700]  builds these horrible open-air camps, creates the crisis of disease and crime,
[03:34:24.700 --> 03:34:31.700]  and then demands that the countries then sign treaties giving the U.N. more money and more power and more control
[03:34:31.700 --> 03:34:36.700]  over the very crisis they admit they've engineered.
[03:34:36.700 --> 03:34:43.700]  The answers always give them more money than they pull on our heartstrings when we know that it's all part of a larger program
[03:34:43.700 --> 03:34:48.700]  and we have interviews that are posted at infowars.com where the illegal alien invaders are saying,
[03:34:48.700 --> 03:34:54.700]  we were promised everything would be free, we were promised we'd get right in, the U.N. lied to us.
[03:34:54.700 --> 03:34:57.700]  This is how world government conquers nation-states.
[03:34:57.700 --> 03:35:04.700]  And right now they're getting set next week to try to ratify a new global treaty where borders don't even exist,
[03:35:04.700 --> 03:35:10.700]  even if countries say it does, other nations will gang up against you, like the EU,
[03:35:10.700 --> 03:35:14.700]  and will send in their navy to stop you.
[03:35:14.700 --> 03:35:25.700]  So this is 21st century warfare, ladies and gentlemen, with now over 50,000 people marching or already now on the border
[03:35:25.700 --> 03:35:29.700]  with California and the United States, where if they get through,
[03:35:29.700 --> 03:35:35.700]  Democrat judges will then shove a welfare spoon in their mouth, which Democrats will then skim money off the top
[03:35:35.700 --> 03:35:42.700]  and then put them into labor so that they can get money on every level of these people's misery,
[03:35:42.700 --> 03:35:44.700]  a new permanent underclass.
[03:35:44.700 --> 03:35:47.700]  This is the globalist program.
[03:35:47.700 --> 03:35:54.700]  It's cut and dry, and it's all based on squeezing the third world, never allowing it to industrialize,
[03:35:54.700 --> 03:35:59.700]  never allowing it to become free, that's on record, I'm as a World Banker on record,
[03:35:59.700 --> 03:36:03.700]  suppressing the third world and keeping them in corruption and squalor as a political tool.
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:08.700]  And then you look at the Democrats and the blue cities they control, they're all third world as well,
[03:36:08.700 --> 03:36:12.700]  because it's a form-yallay, it's a system.
[03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:15.700]  The globalists want to kill you in the womb,
[03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:21.700]  but if they can't, they're going to then try to kill your brain with vaccines and GMO and cultural brainwashing
[03:36:21.700 --> 03:36:25.700]  and confusing your gender if you get out of the womb.
[03:36:25.700 --> 03:36:28.700]  Destabilization, being predatory is their plan.
[03:36:28.700 --> 03:36:34.700]  And our own old shroyer went to the Austin City Council yesterday to point out, on record,
[03:36:34.700 --> 03:36:40.700]  that they are illegally giving tens of millions of dollars of value to Planned Parenthood,
[03:36:40.700 --> 03:36:43.700]  just at one facility, just happening all over the country,
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:47.700]  and then Planned Parenthood gives them political contributions.
[03:36:47.700 --> 03:36:54.700]  And these Democrats were up on the city council stage, laughing at him while he talked about baby's hearts being stopped.
[03:36:54.700 --> 03:37:01.700]  This is the sick attitude and behavior of these people, and it illustrates how at every level they're feeding on humanity.
[03:37:01.700 --> 03:37:18.700]  Here is Owen Shroyer's powerful report.
[03:37:32.700 --> 03:37:34.700]  But that's not all there is to the story.
[03:37:34.700 --> 03:37:37.700]  So I went to City Council today to raise awareness for this.
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:40.700]  I gave them all the facts. Let's see how it went.
[03:37:40.700 --> 03:37:44.700]  Thank you, Mayor Adler, the members of the City Council present today.
[03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:49.700]  Mr. Renteria, last time I saw you, you were illegally campaigning outside of a polling place.
[03:37:49.700 --> 03:37:51.700]  That's not what I'm here to talk about today.
[03:37:51.700 --> 03:38:00.700]  What I'm here to talk about today is a giant pay-for-play scam, at the very least, happening in the state of Texas and Austin.
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:08.700]  This month, this City Council voted to once again allow Planned Parenthood to rent government-owned property for free, or $1 a year.
[03:38:08.700 --> 03:38:13.700]  This property is valued at a fair market price per year of $110,000.
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:19.700]  This property is also about to receive renovations with a price tag of $1.2 million.
[03:38:19.700 --> 03:38:25.700]  This property had a bidder, Austin Life Care, who made a fair market bid to rent the property,
[03:38:25.700 --> 03:38:30.700]  and Austin Life Care offers the same services as Planned Parenthood minus the abortions.
[03:38:30.700 --> 03:38:33.700]  That bid was ignored.
[03:38:33.700 --> 03:38:38.700]  Now, Planned Parenthood has been receiving this advantage since 1972,
[03:38:38.700 --> 03:38:42.700]  and thanks to this City Council, that could go on for another 40 years.
[03:38:42.700 --> 03:38:47.700]  So it is fair to say that this Planned Parenthood clinic is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
[03:38:47.700 --> 03:38:51.700]  This, on top of the millions of taxpayer dollars Planned Parenthood receives a year,
[03:38:51.700 --> 03:38:56.700]  half a billion this calendar year, one and a half billion over the last three years,
[03:38:56.700 --> 03:38:59.700]  yet this clinic needs free rent.
[03:38:59.700 --> 03:39:06.700]  Before I ask the City Council to justify this decision, which goes against millions of Texan spiritual, religious, and political beliefs,
[03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:11.700]  I will point out what to me is criminal pay-for-play activity happening between the Democrats,
[03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:16.700]  some of which are on the City Council, mind you, you identify as Democrats, and Planned Parenthood.
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:21.700]  In 2018, according to FEC filings and Open Secrets, reports the following Texas Democrats in Congress
[03:39:21.700 --> 03:39:24.700]  received campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood.
[03:39:24.700 --> 03:39:26.700]  Alrit Collins, $1,500.
[03:39:26.700 --> 03:39:28.700]  Gina Jones, $3,000.
[03:39:28.700 --> 03:39:30.700]  Joseph Cosper, $1,500.
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:31.700]  Sylvia Garcia, $2,500.
[03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:33.700]  Lizzie Fletcher, $2,200.
[03:39:33.700 --> 03:39:35.700]  Joaquin Castro, $1,000.
[03:39:35.700 --> 03:39:38.700]  So if this is untrue, I'm waiting to hear these Democrats disavow it,
[03:39:38.700 --> 03:39:42.700]  or I think this requires I file a federal complaint.
[03:39:42.700 --> 03:39:50.700]  How can any entity that receives government money be contributing to campaigns specifically to only one party?
[03:39:50.700 --> 03:39:56.700]  So not to mention the millions of hearts, beating hearts, stops by Planned Parenthood every year.
[03:39:56.700 --> 03:39:59.700]  They receive billions of dollars in taxpayer funds.
[03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:04.700]  They contribute politically to only the Democrat Party, and this City Council decides to give them free rent.
[03:40:04.700 --> 03:40:07.700]  We just voted to expand government spending in Austin.
[03:40:07.700 --> 03:40:10.700]  We can't afford giving millions of dollars away in free rent,
[03:40:10.700 --> 03:40:14.700]  let alone to Planned Parenthood when a similar organization offered to pay a fair price.
[03:40:14.700 --> 03:40:18.700]  So I ask, and I'd like to get an answer today from this City Council,
[03:40:18.700 --> 03:40:27.700]  how do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[03:40:27.700 --> 03:40:28.700]  Laughing.
[03:40:28.700 --> 03:40:30.700]  And that's funny to Mr. Renteria.
[03:40:30.700 --> 03:40:34.700]  Do you realize that Planned Parenthood has admitted that they stop beating hearts?
[03:40:34.700 --> 03:40:36.700]  And we're going to fund that?
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:39.700]  So there's no comment from this City Council.
[03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:45.700]  Mayor Adler, can you justify that decision for the City of Austin?
[03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:47.700]  It's your time. Thank you.
[03:40:47.700 --> 03:40:53.700]  Next speaker, there we have Mr. Clinton.
[03:40:53.700 --> 03:40:56.700]  And then after Mr. Clinton, Mr. Leon.
[03:40:56.700 --> 03:40:59.700]  Now the full report, there's more, is up on infowars.com.
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:04.700]  Get it. Get it out to everybody you know.
[03:41:04.700 --> 03:41:06.700]  Lawsuits need to be filed. This is all illegal.
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:09.700]  But see, conservatives and Christians don't do it.
[03:41:09.700 --> 03:41:12.700]  There's more than one way to stop these death facilities.
[03:41:12.700 --> 03:41:16.700]  You sue them. In fact, you know what?
[03:41:16.700 --> 03:41:19.700]  I'm a taxpayer in here in Austin.
[03:41:19.700 --> 03:41:21.700]  Maybe I should follow that lawsuit.
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:24.700]  But it takes money to do that, and that's why we need your financial support
[03:41:24.700 --> 03:41:30.700]  at infowars.com with this week and being the last days of the Cyber Week sales.
[03:41:30.700 --> 03:41:33.700]  We'll have sales continuing through Christmas, but these are our biggest ever
[03:41:33.700 --> 03:41:36.700]  stuff selling out to take advantage of those. Speaking of our children,
[03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:40.700]  here's just a few days ago in Lafayette, Louisiana, a man who dresses like a woman
[03:41:40.700 --> 03:41:44.700]  who wants to come talk to your kids saying, I'm there grooming your children.
[03:41:44.700 --> 03:41:47.700]  This is the stuff going on in city councils all over the country.
[03:41:47.700 --> 03:41:49.700]  He wants to groom your children about LGBT.
[03:41:49.700 --> 03:41:52.700]  Imagine if a heterosexual man wanted to go to your school
[03:41:52.700 --> 03:41:54.700]  and groom your daughters about heterosexual sex.
[03:41:54.700 --> 03:41:57.700]  He keeps saying it's disgusting that you don't want us to do this.
[03:41:57.700 --> 03:42:01.700]  No, you being obsessed with our children is disgusting.
[03:42:01.700 --> 03:42:03.700]  You monster. Here he is.
[03:42:03.700 --> 03:42:06.700]  I just let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful.
[03:42:06.700 --> 03:42:09.700]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize
[03:42:09.700 --> 03:42:12.700]  that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[03:42:12.700 --> 03:42:17.700]  We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:19.700]  Now, you're going to come talk to our kids about sex.
[03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:23.700]  What an over-the-top obviousness of this.
[03:42:23.700 --> 03:42:25.700]  By the way, I'm going to show you something.
[03:42:25.700 --> 03:42:27.700]  Here's David Knight's notes. He's about to take over live here.
[03:42:27.700 --> 03:42:30.700]  This is the type of notes he does for each show.
[03:42:30.700 --> 03:42:33.700]  Look at these amazing topics. David Knight has taken over today.
[03:42:33.700 --> 03:42:35.700]  The rest of Friday broadcast. A bunch of huge guests.
[03:42:35.700 --> 03:42:39.700]  Climate change for geoengineering. China unraveling DNA.
[03:42:39.700 --> 03:42:41.700]  It's a huge show. He's got lined up.
[03:42:41.700 --> 03:42:43.700]  We need your help, folks. The children need your help.
[03:42:43.700 --> 03:42:46.700]  We need you to take action. Email infoawards.com.
[03:42:46.700 --> 03:42:48.700]  For a live show to everyone you know.
[03:42:48.700 --> 03:42:50.700]  Help us at the local station. You're listening to or watching.
[03:42:50.700 --> 03:42:52.700]  You are unstoppable. Please help us.
[03:42:52.700 --> 03:42:55.700]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[03:42:55.700 --> 03:42:57.700]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[03:42:57.700 --> 03:43:00.700]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[03:43:00.700 --> 03:43:04.700]  that it lowers IQ. It literally dumps the population down.
[03:43:04.700 --> 03:43:07.700]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[03:43:07.700 --> 03:43:11.700]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:43:11.700 --> 03:43:15.700]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source,
[03:43:15.700 --> 03:43:17.700]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:43:17.700 --> 03:43:21.700]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine
[03:43:21.700 --> 03:43:23.700]  and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[03:43:23.700 --> 03:43:26.700]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[03:43:26.700 --> 03:43:31.700]  we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:43:31.700 --> 03:43:34.700]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[03:43:34.700 --> 03:43:37.700]  that by combining it with three other compounds,
[03:43:37.700 --> 03:43:41.700]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it
[03:43:41.700 --> 03:43:45.700]  and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:43:45.700 --> 03:43:47.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[03:43:47.700 --> 03:43:49.700]  it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.700 --> 03:43:52.700]  X3, now available at infoawardslife.com.
[03:43:52.700 --> 03:43:54.700]  I just want everybody to count the cost here
[03:43:54.700 --> 03:43:57.700]  as we enter the last month of 2018.
[03:43:57.700 --> 03:43:59.700]  I want to thank you for all of your support
[03:43:59.700 --> 03:44:02.700]  and I want to just remind you that infoawards isn't perfect,
[03:44:02.700 --> 03:44:05.700]  but we're fighting as hard as we can and without you, we won't be here.
[03:44:05.700 --> 03:44:08.700]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week
[03:44:08.700 --> 03:44:11.700]  and it's happening now at infoawardsstore.com.
[03:44:11.700 --> 03:44:14.700]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory
[03:44:14.700 --> 03:44:18.700]  so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[03:44:18.700 --> 03:44:21.700]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment
[03:44:21.700 --> 03:44:24.700]  and attacks have taken an hour to go over to some of it.
[03:44:24.700 --> 03:44:28.700]  So right now at infoawardsstore.com there is the revolution of products
[03:44:28.700 --> 03:44:31.700]  that are excellent and the revolution of funding info wars
[03:44:31.700 --> 03:44:36.700]  that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit
[03:44:36.700 --> 03:44:39.700]  and human destiny for my children and your children
[03:44:39.700 --> 03:44:41.700]  and all of our shared futures together.
[03:44:41.700 --> 03:44:45.700]  Info wars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[03:44:45.700 --> 03:44:47.700]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny
[03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:49.700]  and we will fight until the end.
[03:44:49.700 --> 03:44:51.700]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[03:44:51.700 --> 03:45:20.700]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:45:21.700 --> 03:45:24.700]  All new natural caffeine boost included.
[03:45:24.700 --> 03:45:27.700]  A powerful, pregnant-owned base, the real red pill
[03:45:27.700 --> 03:45:30.700]  has quickly become one of our fellow info wars' favorite products.

[03:45:44.700 --> 03:45:46.700]  it's also got the boost in it.

[03:46:16.700 --> 03:46:19.700]  Remember that without you supporting info wars financially
[03:46:19.700 --> 03:46:20.700]  we will be shut down.
[03:46:20.700 --> 03:46:21.700]  We make it easy to do.
[03:46:21.700 --> 03:46:23.700]  We've got cyber week going right now
[03:46:23.700 --> 03:46:25.700]  extending our big mega sales from Black Friday

[03:46:31.700 --> 03:46:34.700]  and it makes the information warp possible against the global.
[03:46:34.700 --> 03:46:36.700]  So I want to thank you this Christmas for your support
[03:46:36.700 --> 03:46:38.700]  and I want to ask you for your continued support.
[03:46:38.700 --> 03:46:40.700]  It's a 360 win because these products are great

[03:46:43.700 --> 03:46:45.700]  and double patriot points.
[03:46:45.700 --> 03:46:47.700]  Right now at infowarstore.com
[03:46:47.700 --> 03:46:50.700]  recall toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[03:46:50.700 --> 03:46:56.700]  because when you take action nothing on earth can stop you.
[03:46:56.700 --> 03:47:04.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:04.700 --> 03:47:07.700]  Anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists
[03:47:07.700 --> 03:47:11.700]  especially historians are very very clear on something.
[03:47:11.700 --> 03:47:14.700]  Fairy tales from all over the world
[03:47:14.700 --> 03:47:16.700]  that's from ancient Germany or ancient Japan
[03:47:16.700 --> 03:47:19.700]  or ancient what is now Latin America
[03:47:19.700 --> 03:47:22.700]  Mesoamerica the Aztecs are all very very similar.
[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:28.700]  There are Typle and Carl Jung wrote about the hero of a thousand faces
[03:47:28.700 --> 03:47:30.700]  or the villain of a thousand faces
[03:47:30.700 --> 03:47:34.700]  and what I'm about to break down is extremely profound
[03:47:34.700 --> 03:47:37.700]  and extremely serious and if you understand this
[03:47:37.700 --> 03:47:39.700]  you understand the whole world
[03:47:39.700 --> 03:47:42.700]  because you understand the appetite of the globalist
[03:47:42.700 --> 03:47:45.700]  and the cult we're facing.
[03:47:45.700 --> 03:47:48.700]  Every culture when it went into decadent cycles
[03:47:48.700 --> 03:47:52.700]  engaged in human sacrifice particularly of children
[03:47:52.700 --> 03:47:56.700]  ancient Druids, ancient Babylonians, ancient Israelites,
[03:47:56.700 --> 03:48:00.700]  ancient Mesoamericans, every culture did it.
[03:48:00.700 --> 03:48:01.700]  It's on record.
[03:48:01.700 --> 03:48:04.700]  They built pyramids, altars, they burned children,
[03:48:04.700 --> 03:48:08.700]  they ate them, they drank their blood, they burned them
[03:48:08.700 --> 03:48:13.700]  and now in modern age we see an obsession with aborting children
[03:48:13.700 --> 03:48:15.700]  and abortion doctors getting busted admitting
[03:48:15.700 --> 03:48:17.700]  that they were carrying out rituals while they did it
[03:48:17.700 --> 03:48:21.700]  and we see all these movements of the LGBTP community,
[03:48:21.700 --> 03:48:24.700]  Nambla, saying we want to come talk to your children
[03:48:24.700 --> 03:48:29.700]  about diversity and we admit that we are actually grooming them.
[03:48:29.700 --> 03:48:34.700]  And I am not here to obviously change anyone's views about me
[03:48:34.700 --> 03:48:37.700]  but I'm here to let you know that this event is something
[03:48:37.700 --> 03:48:39.700]  that's going to be very beautiful and for the children
[03:48:39.700 --> 03:48:41.700]  and the people that support it are going to realize
[03:48:41.700 --> 03:48:44.700]  that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:47.700]  We are trying to groom the next generation
[03:48:47.700 --> 03:48:49.700]  to not see the way that they just did
[03:48:49.700 --> 03:48:53.700]  and just because I said that you heard the little plurip people behind me
[03:48:53.700 --> 03:48:54.700]  it's disgusting.
[03:48:54.700 --> 03:48:57.700]  We are trying to teach people to be tolerable,
[03:48:57.700 --> 03:48:59.700]  to be patient, to be loving.
[03:48:59.700 --> 03:49:00.700]  And then it really hit me.
[03:49:00.700 --> 03:49:05.700]  If you look at all of the western famous fairy tales
[03:49:05.700 --> 03:49:09.700]  of the Greeks and the Germans and the British and others,
[03:49:09.700 --> 03:49:14.700]  they're all about evil corrupt witches or warlocks
[03:49:14.700 --> 03:49:17.700]  coming and trying to steal the voice of the little mermaid,
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:19.700]  her innocence, her soul.
[03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:23.700]  It's Rumpelstiltsch and the little dwarf goblin
[03:49:23.700 --> 03:49:25.700]  giving the woman what she wants
[03:49:25.700 --> 03:49:27.700]  but he gets the firstborn child.
[03:49:27.700 --> 03:49:29.700]  It's Hansel and Gretel getting captured
[03:49:29.700 --> 03:49:31.700]  and being fattened up by the witch to be eaten.
[03:49:31.700 --> 03:49:34.700]  It's Snow White where the evil queen believes
[03:49:34.700 --> 03:49:36.700]  if she kills her, she gets her essence
[03:49:36.700 --> 03:49:38.700]  and will be the most beautiful again.
[03:49:38.700 --> 03:49:42.700]  It's Rapunzel, the prince that's stolen up in a high tower
[03:49:42.700 --> 03:49:46.700]  with the witch living forever off the essence of the young one.
[03:49:46.700 --> 03:49:52.700]  But the one that really brings it into clear, crisp 2020 focus
[03:49:52.700 --> 03:49:54.700]  is Little Red Riding Hood.
[03:49:54.700 --> 03:49:56.700]  Everyone knows Little Red Riding Hood
[03:49:56.700 --> 03:49:59.700]  is a way to tell children about real dangers
[03:49:59.700 --> 03:50:02.700]  but in a story format that they'll listen.
[03:50:02.700 --> 03:50:04.700]  If you tell children, hey, there's a bad man out there
[03:50:04.700 --> 03:50:06.700]  that might try to kidnap you when you're outside
[03:50:06.700 --> 03:50:08.700]  and go take you and rape you and kill you,
[03:50:08.700 --> 03:50:10.700]  kids won't listen.
[03:50:10.700 --> 03:50:14.700]  But if you tell them a story about the big bad wolf
[03:50:14.700 --> 03:50:16.700]  that falls a little girl home
[03:50:16.700 --> 03:50:18.700]  and then went in and ate grandma
[03:50:18.700 --> 03:50:20.700]  and then dressed up like her, like a little old lady
[03:50:20.700 --> 03:50:24.700]  so that she would come close so that she couldn't get away,
[03:50:24.700 --> 03:50:27.700]  mind what big eyes you have, mind what big sharp teeth you have,
[03:50:27.700 --> 03:50:29.700]  all the better to eat you with, my dear.
[03:50:29.700 --> 03:50:31.700]  And you think about it, then you pull back
[03:50:31.700 --> 03:50:34.700]  from Europe to the US, drag queen days.
[03:50:34.700 --> 03:50:36.700]  They're not even drag queens.
[03:50:36.700 --> 03:50:39.700]  It's like Bob Hope dressed up like a woman to be funny.
[03:50:39.700 --> 03:50:44.700]  No, it's men dressing up in these scary, weird outfits
[03:50:44.700 --> 03:50:46.700]  and coming in and traumatizing
[03:50:46.700 --> 03:50:48.700]  and talk to mainly elementary students,
[03:50:48.700 --> 03:50:50.700]  five, six-year-olds about their sexuality
[03:50:50.700 --> 03:50:52.700]  and just how do you shake your booty
[03:50:52.700 --> 03:50:54.700]  and you can be a boy, you can be a girl.
[03:50:54.700 --> 03:50:56.700]  Things parents would never say to their kids
[03:50:56.700 --> 03:50:59.700]  is done out in the open and it's a man
[03:50:59.700 --> 03:51:02.700]  dressed like a woman but then there's even the archetype
[03:51:02.700 --> 03:51:04.700]  with so many of the ways they dress
[03:51:04.700 --> 03:51:06.700]  actually scary on top of it.
[03:51:06.700 --> 03:51:08.700]  So they're throwing it and everyone's face
[03:51:08.700 --> 03:51:10.700]  what's going on and even admitting
[03:51:10.700 --> 03:51:12.700]  this is grooming people into a way of life
[03:51:12.700 --> 03:51:14.700]  and in many cases they don't even warn the schools
[03:51:14.700 --> 03:51:17.700]  or the parents, they just show up at the events
[03:51:17.700 --> 03:51:19.700]  at career day and in other cases
[03:51:19.700 --> 03:51:21.700]  the schools don't tell the parents.
[03:51:21.700 --> 03:51:24.700]  So everything about this is diabolical and it's evil
[03:51:24.700 --> 03:51:26.700]  because throughout every time in history
[03:51:26.700 --> 03:51:29.700]  there is an obsession with taking control
[03:51:29.700 --> 03:51:31.700]  of the youth and their energy.
[03:51:31.700 --> 03:51:35.700]  It is a form of psychic and energetic vampirism
[03:51:35.700 --> 03:51:38.700]  and it's the essence of Luciferianism,
[03:51:38.700 --> 03:51:40.700]  Satan worship, it's come out in the Catholic Church
[03:51:40.700 --> 03:51:42.700]  that's been taken over by this,
[03:51:42.700 --> 03:51:44.700]  them raping children in mass, in rituals.
[03:51:44.700 --> 03:51:46.700]  It's all over the world.
[03:51:46.700 --> 03:51:48.700]  They're seeing a major reassurgence
[03:51:48.700 --> 03:51:51.700]  of what's happened during this part
[03:51:51.700 --> 03:51:54.700]  of the end of a cycle, the end of the decadent cycle
[03:51:54.700 --> 03:51:56.700]  going back into rebirth.
[03:51:56.700 --> 03:51:58.700]  We're seeing this true evil rear its head again
[03:51:58.700 --> 03:52:01.700]  that's in the history books, that's in the fairy tales,
[03:52:01.700 --> 03:52:04.700]  that's in all the archetypes, that's in all the horror movies
[03:52:04.700 --> 03:52:06.700]  but it's going on right in front of you
[03:52:06.700 --> 03:52:08.700]  and the media is telling you that if you stand against it
[03:52:08.700 --> 03:52:11.700]  and say that it's abusive to sexualized five-year-olds,
[03:52:11.700 --> 03:52:13.700]  if you say it's abusive to not tell parents
[03:52:13.700 --> 03:52:15.700]  men are going to dress like women
[03:52:15.700 --> 03:52:17.700]  like the big bad wolf, this old lady
[03:52:17.700 --> 03:52:19.700]  to come speak with your children
[03:52:19.700 --> 03:52:21.700]  to make that first contact, to groom them.
[03:52:21.700 --> 03:52:23.700]  If you say that 2 plus 2 equals 4
[03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:25.700]  the media will attack you.
[03:52:25.700 --> 03:52:27.700]  I'm not afraid of the corporate media
[03:52:27.700 --> 03:52:29.700]  they've signed on to pure evil.
[03:52:29.700 --> 03:52:31.700]  But I do know some people out there are aware of this
[03:52:31.700 --> 03:52:33.700]  and decided to go ahead and go along with it
[03:52:33.700 --> 03:52:35.700]  because they're afraid of being ridiculed.
[03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:37.700]  You've now signed on to the abuse and traumatization
[03:52:37.700 --> 03:52:39.700]  of these children by not taking action.
[03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:41.700]  So I'm challenging everyone who's been on the fence
[03:52:41.700 --> 03:52:43.700]  to stand up and to start speaking out against this
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:45.700]  because the fact that they're trying to ban
[03:52:45.700 --> 03:52:48.700]  anybody from the internet that decries this shows
[03:52:48.700 --> 03:52:51.700]  how it's organized, how it's diabolical
[03:52:51.700 --> 03:52:54.700]  and how it's so outrageous
[03:52:54.700 --> 03:52:57.700]  it can't cement itself,
[03:52:57.700 --> 03:52:59.700]  it can't get a firm beach head
[03:52:59.700 --> 03:53:01.700]  if we as guardians of the children
[03:53:01.700 --> 03:53:03.700]  and of culture and of innocence stand up
[03:53:03.700 --> 03:53:05.700]  and say you will not pass
[03:53:05.700 --> 03:53:07.700]  like Gandalf at that bridge
[03:53:07.700 --> 03:53:09.700]  with the bullrog coming.
[03:53:09.700 --> 03:53:11.700]  The bullrog is just an archetype of the raw spirit
[03:53:11.700 --> 03:53:14.700]  of destruction and that's the spirit behind
[03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:16.700]  these little clowns
[03:53:16.700 --> 03:53:18.700]  that they're dangling out in front
[03:53:18.700 --> 03:53:20.700]  to the children.
[03:53:20.700 --> 03:53:23.700]  The clown is only the light on the angler fish
[03:53:23.700 --> 03:53:26.700]  and the real darkness lurking.
[03:53:26.700 --> 03:53:28.700]  We must defend our children
[03:53:28.700 --> 03:53:30.700]  or we must side with Satan.
[03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:32.700]  The choice is up to you.
[03:53:32.700 --> 03:53:35.700]  It's also what happens when you listen
[03:53:35.700 --> 03:53:38.700]  to the radio host Alex Jones
[03:53:38.700 --> 03:53:41.700]  who claims that 9-11
[03:53:41.700 --> 03:53:45.700]  and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:53:45.700 --> 03:53:49.700]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind
[03:53:49.700 --> 03:53:52.700]  or how dark their heart must be
[03:53:52.700 --> 03:53:54.700]  to say things like that.
[03:53:54.700 --> 03:53:59.700]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign
[03:53:59.700 --> 03:54:03.700]  against my campaign
[03:54:03.700 --> 03:54:05.700]  to influence voters in the election
[03:54:05.700 --> 03:54:07.700]  and then they began to weaponize them
[03:54:07.700 --> 03:54:12.700]  and they began to have some of their allies
[03:54:12.700 --> 03:54:15.700]  within the internet world
[03:54:15.700 --> 03:54:18.700]  like info wars, take out pieces
[03:54:18.700 --> 03:54:23.700]  and they began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies
[03:54:23.700 --> 03:54:26.700]  you can imagine, but Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:54:26.700 --> 03:54:29.700]  He actually went on Jones' show and said
[03:54:29.700 --> 03:54:49.700]  your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[03:54:49.700 --> 03:54:52.700]  I have promoted and sold hundreds of great products
[03:54:52.700 --> 03:54:54.700]  in my 22 years on air,
[03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:58.700]  but this one right here is in the top three.
[03:54:58.700 --> 03:55:00.700]  Like Alexa Pure Breeze,
[03:55:00.700 --> 03:55:02.700]  you can buy filters similar to this one
[03:55:02.700 --> 03:55:07.700]  for $500 to $600 that are three stage.
[03:55:07.700 --> 03:55:12.700]  Alexa Pure Breeze is $200,
[03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:15.700]  has a four filter system
[03:55:15.700 --> 03:55:20.700]  including Ion, Cluster, Charcoal and more
[03:55:20.700 --> 03:55:23.700]  that is completely game changing
[03:55:23.700 --> 03:55:27.700]  and costs less than half of leading competitors
[03:55:27.700 --> 03:55:31.700]  and when you look at the specs, it's just amazing.
[03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:34.700]  When you first turn it on in a room, it's red
[03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:36.700]  meaning it's picking up particulate,
[03:55:36.700 --> 03:55:38.700]  it's picking up pathogens, it's picking up gases,
[03:55:38.700 --> 03:55:40.700]  it's picking up toxins
[03:55:40.700 --> 03:55:43.700]  and it might take 10 minutes, it might take an hour for it to turn pink
[03:55:43.700 --> 03:55:46.700]  and then blue when it's picking nothing up
[03:55:46.700 --> 03:55:47.700]  and these are so strong.
[03:55:47.700 --> 03:55:51.700]  In my home, if I sneeze 20 feet away
[03:55:51.700 --> 03:55:54.700]  in a few seconds, it goes from blue to red.
[03:55:54.700 --> 03:55:56.700]  It's picking up that particulate.
[03:55:56.700 --> 03:55:58.700]  That's what's so amazing about this unit
[03:55:58.700 --> 03:56:00.700]  is the sensors are so strong
[03:56:00.700 --> 03:56:04.700]  and the four filtration systems are so compact
[03:56:04.700 --> 03:56:05.700]  but so powerful.
[03:56:05.700 --> 03:56:07.700]  Could you spend way more
[03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:09.700]  to get something that maybe has a little bit better specs?
[03:56:09.700 --> 03:56:10.700]  Yes.
[03:56:10.700 --> 03:56:11.700]  But there are a lot of filters out there
[03:56:11.700 --> 03:56:15.700]  that are $500, $600, $700 that aren't even as good
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:17.700]  and again, these can go six months to a year
[03:56:17.700 --> 03:56:19.700]  depending on how dirty the environment is.
[03:56:19.700 --> 03:56:22.700]  The replacement filters are very, very inexpensive.
[03:56:22.700 --> 03:56:23.700]  Do yourself a favor
[03:56:23.700 --> 03:56:26.700]  and go to infoarstore.com today.
[03:56:26.700 --> 03:56:28.700]  Read the specs for yourself
[03:56:28.700 --> 03:56:30.700]  and then you have nothing to lose.
[03:56:30.700 --> 03:56:31.700]  Spend $200.
[03:56:31.700 --> 03:56:34.700]  Help us make $50 to fund our operation.
[03:56:34.700 --> 03:56:37.700]  Get an amazing unit in your home.

[03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:43.700]  and order several more and then a few more for your office
[03:56:43.700 --> 03:56:45.700]  and then to give them as gifts as well.
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:47.700]  There are studies and listen to me carefully.
[03:56:47.700 --> 03:56:50.700]  All over the world and depending on the study
[03:56:50.700 --> 03:56:53.700]  it's between seven and 12 years
[03:56:53.700 --> 03:56:56.700]  that the average person loses off their life expectancy
[03:56:56.700 --> 03:56:59.700]  living in a big city alone
[03:56:59.700 --> 03:57:02.700]  because of the toxins and the particulates.
[03:57:02.700 --> 03:57:05.700]  You then add all the pollen and the rest of it.
[03:57:05.700 --> 03:57:10.700]  It is not a luxury to have the Alexa Pure Breeze
[03:57:10.700 --> 03:57:12.700]  that is the best filtration system out there
[03:57:12.700 --> 03:57:14.700]  at the lowest price.
[03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:17.700]  It is essential.
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:20.700]  We are doing everything we can to mitigate
[03:57:20.700 --> 03:57:24.700]  the toxic environment that industrial society has created.
