[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:33.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.680]  well I don't have to tell you that it's a very important broadcast that we have
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.760]  lined up today obviously you're fully aware that Barack H Obama declared a
[00:42.760 --> 00:49.720]  national health emergency Saturday dealing with the H1N1 flu more than
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.120]  three months ago we broke down the fact that this was the plan all along
[00:54.120 --> 01:00.760]  because there was no other way that they were going to be able to start mass
[01:00.760 --> 01:08.560]  inoculations with the H1N1 injectable vaccine without declaring an
[01:08.560 --> 01:14.800]  emergency because it was not tested repeat it was not tested and it was not
[01:14.800 --> 01:22.600]  approved it was not tested and it was not approved and so they can only
[01:22.600 --> 01:28.200]  distribute the vaccine under an emergency and yes the executive orders
[01:28.200 --> 01:37.800]  signed by Bush reauthorized by Obama authorize mass quarantines lockdowns of
[01:37.800 --> 01:44.160]  cities total federalization of the country now does that mean because he has
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.800]  authorized this emergency and regular law is suspended that they are going to
[01:49.800 --> 01:55.560]  have forced inoculations no it doesn't mean that but when they declared level
[01:55.560 --> 02:03.400]  six flu pandemic in July they had really declared it back in April and we
[02:03.400 --> 02:09.640]  broke that news here in April that loaded the gun the martial law firearm
[02:09.640 --> 02:17.200]  that's pointed our collective heads was loaded the magazine was loaded with
[02:17.200 --> 02:25.000]  live rounds now let's image in our minds this whole pandemic martial law
[02:25.000 --> 02:35.440]  grid as a 45 APC handgun so they loaded the clip and slammed it into the bottom
[02:35.440 --> 02:42.720]  handle of the firearm with the level six declaration with his emergency
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.920]  declaration of Saturday implementing the first stages of the level six the
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.600]  highest level of a health emergency it is martial law so they've they've
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.040]  green-lighted the Death Star is locked in loaded ready to fire at the planet
[02:58.040 --> 03:05.600]  Aldrin the 45 is loaded with the clip Saturday he pulled the slide back and
[03:05.600 --> 03:15.720]  let go chambering a 45 round in the barrel they have now removed the safety
[03:15.720 --> 03:20.840]  and the federal government controlled by the United Nations under level six
[03:20.840 --> 03:28.040]  rules we're under UN control and that is merging with the driveshaft of every
[03:28.040 --> 03:33.560]  sovereign nation through the federal government so they're locked they're
[03:33.560 --> 03:40.040]  loaded they've got the gun to our head and the finger is on the trigger for total
[03:40.040 --> 03:51.360]  complete implementation of martial law martial law is in effect right now that's
[03:51.360 --> 03:54.720]  like when a police officer turns his lights on if you read the state codes
[03:54.720 --> 04:02.720]  you are under arrest you are detained now he may let you go he may not find
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.640]  something some excuse they even arrest you for not having an insurance now or
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.960]  not having your seatbelt on they promise they wouldn't but they do
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.880]  unless you're an illegal alien and they let you go on record that's another
[04:13.880 --> 04:22.240]  parable or analogy or example so they've turned the lights on and they've pulled
[04:22.240 --> 04:27.520]  us over the question is will they try to continue on with their unconstitutional
[04:27.520 --> 04:33.080]  criminal takeover that is the big 64 million dollar question we're gonna go

[06:19.240 --> 06:24.040]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[07:08.920 --> 07:13.920]  disease either so I use pure works and unique disinfectant that comes in foam

[07:18.760 --> 07:23.560]  alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours not minutes use pure works to
[07:23.560 --> 07:27.400]  protect yourself from disease and infection you can find out all about it

[08:12.360 --> 08:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.880 --> 08:34.040]  Alex Jones
[08:34.040 --> 08:42.080]  welcome my friends welcome to this Monday 26th day of October 2009 edition as
[08:42.080 --> 08:49.080]  you know the national emergency has been declared and I got word I got a call
[08:49.080 --> 08:55.680]  from the office Saturday when I was out in East Texas at a family funeral that
[08:55.680 --> 09:03.040]  this had happened and so I hurried to a computer and pulled it up and it was
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.280]  exactly what we knew it was going to be that's the good news but it's also the
[09:08.280 --> 09:13.080]  bad news folks are asking are they gonna have quarantines will the federal
[09:13.080 --> 09:17.720]  government lock down cities and engage in forced inoculations and the answer
[09:17.720 --> 09:24.400]  is if they think they can get away with it that is exactly what the executive
[09:24.400 --> 09:34.160]  order federally that hooks in to the United Nations level 6 laws states they
[09:34.160 --> 09:40.040]  can do that does not mean that they are going to do this certainly this is a
[09:40.040 --> 09:44.080]  drill to train everyone to go under federal and international control
[09:44.080 --> 09:49.400]  certainly this is a way of scaring everyone into taking the vaccines that
[09:49.400 --> 09:54.400]  are rotting on the shelves because over 70% of the American people in
[09:54.400 --> 10:01.480]  national polls some polls say 71 some say 76 but it's in the mid 70s 70 plus
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.680]  percent of the American people and growing are saying we're not going to
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.400]  take this shot in fact I did a little informal poll in east Texas talking to
[10:11.400 --> 10:18.840]  family and the majority of them in fact I couldn't find anyone who said that
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.040]  they were going to take the flu shot I talked to my cousin who's been in the
[10:23.040 --> 10:31.840]  army for 21 years and he said that he and his men
[10:33.280 --> 10:39.240]  aren't taking it I'm just gonna leave it at that I'm not gonna say anymore I
[10:39.240 --> 10:42.240]  talked to some other military people that were there and they said look when
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.160]  they come down the line with pills we just put them in our cheek and then
[10:46.160 --> 10:51.400]  spit them out later and I was talking to some other people at the larger
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.960]  funeral who were in the military and they said look we're not gonna go get
[10:55.960 --> 10:59.720]  into any details with you on this Alex but let's just say this our commanders
[10:59.720 --> 11:04.760]  don't want us taking it and so the higher ups may may hear that people are
[11:04.760 --> 11:10.760]  taking the shots but that's not what's happening at least with the groups of
[11:10.760 --> 11:16.640]  military people I talked to and in east Texas a large numbers of the men you
[11:16.640 --> 11:22.160]  talked to are in the military active duty or in the guard and so the good news
[11:22.160 --> 11:30.560]  here is this forced inoculation program of fear mongering and propaganda is not
[11:30.560 --> 11:39.000]  working it is falling flat on its face in a big big way coming up in about 20
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.200]  minutes we're going to have a major city spokesman from a major US city I'm
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.680]  gonna leave it at that till they join us who was out promoting and pushing on
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.760]  TV that everybody needs to get their flu shots we're gonna have a nice little
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.320]  discussion coming up here at the bottom of the hour at 33 after with this
[11:59.320 --> 12:05.760]  individual great job to jaren nigh hard for getting him so quickly and we're
[12:05.760 --> 12:12.520]  gonna have open phones throughout the rest of the radio transmission today now
[12:12.520 --> 12:21.120]  we have Copenhagen Denmark global taxation global regulation news we're
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.120]  gonna be going over we have the hate speech bill going to Obama's desk
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.040]  information we need to talk about we have the continual plunge in the dollar
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.960]  watching the slow death or the attempted murder of the republic whether
[12:34.960 --> 12:38.160]  they're going to be successful or not is up to you the listeners of this radio
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.840]  show make no mistake you're the most informed most involved most active you
[12:42.840 --> 12:46.320]  want to know who has a shot at saving this country in our future look in the
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.960]  mirror and got up and realize you may never thought of yourself as a hero or
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.200]  a leader but you're all we got just like I don't think of myself as a hero or a
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.000]  leader but this is all we got and so we better get through the propaganda cut
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.520]  through the mind control break our conditioning and face up to what we're
[13:05.520 --> 13:11.640]  dealing with so we're gonna go over all that and a lot more today one of the
[13:11.640 --> 13:18.680]  disgusting little princelings one of the sons of Queen Elizabeth II of the
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.880]  ancestral crime family is out defending banker bonuses and brokerage firm
[13:23.880 --> 13:29.280]  bonuses just thoroughly disgusting we'll be going over the latest record
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.720]  bonuses to the banks that engineered the financial collapse and out of the crisis
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.600]  have stolen tens of trillions of dollars and growing every month and they're
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.480]  setting up the new planetary dictatorship ruled by them publicly
[13:43.480 --> 13:50.280]  meanwhile I got word this morning that two local radio stations were attacking
[13:50.280 --> 13:54.960]  me basically saying I'm making up the fact that there's a world government or
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.680]  a world tax or a world carbon tax I mean these people are living in complete
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.400]  denial but more than that that's what a lot of your media has bought and paid
[14:04.400 --> 14:10.800]  for is this is to pacify you until it's too late you're like a fat cow they're
[14:10.800 --> 14:17.280]  loading up into a slaughterhouse squeeze shoot about to have its throat slit and
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.040]  they're there sweet talking you baby talking you going it's okay it's okay
[14:22.040 --> 14:28.440]  it's okay mr. Moo Moo everything's gonna be fun and I'm a I'm a cow or a bull
[14:28.440 --> 14:32.920]  back in the back of the pin going absolutely wild trying to ram the
[14:32.920 --> 14:38.600]  sides of the gates trying to get out of there but we're not cows are we we're
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.440]  sentient smart intelligent involved people with a lot of ingenuity a lot of
[14:43.440 --> 14:49.640]  intelligence and firepower whether it's the first amendment of the second
[14:49.640 --> 14:54.640]  amendment we got a lot of firepower and the founders enshrined free speech and
[14:54.640 --> 15:01.760]  free assembly and the second amendment as the last ditch weapons to defend us
[15:01.760 --> 15:07.760]  from being gang raped by a bunch of criminals now again I see all these
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.760]  articles up on info wars.com and prison planet.com and a lot of them are really
[15:11.760 --> 15:19.160]  good but they miss the bigger picture of what's really happening here and so I
[15:19.160 --> 15:22.840]  want to do some full spectrum analysis of what's really happening with the flu
[15:22.840 --> 15:28.840]  situation today and I want to go back over the executive order itself 13,000
[15:28.840 --> 15:35.880]  375 headline DHS sets guidelines for possible swine flu quarantines that was
[15:35.880 --> 15:41.600]  the CBS headline from April of this year and how that dovetails with Canadians
[15:41.600 --> 15:47.120]  wary of swine flu French news agency how their own government says it hasn't
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.520]  been properly tested it hasn't been tested that's the main reason for the
[15:51.520 --> 15:57.760]  declaration of emergency so they can give an untested dangerous vaccine to the
[15:57.760 --> 16:04.320]  public period and I thought I'd go more over the president's declaration of
[16:04.320 --> 16:09.440]  national swine flu emergency with the transcript
[16:11.680 --> 16:16.400]  we'll also go over the propaganda doctors urged action after Obama declares
[16:16.400 --> 16:20.920]  H1N1 flu national emergency there they're saying there's not enough everyone
[16:20.920 --> 16:24.480]  wants it and they cut the parents out in the park swinging their children on
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.640]  swing saying my daughter's one of the few that got it there's not enough to
[16:28.640 --> 16:35.240]  create this what I call the Christmas toy paradigm where companies have been
[16:35.240 --> 16:38.960]  caught over and over again paying off local news around the country whatever
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.360]  the new toy is whether it's a robot toy or a cabbage patch doll in many cases of
[16:43.360 --> 16:46.640]  this it's been well documented and they'll come out and say look people
[16:46.640 --> 16:49.680]  are fighting for the toys and they'll have five or six women out front the
[16:49.680 --> 16:54.560]  toys are us going I want one for my son I'll pay $700 I don't care of the dolls
[16:54.560 --> 16:59.640]  only 45 and it's the same thing I'll do anything I need it will there be a
[16:59.640 --> 17:03.960]  black market in the swine flu shot the H1N1 and they cut to police going we're
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.000]  guarding it don't worry starting at the end of next week this is over the
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.000]  weekend we'll gonna have sports stadiums ready for you to get your shot and
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.480]  people are like I wanted I need it right now people running out getting the
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.200]  seasonal flu shot just thinking it'll oh I've got to have it protect my babies
[17:20.200 --> 17:28.440]  meanwhile I have the Canadian news with major doctors reporting that you have
[17:28.440 --> 17:34.120]  double the chance of getting regular flu or swine flu if you take the vaccine
[17:34.120 --> 17:37.640]  you heard me right in fact I forgot to print that again it was from like three
[17:37.640 --> 17:44.120]  weeks ago you guys print me Canada doctors say or it's like Canada study
[17:44.120 --> 17:53.520]  just try Canada doctors say flu shot doubles chances of swine flu that'll
[17:53.520 --> 17:59.280]  give it to you flu shot double chances of swine flu again I know we I know they
[17:59.280 --> 18:02.240]  tried to create me master files of all these stories but there's a giant stack
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.520]  no exaggeration probably 500 600 700 it's an entire table of swine flu articles
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.240]  and then I just start thinking about one and then I want to read you the
[18:11.240 --> 18:15.840]  headline I don't want to just say that because this is even admitted mainstream
[18:15.840 --> 18:22.880]  news that this is happening so we've got this big city official coming on in
[18:22.880 --> 18:30.320]  about 13 14 minutes from now he'll be on with us for one segment and then it's
[18:30.320 --> 18:34.880]  wide open phones throughout the broadcast James William Doug Fred Jonathan and
[18:34.880 --> 18:38.840]  many others your calls are coming up and I'm gonna ask this Dallas official
[18:38.840 --> 18:43.320]  well the media saying there's not any side effects but I have the FDA.gov's
[18:43.320 --> 18:49.320]  own sheet and I have the drug inserts for the H1N1 shot and it's also a live

[25:06.960 --> 25:11.240]  good to be on the line with you I woke me up about two years ago and I'm glad
[25:11.240 --> 25:14.960]  to be awake and I had something happen to me this weekend that I wanted to let
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.520]  you know about I got pulled over by an officer in Princeton and he wrote me a
[25:20.520 --> 25:26.640]  ticket for speeding not a problem after I got the ticket before he walked off he
[25:26.640 --> 25:30.720]  handed me a little slip of paper and he said that he was handing it out to
[25:30.720 --> 25:35.160]  everybody want to let them know that there was a new law that if you had been
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.560]  convicted of a misdemeanor a domestic violence offense that you are no longer
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.880]  able to possess purchase or own a firearm or ammo yes and it doesn't matter if the
[25:45.880 --> 25:51.200]  Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case the National Federal Supreme Court ruled
[25:51.200 --> 25:56.080]  that that's unconstitutional and they don't care and now they're going to
[25:56.080 --> 26:02.120]  expand it to other misdemeanors and they have bills in the federal house in DC
[26:02.120 --> 26:08.280]  stating that the Attorney General can just ban anyone secretly from owning a
[26:08.280 --> 26:13.480]  firearm no judge no jury no nothing they have another bill no fly no buy that's
[26:13.480 --> 26:19.880]  similar and also one final note but see notice the police are becoming anti gun
[26:19.880 --> 26:24.440]  police with little with little messages about your second amendment you need to
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.040]  scan that in and you need to email us that go ahead Jonathan so I mean James
[26:29.040 --> 26:32.800]  one more thing I've never heard anyone mention this but I've noticed for the
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.280]  past couple years now they're stringing big strands of cable up and down the
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.640]  highways not just in Texas but and the surrounding states as well or concrete
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.760]  blocks so that you're unable to make a u-turn and I'm just really feel like
[26:47.760 --> 26:50.400]  they're getting ready to clamp this thing down they're going to make all the
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.960]  major roads this is official Texas documents been in the Dallas morning
[26:53.960 --> 27:00.040]  news 8,000 plus miles are going to be toll roads so take our 37 from San
[27:00.040 --> 27:05.040]  Antonio to Corpus Christi and the beach and to Port Aransas huge destination for
[27:05.040 --> 27:10.040]  millions of Texans and others every year almost the entire way down there they
[27:10.040 --> 27:15.520]  have put metal poles with cable down the middle so you can't exit and they
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.160]  admit that's to train people that they can't turn around and it's also for
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.840]  lockdowns during emergencies but it's training you for the toll roads Alex I'm
[27:25.840 --> 27:31.120]  a pastor and I'm having the hardest time waking up my fellow pastors and get out
[27:31.120 --> 27:35.720]  of this left-right paradigm I was in it for years I was for the Iraq war got to
[27:35.720 --> 27:39.240]  studying about the economy two years ago and came across you and I've been
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.080]  woken up and I just cannot get the pastors to wake up they're caught up in
[27:43.080 --> 27:48.080]  this right-wing neocon propaganda and I'm just praying that they wake up and
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.800]  snap out of it we have a broken spirit in this country we've lost our fighting
[27:53.800 --> 27:58.680]  spirit I was talking to family in Freestone County and I was sitting there
[27:58.680 --> 28:05.760]  at one of my family's members coffee tables visiting and he said look at this
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.840]  and he handed me the property tax through a new school tax on top of property
[28:10.840 --> 28:15.160]  tax under a new law they passed a few years ago in Texas and had the Senate
[28:15.160 --> 28:21.000]  bill number on it I meant to get a copy of it but forgot and it's his property
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.520]  tax went up nine fold he was saying look my property tax has gone up five fold
[28:26.520 --> 28:29.760]  and my dad was sitting there and he said let me see that and he goes no do the
[28:29.760 --> 28:41.160]  math do the math Pat Pat's name he said this is a nine fold increase a nine
[28:41.160 --> 28:47.480]  fold increase and normally people would go take over the city council take over
[28:47.480 --> 28:51.200]  the county commissioners and they would they would not allow that back when my
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.080]  grandfather was the county tax assessor he was loved by everybody because he
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.360]  made sure that basically nobody had to even really pay taxes that's what they
[28:59.360 --> 29:02.480]  wanted was was to have a tiny government well that's not the way it is
[29:02.480 --> 29:09.920]  anymore in Freestone County nine fold property tax on top of the property tax
[29:09.920 --> 29:15.520]  it's a school tax and it's a little bitty schools and they claim it's for
[29:15.520 --> 29:20.520]  some of the roads they are absolutely raping everyone everywhere and I
[29:20.520 --> 29:28.120]  appreciate your call James it is just incredible but it's what do you expect
[29:28.120 --> 29:36.800]  when the media is on the news saying there's no flu side effects when the
[29:36.800 --> 29:40.560]  insert says there are side effects I mean they're going for broke if you're
[29:40.560 --> 29:45.460]  gonna tell a hundred lies why not tell a million why not lie about everything we

[33:22.000 --> 33:25.240]  County Department of Health and Human Services Office of Public Information
[33:25.240 --> 33:31.440]  Director Zachary Thompson on the line with us. I was watching Dallas
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.480]  television this weekend and saw him on the news giving reports about Dallas
[33:36.480 --> 33:43.080]  sites, my hometown, concerned about there not being enough of the vaccine. All of
[33:43.080 --> 33:47.360]  this of course on the heels of President Barack Obama's announcement that it is
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.560]  a emergency. Sir, what does this mean by emergency? People are asking what this
[33:53.560 --> 33:58.320]  declared national emergency means. Well, I think it's good that the president put
[33:58.320 --> 34:03.360]  together a national emergency. I think that it's really focused on hospitals
[34:03.360 --> 34:09.360]  and the possible surge in patients that hospitals can see. So this declaration
[34:09.360 --> 34:15.280]  really focused more on hospitals and the impact of additional patients who may
[34:15.280 --> 34:22.840]  come in due to H1N1. My overall concern is enough vaccine in our community Dallas
[34:22.840 --> 34:26.880]  County, North Texas, of course, Texas and throughout the nation. We have to have
[34:26.880 --> 34:33.280]  the vaccine in place now specifically for the uninsured, those who don't have a
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.920]  medical home. The concern is is that we could see increased deaths. We could see
[34:37.920 --> 34:42.400]  of course additional outbreaks in our community, but right now we're only
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.720]  operating with limited supply of the vaccine. So the real issue is vaccine
[34:46.720 --> 34:52.000]  availability. The federal government had promised that we would have vaccine
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.160]  available by the 1st of October. They did that. No one just told us it was going
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.880]  to be in such a small amount. So the real issue to date is that we do need the
[35:01.880 --> 35:06.080]  vaccine. We're concerned that we make it large shipments of the vaccine on the
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.640]  back end back and what you can still use it in November, you can still use it in
[35:09.640 --> 35:14.080]  December. But one of the things that we want to push is get in the vaccine in
[35:14.080 --> 35:19.960]  place now, get our American public vaccinated before Thanksgiving so we can
[35:19.960 --> 35:26.040]  really deal with the issues of outbreaks of H1N1 throughout Texas, throughout
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.760]  the United States. So that's the real bottom line. The national emergency is
[35:29.760 --> 35:35.120]  great. That's going to open up, you know, various issues. I believe in Texas and
[35:35.120 --> 35:40.200]  most of our hospital emergency rooms in Texas, we've already been operating in
[35:40.200 --> 35:44.680]  terms of emergencies. If you've looked at what you've seen, even in Austin, Dallas
[35:44.680 --> 35:49.720]  and Harris County, you've seen where your hospitals have basically set up
[35:49.720 --> 35:53.840]  tents outside their hospitals to deal with screening people out who were sick.
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.400]  Well, you're the director of one of the biggest health departments in the nation.
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.360]  So perhaps you can give us the numbers. I see different statistics in
[36:03.360 --> 36:09.440]  the national media, but the regular flu kills around 36,000 people a year, if
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.540]  I'm correct, correct me if I'm wrong. That's correct. And this flu has
[36:13.540 --> 36:19.480]  killed how many? Well, locally we've had 11 deaths in Dallas County and then
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.120]  in terms of just Texas and throughout the nation, you saw a significant amount of
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.520]  deaths. So the concern is that here in Dallas County, we've had 11 deaths
[36:27.520 --> 36:34.520]  predominantly among teenage kids, children, and that's a concern. So our
[36:34.520 --> 36:40.200]  concern nationally is that it has been a staggering number of deaths and the
[36:40.200 --> 36:45.360]  concern is how much, you know, deaths are we going to see associated with H1N1.
[36:45.360 --> 36:49.520]  We have to begin to get the vaccine out there to vaccinate our community to
[36:49.520 --> 36:54.800]  prevent future deaths. We don't know what the number may be in terms of H1N1.
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.600]  We know about seasonal flu because we've been dealing with this for years,
[36:59.600 --> 37:03.800]  but this is a new virus and what impact it's going to have. We don't know, but
[37:03.800 --> 37:08.480]  we do know you've got to get the vaccine out there. Sure. Mr. Thompson, my concern
[37:08.480 --> 37:13.600]  is the number we've got is around 5,000 deaths and I understand that the
[37:13.600 --> 37:19.200]  seasons, you know, just now getting into full swing, but many experts and many
[37:19.200 --> 37:25.240]  headlines I read state that it looks like this flu isn't as deadly as the
[37:25.240 --> 37:33.400]  regular swine flu isn't as deadly as the regular seasonal flu. So what is
[37:33.400 --> 37:37.840]  all the fear about? What is the big concern? What are the feds and other
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.920]  experts telling you the reason for so much concern is? Well, you write that.
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.680]  That's a national number. I think no one is telling us. We're just basing it on
[37:47.680 --> 37:53.160]  the fact of the deaths we've seen here locally and we realize the impact H1N1
[37:53.160 --> 37:57.280]  is having on our community in Dallas County. This is not about a fear factor.
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.720]  Let me be real clear. It's about the fact that you have to put yourself in the
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.880]  place of a mother whose child has died from H1N1 or a child whose parent has
[38:05.880 --> 38:09.760]  died from H1N1 and you got to personalize it from the standpoint that
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.680]  this has been a deadly virus. We don't know what the number may get up to.
[38:14.680 --> 38:19.960]  We're seeing fluctuations throughout the United States. Basically, you see high
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.040]  number of cases in some parts of the United States, low numbers in other
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.720]  parts of the United States. Clearly, no one knows what to expect, but the
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.680]  preparation, we've asked for two things. One, prevention tips. Cover your mouth
[38:32.680 --> 38:37.240]  when you cough or sneeze, stay at home when you're sick, but the key ingredient
[38:37.240 --> 38:43.120]  is in the vaccine. We don't know what the death toll may be if we continue
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.720]  without the vaccine. That's the real key right there. So I won't get into the
[38:47.720 --> 38:51.880]  debate whether or not this is any more different than seasonal flu. I'm just
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.360]  saying you have people who have died from H1N1 related.
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.280]  I understand Mr. Thompson, the director of the Dallas County Department of Health
[38:59.280 --> 39:04.080]  and Human Services Office of Public Information. The issue here is we see
[39:04.080 --> 39:10.880]  these reports out of New York and out of Boston where they attempted to make
[39:10.880 --> 39:15.680]  medical workers and nurses take the shots. They've now lost in court. Dallas
[39:15.680 --> 39:20.360]  County isn't attempting to make medical workers take it. Are they or what's the
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.800]  policy there? No, no, and I think the question really on the table is whether
[39:24.800 --> 39:30.200]  or not in terms of offering it to your public health workers, first responders,
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.840]  that opportunity to take the vaccine. So I don't know how, you know, what's going
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.400]  on in other states. We're saying that we make it available to first responders,
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.120]  to our public health care workers, and give them that option since they're
[39:43.120 --> 39:46.720]  going to be the ones on the front line when we open up these. So they're not
[39:46.720 --> 39:49.720]  being pressured. They're not being pressured in Dallas County to take it
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.080]  then. No, I'm not. I'm not aware of anybody being pressured in Dallas County.
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.680]  We're not. We make it available for public health workers and first
[39:58.680 --> 40:04.320]  responders basically because they will be on the front line of responding to the
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.640]  setup and administering doing a vaccination. When did you, when did
[40:08.640 --> 40:13.280]  Dallas County start giving the nasal vaccine? About two weeks ago. We
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.280]  received 700 doses of the nasal spray of vaccine about two weeks ago. Have you
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.880]  read the mainstream media reports that it's actually a live attenuated virus
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.400]  and that it can actually mutate or spread the H1N1 itself? Right. Everyone
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.840]  is aware of that. Yes. I think the key is, if you read the CDC guidelines, is
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.320]  that only healthy people can take the nasal spray. So if you really got to
[40:38.320 --> 40:44.080]  make sure that the nasal spray was made available to healthy individuals in
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.560]  Dallas County and then the injectable, which came in almost a week or week and
[40:48.560 --> 40:52.720]  a half later, that's made available to the general public. Sir, what are the
[40:52.720 --> 40:55.760]  public schools doing? Because we see different headlines in the state of
[40:55.760 --> 41:00.600]  Texas and outside the state where their county health departments and city
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.960]  health departments are adding it to the list of mandatory vaccines for school
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.960]  children, the regular seasonal and the H1N1. And then I have parents and that's
[41:09.960 --> 41:12.640]  why we appreciate you coming on because you are an authority on this an
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.960]  expert because you're there over a large county and actually know what the
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.000]  facts are. What is the real policy in the public schools? I'm not aware of a
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.160]  policy in the Texas school district that requires anyone to take the flu shot
[41:28.160 --> 41:34.200]  or the H1N1 vaccine. The recommendations are on vaccinations, the
[41:34.200 --> 41:40.200]  normal vaccine that are required for school, which are the basic varicella,
[41:40.200 --> 41:46.080]  tetanus, MMR. I'm not heard of. I'm not read anywhere with anyone has been
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.080]  mandated in the Texas school district, but I can't speak for all Texas
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.560]  school in Dallas County. That's not been a requirement, so I don't know where
[41:53.560 --> 41:57.080]  that information may have come from. There is quite a confusion because of the
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.200]  back-to-school immunization and a lot of parents didn't get their kids in before
[42:02.200 --> 42:08.080]  the September 1 deadline that the state issued a one-month extension until
[42:08.080 --> 42:12.880]  October 1st for individuals to get their families in, get their
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.360]  children in to get their immunizations updated. And is the regular seasonal flu
[42:17.360 --> 42:23.440]  on that list? No, it's not on the list. Is Gardasil still on the list? No, I'm not
[42:23.440 --> 42:27.280]  aware of Gardasil being on that list. Well, you were with Rick Perry last year
[42:27.280 --> 42:31.280]  saying girls had to take it and he was instructing the health departments to
[42:31.280 --> 42:37.760]  implement that. Yeah, but it's not on a requirement for back-to-school, no. Okay,
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.960]  again, we're talking to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of
[42:41.960 --> 42:47.800]  Public Information, Dallas County Director Zachary Thompson. Sir, I saw a
[42:47.800 --> 42:51.520]  story on the statesman a few weeks ago and I've seen him in Oregon, I've seen
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.600]  him in New York state as well. Perhaps you can enlighten us on this subject and
[42:55.600 --> 43:02.000]  that deals with fact sheets being given out to the parents of children, to the
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.200]  children in the independent school districts around the country, explaining
[43:06.200 --> 43:11.400]  the basics about the vaccine and clearing up some of the misunderstandings
[43:11.400 --> 43:16.400]  is Dallas County issuing any type of fact sheets like that? Well, I think anyone
[43:16.400 --> 43:20.880]  that takes the vaccine or come in to get their children administered the vaccine
[43:20.880 --> 43:26.400]  has to review that information and make a decision whether or not they want their
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.720]  children to receive the vaccine. Are they signing forms? Are people signing
[43:30.720 --> 43:35.400]  waiver forms when they take the H1N1? Well, I think you sign a form after
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.080]  acknowledging that you've been given education about it and that you
[43:38.080 --> 43:41.360]  willing to have your child immunized. Is your choice whether or not you want your
[43:41.360 --> 43:45.720]  kids to be vaccinated? I understand. Well, I want to give you the last word in a
[43:45.720 --> 43:48.520]  moment but I did want to bring this up to you because I'm sure you're a very
[43:48.520 --> 43:53.440]  nice intelligent and form person who genuinely cares about the community. Our
[43:53.440 --> 43:57.680]  issue is we've seen copies of what's being given out in Travis County here in
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.720]  Austin, we've seen copies of it in Oregon and the New York Times has a public
[44:03.720 --> 44:07.760]  school program in New York state but also in other states that states there is
[44:07.760 --> 44:11.720]  no mercury in the shots that states there is no connection to Gillian-Barray
[44:11.720 --> 44:16.840]  syndrome or other neurological disorders within six weeks of receiving it but I
[44:16.840 --> 44:22.160]  happen to have the actual inserts not the fact sheets but the inserts and the
[44:22.160 --> 44:29.560]  FDA.gov norvitis vaccine diagnostics limited report that is that actually
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.440]  comes to the medical workers and doctors with it and it states that this is an
[44:33.440 --> 44:39.680]  experimental vaccine that has a lot of side effects. A, were you aware of that
[44:39.680 --> 44:44.240]  and B, is the information you're giving to parents of school children when they
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.360]  come in to get the shots? Does the information in Dallas County have that
[44:48.360 --> 44:52.760]  information in it? I believe it does. We just got the vaccine in. We have not
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.600]  administered to any kids but I'll take a look at it and and be more informed
[44:57.600 --> 45:00.960]  about whether or not that that is the case. I think I want to clear up one
[45:00.960 --> 45:06.120]  thing is that the option is there whether or not a parent wants their kid to
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.560]  take the vaccine. Clearly there is due diligence in terms of that so it's not
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.840]  mandatory. It is optional so the issues that you bring up are one that all
[45:16.840 --> 45:21.480]  parents should consider regarding whether or not they want their child to take the
[45:21.480 --> 45:25.880]  vaccine. Do you have children Mr. Thompson? Yes I do. Are you vaccinating your children?
[45:25.880 --> 45:32.000]  Well my child happens to be 25 so I'm yeah he can make that decision himself.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.520]  But okay have you taken the flu shot? The seasonal flu yet? Because it's been in the
[45:39.520 --> 45:45.440]  news that the German government for its military and higher ups is giving
[45:45.440 --> 45:50.760]  an additive free vaccine to government officials and I wanted to just because
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.120]  again you reach tens of thousands will potentially millions of people. What is
[45:55.120 --> 45:59.520]  it six seven million people in Dallas County sir? No no about 2.3 million in
[45:59.520 --> 46:03.480]  Dallas County. Harris County has about three million plus yeah. Okay so I'm just
[46:03.480 --> 46:06.960]  thinking of all the suburbs total in the Metroplex is seven million. No Dallas
[46:06.960 --> 46:12.160]  County yeah 2.3 million. Okay so you reached all these millions of people. I
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.240]  wanted to read to you a Toronto star and mail online headline. Normal flu jab
[46:17.240 --> 46:22.800]  doubles the risk of catching swine bug. The findings from Canada led to some
[46:22.800 --> 46:26.240]  states in the country delaying seasonal flu jab campaigns and it fears the
[46:26.240 --> 46:29.920]  recipients to be more vulnerable to a second surge of the pandemic. Were you
[46:29.920 --> 46:33.520]  made aware of this? No I'm not. I'll be glad to take a look at that. Yeah I'll have
[46:33.520 --> 46:37.400]  your producer's immediate information. Be glad to look at it. Sure in fact if
[46:37.400 --> 46:41.800]  people want to contact the Dallas County Health Department or send you
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.720]  email sir what's the best general email to do that? Well they can go to our
[46:45.720 --> 46:52.640]  website at DallasCounty.org and click on Dallas County Health and Human
[46:52.640 --> 46:56.920]  Service and it has our email address on there and they can contact me. It has my
[46:56.920 --> 47:01.160]  email address on there and contact me directly. Okay well I know you've got a
[47:01.160 --> 47:05.160]  view. Okay all right thank you so much for spending time with us. Okay thank you.
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.520]  All right there he goes ladies and gentlemen good job to the producers
[47:08.520 --> 47:13.960]  getting him on. I was gonna get into next quarantine training because under
[47:13.960 --> 47:20.240]  executive order 133.75. Let me give that to you again. Don't believe a word I
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.660]  say. Go look at the executive order for yourself. You can go to the
[47:24.660 --> 47:32.040]  WhiteHouse.gov type in executive order 133.75 and read it for yourself and it
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.960]  talks about locking down cities, forced inoculations, massive fines and prison
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.560]  time if you refuse the shots. Now Obama with his declaration of a national
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.280]  emergency under this executive order has implemented these powers that does not
[47:49.280 --> 47:56.480]  repeat. Does not mean they're going to carry them out but they have loaded the
[47:56.480 --> 48:00.400]  firearm, they have pulled the slide back, they have loaded around into the
[48:00.400 --> 48:05.280]  chamber, they've taken the safety off and they have this unconstitutional weapon
[48:05.280 --> 48:08.400]  at our head. Oh they can claim they have it executive orders, they can claim the
[48:08.400 --> 48:14.880]  UN has passed laws under level six that the president has signed executive
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.400]  orders that follow it. The president's following the orders of the UN. But the
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.720]  Congress could pass laws today saying we all have to go dig ditches for the
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.080]  government. By the way they have executive orders that say that. It doesn't mean
[48:28.080 --> 48:32.400]  you have to follow those orders. It is criminal, it is abhorrent, everything free
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.280]  in this nation. So that is some of what's coming up today but I do want to
[48:38.280 --> 48:43.920]  point out to listeners that the reason I had the Dallas County health
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.240]  department head on one of the most populous counties. I guess he's not
[48:48.240 --> 48:52.240]  counting Dallas inside of the county so I guess it's two and a half million or
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.480]  two point three whatever he said in the county that's outside the city but my
[48:56.480 --> 49:01.520]  point is that health department in that county is over six million people. At least
[49:01.520 --> 49:06.520]  last time I read the newspaper. The issue here is that I wanted to have a health
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.520]  department head on and if we can get them on we'll have more on. Maybe we get the
[49:10.520 --> 49:13.880]  San Francisco health department head on. Then we can get the Houston health
[49:13.880 --> 49:17.240]  department head on. Maybe the New York health department head on. So you can
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.040]  hear from them that you don't have to take the shot. So you can hear from them
[49:21.040 --> 49:29.280]  that they know it's got dangerous side effects. So you can hear from them that
[49:29.280 --> 49:35.160]  you need to sign a form when you do take the shot or your children take it that
[49:35.160 --> 49:46.840]  you're fully aware of what's in it. Because most mainstream media lies and
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.160]  says there is no mercury. It cannot cause neurological disorders, brain
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.040]  disorders. It cannot kill you. It cannot sterilize you. It does not have any type
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.120]  of additives in it. It's wonderful. It's good. There's nothing wrong and that's in
[49:59.120 --> 50:02.680]  the fact sheets we've seen from all over the nation and I'd like to see what's
[50:02.680 --> 50:10.000]  in that Dallas fact sheet. Dallas at the city or Dallas the county. Because I got
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.400]  a sneaking suspicion. It doesn't say that. But maybe Dallas County is different
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.440]  than other counties around the nation of the thousands and thousands of counties
[50:18.440 --> 50:22.120]  that are in this country. There are hundreds. I forget how many a hundred
[50:22.120 --> 50:26.160]  and something. Maybe I said searchings in the term. How many counties in Texas?
[50:26.160 --> 50:32.480]  Okay, we're going to come back and take phone calls. I do want to encourage
[50:32.480 --> 50:37.560]  listeners to be part of the second American Revolution. The answer to 1984
[50:37.560 --> 50:43.920]  is 1776 and you can do that. When you get the DVD, follow the Republic at
[50:43.920 --> 50:48.640]  infowars.com and make copies of it. The power of you, the people taking action is
[50:48.640 --> 50:52.880]  irresistible. It will bring down the tyranny. If you decide to unchain
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.920]  yourself and take action infowars.com or watch it in super high quality at

[52:01.120 --> 52:06.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.600]  our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.800]  be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[52:15.800 --> 52:20.640]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[52:20.640 --> 52:26.040]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the
[52:26.040 --> 52:30.640]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.000]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.760]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[52:38.760 --> 52:42.680]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.320]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[52:48.320 --> 52:54.400]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're

[54:13.400 --> 54:19.600]  No it's not about fear mongering with the Dallas County Health Department head.
[54:19.600 --> 54:26.440]  It's about babies dying but sir this flu statistically for this time of year is
[54:26.440 --> 54:32.040]  killing less than a third of the normal amount that will be dead from seasonal
[54:32.040 --> 54:36.280]  flu and the regular flu shot more than doubles your chances of getting H1N1.
[54:36.280 --> 54:42.920]  Well that's fine but babies have died but sir the shot has all these bad side
[54:42.920 --> 54:51.080]  effects but babies have died and then every time I read papers around the
[54:51.080 --> 54:54.480]  country when they talk about flu deaths do it yourself. They will say in the
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.160]  article that it was a baby on a ventilator who had holes in their heart
[54:58.160 --> 55:06.080]  or it was a 75 year old heart patient who had diabetes and it had both their
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.800]  legs amputated who died from it. I haven't seen but a handful of cases
[55:11.800 --> 55:18.560]  because they parade those through the media like their cause celebrities and
[55:18.560 --> 55:25.160]  they are cause celebs to scare everybody. The few healthy people. One
[55:25.160 --> 55:30.000]  teenager died in Minneapolis and Ted Anderson said it was all over the news
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.280]  for a week about how they died and how they were healthy and how they went to
[55:34.280 --> 55:39.520]  the hospital and died and on and on and on. Meanwhile the media is trying to sweep
[55:39.520 --> 55:45.320]  under the rug how many people are dying from the H1N1 nasal how many people are
[55:45.320 --> 55:49.520]  dying from bad reactions. All over the world these reports are coming in
[55:49.520 --> 55:54.800]  confirmed. So we're going to break down what the emergency really means today and

[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:50.080]  emergency under the national emergency they can lock down cities have
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:53.960]  quarantines and forced inoculations but because 70 plus percent of the public
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:57.160]  are saying no to the shots it looks like it's going to be hard for them to go
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.800]  all the way with this declaration of emergency
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:05.520]  let's go to Jonathan in Vermont and Brian in Montreal Jonathan you're on the
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:12.400]  air hey Alex hey great work you're doing appreciate it thank you
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:18.240]  little surprise I'm on my way up here in northern Vermont and actually I'm not
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:24.480]  too worried about for myself then whatever I'm more concerned for my
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:29.840]  friends and family around cities during this this what now a national
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:38.000]  emergency yes and the same emergencies are being declared all over the world
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:45.520]  England Germany Canada you were all under a level six as of almost four
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:50.960]  months ago but what they did was first they declared the level six privately
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:54.680]  we got internal state of Texas health department documents I'll just leave it
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:01.880]  that when we posted them people didn't believe they were real then it came out
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:06.840]  oh we had been under level six so we're already under a UN martial law directive
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:13.600]  now they're just announcing it on a national basis to train to drill to
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:18.880]  practice taking over cities and counties under federal slash UN control to see
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:24.240]  what the public will accept for future staged pandemics where they may even
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:29.040]  release some deadly pathogen we also know the flu shots both regular seasonal
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:35.080]  and h1n1 are hurting people you just heard the head of the Dallas health
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:42.480]  department Dallas County admit that the nasal was live did mutate can spread and
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:48.920]  can hurt people I mean but then you watch the national news Fox CNN you name
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:55.080]  it there's nothing about that and they say it's a conspiracy theory so they're
[1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:59.120]  targeting the dumbed-down public that believes anything and everything they're
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:05.000]  told they know a large portion of us are awake now it's our job being awake
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.600]  being informed knowing how dangerous this is to reach out and warn our friends
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:14.480]  our family our neighbors our community we have a responsibility to do it we know
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:19.360]  they're engaged in fraud we know they're lying now the question is what do we do
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:23.840]  about it we're being tested right now with a trial balloon if we give into
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:29.000]  this and go along with the quarantines and control they will expand it in
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.800]  subsequent operations but we're doing a pretty good job I give us a minus right
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:39.160]  now for fighting this and getting the word out this is kind of blowing up in
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:43.520]  their face they're admitting that they so so they produce tens of millions of
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:47.240]  the shots most people won't take it so now they're trying the artificial
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:51.240]  scarcity game of oh we don't have enough everyone wants it newscast all over the
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:54.680]  country I've seen her everybody needs it everybody's lining up everyone's
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:58.520]  fighting for it they you know they show parents saying I sure want it but I
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:02.200]  guarantee you they got to go through 1015 people to find the one idiot so
[1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:06.240]  they're trying to create the hype the illusion that this is the latest cabbage
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:16.360]  patch doll that everybody's got to have yes sir so what we need to do in
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:26.160]  order to get the at least a mainstream news source to to report on on the fact

[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:07.000]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.040]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:14.920]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:18.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:28.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:31.880]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:35.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:39.280]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:08:46.920 --> 1:08:52.280]  breeding it in the 9-12 day incubation period they're now sneezing it out on
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:57.600]  everyone and then right on time Obama declares the emergency so that they can
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:02.520]  try to now fear monger everyone into taking an untried vaccine and we're
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:05.840]  confirming reports we're gonna cover this after Ted Pike leaves us and take

[1:09:50.760 --> 1:10:00.280]  has fought against the takeover that we are dealing with with the attack on
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:06.320]  free speech like truthtellers.org and reverend Ted Pike the cyber bullying
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:09.680]  act is a separate issue we have to deal with it hasn't passed yet and is in
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:13.600]  trouble for decades they've tried to pass the hate crime legislation that most
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:19.840]  importantly federalizes local police and turns them officially into commasars we
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:22.880]  have their training videos their training manuals we've shown them here on
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:26.000]  air we show a lot of it in fall the republic my new film that we just
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.760]  released last wednesday and in there they state that gun owners conservatives
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:37.400]  anti-fetal reserve people that this is hate speech that this is criminal and
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:43.120]  that if you hurt someone's feelings you can be charged if someone ever commits
[1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:47.560]  a crime and says you influence them even if you didn't call for violence you are
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:52.040]  liable this is in both the bills we've got the expert on to talk about this
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:56.680]  Obama swore that he wouldn't sign the defense appropriations if it had the
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:01.760]  hundred billion for fighter engines now last Friday he said I've always sworn I
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:09.940]  would sign it just like Schwarzenegger said he would not sign the bill to make
[1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:14.440]  you thumbprint and register to buy ammo then he did sign it they normally do the
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:17.400]  opposite so I'm predicting he's going to sign it but I don't want to have a
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:20.360]  fatalistic attitude I'm just stating what I believe is going to happen we
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.960]  should call the White House we should email them he said hundreds of times he
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:30.160]  would veto the bill but he wants that hate crimes act so to tell us what's in
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:36.600]  there and how we can fight it Reverend Ted Pike Reverend yes this is a crime is
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:41.360]  bill will destroy three amendments to the Constitution the 14th amendment
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.520]  bill exalt particularly homosexuals Jews Latinos so on above the rest of the
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:52.080]  population it'll also destroy the 10th amendment which gives states rights to
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:57.320]  enforce the crimes laws locally without government intervention this this makes
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:02.320]  a seamless unity between federal enforcement and local law enforcement
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:07.120]  which of course is the very definition of a police state and then finally it
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:11.600]  will eventually destroy the first amendment because the the real momentum
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:17.040]  of this legislation is to establish a bias-oriented justice system in America
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:21.480]  are running parallel with our traditional English law and once the case is
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:25.600]  coming they come through the courts they'll be turned over to federal judges
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:29.920]  and judges throughout the justice system which will make law from the bench
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:36.040]  they will they will not only protect homosexuals from physical violence they'll
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:40.240]  broaden that to include verbal violence against them which of course means
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:46.520]  quoting from the Bible so this is this is the dissent now if if Obama signs it
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:51.040]  on Wednesday which he scheduled Wednesday to to consider the defense
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:55.960]  appropriations bill and the hate bill attached if he signs both of them then
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:00.840]  we are heading the way of Canada and this ends equal protection under the law
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:06.360]  and a video that you posted from C-SPAN went viral on the web hundreds of
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:14.520]  thousands of views of Attorney General Holdren and others absolutely holders
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:19.560]  to plan out stated in the aesthetic judiciary hearing this spring that there
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:24.120]  is no equal protection for most Americans under the hate crimes law it's
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:28.660]  only for specially protected groups who are viewed as victims of white
[1:13:28.660 --> 1:13:36.400]  Christian a heterosexual persecution over the centuries Reverend Ted Pike is
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:43.200]  our guest Reverend when you talk about Canada or England or Germany where
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:48.320]  first they pass a law saying you can't deny the Holocaust and then once they've
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:53.640]  done that they say you can't criticize the EU you can't criticize French can't
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:14:00.480]  criticize British produce people been arrested for that then Robin Page BBC
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:05.880]  non-political host of one man and his dog a rural affairs show where he travels
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:11.240]  to small towns to show the local culture he gave a speech and we had him on the
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:16.760]  show and this was a headline in the BBC Robin Page arrested for saying the
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:20.520]  word homosexual doesn't matter of the word homosexuals like heterosexual a
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:25.680]  scientific term they said well the groups found it was hurtful that he said
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:30.720]  rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals he was
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:36.800]  arrested and again we had him on the radio show here we see pastors being
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:42.320]  fined and arrested in Canada we the groups pushing this admit what their plan
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:47.000]  is a complete end of the First Amendment absolutely there's no checks and
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:52.040]  balances whatever in this legislation is wide open and there are many groups who
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:56.080]  want to get on the hate crimes bandwagon certainly the Muslims have gotten on
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:01.240]  board even the pedophiles these reality advocates things like that are just
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:05.160]  waiting to come under the special protection of so-called sexual
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:10.640]  orientation under this legislation now what's really important right now is
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:15.520]  we have a couple more days here in which we can bombard President Obama to keep
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:21.520]  his many promises this spring and early summer he and Secretary Geith flat out
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:26.440]  warned the Congress repeatedly that if they added on an extra hundred billion
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:33.240]  dollars of pork military pork which means if thousands of F-35 unnecessary
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:38.080]  F-35 jet engines on this hate bill they would speak to it that this this hate
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:43.040]  bill is a bill and arms bill are both of each other that's exactly what
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:47.280]  Congress delivered to the president last Thursday now the president has said
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:52.240]  repeatedly he wants to hate crimes bill he will sign it and so on but that there
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:56.920]  there is an implied condition there that it that this package meets his term
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:16:03.360]  terms of stripping off excessive pork and being amenable to what he thinks is
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:09.040]  a practical defense bill considering the realities of present warfare he has
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:13.520]  criticized this legislation this disauthorization bill he says it hurts
[1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:19.240]  back to the 1980s it's outdated it it's designed for warfare with Russia on the
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:23.800]  planes of of the Soviet Union and and so on he has a lot of complaints with this
[1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:29.920]  legislation what we need to do right now is is get those emails going into the
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:33.800]  White House letting him know in no uncertain terms that we're not going
[1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:38.600]  to stand for him moving us into a hate crimes bureaucracy like Canada and I
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:43.560]  just have a several several suggested messages which I people need to have
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:49.480]  people spend in immediately in fact do it at the next station break because this
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:53.920]  is a national emergency such as we have never seen before in the history of our
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:17:00.880]  republic what I'd like you to do is to go to White House dot gov forward slash
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:07.560]  contact that's White House dot gov forward slash contact and just cut in
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:15.520]  paste in these several messages Mr. President I will veto I will vote out
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:22.440]  excuse me I will vote out Democrats at midterms if you sign the freedom
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:30.000]  destroying hate crimes bill again Mr. President I will vote out Democrats at
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  midterms if you sign the freedom destroying hate crimes bill and then the
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.400]  next message I'd like you to stand is this Mr. President I expect you to keep
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:48.760]  your promise to veto any military authorization bill that wastes a hundred
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:55.440]  billion dollars of taxpayers money on unnecessary f-35 jet engine again a
[1:17:55.440 --> 1:18:03.880]  little slower Mr. President I expect you to keep your promise to veto any
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:10.040]  military authorization bill that wastes a hundred billion dollars of taxpayers
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:16.400]  money on unnecessary f-35 jet engines okay pastor pastor in the time we have
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:20.200]  left we'll have you back up again in the next week in the aftermath of whichever
[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:26.920]  way this goes shouldn't we also get on the offensive now to start running
[1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:31.840]  people for Congress and start beating the drum now for the repeal of it in
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:37.600]  less than a year and a half when there is a new Congress and undoubtedly Obama
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:41.560]  is gonna probably lose control because Republicans will act like they're
[1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:45.160]  against this but if we don't make a big deal out of it now while it's still on
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:50.760]  the front burner it won't be as big an issue once they have a new freshman class
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:55.480]  in there don't we need to go ahead and also start hoping for the best but
[1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:59.320]  preparing for the worst and moving for the repeal of this first amendment
[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:05.680]  attacking situation that also gets rid of equal protection under the law as the
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:12.040]  Attorney General Holder admits I think we're gonna know the answer to that in
[1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:16.960]  about three days Alex what we need to do now is concentrate our firepower in
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:22.080]  literally thousands if not tens of thousands of emails coming in and they
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:26.680]  will be electronically counted they will they'll give a strong recorded okay
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:33.000]  White House dot gov forward slash comments but to contact contacts that's

[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:16.560]  haven't even begun to break down what's happening with Obama's national
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:24.080]  emergency with the flu that was declared back in May quietly under UN level 6 the
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:28.520]  treaties signed between the nation states and the UN were implemented then
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:36.080]  this is a formality a formality of treason by the acting chair of the UN
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:40.840]  Security Council Barack H. Obama let's go to your phone calls Brian and
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:47.080]  Montreal you're on the air welcome hi Alex I just mentioned two things to you
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:50.800]  the first thing you're absolutely right about the media cover up last night at
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:55.480]  11 o'clock at night on ctv news they start the report by saying that they
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:01.560]  took a poll and 51% of Canadians refuse the shot so you're absolutely right that
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.920]  we've done a fantastic job yeah the other polls that that's a low one and then
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:13.040]  that's Canada in the US it's as high as 76% yep and in the news report they made
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:17.200]  sure like they talked to one person that said that they weren't going to get the
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:21.760]  flu shot but that's all they gave the guy the time to say you understand and
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:25.240]  then they shut him right up and they don't talk about why he refuses to get
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:30.000]  the shot and it was the same thing over the weekend on cbc radio they opened up
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.760]  a clinic at the code virtue shopping center and plenty of doctors were
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:39.040]  talking about it in nurses but when the reporter was asking people on the
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:43.800]  street how many people are going to get the vaccination over 75% of them said
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:46.960]  they were not sure because they had to investigate it more because they had
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.520]  heard things so we've been doing a bang-up job of informing me guess they
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:56.200]  didn't show the doctors and nurses the majority of which in Canada in the
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:26:00.080]  United States they're refusing to take it let me guess the doctors and nurses
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.960]  they showed said they love it and we all need to get it oh yes they it's with 100
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.520]  percent propaganda up here it's a pure salesmanship we have nothing to fear
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:14.520]  actually the only thing people have to fear is people like us spreading the
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:20.520]  truth because supposedly we're fear mongering well I think mm-hmm go ahead
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:24.760]  the other thing I wanted to mention is them I do a show on 12 160 called
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:29.240]  northern front on Tuesday night and about two weeks ago I talked with a
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:33.880]  woman who's taking a bite microbiology nursing course at the University of
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:38.520]  Sherbrooke she refused to give me an interview and she doesn't want me to
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:42.800]  publicize her name or anything but the information she gave me was that in her
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:47.000]  class they were all instructed that they're not allowed to talk to anybody
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:52.400]  about the H1N1 for fear that it will damage their current or future career
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:56.440]  yeah no no listen I appreciate your call that's going on everywhere Brian this
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:01.840]  intimidation we've had countless doctors and nurses on the radio show who've
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:07.080]  called in we have shown countless news articles where nurses and doctors from
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:11.640]  Texas to New York to California have been ordered to take it or they'll lose
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:16.080]  their job meanwhile we have health department heads on for major cities
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:22.640]  and they say nobody has to take this well then why in New York did the nurses
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:29.480]  have to sue to stop forced inoculation why are they suing in Massachusetts they
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:35.160]  are attempting under the radar to force this coming up in the next segment we
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:38.800]  have news articles where children are being given and even though their parents
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:46.800]  said no in the public schools and I've had massive calls from parents saying
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:50.280]  their children came home and said they were injected or they came home and
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:53.160]  they were given the flu miss without asking you call the school and they say
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:59.920]  oh you're your son or daughter is imagining things in fact if I said no
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:05.040]  phone calls but parents that this has happened to we could take call after call
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:10.080]  after call we've done this on five or six shows maybe more you've heard those
[1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:16.160]  shows and some parents give their name they give the school we call the school
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:22.600]  we confirm it this is going on but now we have newscast saying this now we have

[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:56.640]  hour I had Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services office of
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:03.300]  public information Zachary Thomas director of the health department for
[1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:10.080]  Dallas County on and he admitted that the nasal can breed the h1n1 can hurt
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:16.120]  you can make you sick and can really hurt people that are already sick so this
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:21.040]  is all there he also admitted that the regular flu shot they're starting to
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.160]  give the the the normal injectable h1n1 has all these serious effects that you
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:29.520]  should read it and that they have you sign a waiver form when you take it
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:35.120]  there's no denial about this here's another one normal flu jabs double the
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:40.400]  risk of catching swine bug the mail newspaper it's also in the Toronto
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:45.040]  star the findings from Canada led to some states in the country to delaying
[1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:49.520]  seasonal flu jab campaigns a mere amid fears the recipients could be more
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:58.800]  vulnerable to seasonal surge of the pandemic continuing here it goes on and
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:04.360]  on and on reports confirming that there are a lot less cases of h1n1
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:08.560]  compared to the regular seasonal flu at this time of year and that it's not that
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:13.160]  dangerous of a virus and most people dying are dying from complications of
[1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:18.480]  diabetes heart disease cancer the list goes on and on or extremely elderly
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:24.640]  meanwhile president Obama doesn't care he has declared his civil emergency so
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:32.720]  they can give an untested unproven this is untested they admit experimental
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:39.520]  highly dangerous h1n1 nasal and injectable flu vaccines we're getting
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:45.120]  reports all over the country of school teachers children doctors medical

[1:40:54.480 --> 1:41:01.440]  reason getting paralyzed from it and the doctors said to her and we play the
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:05.320]  news clips here that yes the flu vaccine did this and the food and drug
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:09.200]  administration said that's okay that's an acceptable loss to have that here's a
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:15.160]  headline that breaks it all down deaths from swine flu vaccine reported in
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:28.160]  Europe now all of that said we need to take action on this situation and we
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:35.600]  had an earlier caller who talked about how he went out with simple flyers
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:40.840]  there's a lot of great sites that have the basic boil downs flu scam dot com
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.720]  natural news info wars dot com prison planet dot com we have the basic fact
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:50.480]  sheets the real fact sheets with links to government reports on their own
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.400]  admissions as they cover their butt in the fine print it says it can sterilize
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:59.360]  you kill you give you cancer give you autoimmune diseases kill you that are
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:03.400]  in a hammer give you the flu make you more than double susceptible to the
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:10.800]  regular flu or to h1n1 we just went over that but to the public they hand
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:15.640]  out in public schools fake sheets saying oh we're getting rid of the rumors
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:21.760]  there's no mercury it can't make you sick we have a responsibility to stand up
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:28.040]  against this fraud and to speak out against this fraud and to say no to this
[1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:32.920]  fraud and to print up your own fact sheets off of documents you read and see
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:37.640]  or go get the other fact sheets that are out there and to put them on telephone
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:42.920]  polls to go and give them to friends and family to go and paper your entire
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:46.840]  neighborhood go and put them on people's front door steps that you're right
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:49.880]  under the first amendment don't anybody tell you don't have that right they've
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:53.160]  been running newscast trying to demonize our listeners putting up fact sheets
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:57.120]  about flu all over the country especially up in temple they've had three
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:02.360]  news reports I've seen without even looking with TV attacking the folks
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:07.920]  that are putting these up carry a video camera if you don't know how to put
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:11.800]  something up on YouTube a 10 year old child can figure it out now it's very
[1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:15.800]  simple use YouTube it's the biggest it's the battleground they have more video
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:19.800]  views every day than all their video sites and file sharing combined video
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:25.800]  it upload police coming over saying in America you can't stand off the public
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:31.080]  school or city hall or sports stadium parking lot where they're doing the mass
[1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:35.160]  inoculations when the police come over say my first amendment right officer
[1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:40.400]  please don't violate my first amendment if they get in your face I would
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.600]  recommend you go ahead and leave you go upload it to YouTube you email it to the
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:50.280]  police chief you go a day later and file a complaint and file a lawsuit for them
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:54.160]  violating your first amendment if you don't leave they will taser you Billy
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:57.840]  Club you and maybe even kill you they're on power trips they've been taught
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:01.680]  they're God they've been taught there's no first amendment even though you're
[1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:06.720]  trying to save them in their lives most police if someone above them in authority
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:12.680]  like a city official tells them get those people off the sidewalk out there and
[1:44:12.680 --> 1:44:16.520]  when you submit first they'll push you to the sidewalk and they'll push you
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:19.760]  across the street then when people come over to get your literature they'll
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:26.880]  push you off of that remember two years ago in one of the major counties in
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:32.200]  Baltimore Maryland was it Prince George County we had one of the state
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:36.480]  attorneys on who was on CNN saying everyone must take the shot it's the
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:40.880]  law over 2,000 children their parents showed up at the courthouse there were
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:46.840]  police dogs this is on CNN riot police we've had guests on who were there the
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:50.320]  police told them you can't even stand off the property giving people flyers or
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:53.720]  talking to them they would use police dogs to threaten them this was on the
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:59.160]  news we want even more depth here on air and when I had him on I said do you
[1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:03.720]  vaccinate your children he laughed and said no he had school-aged children and
[1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:07.960]  I said it's not the law to take the shot he goes no inside the courthouse on one
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:12.200]  table we did have the waiver file the waiver sheets but then I talked to people
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:15.080]  that were there they never told them about it never told them they were on a
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:20.240]  table and there were people on the news predominantly black crying saying I don't
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:24.360]  trust the shot but they told me I'm gonna be arrested if I don't take this
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:30.760]  that ladies and gentlemen is criminal and un-American and wrong and this is a
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:36.920]  test to see if we'll put up with this now separate from that I've seen story
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:42.560]  after story after story after story I lost count but I know it's more than 20
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:47.560]  probably 30 or 40 I see so many of these I don't even cover them most the time
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:50.880]  when it when a new one comes across my desk the last six months with all this
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:59.960]  fear-mongering where they tell parents that no we didn't inject your child or
[1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:04.440]  we didn't give him a flu minister we didn't give him a vaccine the seasonal
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:10.120]  shot or now the H1N1 and then it even makes it in the newspaper that oh
[1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:13.440]  there's a controversy the school says the children are lying even though they'll
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.160]  have whole groups of children saying it in elementary middle school and high
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:22.840]  school here is a news piece out of right here in the United States where this
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:29.360]  indeed did happen and the school admits it but says they screwed up no they're
[1:46:29.360 --> 1:46:34.600]  lining your children up without your authorization and doing this to them and
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:37.760]  that's what the executive order states so they're testing to see what they can
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:42.640]  get away with here it is has a lot of questions tonight after he says his son
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:48.040]  was given the H1N1 vaccination at school without his permission the child got
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:51.960]  the vaccination from Montgomery County health officials at Camargo elementary
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:56.200]  school but his dad says the child has other health issues that make this
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:00.160]  vaccination potentially dangerous Sorrell Roberts talked with the upset
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:04.960]  father and school officials for tonight's top story school officials say
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:10.160]  that it was a mix up a case of mistaken identity that caused a seven year old
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:14.800]  student to receive the H1N1 vaccine despite the fact that his parents said
[1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:19.640]  he wasn't supposed to and now the young man's parents are upset they want
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:24.160]  authorities to revisit their procedures and possibly change them to make sure
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:27.720]  this doesn't happen to another child I picked him up from school and he said
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:32.440]  he'd been to the nurse's station and he got medicine spraying his nose and we
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:36.160]  didn't give him consent to do so so Matthew Angel called his son's at
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:40.880]  school's nurse's station and discovered his son had been given the flu mist
[1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:46.000]  vaccination for H1N1 they said that we're sorry we got the wrong give-up by
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:51.960]  mistake the flu mist was supposed to go to another child who had a similar name
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:56.800]  to Jacob Wages sorry Harley fixes it though a school is supposed to be a safe
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:02.200]  place but the flu mist was not given by a school official Montgomery County
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:06.680]  Health Department nurse was running a vaccination clinic at the school and
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.040]  administered it we contacted the health department looking for an explanation
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:16.920]  and they said that the incident is under investigation but this guy says an
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:22.760]  investigation might not protect his asthmatic and naturally sickly child from
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:27.120]  falling ill because of the mistake a little cold can lead to a big thing for
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:31.960]  him if he runs a temperature you know it's not a hundred point one it's a
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:35.520]  hundred and five he and his wife hope the health department's procedures in
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:40.480]  schools will be changed so this doesn't happen again and the doctors excuses and
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:44.760]  whatnot I would suggest call my parent and double check it you know instead of
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:50.320]  just a written consent how about verbal and when we spoke to the school
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:54.480]  superintendent he says to the best of his knowledge he's never known any of
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:58.680]  the health department workers who come to the schools to run clinics to ever
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:06.600]  have made a mistake oh we never known of them to make a mistake and of course
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:12.560]  there are several issues here but first off we need to remember the government
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:16.760]  the criminal group that runs this nation has been caught more than twenty
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:24.120]  thousand times that's the numbers that we have an end game you can read hundreds
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:28.760]  of those cases at what is the end game dot com the bibliography for the film we
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:32.360]  don't just make these claims of giving people syphilis letting them die of it
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.880]  radiating foster children testing pesticides on foster children spring
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.880]  towns with chemicals biologicals radiologicals government does this over
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:48.120]  and over and over again they test on us mainly to see if they can get groups of
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:53.840]  doctors and nurses that can be promoted into the whole eugenics system who they
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:59.040]  know will carry out secret testing in many cases with lethal substances on the
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:05.120]  population there's another big facet to all of this all over the nation they
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:09.440]  tell people it's mandatory to take the flu shot to take the Gardasil shot that's
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:12.960]  on record you heard the health department head of Dallas County
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:19.280]  sidestepping that one they don't ask people if they have asthma they don't
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:22.040]  ask him if they have autoimmune problems they don't ask him if they have
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.520]  diabetes they don't ask him if they have heart trouble because you're not
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:33.160]  supposed to take these shots their own inserts from cdc.gov say it but they
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:38.720]  never tell you that so that's a whole nother issue it goes on and on it is a

[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:22.440]  truth and nothing but the truth and we occasionally make a small error mistake

[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:30.560]  media is we're trying to tell the truth we're trying to get at the heart of the

[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:39.240]  your question or comment ready quickly because I want to get to the next person
[1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:44.680]  continual open phones in the final two hours straight ahead and a ton of other
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:50.720]  news on the economy on the wars on the police state on the dollar that we
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:56.080]  haven't even gotten to yet but here's here's a point of a meaning to make
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:01.920]  several points the solution is looking at you in the mirror and I know you know
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:08.600]  that but if you really consciously taken that information and then begun to take
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:14.040]  action I haven't been on access TV in Austin and over a year where I started
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:20.120]  out 14 years ago because I don't have the personnel or the staff or the time to
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:25.760]  dump this live slash radio TV show on the digital hard drive they take it on
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:30.720]  hard drive now to go down there fill out a few red tape forms and put my show on
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:35.720]  someone should volunteer in Austin multiple people should to go down there
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:40.440]  and get my show back on there or go do your own show the federal government in
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:45.560]  two years is shutting down the mandate for access TV access TV is being shut
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:50.280]  down everywhere already in many areas but we've got two years to use it while
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:54.080]  it's still there and to fight to keep it locally there's some chance we can keep
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:59.000]  it that's a whole nother fight you can go in Austin access TV during prime time
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:03.360]  and conservatively reach more than 10,000 people they've gotten numbers
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:07.680]  before from the cable company you can get two or three thousand viewers in the
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:14.160]  noon time hour on channel 10 or 11 or 16 you can reach in the aggregate hundreds
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:18.000]  of thousands of people a year who have cable in Austin and surrounding
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.840]  communities that have time Warner cable and there's access TV all over the
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:27.680]  country and a lot of you have taken my films and my material and put it on we
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:31.480]  need more people to do it we need more people to start newsletters and websites

[2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:13.520]  these there's like about 12 different vaccines and you got this H1N1 pandemic
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:18.840]  and well sir it's not a pandemic it's only a pandemic on paper they did a
[2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:23.240]  regional pandemic meaning the virus was worldwide so they changed the rule
[2:01:23.240 --> 2:01:28.840]  normally it was millions of people sick now oh it's there's a virus well
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:34.040]  there's millions of different viruses out there you do what you want Morgan but
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:38.120]  I've got three children and none of them have ever had any vaccine put in their
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:42.680]  body and I just read to you the inserts from the vaccine how it can give you
[2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:46.760]  cancer sterilize you give you autoimmune disease and has mercury in it
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:52.800]  following it since that you know about a year now and listening to you and kind
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:57.240]  of verifying some things and you know I went into the follow-up appointment with
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:03.760]  the doctor and boy they are just a huge vaccine proponents and you know I talked
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:08.760]  about mercury and no we don't use the mercury anymore because if everybody
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:16.160]  would stopped you know objected to it and we use aluminum now and not sure
[2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:21.680]  what excuse me they told you there's not mercury in the shots in in some of them
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:27.200]  yeah well let me stop you about five years ago right at five years ago the
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:32.760]  feds put out regulations that vaccine makers should make lots available that
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:39.440]  don't have squalene or mercury or other things but you can read for yourself
[2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:47.840]  always read the insert it's all bad sir they grow it in animal tissue I have top
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:52.400]  scientists at the top scientist reporting that there's live cancer viruses in
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:59.520]  every major vaccine even if they grow vaccine on it on egg yolks the original
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:05.840]  seed vaccine was grown in tissue dead baby retinas for some reason it grows
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:11.960]  great in that caterpillar eggs for some reason grows great in that and monkey

[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:47.120]  whole other issue they put h1n1 in the regular flu shot see everything you're
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:52.040]  told is is a fraud but you can pull up mainstream news articles but only here
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:57.480]  or there or read the insert to learn that there's so many bad things in there
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:02.760]  that I even forget I hadn't mentioned that today I'm glad you reminded me not
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:06.560]  problem I just want to make sure parents know that they shouldn't be getting
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:11.160]  their kids vaccinated with this stuff because very toxic and they can hurt
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:15.960]  them very badly but the bigger question is why is the government the media
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:20.400]  lying and pushing it who are these people and the answer is an eco science
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:24.840]  they want to sterilize they want us dead man I appreciate your call let's talk
[2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:29.160]  to George in Indiana George you're on the air I thank you Alex I got one
[2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:33.720]  quick comment for that boy with the baby and then a two-part quick question look
[2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:37.160]  mercury and aluminum both interact with each other you can't even walk on an
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:41.640]  airline with a thermometer they'll arrest you I mean they painted the airlines in
[2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:46.560]  Germany with the little mercury at night so the aluminum would break down and
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:52.200]  they'd fall apart in the sky you don't want that in your body here's the two
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:57.640]  part question real quick Alex since Obama declared a national emergency does
[2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:02.920]  that suspend Congress of the Constitution potentially it could now
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:07.520]  again they have engaged the executive orders and they have engaged United
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:16.240]  Nations pandemic rule six and Congress is suspended if the bankers
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:19.160]  threaten martial law if they don't do what they're told by the banker bailout
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:25.800]  Congress is suspended when President Bush signed PDD 51 telling Congress
[2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:29.880]  they're no longer involved in an emergency at the White House is in total
[2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:36.720]  control Obama didn't rescind that but even if a ten horn dictator just because
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:41.360]  Hitler said he could arrest whoever he wanted just because Hitler said he was
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:50.880]  God didn't make it so but yes under the emergency powers the continuum of powers
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:56.480]  total tyranny being here Obama has gotten to about right here he hasn't gone
[2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:00.840]  all the way on a scale of one to ten the country's under about a level six and a
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:05.760]  half tyranny right now but we're moving further down the rattle I mean sir
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:10.120]  they're putting regular army and Marines infusion centers and police
[2:12:10.120 --> 2:12:16.160]  departments around the country it's a slow incremental red dawn George and
[2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:20.720]  they're testing us because they know incremental takeover is hard to counter
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:25.680]  go ahead what scares me then is the Copenhagen Treaty if Congress is
[2:12:25.680 --> 2:12:29.640]  suspended then he doesn't have to bring it in front of Congress if he accepts
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:34.440]  the treaty then we're in and how do they do that he's not gonna announce that
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:40.920]  Congress is vestigial if Congress will pass a government takeover of health
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:45.560]  care then they'll let it have authority in that one respect in that one avenue
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.160]  and that one sequestered compartmentalized area if they'll pass a
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:54.120]  hate crime law restricting free speech then Congress and their authority will
[2:12:54.120 --> 2:12:59.360]  be followed by the National Security Council but what you said is so
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:04.600]  important just because Reagan left UNESCO the United Nations educational and
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:08.280]  cultural organization that controls the curriculum in our schools our
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:13.440]  environmental policies and everything else under the sun when Reagan got us
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:19.280]  out of that the EPA the FDA the Bureau of Land Management the Forestry Service
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:24.080]  the Department of Energy the Department of Education they all continue to
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:29.200]  follow it and I've had former top officials from all these agencies on to
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:35.120]  talk about how they just continued following the UN rules even though they
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:39.440]  couldn't get the Congress or even the president in that case to go along with
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:43.720]  it and so it's the same thing they're already implementing carbon taxes at the
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:49.720]  state county city school board level they're already putting taxes on people's
[2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:54.680]  houses and taxes on people's power and taxes on people's produce and taxes on
[2:13:54.680 --> 2:14:00.160]  television sets and taxes on toilets and taxes on water they're already putting
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:06.920]  in all these environmental rules under agenda 21 the UN writes up these global
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:11.480]  rules they then come in through the federal bureaucracies of the nation
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:20.640]  states and they then hold back federal grants and federal money if the states
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:25.200]  don't implement so when Congress doesn't get in line with the out-of-control
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:34.440]  executive and the out-of-control corporations they simply implement it
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:38.920]  through the bureaucracy and through the states I appreciate your call let's
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:44.600]  continue on with more calls here today let's go ahead and talk to John in
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:49.320]  California John you're on the air hi Alex thanks for taking my call I'm active
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:53.120]  duty u.s. Marine sergeant serve three tours in Iraq I get out of the Marine
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:56.560]  Corps and about another month and a half just wanted to say first of all thank
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:15:00.280]  you very much just started listening to you about a month ago and I was absolutely
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.600]  shocked because I was raised in a very you know respect the government my dad's
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:09.640]  next cop and you know I've served eight years in Marine Corps and as a matter
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.880]  of fact we had a guy that was just court marshaled good friend of mine about a
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:18.280]  week and a half ago I went to NCO school with and was court marshaled under
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:22.960]  treason and kicked out because he was a listener of your show and he was
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:26.960]  starting to go around talk to people in my unit and put this information out
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:30.240]  there and I mean it's fastest court marshal I've ever seen I've been in eight
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:35.480]  years seen a lot of court marshals and yeah it happened real quick he was gone
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:41.160]  in about a week and a half was that was that in the news anywhere no no no this
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:46.440]  was I'm I'm stationed in California and now this was it was done real quick most
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:49.320]  of the people my unit didn't have you heard about the Marines running
[2:15:49.320 --> 2:15:54.600]  checkpoints with the chips yeah we we've actually done some training to do
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:58.640]  that ourselves with my unit I'm getting out fortunately I have about a month
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:03.920]  left per Marine Corps policy actually so they said I mean let's go back into that
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:07.160]  in a moment but but and of course that was the state police announced that it's
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:11.000]  been in the newspapers for people that don't know Marine Corps checkpoints for
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:14.920]  drunk drivers you're not for drunks are you again setting the precedent with
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:18.600]  something that sounds reasonable but but let's expand and then of course Marines
[2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:22.960]  at the shooting in Alabama illegally and the list goes on and on what did he
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:28.200]  get you said court marshal for treason what was he saying we've got to follow
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:35.080]  our oath what was he doing basically against DOD policy what he did because
[2:16:35.080 --> 2:16:38.640]  there's a DOD policy in place the very clearly states active duty military
[2:16:38.640 --> 2:16:44.480]  cannot speak at deal of leadership to include the president and honestly
[2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:48.280]  per DOD policy I'm not even supposed to be talking to you right now but I kind of
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:54.280]  just gave up on that whole thing because it's ridiculous I mean you know he was
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:57.960]  court marshaled under I got a copy of it because I have a friend of mine that
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:02.840]  works the legal section I got a copy of it it was under treasonous acts or
[2:17:02.840 --> 2:17:07.640]  seditious acts and it's covered under the uniform code military justice and so
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:11.640]  on so forth and he was court marshal for it and there was a lot of people in my
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:14.840]  battalion that were very upset with that but I mean we had you know there was
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:20.120]  really no recourse he had put out a he was just going around talking about it
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:23.040]  he was he was writing some letters you know it's kind of thing going hey
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:28.120]  here's what's really going on and so he was doing this out in the open just look
[2:17:28.120 --> 2:17:34.000]  the same thing happened in Germany in 1936 and 7 and 38 and 39 and 40 and 41
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:39.640]  and 42 and in the end the tyrants were punished but when the government openly
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:43.400]  hands you over to foreign banks when they openly begin abolishing the Bill of
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:50.240]  Rights and Constitution read you their oath the oath is above the policy of the
[2:17:50.240 --> 2:17:56.600]  DoD but but I remember when Colonel Stephen Butler spoke out and said I
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:17:59.920]  don't know what's going on here but we trained hijackers at the defense
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:04.080]  language school and these guys were government agents so Bush at least let
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:09.320]  this happen Mohammed Atta was here they began the court marshal on him until he
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:12.920]  just said he would shut up and they dropped it that was the head of the
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:17.880]  school I mean you got hijackers your training of spies three months later you
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:21.800]  see him on the national news as Al Qaeda attacking you and you're not supposed to
[2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:25.360]  talk about it you're supposed to let the buildings get blown up you're supposed
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:31.800]  to turn your guns in you're supposed to let the UN run everything I'm so sad to
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:37.080]  hear this happen to your to your friend well I you know and he went back to his
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:40.020]  home state and he was like you know whatever I'm gonna I'm gonna keep no
[2:18:40.020 --> 2:18:44.040]  I'm doing say man you know good good on you so they didn't put him in prison for
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:48.440]  the treason of speaking out against treason they just kicked him out yeah
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:53.360]  he was he was kicked out on his on his discharge papers it was dishonorable
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:57.800]  discharge for treason for speaking out basically against the president who we
[2:18:57.800 --> 2:19:03.280]  you know have to see you know he's commander chief all that but regardless of
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:07.360]  all that you know who his commander is his commander is the Congress that's
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:11.840]  why we haven't declared war since World War two the Congress is supposed to
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:17.280]  declare the war and give the orders to the president he then executes he
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:22.840]  executes but now they've made it where he is the boss just like in Germany go
[2:19:22.840 --> 2:19:28.720]  ahead sorry that's alright I but I did want you to know I got I got your your

[2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:52.480]  crisis evidence that the US is a failed state is piling up faster than I can
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:56.800]  record it one conclusive hallmark of a failed state is that crooks are inside
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:24:59.760]  the government using government to protect and to advance their private
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:04.440]  interests another conclusive hallmark is rising income and equity as the
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:08.040]  insiders manipulate economic policy for their enrichment at the expense of
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:11.800]  everyone else the bankers are in charge forget if you're in the military

[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:29.440]  your right as a citizen to criticize what the government's doing and there's
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:34.240]  nothing more patriotic this was taught for 200 years but the last 30 or 40
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:37.440]  years it's been taught you don't criticize the government you do whatever
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:41.400]  it says it's the boss it's the officials they're the authorities we're the
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:46.400]  servants ladies and gentlemen when the army and Marine Corps are doing gun

[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:06.920]  retired police officer saying I just can't believe the government would do

[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:45.120]  don't know if he associates himself with the government so because he's good the
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:49.880]  government must be good and that's what the Germans did yeah and you know I
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:55.840]  myself as a government employee is a part of you know the US Marine Corps you
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:27:00.120]  know it took me a good the last couple months to start really realizing what
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:04.520]  you were saying and as soon as I did I went Jesus I mean my god what is going
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:07.920]  on and I you know I really started looking at I didn't believe you at first

[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:40.040]  going on here we we sworn oath I've been sworn in twice in eight years and the
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:43.880]  oath that I took said all enemies form and domestic so let me ask you this
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:46.720]  question while we have you John we appreciate you we don't we think
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:50.680]  everybody in the uniform are good not bad it's the leadership that's been
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:56.380]  taken over by foreign offshore banks Thomas Barnett is a top a war college
[2:27:56.380 --> 2:28:02.160]  professor and he brags how our military works for offshore banks and Wall Street
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:06.200]  and they clearly want to use the military against the people it was wrong
[2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:11.120]  in Waco it's wrong today and there's nothing wrong with you saying you're
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:16.720]  gonna follow your oath but but at the same time we need good men and women in
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:21.200]  the military and we don't need you to get in trouble so be sure and you know
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:26.320]  watch your P's and Q's there but at the same time you mentioned that you are
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:33.720]  aware of training to run checkpoints with the police tell us about that yeah
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:38.040]  our once again I'm not gonna put out any information or anything like that
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:43.880]  that's fine don't operational security but yeah our we we have military police
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:49.800]  that work very closely with Department of Homeland Security with border patrol
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:55.120]  also with the outer in California also with the California Highway Patrol they
[2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:59.200]  roll out on accidents they roll out on shooting calls in conjunction as a
[2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:04.720]  matter of fact military police recently in the Marine Corps as well as the
[2:29:04.720 --> 2:29:08.840]  Crosby branch of service have started to they've contracted I'm not sure the
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:13.840]  name of the company they've contracted with a civilian agency because you go
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:18.760]  on through any of the access points on Camp Pendleton now and this is I found
[2:29:18.760 --> 2:29:24.080]  this this is Marine Corps wide as well as Navy throughout the Navy they have
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:29.360]  they're getting rid of military police and they're going to a civilianized
[2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:34.400]  civilianized gate guards the guys that patrol through Camp Pendleton as part of
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:38.600]  military police are hold on two more minutes with us and we're gonna go to

[2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:31:08.040 --> 2:31:12.200]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:31:12.200 --> 2:31:16.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:20.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:24.280]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:28.560]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:31:28.560 --> 2:31:32.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:36.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:40.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:44.160]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[2:33:12.360 --> 2:33:18.520]  States they are they set up a police state they're using the military and
[2:33:18.520 --> 2:33:22.400]  police domestically they're putting regular army and Marines in police
[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:29.320]  departments it's in the newspaper but it's being very quietly announced and
[2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:32.720]  you notice the training with John we're going back to me so well I don't want to
[2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:37.560]  give up any of our operational procedures see we shouldn't be having
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:43.160]  discussions about operational procedures with the American people as if we're the
[2:33:43.160 --> 2:33:46.360]  enemies and I'm not saying John's saying that but that's what that term
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:51.320]  signifies I remember when we interviewed the Alice police chief in South Texas on
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:56.440]  the coast we interviewed Thomas Sanchez the head of emergency management in
[2:33:56.440 --> 2:34:03.160]  Kingsville County down in Kingsville down by the King Ranch I interviewed the
[2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:08.680]  city manager in Kingsville I interviewed the San Antonio police chief and
[2:34:08.680 --> 2:34:14.080]  others and they were 5050 split Thomas Sanchez had been an army intelligence in
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:18.600]  Vietnam the army came to him and said we want to covertly lease buildings in
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:25.520]  your town this is 1999 and we want to blow them up and he said are you kid in
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:30.160]  the middle of the town of more than 10,000 people next to Casa Ricardo
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:35.920]  nursing home no and they said it's national security and they went above
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:40.160]  him to the city manager in the county commissures and got it done they
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:45.760]  practiced taking over the Corpus Christi courthouse this was in the news
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:52.840]  unannounced though and dozens of black helicopters come in Delta Force night
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:59.160]  stalkers for Campbell Kentucky piloting them Sanchez tried to say no chief of
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:03.480]  police San Antonio tried to say no they came to his office with bags of money
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:08.480]  hundreds of thousands of dollars saying work with us you can have this money
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:13.720]  he'd been in the army he said this is illegal this is bribery get out of here
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:17.440]  they went and paid off other city officials and it happened and that made
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:24.240]  the Associated Press the word bribes is in there now I'm no genius we're going
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:28.480]  to you in a moment John so stay there I want to talk to you but I'd studied
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:33.080]  enough history and read enough military history books I found them very
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:38.440]  informative when I was a teenager and in college to know that when you've got
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:43.480]  covert black ops making black bag payments to city leaders and then you
[2:35:43.480 --> 2:35:48.040]  find out they went ahead and admitted to Sanchez oh yeah this is for martial law
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:55.320]  drills under presidential decision directives I went to San Antonio they
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:36:00.000]  went ahead and did the drill and we had military police this was in World Net
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:04.360]  Daily come up and confiscate our videotape Mike Hansen started arguing
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:09.800]  with them one of them pulled aside our mountain said don't resist me now that
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:18.240]  is America I'm not the enemy I'm not Al C I ate it now I've been to urban
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:23.560]  warfare drills all over the country since then we've had this is in police
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:29.400]  state 2000 in Hebron Maryland the police chief let the Marines train to take
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:35.120]  over the city they had Boy Scouts in white t-shirts riding around in a gun
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:42.960]  confiscation drill quote fighting American militia that was 1998 what
[2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:50.800]  happened in February of this year in Arcadia Iowa it was in the local paper
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:54.800]  the sergeant saying yeah we're doing a drill we're a gun dealer selling guns
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:57.720]  illegally here in the town and we go door-to-door and ask you to let us
[2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:01.680]  search your home and search your cupboards for illegal weapons now
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:05.760]  that's to acclimate the police the military and the locals there's New
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:11.040]  York Times Scouts train to fight terrorists and more second paragraph of
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:15.680]  the article states they're training to take on disgruntled veterans who won't
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:23.720]  turn their guns in read the stinking article now mid-level officers aren't
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:29.320]  told all of this but this is what the training is for now I'm gonna go back
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:34.520]  to John John whenever I talked to the police chief of Alice he was a former
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:39.840]  DEA agent he said yes there were foreign troops in the town in the drill but
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.320]  I'm not at liberty to give you operational procedure for security reasons
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:48.720]  see the foreign check Republic troops we found out they could train in America
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:53.080]  terrorizing people and under NLE09 they now admit it's to use foreign military
[2:37:53.080 --> 2:38:00.040]  in America that's FEMA.gov they can train to do that but we are the enemy so we
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:04.520]  can't know and I always could report to you we were the enemy but now we have the
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:08.920]  DHS report now we have the Homeland Security report that we broke that was
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:15.320]  given to us by law enforcement federal and state state troopers and then feds
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:22.440]  we can now talk about this because it's now mainstream media in everyone's face
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:27.280]  and we now know it is veterans gun owners conservatives people that want us
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:33.320]  out of the UN we the people declaration of independence we the people that are
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:35.960]  defending the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:40.720]  Independence are saying no to the end of our liberty the end of our freedom and
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:45.160]  if that isn't what our military is for to defend the Republic what is it for but
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:50.360]  but but John closing comments on that and I do want to ask you are you you said
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:54.400]  rolling out with police is that rolling out off base because it's been in the
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:39:00.760]  news in California Marines do go off base and aid the police go ahead yes or
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:05.440]  that's that is correct our military police handles a large section of the
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:13.560]  interstate five freeway that runs parallel to Camp Elton and they military
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:18.680]  police does tons of training every year with Satan and local agencies San
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:24.800]  Diego PD all that stuff LAPD so you know it is being done it's just it's just
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:30.520]  never really reported so it's it's under you know federal you know federal
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:36.040]  agreement with with these agencies but like I like I also said we have tons of
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:39.560]  foreign military all over Camp Elton all the time you know we get we get the
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:45.680]  Koreans that do regular training down here I've personally trained with some
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:51.360]  foreign military units who I won't name but as part of our some of our urban
[2:39:51.360 --> 2:39:55.720]  warfare stuff that we do and that's one thing it was for offshore use but
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:39:58.960]  they're more and more admitting like when I went to urban warfare drill in
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:05.520]  99 in Oakland California the Marines they're admitted including Colonel Love
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:10.520]  that this could be foreign use or domestic use and they had foreign
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:16.600]  troops with them there and I just want to expand on that and point out do the
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:22.480]  Marines in in your unit are they aware of this is a conditioning process to be
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:27.080]  deployed on a wider and wider field in the US I mean do they ask why at the
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:33.320]  Kentucky Derby regular Army run out on the field with sidearms to run security
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:39.440]  not not as much as you would hope I I've been trying to put out as quietly as
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:44.320]  possible put the word out to the to the people in my unit that I have the most
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:50.200]  direct contact with as a as it's in a leadership position as much as I can man
[2:40:50.200 --> 2:40:54.960]  and a lot of them are starting to go my god we have no idea and in looking at this
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:58.640]  and you're I really wanted to thank you again for putting at your video the
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:02.120]  fall of the Republic because that's that's what I've been using and I put it
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:07.760]  out to as many people as I can quietly on the active duty side and I've got
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:10.920]  nothing but positive feedback they'll say hey if you talk to this guy tell him
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:17.720]  thank you very much you know and we're we're we're we are going to uphold there
[2:41:17.720 --> 2:41:22.880]  are many of us who are we're going to sit here and uphold the Constitution that
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:28.280]  we swore to defend that we swore an oath that I sworn off that twice because I
[2:41:28.280 --> 2:41:32.560]  ran once did and you know that that's what we're here to do you know and if
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:35.760]  that crazy order comes down I know people right now that they're that are
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:39.200]  saying there's no way I'm gonna start rounding people up you know I mean it I
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:44.200]  know guys that have four or five years left to serve and they're going well
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:47.640]  here's the good news here's the good news that's not gonna happen because
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:51.120]  you're there and that's why the globalists are so angry that's why
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:57.760]  they're creating a new domestic military force just as big and just as strong as
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:04.000]  our military being set up by the Department of Education and by the FBI
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:16.480]  filled with big city corruption types are you guys aware of that going on very
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:21.960]  slightly I've heard very very limited information in my unit in reference to
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:29.880]  upcoming operational stuff working interagency with other elements of you
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:34.240]  know federal government things like that it's totally it's totally illegal and
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:39.440]  we've had Judge Advocate General after Judge Advocate General on to explain
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:44.280]  the media says Posse commentatus is gone it is not gone they've just blown big
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:51.720]  criminal holes in it and we can't just sit here and say no because they're gonna
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:54.920]  then bring in the illegal aliens the foreigners the criminals I know the
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:58.200]  Marine Corps doesn't have too many but the Army does and replace the good men
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:02.680]  and women with them but thank God there are good people in the military right
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:06.200]  now but you were saying when I cut you off that they're saying if that order
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.280]  comes down for gun confiscation you're not going along with it yeah most of the
[2:43:10.280 --> 2:43:15.440]  most of the guys that I work with on my side are all we're all gun owners I
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:21.600]  mean I'm gun owner you know we all have served time in either Iraq or Afghanistan
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:28.680]  I did two years in Iraq on the ground and you know I at some point you have to
[2:43:28.680 --> 2:43:31.680]  draw the line at some point you have to say you know what this is this is
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:36.040]  insane what I'm doing this this is not America this is not what we swore to do
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:39.960]  in our oath of allegiance well exactly and and the next time they try to court
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:45.840]  marshal somebody if half of the unit stood up and then more stood up they
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:48.640]  would back off and that's happened a bunch of times but they love to take one
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:53.880]  person and try to destroy them but that that individual who they court
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.240]  marshaled for saying he wouldn't violate the Constitution he's a hero he's like
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:02.440]  somebody saying no to Hitler no to Stalin no to Mao but again it's not
[2:44:02.440 --> 2:44:07.000]  Obama he's just a front man an actor reading a teleprompter it's the offshore
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:13.080]  banks engaged in treason that is who you're criticizing and I just commend
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:16.560]  you John and I want to thank you and the good men and women in the Marine Corps
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:21.720]  we know you're the salt of the earth we know even two years ago 70 plus percent
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:30.080]  of all military contributions didn't go to John McCain didn't go to any of the
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:34.680]  Democratic candidates didn't go to Barack Obama they went to congressman Ron
[2:44:34.680 --> 2:44:39.960]  Paul and so the government knows that the military by and large is awakened or
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:45.560]  good people and you would have said yes to all this treason you would have been
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:49.960]  promoted and and if you haven't seen 9-11 the road to tyranny it's free all
[2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:55.200]  over the internet you get the DVD at info wars dot com you need to get that
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:45:01.560]  film and about it's two and a half hours long but about two hours in there is a
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:06.440]  Marine Corps captain who was since retired and did quite well with the
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:10.760]  computer company in Austin I'll just leave it at that and he saw an army
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:15.560]  checkpoint in Kyle Texas on I-35 he called me showed me documents photos
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:23.000]  everything in 1988 and 89 he was kicking indoors in Norfolk Virginia with a
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:29.040]  police jacket on as an active duty Marine on gun dealers homes and businesses
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:35.000]  so sir there's a huge secret operation going on that's decades old that
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:39.440]  transcends presidents and they're they're trying to figure out how to make the
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:43.120]  military evil they're trying to figure out how to train you to do this and the
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:49.080]  good news is you failed you failed the test you're not evil and so they are
[2:45:49.080 --> 2:45:53.000]  mad even though they they have Jack Bauer the hero who tortures innocent
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:58.280]  people to get answers on 24 even though they try to brainwash you you have with
[2:45:58.280 --> 2:46:04.200]  with stood the brainwashing and so that's why the globalist consider and
[2:46:04.200 --> 2:46:07.880]  rob us and do all these bad things but they can't get the full power thanks to
[2:46:07.880 --> 2:46:12.440]  you go ahead well thank you and I know you go to colors I do appreciate it
[2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:16.320]  though and just just remember also I mean I listen to you daily as much as I
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:20.120]  can and I really wish you on XM cuz that's what I have my vehicle but they
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:25.360]  only have Saturdays okay well the I just want to make the last point that you
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:29.080]  know just remember that there are lots of us there are more probably more than
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:34.280]  you know active duty military not just Marine Corps to army you know throughout
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:39.480]  the branches of service that you know we're not we're not gonna you know
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:42.360]  we're not gonna stand for this and then as an old platoon sergeant I used to
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:46.280]  have years ago said we're not gonna go quietly into the night so well God bless
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:50.240]  you remember thank you very much Alex and keep doing what you do it's it's
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:55.480]  really getting out there thank you very much sir thank you John well in closing
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:47:00.280]  I'm gonna go to break and come back with more calls for the final hour in closing
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:07.480]  I want to say this so many great men and women have gone and been shot and
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:15.040]  wounded and killed and dismembered for the idea of America some of the wars
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:19.840]  were just some of them were in just but they believe they were doing good they
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:25.480]  had courage they had honor and men and women want to be honorable and they
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:31.200]  want to be good and they want to stand up for good but the social engineers know
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:38.320]  how to paint evil as if it's good and good as if it's evil and by degrees they
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:44.560]  corrupt you and twist you and acclimate you and sell you on doing
[2:47:44.560 --> 2:47:49.920]  unconstitutional things but I do want to say to the military and police and
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:54.640]  everybody listening to the sound of my voice this is your last chance this is
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:48:00.480]  America's last stand open world government is publicly been trumpeted
[2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:05.600]  run by private banks taxing regulating every facet of our lives the school
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:11.000]  children the boy scouts the girl scouts are openly being recruited as spies
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:16.960]  public school children are being recruited every form of tyranny if you
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:21.000]  had a checklist of a hundred things that mean tyranny every one of them has been
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:26.240]  checked I've never seen this much preparation for tyranny I've never
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:32.160]  seen this much due diligence and time spent setting up a corrupt system they
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:36.840]  know America's a big target to bring down with a with wealth and freedom and a
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:41.240]  spoiled population that believes it deserves all this stuff we are decadent
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:46.280]  and they know it's it's it's not going to be easy but they mean business and the
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:50.840]  final phases of the operation are being green lighted and we are now inside the
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:54.560]  new world order so for anybody out there that ever wanted to have a chance to
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:59.480]  really fight tyranny and for anybody who ever wanted to stand up for their
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:05.440]  nation there's no doubt this is a just war there is no doubt that we're facing
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:10.800]  corruption there is no doubt that it is growing exponentially there is no doubt
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:15.000]  we've got a hellish road we got to go down but gutting up getting focused

[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:25.320]  it's atomic age or renegade
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:28.320]  renegades and it's atomic age
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:33.280]  I ended up having that guest on for about 30 minutes that caller I know we have
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:36.640]  loaded phones I'm going to continue going to your calls but when we get an
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:40.080]  important call like that it's important to spend time with them you just heard
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:45.800]  the Marine but you don't have to believe he's a Marine or not we have the state
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:50.600]  police press release how the regular Marine Corps goes out and runs
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:55.760]  checkpoint searching US citizens it's illegal and we should stand behind the
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:55:03.000]  Marines and help them say no all right let's go to your phone calls then I have
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:08.520]  articles like this one in US less education means more h1n1 concern
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:13.440]  that's how Reuters spun this article that oh educated people won't take it but
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:17.760]  the uneducated will because they're smarter yes they're really spinning things
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:23.320]  now no educated people know to go check things out let's go ahead and talk to
[2:55:23.320 --> 2:55:29.920]  Steve in New Jersey Steve you're on the air yes Alex God bless you God bless you
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:35.440]  what's on your mind Alex I need to I want to shed some background information
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:41.520]  on the Novartis corporation the manufacturers of that vaccine okay are
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:46.000]  you there yes my dad my dad retired from that corporation over here in New
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:51.160]  Jersey two years after retiring unfortunately he suffered a debilitating
[2:55:51.160 --> 2:55:56.920]  dementia and Alzheimer's disease now I want to give you some background on this
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:02.480]  note it's called Novartis and OV a RT is there a Swiss pharmaceutical
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:10.880]  corporation okay they brought out the Seba Geige C I B a G E I G Y
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:18.920]  pharmaceutical corporation in the 90s okay okay I just figured that give you
[2:56:18.920 --> 2:56:22.720]  some background information if you want to try to connect the dots somehow but
[2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:28.200]  my dad retired after two years he suffered a debilitating
[2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:33.440]  Alzheimer's and at that time I was battling cancer myself and of course
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:38.120]  all the studies state that if you take more than three flu shots you double
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:43.800]  your chances of a neurological disorder or Alzheimer's people don't believe me
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:53.760]  let's Google right now flu vaccine Alzheimer's and three shots doubling in
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:58.320]  Alzheimer's now I'm the cook for telling people they better think twice
[2:56:58.320 --> 2:57:02.160]  before they take it let me guess your dad really believed in it all and took
[2:57:02.160 --> 2:57:07.040]  the shots well my dad no my dad didn't take the shots you have to understand
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:11.400]  this was four years ago he retired he worked for no no I understand that he
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:16.760]  never took flu shots I'm not as far as I know because you know I mean I'm you
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:20.640]  know that it's an epidemic and people that take shots getting Alzheimer's
[2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:25.560]  they have teenagers getting it now and they say that's normal now my dad worked
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:29.760]  in chemical manufacturing for that company okay years I'm just warning
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:34.160]  people about the shots but here it is flu shots and Alzheimer's go ahead but
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:38.200]  the reason why Novartis sends a chill down my spine is because I'm
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:42.200]  infinitely connected with this company because of my own personal experience
[2:57:42.200 --> 2:57:47.760]  through my dad working for them this is why when I found out that they were the
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:53.480]  ones that manufactured this this vaccine or one of them with the pharmaceutical
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:57.200]  companies that manufactured this vaccine it hit close to home for me because my
[2:57:57.200 --> 2:58:03.400]  dad retired from them interesting anything else sir no that's about it but I
[2:58:03.400 --> 2:58:06.880]  just wanted you like I said it's a Swiss pharmaceutical company that bought out
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:11.240]  Siva Geige corporation no I mean I know who they were and I know they're one of
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:15.440]  the biggest another one of the biggest in the world and all five of these big
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:21.320]  manufacturers of the H1N1 are all just leave a trail of wreckage behind them
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:28.480]  God bless you appreciate the call Steve Fred Ryan Ron Robert and others your

[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:16.000]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:20.960]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:59:20.960 --> 2:59:25.320]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:29.080]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:33.000]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems

[3:01:27.680 --> 3:01:35.800]  power I agree if you tell people make copies yourself then it's exponential

[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:34.080]  Massachusetts residents I've been in contact with some of the big wigs on
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:40.080]  YouTube as far as the Patriot movement goes I threw this idea out at a few
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:45.360]  people and I wanted to get a hold of you and I figured what better way than to do

[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:11.640]  to post on their property a sign that somewhat parodies a campaign signed when

[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.840]  know ask to put that on your property you know the campaign for them something
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:30.000]  that would resemble that in defiance to the bill that they're putting through

[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:20.600]  we're going back to your phone calls here in just a moment I'm just watching
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:25.040]  CNN during the break and there was John Kerry up there at the Council on
[3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:31.600]  Foreign Relations the CFR a decade ago we talked about the CFR and Limbaugh and
[3:08:31.600 --> 3:08:34.680]  everybody would say it didn't exist we were lying cooks and they didn't want
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:38.760]  world government even though every one of their bi-monthly publications titled
[3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:43.880]  foreign affairs calls for world government a new world order and defines
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:50.000]  it and world government is in the Copenhagen Denmark Treaty see a decade
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:54.320]  ago 20 years ago if people would have listened to all the patriots warning
[3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:57.800]  about global government we wouldn't have been robbed by the banks we wouldn't
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:01.360]  have had naft and get and been deindustrialized we wouldn't have had
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:05.080]  all this corruption the open borders the bankrupt southern and western states
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:11.080]  but instead now we are deindustrialized we are bankrupt and the very group that
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:16.360]  engaged in all of this corruption and takeover they are now wanting even more
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:23.520]  power and the very Al Gore who sold naft and get in the Larry King debates with
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:30.100]  Ross Perot that we document and follow the Republic he is the individual now
[3:09:30.100 --> 3:09:35.640]  ramming through the greenhouse gas emission treaty that totally takes

[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:01.200]  quickly now Brian for those that don't know tell them what's happening in
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:08.120]  Massachusetts. Well they passed a bill and from what I understand it's just
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:15.200]  awaiting the governor Patrick DeVall to sign it into law and it basically the
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:20.440]  verbiage if you read the bill it's just insanity what they say they want to do
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:26.920]  empty our homes all over some bogus swine flu I clearly but the way it's written it
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:32.080]  could be for other emergencies in the future absolutely in under it it just
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:37.280]  like they gave immunity to all the pharmaceutical companies with the swine
[3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:43.720]  flu it gives anybody involved any law enforcement any medical entities anything
[3:13:43.720 --> 3:13:48.800]  total immunity no matter what they do or any actions they take against the
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:54.720]  citizens you talk to you know I can go out on the streets right now and talk to
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:13:59.040]  people they have no idea this is going on ironically Massachusetts the birth
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:05.440]  place of Liberty is becoming the birth birthplace of tyranny you know and this
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:09.760]  is just an experiment because you know even an article I read this you know
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:15.320]  other states are in the process of implementing the same proposals you
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:21.320]  know what I mean so I'm just hoping that you know with your help or something we
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:26.720]  could do some kind of campaign like that which I think you know if we peptid the
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:31.920]  properties of you know most of the anyone who wake up in Massachusetts you
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:36.200]  know put this up I mean there's no way absolutely mainstream media can ignore
[3:14:36.200 --> 3:14:45.400]  this anymore sir sir I appreciate your call look that contest with the Obama
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:49.320]  Joker poster image that our listeners put up in hundreds of communities around
[3:14:49.320 --> 3:14:54.440]  the country and the world making news in Japan Germany England the United States
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:15:03.360]  South America that was big because listeners took action and I can only do
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:08.240]  so many contests so many events so many ideas we talk about Massachusetts we talk
[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:11.680]  about the force inoculations I spent the first and second hour on the flu and
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.800]  Obama's civil emergency and yes but but but people in that state need to stand
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:21.240]  up they do plan to forcibly inject they do plan to quarantine that's in the
[3:15:21.240 --> 3:15:25.360]  national executive order and the UN rules all we can do is cover what's
[3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:31.800]  happening everything else is up to the people I am powerless without the people
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:36.920]  I am absolutely powerless I mean I look at the news in front of me and I want to
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:42.520]  get into this climate taxes on dogs taxes on your cars taxes on everything
[3:15:42.520 --> 3:15:47.840]  mobile phones confirmed to be causing brain cancer mainstream news again taxes
[3:15:47.840 --> 3:15:52.840]  on everything with the carbon taxes the Copenhagen Treaty coming up I've got it
[3:15:52.840 --> 3:15:57.400]  all here we're gonna go over it that's in my next stack it we're being hit from
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:02.160]  all sides it's like dr. Paul Craig Roberts wrote an article today are you
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:06.400]  ready for the next emergency and he says I can't even chronicle how fast the
[3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:12.360]  corruption and pure tyranny is one of these forms of takeover that are
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:16.800]  happening is enough for us to completely abolish the government started over
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:21.120]  again according to the Declaration of Independence I mean it's it's just total
[3:16:21.120 --> 3:16:25.800]  takeover total looting total robbing and we ain't seen nothing yet as they say
[3:16:25.800 --> 3:16:32.760]  Ron in Vermont Ron you're on the air how you doing Alex I just want to say you
[3:16:32.760 --> 3:16:39.080]  know I appreciate you rebroadcasting your broadcast 24 7 because sometimes I
[3:16:39.080 --> 3:16:44.280]  miss things and you know I just need to hear them again and it's it's almost
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:49.840]  like a deep conditioning you know from all the years I've been watching you
[3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:57.200]  know regular television and I need that and listen listen we all need it I
[3:16:57.200 --> 3:17:02.480]  catch myself being propagandized I catch myself all the time I understand
[3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:07.580]  more I see how they operate I mean it is a fight to even be awake under this
[3:17:07.580 --> 3:17:13.400]  mind control you know I just wanted to tell you how I stumbled upon Alex Jones
[3:17:13.400 --> 3:17:19.400]  you know somebody told me to tune into prison planet dot TV or info words I
[3:17:19.400 --> 3:17:24.920]  would have said boy and that's kind of off the wall but you know I had a I had
[3:17:24.920 --> 3:17:31.840]  a chemical exposure to to a HF buffered HF which is hydrofluoric acid and because
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:37.240]  it was buffered it didn't burn so I didn't really know I had it but what
[3:17:37.240 --> 3:17:42.440]  what happened was it started to just break down my body and I've been
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:48.040]  fighting this thing and I've been looking for answers and I found Dr. Blalock
[3:17:48.040 --> 3:17:56.560]  online and I went to YouTube and he was on your show and you know I was getting
[3:17:56.560 --> 3:18:01.480]  treated and my other doctor tried to use other halogens because that's what
[3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:08.520]  fluoride is to kind of displace it but when I used iodine to get rid of it it
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:15.200]  kind of made me worse and I only found out through Blalock that if you do that
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:22.240]  then you can leach out too much and you can like re-poison yourself so I really
[3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:27.320]  appreciate you you know having him on because he really knows what he's
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:33.440]  talking about well let me break that down I mean Dr. Blalock is a top brain
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:37.560]  surgeon he invented a whole bunch of different types of brain surgeries he
[3:18:37.560 --> 3:18:42.920]  discovered excitotoxins that is now in thousands of medical periodicals I mean
[3:18:42.920 --> 3:18:49.040]  he is a top scientist and he's telling you what MSG and sodium fluoride and
[3:18:49.040 --> 3:18:54.080]  other forms of fluoride and vaccines are doing and we have expert after expert
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:58.800]  after expert none of this is my opinion but did Dr. Blalock's information help
[3:18:58.800 --> 3:19:06.480]  you any? Oh absolutely and and your your sponsors that you have I can't thank you
[3:19:06.480 --> 3:19:15.040]  enough because was it zeolite zeolite that that has been tremendous for for
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:22.200]  detox and the hemp the micro plant food and now I have a Berkey filters the
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:26.640]  thing is you know when you when you try to combat something like this because
[3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:31.840]  the fluoride itself is breaking down you know my enamel and things like that my
[3:19:31.840 --> 3:19:38.840]  teeth and my sister's a dentist and you know because of that I'm leaching out
[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:44.200]  even more mercury from my amalgam fillings well I'm glad to hear you're
[3:19:44.200 --> 3:19:47.400]  on the road to recovery we're going to break and coming back with more calls
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:53.840]  and more news on this Monday edition the 26th day of October 2009 I'm Alex Jones
[3:19:53.840 --> 3:19:58.240]  the balls in your court with all the Republic folks don't count on others
[3:19:58.240 --> 3:20:03.840]  get it make copies this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:08.280]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:12.280]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:20:12.280 --> 3:20:16.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[3:20:16.200 --> 3:20:20.200]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:24.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:29.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:20:29.400 --> 3:20:33.120]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:36.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:20:36.600 --> 3:20:40.560]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:43.720]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[3:20:43.720 --> 3:20:47.400]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[3:22:06.880 --> 3:22:12.200]  our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[3:22:12.200 --> 3:22:15.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:22:15.160 --> 3:22:20.280]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:25.560]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:30.080]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[3:22:30.080 --> 3:22:34.760]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:38.800]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're

[3:22:42.480 --> 3:22:47.560]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[3:24:08.760 --> 3:24:13.460]  the main reason Obama has declared a civil emergency so they can use the
[3:24:13.460 --> 3:24:17.720]  swine flow as a cover to put in more threat to use in centers more federal
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:23.120]  money to the states further takeover of our community unconstitutional and so
[3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:27.560]  they can give an untested experimental admittedly dangerous vaccine to the
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:32.120]  public and if he declares an emergency it scares everybody into going out and
[3:24:32.120 --> 3:24:36.440]  taking the shot that's it I don't think they're gonna have mass quarantines and
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:39.720]  lockdowns and roundups except for Massachusetts where they're past the law
[3:24:39.720 --> 3:24:43.520]  and they may try it there it's one thing to pass a law it's another thing I
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:48.040]  could claim I was emperor of the world or I could claim I was Buck Rogers it'd be
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:52.440]  another thing to actually conquer the world or become Buck Rogers or duck

[3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:16.000]  hearing any chatter about school districts our local school district here in
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:20.800]  the past couple years built ten spanking brand new buildings with the windows
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:25.480]  that don't open or close on the inside oh yeah everything's a present a lockdown
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:30.040]  the schools or federalization centers to tax and take over your towns there's
[3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:33.960]  nothing local about them unless you totally take over your communities the
[3:25:33.960 --> 3:25:37.320]  more schools we get the dumber the kids get and now they want the kids to go
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:41.280]  year-round and and stay there after hours and the state is taking your
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:44.680]  children they're announcing in Illinois and California that they want to make
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:50.200]  homeschooling illegal seeing the state owns your children at the same time they
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:54.640]  laid off two hundred and forty nine teachers while they built ten brand new
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:25:58.400]  building well that's what the local boss hogs always want the federalization of
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:04.760]  schools because that's a local payoff is those building contracts and a bit of
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:09.120]  advice to the people in Massachusetts if you don't have guns take a look at two
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:14.360]  movies real close braveheart and home alone Tim good to hear from you Robert
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:18.160]  in California you're on the air than Eric Vanessa mark and others go ahead
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:24.480]  Robert Alex how are you good hey thank you for what you're doing you know you
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:28.600]  were just mentioning about them saying they own the children now my son is
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:32.840]  we're here in San Diego and he came home and had some paperwork there and the
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:37.920]  paperwork from the teacher was saying we own you when you're in the school yes
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:42.640]  they issued those for years and and they find parents of the kids don't finish
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:48.120]  the homework it's total total garbage what I wanted to call you about it my
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:52.000]  wife caught this the other evening we were watching one of the baseball games
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:56.440]  or whatever whatever it was championships and they had a commercial on
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:03.120]  Wendy's is promoting North American beef made in North America yes all the
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:09.840]  labeling now says North American and two years ago I got a letter from the
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:16.520]  Texas Department of Labor saying you now send your forms not to the feds but to
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:20.560]  the North American Bureau so you look we're in the North American Union
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:24.480]  exactly you know can I say something to the guys in Massachusetts I think a
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:28.600]  better sign to put up would be the one that I remember as a kid when you
[3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:32.200]  wandered off into someone's private property that showed the guy with a
[3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:36.360]  barrel of a shotgun saying warning you come into my property you'll get your
[3:27:36.360 --> 3:27:39.680]  head blown off I think those are the signs we need to put up that we will
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:44.520]  defend our property and Jesus said to go out and get yourself a sword and
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:49.640]  protect your family if not you were worth worth worse than a infundale so we
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:54.600]  need to be as Christian and as Patriots defend our families and this
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:27:59.480]  tyranny has got to stop it does but look everybody's up in arms about mass
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:03.760]  saying they can come in your house and take you away for no reason what about
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:08.280]  knock-and-talk under federal grants it's not just Illinois and Massachusetts and
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:14.920]  California police state states I remember six seven years ago Dallas morning
[3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:19.120]  news in the wealthy areas they normally tested on the poor people they come to
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:23.440]  your door during the day they admit they case the home to make sure the
[3:28:23.440 --> 3:28:27.240]  husband's not at home and they say we want to search your house for illegal
[3:28:27.240 --> 3:28:33.040]  guns and they force their way in past the woman and and I mean it they're
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:36.560]  getting the police ready for when they have all these gun buybacks they did
[3:28:36.560 --> 3:28:40.240]  that in England in Australia in New Zealand before they banned most guns
[3:28:40.240 --> 3:28:46.920]  they admit what they're doing the image of all these police behind tables with
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:51.000]  people handing their guns in and then the image of the guns being smashed or
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:56.400]  thrown away being demolished being destroyed that is to condition everybody
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:29:01.240]  to seeing that image just like for at least a decade they've got billboards
[3:29:01.240 --> 3:29:07.960]  I've seen all over the United States that say report illegal guns report
[3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:14.680]  illegal guns and they show a hand with a revolver and then your neighbor thinks
[3:29:14.680 --> 3:29:18.480]  if they see a revolver that it's illegal it's not illegal but they're
[3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:22.600]  preying on this the government and the corporate controllers use the stupidest
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:29.000]  dumbest people as their minions and many Americans don't know what their state
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:31.600]  capital is they don't know the three branches of government they don't know
[3:29:31.600 --> 3:29:35.640]  the vice president they don't care they don't care they're just complete morons

[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:43.320]  next few months because I was in the film and I think it's a fair film our
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:48.200]  enemies can see things in it that they don't like about us but overall I think
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:51.520]  it shows the human side of us and it's also well done it's got Jack McClam
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:55.960]  in it Luke Radowski myself and many others it's a new world order and it
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:01.200]  hits store shelves everywhere this week and and no I don't own the film I'm not
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:04.680]  profiting from it being in stores but I think people should get it we do sell it
[3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:07.480]  though at our shopping cart only place you get it from us we do have it
[3:37:07.480 --> 3:37:10.720]  discounted with fall the Republic if you'd like to get the two films together
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:15.960]  at info wars.com it aired on independent film channel to the highest
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:20.640]  viewership they've ever gotten on the on-demand and it has a fresh look at the
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:24.840]  reality that the false left-right paradigm simply can't offer far behind
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:28.440]  the media contrived Democrat Republican political circus or government
[3:37:28.440 --> 3:37:32.680]  funded fake news PR packages are powerful bankers presidential advisors and
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:36.400]  European leaders meeting quietly and secret to advance a global agenda for
[3:37:36.400 --> 3:37:40.840]  total control it's the reality that the mainstream media refuses to cover and
[3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:44.320]  it's the unreported truth that the subjects of the film new world order
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:49.240]  will stop at nothing to expose film producers from C-Think and the
[3:37:49.240 --> 3:37:53.920]  directors Andrew Neil and Luke Meyer join us today good to have you guys on
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:38:01.400]  no long time no talk guys tell us I mean last time I talked to you a few
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:05.040]  months ago when it aired on IFC were telling me record viewership I talked
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:09.480]  to IFC they said that it was just gangbusters if that's any idea of what
[3:38:09.480 --> 3:38:13.880]  Ventura's TV show it's gonna be like on true TV it's pretty exciting there's
[3:38:13.880 --> 3:38:17.560]  actually an update to that it was it turns out it wasn't the most just it
[3:38:17.560 --> 3:38:22.280]  wasn't just the most successful one on on IFC down you know on download but
[3:38:22.280 --> 3:38:28.640]  actually an all cable vision ever for documentary for documentary so it was a
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:35.720]  tremendous success on television so that's great well I didn't know that so
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:42.400]  what what should that tell the establishment it should be pretty clear
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:46.640]  to the establishment that the people want to know about the new world order
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:51.280]  and how stupid is the establishment look your film seems to have come out at
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:55.480]  the perfect time for mainstream television because now open world
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:59.280]  governments being announced open banking controls being announced open global
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:04.320]  carbon taxes being pushed everything we talk about is unfolding publicly yeah
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:09.680]  it's I think I think that what it demonstrates is that people are
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:14.000]  interested in not looking at at cardboard cutouts or two-dimensional
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:19.120]  stereotypes of people you know that are classified as quote-unquote conspiracy
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:23.760]  theorists so you know our job with the film was to humanize people in the
[3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:28.000]  movement get to get to know them why they believe what they believe how they
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:32.960]  got to where they were in their life and what their lives were like and so you
[3:39:32.960 --> 3:39:37.360]  know we feel like it's as a really you know the clear that people want to be
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:43.280]  you know unbiased take on on subject matter your phone's breaking up a bit
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:48.280]  but absolutely let's get mr. Meyer to comment or they all just call you
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:53.320]  Davis Davis and Davis I kept on all Davis let's go to Davis number two Luke
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:57.520]  Meyer Luke your your take on all this well I I mean I think it's pretty clear
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:00.480]  it's sort of been clear for a little while now but just also with those
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:03.920]  numbers it's pretty clear these are issues that people have a hunger to find
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:10.360]  out more information about and that is like there's a general rising interest
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:17.600]  in countermainstream media information course well are you glad you made a film
[3:40:17.600 --> 3:40:22.040]  about the New World Order absolutely I mean you know it was it was an
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:26.240]  incredible experience and we got to go all over the world and I think Luke and
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:30.120]  I both learned a lot and we got to know a lot of people that you know we
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:38.240]  consider to be our friends now and it was a wild ride you know like until
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:55.400]  Virginia we've got Luke Meyer on this we're gonna reconnect to you you've
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:01.080]  got a bad landline we're gonna call you right back Andrew Luke where do you go
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:06.200]  from here where does where does the film New World Order go from here well as
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:10.520]  you said at the beginning of it I'm sorry did you lose Andrew on that
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:16.080]  expression on the same line okay well he's well then he's on a cordless or
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:22.040]  something you're on a you're on a hard line he's on a cordless okay yeah he's
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:26.120]  gonna switch phone I'm guessing he's on a cordless it's just the point is or or
[3:41:26.120 --> 3:41:29.960]  get close to the jack there okay all we play telephone we've got a little
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:36.680]  strain up to New York you guys in New York right now we're in New York yeah but
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:40.760]  where's the film at the film like you said the film just came out on DVD and
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:46.440]  and as we said before it you know it had those record breaking on video on
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:50.800]  demand numbers earlier but I don't think they do the video on demand anymore it
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:56.840]  periodically still does play on the independent film channel but it's you
[3:41:56.840 --> 3:42:01.720]  know it's it's only periodically that it runs on on there's their cycle so now
[3:42:01.720 --> 3:42:05.440]  the best way to see it is on DVD and we're just trying to get get that in
[3:42:05.440 --> 3:42:09.480]  front of as many people as possible absolutely we have a comboed up right
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:13.720]  now at info wars.com with follow Republic but expanding from there
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:18.520]  sometimes IFC films like waking life produced was a film produced by Tommy
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:24.080]  Pallotta and Rick Linklater with IFC that went on to Showtime and HBO and
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:28.680]  other places is it is there any chance it's gonna end up also being on HBO or
[3:42:28.680 --> 3:42:34.240]  other channels? I don't think so I think as far as television it's gonna just
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:38.880]  play on the independent film channel we're looking at trying to get it shown
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:43.480]  in various places in other countries but there's been nothing fully settled
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:48.640]  with that yet. Well what's exciting is is that it was number one on both fronts
[3:42:48.640 --> 3:42:55.080]  on demand and did they tell you the actual ratings or did they tell you by
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:42:59.600]  how much it beat any other documentary or because this is pretty exciting. I didn't
[3:42:59.600 --> 3:43:05.280]  get specific numbers we just got an email saying the most ever but if you I mean
[3:43:05.280 --> 3:43:09.360]  I if you look at who cable vision owns you know you could start to do a
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:13.440]  comparison against you know the kind of film that was beating out so clearly it
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:18.520]  was it was a huge getting major numbers you know. Have you guys taken your
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:28.360]  flu shot? I have not taken a flu shot. Have you taken your flu shot Alex? No I haven't so I'm
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:36.200]  asking I mean did you guys wake up making this film? Yeah you know I think
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:40.160]  there's a there's a number of things that I that about about making this film
[3:43:40.160 --> 3:43:45.840]  that that changed my life and I think one of the primary things that I think I
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:56.520]  went in not really having a full grasp of was what rights were as a filmmaker and
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:44:03.240]  actually I have to say hanging around with you Alex and Luke Rudowski really
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:08.400]  taught me a lot about what I'm allowed to do with a camera and I think before I
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:13.600]  made this movie I kind of had that attitude about police officers that I
[3:44:13.600 --> 3:44:18.360]  think to some extent the police kind of like you to have which is whatever we
[3:44:18.360 --> 3:44:36.680]  say you have to do and Andrew your your your phone went out again as much as I'd
[3:44:36.680 --> 3:44:41.560]  like to be able to hear this I'm not sure what's going on with it are you on
[3:44:41.560 --> 3:44:49.040]  a cordless phone yeah we're on wireless phone rule number one in radio don't use
[3:44:49.040 --> 3:44:53.560]  cordless phones or cell phones rule number two don't use cordless phones or
[3:44:53.560 --> 3:44:57.440]  cell phones rule number three now no it's all right I want to be able to hear
[3:44:57.440 --> 3:45:02.020]  what you have to say well I mean everywhere you went including I was
[3:45:02.020 --> 3:45:05.680]  there with you in DC you can be 200 yards away from a monument in a park and
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:12.120]  they walk over and go turn them off you go show me the law boy and and and you
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:15.600]  but you go to Soviet Russia or I guess we get the time machine you could you
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:19.720]  go to Russia today they don't do that how was this liberty and freedom but go
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:22.480]  ahead and finish up with that your phone started cutting out let's see if it's
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:25.680]  let's see if it's back I mean how many times do you have police come up and
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:29.080]  tell you to turn your camera off yeah no what I said which I don't know how much
[3:45:29.080 --> 3:45:32.400]  of you caught but was that just by the the process of making the movie but it
[3:45:32.400 --> 3:45:36.240]  really would what the thing that was most valuable to me was what I learned
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:41.240]  about what my rights were as a filmmaker and what I said I was hanging out with
[3:45:41.240 --> 3:45:46.520]  with you and and Luke really taught me about what I'm entitled to as a
[3:45:46.520 --> 3:45:50.480]  filmmaker and taught me you know that I don't have to just coward to the police
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:54.720]  and do whatever they say and that it kind of reading I you know I just on the
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:45:59.200]  side I grew up in a libertarian environment I think but like you know I
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:04.400]  kind of reinvigorated me in terms of remembering what what what my rights were
[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:10.600]  and you know what what I was entitled to and it and it kind of digs you into the
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:18.080]  fact that I think the population has been called but your but your phone just
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:23.520]  did the same thing again try to reconnect no it's your it's a cordless
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:28.520]  phone I know what it's doing it's got low batteries or something or somebody's
[3:46:28.520 --> 3:46:33.280]  using a blender next door whatever your your phone's back now you're saying what
[3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:37.520]  it really cued you in on with the public go ahead it's really cute it cued me into
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:42.800]  the fact that you know basically you know many many people sort of just get
[3:46:42.800 --> 3:46:47.680]  conditioned to assume that the police are really both the the the law and you
[3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:50.600]  should never question them and I think that's a very dangerous kind of
[3:46:50.600 --> 3:46:55.840]  attitude for a population as a whole to have and so being in you know shooting
[3:46:55.840 --> 3:46:59.320]  a film and hanging out with you and other people in the movie I think got me
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:05.880]  kind of reinvigorated about about what my rights were well well Andrew it's not
[3:47:05.880 --> 3:47:10.960]  that we're looking for trouble with the police but if you're in Austin Texas or
[3:47:10.960 --> 3:47:16.040]  you're in Dallas or you're in New York or you're in Los Angeles or you're in
[3:47:16.040 --> 3:47:20.880]  DC and you're in a park with a video camera and police march over and
[3:47:20.880 --> 3:47:25.200]  meanly tell you you can't be there and you see them doing it to tourist and you
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:31.320]  see them doing it to teenagers you know this is tyranny and I and I watch that
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:35.960]  happen to you guys quite a lot you call DC to get a permit to videotape and the
[3:47:35.960 --> 3:47:40.000]  city said rightfully there is no permit but then you tell police that and
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:43.720]  private security guards and they'd flip out I know I witnessed it a half dozen
[3:47:43.720 --> 3:47:49.200]  times with you just in two hours of shooting in DC what seeing that when
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:51.680]  you're in front of the White House and you have a conversation with the police
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:56.120]  officer there and you're trying to tell him look I'm just I'm just doing my job
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:00.120]  there's no reason why you should take any of they try to take our personal
[3:48:00.120 --> 3:48:03.800]  information who we were what we were doing all that kind of stuff and that's
[3:48:03.800 --> 3:48:07.480]  just like you know I think that that's that's that's strange and sort of a
[3:48:07.480 --> 3:48:10.840]  dangerous pair and by the way they were doing it to all the other tourists out
[3:48:10.840 --> 3:48:15.680]  there not just us but let me expand on that in your film and your film can be
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:19.000]  seen from two perspectives you just show what happened but with a camera only
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:25.760]  shows limited snapshots there were secret service guys that we saw come out
[3:48:25.760 --> 3:48:29.280]  and they had their shirts off and they were watching us and they were
[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:33.640]  following us and in the film it's like I'm crazy going their secret service
[3:48:33.640 --> 3:48:37.440]  when they were a secret service and they were following us down the block and
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:42.360]  down another street sitting behind a hot dog stand watching us some people a
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:46.680]  whole bunch of editorials have been written one of them in New Republic
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:53.200]  several others but psychology today thinks I am says I'm schizophrenic that
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:57.280]  says I may be schizophrenic and that I believe there was a Bilderberg meeting
[3:48:57.280 --> 3:49:01.480]  that I was in a hotel having a full-blown hallucination and there was
[3:49:01.480 --> 3:49:06.320]  nothing going on there now were there Capitol Police coming out were we
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:10.960]  being followed by guys on a bike was there a Bilderberg group meeting were
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:15.920]  there men behind trees at the Bilderberg group you know as far as the
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:19.640]  man on the bike like I can't confirm that but there were a lot of there were a
[3:49:19.640 --> 3:49:24.600]  lot of people around you seem like they were you know surveillance people but
[3:49:24.600 --> 3:49:28.320]  you know certainly at the Bilderberg group when we were there there were
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:33.400]  police following us and you know at the Bilderberg group in Turkey and you know
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:37.240]  I mean that was all stuff that was and that's what I think I'm not cars because
[3:49:37.240 --> 3:49:41.000]  a bunch of articles have also said I was having full-blown hallucinations that
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:45.320]  cars were following me they guys you know with short haircuts would follow us
[3:49:45.320 --> 3:49:49.400]  off Bilderberg with their cars make six seven eight turns with us was that guy
[3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:55.040]  following us in the green car spying on us definitely your schizophrenic you
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:49:58.440]  know and that's and and that's that's what that's what that's what's
[3:49:58.440 --> 3:50:02.520]  interesting about and and I can also say you know we were definitely I mean we
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:06.200]  in Istanbul we started talking to the guys that were following us almost
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:10.440]  literally don't exist Istanbul doesn't exist but but there was a Bilderberg
[3:50:10.440 --> 3:50:16.280]  group meeting correct yeah yeah right now on TV saying we were there and that
[3:50:16.280 --> 3:50:20.760]  we bullhorned her so but but psychology today do you think psychology today and
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:24.080]  others are gonna lose credibility saying that we had a full-born mass
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:28.840]  hallucination together I mean I think that's ridiculous I think anyone who
[3:50:28.840 --> 3:50:32.440]  watches that movie who looks at that and says there's no Bilderberg meeting is
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:37.680]  like literally like deluded and and and it's worse than that they talk to us
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:42.680]  like we're dumb it's a mind trick and you didn't see that yeah and a lot of you
[3:50:42.680 --> 3:50:47.600]  know people who you know often you know sometimes the film was editorialized you
[3:50:47.600 --> 3:50:52.280]  know while it was it was it was you know immoral to let these people say this
[3:50:52.280 --> 3:50:56.120]  without you know offering you know the other side of the thing or whatever and
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:50:59.880]  you know what we what we really did not want to do is have some quote-unquote
[3:50:59.880 --> 3:51:04.720]  expert commenting on stay there say no to government vaccinations say no to toxic

[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:42.640]  from the state he always plays the part of the guy fighting it when he's one of
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:47.560]  the biggest people involved in it Obama hits out at climate naysayers saying we
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:51.280]  will be defeated and that it's going to pass the Senate the next month and he's
[3:54:51.280 --> 3:54:59.920]  gonna sign the Copenhagen Denmark Treaty and what does that do well I have the
[3:54:59.920 --> 3:55:03.600]  news here I know that's the article about cell phones confirmed to cause
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:08.160]  brain cancer but this just turns out they knew in the early 90s it did that but
[3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:13.680]  so what it gets rid of the power how dogs damage the planet like a 4x4 using
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:19.900]  as much energy as a 4x4 vehicle we need a global tax on dogs that's the
[3:55:19.900 --> 3:55:26.200]  daily express folks this is the type of news that I have in front of me are you
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:31.200]  gonna enjoy your new carbon tax in your home inspections Andrew Neil and Luke
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:37.200]  Meyer no I won't enjoy that at all you know I think I think like really what
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:40.640]  and it's something that you talk about a lot Alex and some of the footage that
[3:55:40.640 --> 3:55:45.040]  that that wasn't in the actual film and I think there's a little bit of it in the
[3:55:45.040 --> 3:55:51.520]  extras is just that you know like when a society gets bloated and and and and
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:59.120]  thick it's very difficult for them to see what their own problems are and you
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:02.160]  know I think it goes back to what I was saying about what I learned about making
[3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:08.040]  the film is that you know it it's like yeah you're in a society that is too
[3:56:08.040 --> 3:56:16.720]  comfortable it's like a society it's too comfortable the bad cordless phone you
[3:56:16.720 --> 3:56:22.280]  just cut out again that's a good place to bring in Luke Meyer Luke are you ever
[3:56:22.280 --> 3:56:25.680]  gonna make any more films about the New World Order are you gonna I guess you've
[3:56:25.680 --> 3:56:31.120]  already moved on to other issues I can't say for sure I mean I feel like a lot of
[3:56:31.120 --> 3:56:35.960]  what we wanted or at least a lot of what I wanted to say about or like to look
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:41.560]  into with this film I feel like we were able to in this film so I there's not a
[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:47.360]  there's not a similar film on the coattails of this film lined up yet I'm
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:52.080]  not currently in production on the next film I'm sort of taking some time in
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:59.120]  between but I couldn't tell you for sure how we really want to get into
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:07.760]  fiction stuff yeah there's not enough of that yeah well you guys are great
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:13.520]  filmmakers and I was honored to be part of your production it's the fairest thing
[3:57:13.520 --> 3:57:17.480]  we've seen from the mainstream media yet we'll see what Time Warner tries to do
[3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:25.080]  with Ventura's TV show coming up in December and January but I think you
[3:57:25.080 --> 3:57:29.080]  guys did focus a bit on the hokey but we are a bit hokey so we did do the
[3:57:29.080 --> 3:57:33.640]  things that you have in the film and I think overall it's a good film because
[3:57:33.640 --> 3:57:37.400]  it gets the detractors to plug it and we found the films actually been waking a
[3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:41.200]  lot of people up so it was great having you guys on it's in stores everywhere

[3:58:00.440 --> 3:58:04.200]  World Order that says New World Order and there's water with a shark fin

[3:58:57.040 --> 3:59:00.440]  you will ever hear solar powered generators are now available from
[3:59:00.440 --> 3:59:04.200]  solutions from science in Thompson Illinois these emergency backup systems
[3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:07.840]  provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas
[3:59:07.840 --> 3:59:12.000]  generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces
