[00:00.000 --> 00:17.360]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.640]  it is Sunday the 7th day of August 2011 and we're here every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.440]  back Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time thank you so much for
[00:48.440 --> 00:55.480]  joining us today we are going to have open phones on the transmission in the second half of the
[00:55.480 --> 01:01.840]  first hour the entire second hour today let me first go over all of the incredibly important
[01:01.840 --> 01:07.920]  news and I do want to open the phones up on a spectrum of topics and we don't screen your
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.600]  calls but I hope that you when I do give the number out that you will call in at least give
[01:12.600 --> 01:16.760]  me your view on the topics that I'm raising and then if you want to segue or digress into
[01:16.760 --> 01:23.680]  something else that would be great but I do want to really focus in obviously on the big
[01:23.680 --> 01:31.640]  downgrade of the u.s. currency and the u.s. economy by the private megabanks that have been
[01:31.640 --> 01:38.400]  spending decades positioning our country for financial collapse and consolidation and of
[01:38.400 --> 01:45.560]  course I told you our expert guests told you that as soon as they got their debt deal done that
[01:45.560 --> 01:52.400]  they would then announce new rounds of economic implosion and that the super congress you watch
[01:52.400 --> 01:57.320]  in the fall will call for a new round of banker bailouts which is your tax money being given to
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.640]  the bankers and for the bankers being given your money you then pay them interest on the money you
[02:02.640 --> 02:07.000]  give them you you heard me right and that's what's happened with the tens of trillions of dollars in
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.640]  the last three years we're going to be going over all of that today u.s. downgrade alarm bell
[02:13.640 --> 02:21.160]  Chinese media reporting world leaders race to head off fresh market turmoil are worried about a
[02:21.160 --> 02:28.760]  total collapse in markets tomorrow that's French news agency dollar to be discarded by world CNBC
[02:28.760 --> 02:33.280]  see the globalists have to destroy the United States to build their world government after we
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.800]  empower it with our military and our taxes they're done with us that's what homeland securities for
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.840]  to make sure that we are destroyed and never rise again this is the domestic globalist straight
[02:44.840 --> 02:49.320]  jacket system similar to what the bankers have put in another third world countries Tel Aviv
[02:49.320 --> 02:56.360]  stocks fall seven percent on u.s. debt downgrade they're already open for trading a White House
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.960]  advisor blames tea party for downgrade I told you in the last month and I told you Friday that was
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.240]  going to happen and this is out of AP and anyone who doesn't basically call for the fellow reserve
[03:07.240 --> 03:12.760]  to be our supreme ruler it's your fault not the fellow reserve not the derivatives brokers not
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.360]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan it's your fault and that's why I've warned people that we've got to get the
[03:18.360 --> 03:22.440]  word out about who's going to be behind this depression so that when it happens the culprits
[03:22.440 --> 03:30.200]  don't run around grandstanding and saviors but it's on Geithner is to remain as treasury secretary
[03:30.200 --> 03:33.800]  and we've got a clip coming up where just a few months ago he said there's no way we're going to
[03:33.800 --> 03:40.120]  lose our triple a rating it was always planned to do that once they got the super congress in place
[03:40.120 --> 03:47.640]  they've had many debt increases this is all about a spectacle to get the idea of default and collapse
[03:47.640 --> 03:51.880]  in our minds and to make the america people think that it's our fault this is going to happen
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.000]  and to sell us that it's our fault instead of those that created the 1.5 plus quadrillion
[03:58.120 --> 04:05.800]  dollar to drop and s and p move safe haven demands seen here's another one china calls for
[04:05.800 --> 04:10.600]  international oversight of the u.s dollar which is really the end of u.s sovereignty or gunboat
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.000]  diplomacy against our nation suggests single global currency to replace it exactly what the
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.080]  rockefellers and others have been positioning and pushing and promoting and promoting and
[04:19.080 --> 04:23.400]  into the constitution being the answer to all our problems and all the big magazines and newspapers
[04:23.400 --> 04:28.280]  the last few months promoting the last two years a bank of the world that you pay your vat and carbon
[04:28.280 --> 04:38.920]  taxes too and we've got that news also we've got a report out of zero hedge up on prisonplanet.com
[04:38.920 --> 04:45.720]  right now uh that breaks down the fact that world leaders are moving to try to uh slow the
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.760]  implosion again it's designed to implode but they want it incrementally g7 preparing statement
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.800]  to support dollar e you in fact everything that would otherwise collapse tomorrow before asia
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.800]  open stay with us we'll get into the navy seal situation as well hundreds of nations have fallen
[05:01.800 --> 05:07.640]  to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[05:07.640 --> 05:12.920]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've
[05:12.920 --> 05:18.600]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[05:18.600 --> 05:24.840]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention full of the republic
[05:24.840 --> 05:31.480]  identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[05:31.480 --> 05:36.760]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking
[05:36.760 --> 05:41.560]  for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody
[05:41.560 --> 05:48.920]  does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of full
[05:48.920 --> 05:55.800]  of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality
[05:55.800 --> 06:04.760]  at prisonplanet dot tv the genesis communications radio network probably presents the alex jones
[06:04.760 --> 06:16.600]  show because there's a war on for your mind it is sunday my friends the seventh day of august
[06:17.160 --> 06:24.360]  2011 we're going to get into the s and p downgrade of the u.s dollar and u.s treasuries we're going
[06:24.360 --> 06:31.160]  to look at the supposed death of 20 plus navy seals from seal team six something we predicted
[06:31.160 --> 06:37.320]  here in info wars ireland also predicted we have that video up on info wars dot com you know if the
[06:37.320 --> 06:43.800]  official bin laden killing story is a fraud and it's been proven to be a fraud a lie then we have
[06:43.800 --> 06:51.000]  to look at this mysterious event and i'll tell you why i believe it stinks to high heaven coming up
[06:51.640 --> 06:56.200]  we've got a lot of other important news also the alpaso times and others are reporting
[06:56.200 --> 07:03.000]  that in federal court documents have been filed basically proving that the federal
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.320]  government was allowing cocaine to be shipped into the united states while shipping guns
[07:07.320 --> 07:12.920]  to drug cartels that they were arming to knock out the other drug cartels who were not laundering
[07:12.920 --> 07:20.760]  their money through major u.s banks like wells fargo and wakovia who are on record now a year ago
[07:20.760 --> 07:27.320]  uh admitting that they laundered 376 billion dollars in a two and a half year period and also
[07:27.320 --> 07:32.920]  ran the drug aircraft uh so that's a big story we'll be breaking down the 500 billion dollar
[07:32.920 --> 07:37.240]  of your industry that the mainstream media tells you the government and big banks aren't involved
[07:37.240 --> 07:42.360]  in you believe that ladies and gentlemen uh then you don't believe bugs bunny is a rabbit uh or that
[07:42.360 --> 07:51.400]  roger stallback played for the dallas cowboys okay now stopping right there this is a designed
[07:51.400 --> 07:58.280]  controlled implosion of our economy and i am on record telling you over and over again the last
[07:58.280 --> 08:04.120]  month that as soon as they got the quote the debt ceiling raised that they were going to go ahead
[08:04.120 --> 08:12.440]  and announce uh the acceleration of the us losing its triple a credit rating and what that means they
[08:12.440 --> 08:19.400]  have the new super congress in place that on spending bills and on taxing bills uh which is
[08:19.400 --> 08:26.360]  basically the real power of the purse uh and on cut bills bills that cut that now uh there's no
[08:26.360 --> 08:30.680]  filibusters there's no amendments the bills can't start from individual members of the house or
[08:30.680 --> 08:35.720]  senate now uh they will come out of this 12 member board with the president as the 13th
[08:35.720 --> 08:42.040]  to the council of 13 and it's now being admitted that it's undemocratic it's unconstitutional uh
[08:42.040 --> 08:47.480]  but again they need that power as the united states is bankrupted and and financially conquered
[08:47.480 --> 08:52.680]  through fraud so that's coming up now remember geithner said months ago two months ago and this
[08:52.680 --> 08:58.200]  is up on info wars dot com on fox business and other channels he said that the dollar would
[08:58.200 --> 09:03.720]  not be devalued he said that that the us would not lose its triple a credit rating when according
[09:03.720 --> 09:08.760]  to every financial expert out there the us is not at a triple a credit rating for many many years
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.880]  and neither do any of the other major currencies except for the swiss franc they're all being
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.640]  devalued by g20 concerted devaluation and will break down why that's so important but the bottom
[09:19.640 --> 09:24.760]  is now falling out we've been into depression for three years sliding into a deeper one they've
[09:24.760 --> 09:30.040]  been covering it up while the bankers hogged almost all the stimulus and bailout money for
[09:30.040 --> 09:34.920]  themselves and took it offshore where it's tax free as you know most of the fortune 100 pays
[09:34.920 --> 09:41.240]  zero taxes they take the money offshore but let's go ahead and play a clip of uh tim geithner the
[09:41.240 --> 09:47.400]  treasury secretary on fox business just a few months ago saying that there would be no downgrade
[09:47.400 --> 09:51.960]  of the credit rating here it is all right connell thank you mr secretary thanks for joining fox
[09:51.960 --> 09:58.520]  business uh is there a risk that the united states could lose its triple a credit rating yes or no
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.080]  no risk of that no risk no risk again if you look if you listen carefully now you see the
[10:03.080 --> 10:08.040]  leadership of the united states of america the president the republican leadership in both houses
[10:08.040 --> 10:13.160]  and the democrats recognizing now this is the right thing to do for the economy that we have to put
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.720]  in place now reforms that bring down our long-term deficits in ways that'll help strengthen future
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.840]  growth and that's incredibly important recognition by people and we'd like to put something in place
[10:23.640 --> 10:29.960]  as soon as we can so we can begin that process okay now you can watch the full seven minute clip
[10:29.960 --> 10:37.160]  at info wars dot com right now uh it's a titled flashback geithner said us would not lose triple a
[10:37.160 --> 10:44.040]  rating after debt limit hike now you have to understand that we have been signed on under
[10:44.040 --> 10:54.440]  the october 3rd 2008 uh quote banker bailout law we have been signed on to 640 plus trillion dollars
[10:54.440 --> 11:03.080]  of the 1.5 quadrillion and growing derivatives fraud debt instrument scam ponzi garbage and
[11:03.080 --> 11:09.880]  that it is impossible for the american people to pay 600 plus trillion or to pay 40 trillion or to
[11:09.880 --> 11:16.440]  pay 10 trillion okay now you hear about our current debt is 14 and a half trillion why then are we
[11:16.440 --> 11:23.480]  being told that we're insolvent bankrupt because we have been signed on and so has europe and every
[11:23.480 --> 11:29.160]  other major industrialized country by our leaders who've been bought and paid for by the big six banks
[11:29.160 --> 11:35.240]  we have been signed on to that debt and so as dr paul craig roberts former head of policy of the
[11:35.240 --> 11:41.000]  department of treasury has said as dr webster tarpoli economists has stated as all of these expert
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.480]  guests in my own research it's just common sense have stated that entire debt limit increase was
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.920]  a dog and pony show the republicans came forward with very small cuts two and a half trillion
[11:52.920 --> 11:58.280]  over 10 years gimme a break uh the democrats came in with one and a half trillion in cuts
[11:58.280 --> 12:04.440]  most of which didn't start till next year and then over 10 years it it's total total total
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.160]  total smoke and mirrors it has nothing to do with reality show why did they hype up the
[12:09.160 --> 12:13.080]  debt limit increase something they've done dozens and dozens like 30 something times
[12:13.080 --> 12:21.080]  the last two decades why are they making such a big deal out of it well it wasn't about the
[12:21.080 --> 12:29.960]  actual little debt increase it was about what was in that agreement huge tax increases on the middle
[12:29.960 --> 12:37.880]  class um no real cuts to corporate welfare and defense spending and things like that
[12:39.320 --> 12:46.600]  and it gives this board of 12 members six house six senate with the president as the
[12:46.600 --> 12:53.320]  13th veto power that's a council of 13 couldn't get any more creepy or cryptic that they now
[12:53.320 --> 13:00.360]  have the power to originate the legislation and they bring it to the house and senate and there
[13:00.360 --> 13:07.000]  is either a up down vote and then it goes on the state this is law now it goes on the state that
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.840]  if they don't take the offer they're given by the council of 13 that then it quote reverts to
[13:12.840 --> 13:19.320]  whatever the council of 13 have set up so that's do what we say or we'll do what we want it is it
[13:19.320 --> 13:26.280]  is incredible authoritarianism and as the Associated Press and Huffington Post and New American and
[13:26.280 --> 13:38.120]  Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano have all stated it is it it is a new branch of government
[13:38.840 --> 13:44.280]  and it is exactly what started happening in the decline of Rome where a select inter cutary of
[13:44.280 --> 13:49.560]  senators teamed up with the Caesars to basically frustrate the will the rest of the people
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.560]  and the republic is dying not with a bang but with a whimper
[13:58.200 --> 14:06.680]  so we're in deep trouble because now as as we predicted not hard to do just like three years
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.520]  ago you give them tens of trillions of dollars they won't tell commerce where the money went
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.480]  the big six banks and then within months oh it didn't fix things we need more oh it didn't
[14:15.480 --> 14:21.880]  fix things we need more in Europe in Ireland in in Greece in Spain in Portugal in Italy
[14:21.880 --> 14:26.680]  give us trillions more you give them trillions more of your tax money they don't pay off the
[14:26.680 --> 14:33.000]  derivatives debts that the public is signed on to so the economy doesn't quote fold because they're
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.040]  too big to fail and now they're going into their third round of bailouts in Europe
[14:38.040 --> 14:44.440]  up our second round here this is how they do it this is how they hold you hostage and play on
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.960]  the public's lack of knowledge about how international finance and how fiat currencies
[14:49.960 --> 14:57.640]  and how counterfeit derivative financial instruments operate and as again as i predicted this was
[14:57.640 --> 15:04.920]  not hard to see uh the Associated Press Reuters the Sunday news shows today everywhere are saying
[15:04.920 --> 15:12.520]  the tea party caused the debt downgrade the tea party the people that wanted to audit the Federal
[15:12.520 --> 15:18.200]  Reserve the people that wanted to get congress back in control of the purse the people that want
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.280]  the constitution and the second amendment i'm not saying the tea party mainline tea party are
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.200]  perfect they're pretty much republican taken over but the point is that the the republican
[15:28.200 --> 15:35.160]  compromise is two and a half trillion dollars in cuts over 10 years that has nothing to do with us
[15:35.160 --> 15:41.080]  we're losing our debt downgrade because s and p and moody's and others are a revolving door
[15:41.080 --> 15:47.720]  of operatives and corporate officers out of Goldman Sachs jp morgan bank of england city bank um
[15:48.360 --> 15:56.920]  bank of america the big six but here is the headline and we told you this was coming

[19:15.400 --> 19:20.680]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[19:20.680 --> 19:25.640]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[19:25.640 --> 19:31.080]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local

[20:06.280 --> 20:17.240]  jones broadcasting network network crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex
[20:17.240 --> 20:27.240]  jones on the gcn radio network all right i'm going to get into the mysterious shootdown with at least
[20:27.240 --> 20:33.480]  20 members of seal team six killed coming up we've also got other news like google blames human for
[20:33.480 --> 20:39.080]  robot car crash but all of the human witnesses are saying that what google says isn't true
[20:39.080 --> 20:43.080]  that's right there's already google cars with driving around without people in them
[20:43.080 --> 20:47.480]  it'll totally replace truck drivers you name it soon and they'll show statistics that it's safer
[20:47.480 --> 20:53.960]  and then make you be driven around by the robotic system that's all part of the dehumanization
[20:54.840 --> 20:59.640]  coming up we're going to be breaking that down also earlier if you're watching on prison planet
[20:59.640 --> 21:05.720]  dot tv we stream the radio show also over the web and living color at prison planet dot tv you
[21:05.720 --> 21:11.080]  saw up on screen we popped fox news up there for a moment showing huge fires burning cars you name
[21:11.080 --> 21:20.760]  it in london and that's after police reportedly shot a unarmed 29 year old man and they will
[21:20.760 --> 21:27.320]  been rioting now for two days there and i saw another report and i see these all the time this
[21:27.320 --> 21:33.640]  was from earlier in the week street vendor beaten to death riot rocks chinese city and every few days
[21:33.640 --> 21:39.400]  they attack and burn down police stations in china they have thousands of riots a year now now
[21:39.400 --> 21:45.640]  here's my question what makes americans different than brits who are normally pretty docile you know
[21:45.640 --> 21:50.520]  pretty gentlemanly hence you know the brits are gentlemen then i guess there's that stereotype
[21:50.520 --> 21:56.760]  or slash soccer who against whichever one you want to pick up on but all the time we see people
[21:56.760 --> 22:01.240]  shot and killed or beaten to death by police in the u.s and the police that don't even get in
[22:01.240 --> 22:08.440]  trouble when it's on video and i keep getting calls about this and comments and cover it cover it
[22:08.440 --> 22:14.040]  even though i've probably covered this 15 times but it does show folks are outraged by it and now
[22:14.040 --> 22:20.680]  police have spoken out behind the scenes and this has been covered by kfi and other stations out in
[22:20.680 --> 22:27.000]  la that they've seen the the surveillance footage that the police won't release both from the squad
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.680]  car and a city camera reportedly with a city controller camera controller zoomed in on it
[22:32.680 --> 22:38.040]  where they beat the guy that didn't resist taser team six times and beat the butts of their guns
[22:38.040 --> 22:43.160]  into his head until he died well he died a day later and they were reportedly doing knee drops
[22:43.160 --> 22:49.400]  into his head over and over again uh the nonviolent uh homeless person and hey they needed to you
[22:49.400 --> 22:55.080]  know let off some steam that's what they said about abu graib uh i got a clip of limbaugh saying
[22:55.080 --> 23:01.480]  abu graib is letting off some steam uh and so that's the new america i mean and and people
[23:01.480 --> 23:07.880]  by the way his dad is a retired police officer and says he's very ashamed of ever being associated
[23:07.880 --> 23:12.760]  with the police department because he's so shocked that they want him to release the tape
[23:12.760 --> 23:17.560]  nobody's in trouble what two three weeks into this and uh even though people are now leaking
[23:17.560 --> 23:22.760]  the fact that it is just brutal he just lays their blood just running out and they just like
[23:22.760 --> 23:27.720]  children that think they're playing double you double you have wrestling just start knee dropping
[23:27.720 --> 23:34.120]  into his neck blood shooting out reportedly blood was splattering up to uh 10 feet away on police
[23:34.120 --> 23:40.840]  officers faces that only seemed to but i actually support this because i'm not anti law enforcement
[23:40.840 --> 23:45.880]  and i think that they need to let off some steam of course i'm being sickeningly sarcastic and
[23:45.880 --> 23:50.600]  illustrating absurdity by being absurd uh the point is is that we have a lot of good police in
[23:50.600 --> 23:55.320]  this country but we also have a lot of really bad police forces where thugs run them and where they
[23:55.320 --> 23:59.560]  can get away with bloody murder and it's called tyranny just like we know there's tyranny in
[23:59.560 --> 24:04.360]  mexico or north korea and we know that when you live in a tyranny the tyranny is personified by the
[24:04.360 --> 24:11.320]  uniform uh once guardians of the republic now guardians of the new world order uh in many many
[24:11.320 --> 24:20.840]  cases uh so uh there i am covering uh that case again of kelly thomas 37 um no weapons on him no
[24:20.840 --> 24:27.560]  nothing and uh that's just the end of it and it was all witnessed by people that also saw it um
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.600]  and there's grainy footage shot from somebody's cell phone about 60 feet away and he begs for his
[24:32.600 --> 24:37.640]  dad for a while until he succumbs to gurgling blood he's screaming daddy daddy help me and
[24:37.640 --> 24:43.000]  they just keep laughing and tazering and then slaughtering hardcore all right well there you go
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.520]  and don't worry the banks are going to slaughter your pension funds police you think you've been
[24:46.520 --> 24:51.400]  given all this power for no reason i see the reports all over the country we're in texas
[24:51.400 --> 24:56.120]  in small towns everywhere the police even go on camera admit it they pull over old women young
[24:56.120 --> 25:01.160]  people they don't care you got 500 bucks in your wallet they take it you could even have the atm
[25:01.160 --> 25:07.160]  receipt they say we don't care we're taking your cash and uh they're so proud they go on tv and admit
[25:07.160 --> 25:12.120]  it and just like in new york we have footage of police coming up to peaceful demonstrators and
[25:12.120 --> 25:16.040]  saying we're going to say your bags a bomb and your camera's a gun you're going to go to jail
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.880]  for terrorism leave you're not allowed to protest and they say but i even have the permit and they
[25:19.880 --> 25:24.840]  say i don't care i'm going to say you got a bomb and a gun and they they say okay i'm leaving and
[25:24.840 --> 25:32.200]  the cops let them leave with that on tape i mean that that again that is a felony to sit there and
[25:32.200 --> 25:37.080]  say i will call them a fake bomb threat i will have you arrested and then grab the camera and say
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.600]  this is a gun while it's still running and not even care that it's on tape and say oh you've
[25:40.600 --> 25:46.760]  agreed to go now leave i mean that is committing hardcore felonies right out in front of everyone
[25:46.760 --> 25:53.400]  but see criminals run america now at every major level and so they want a criminal force just like
[25:53.400 --> 26:00.760]  stalin released the violent prisoners out of prison and made them his top lieutenants and
[26:00.760 --> 26:07.560]  that's who government now looks for i saw the footage of that raid on a public uh organic store
[26:07.560 --> 26:12.920]  that's been open for many years they confiscated papayas watermelons raw milk cheese that by the
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.960]  way is sold at supermarkets all over austin the same brands not even illegal but they don't care
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.560]  they'll show a jury at armed raid the jury will say well you raided them with guns that means they
[26:21.560 --> 26:27.800]  must be bad men and the footage of the cops that we posted on info wars dot com uh and that the
[26:27.800 --> 26:33.800]  drudge report linked to back on what wednesday the police look like something out of central
[26:33.800 --> 26:39.320]  casting of gang bangers all of them didn't matter if they were white hispanic black all of them
[26:39.320 --> 26:45.560]  look like what you would think of as a hardcore violent conflict i mean they looked evil their
[26:45.560 --> 26:53.640]  eyes look vicious they look slimy uh their their mannerism uh their enjoyment i mean it it's simple
[26:53.640 --> 26:59.000]  i mean you know when somebody gives you the willies these guys looked they you know these guys didn't
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.200]  look like clark kent or something you know that arc type will cop type they looked they didn't look
[27:04.200 --> 27:08.680]  like somebody like sheriff mac who's confident nice and you get a friendly feeling from but also
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.720]  you know comes off like a strong guy no no no they didn't they don't they don't look like a lawman
[27:13.720 --> 27:18.760]  they looked like criminals like if these guys were walking down the street because our cops don't
[27:18.760 --> 27:23.880]  look so criminal here in austin if these cops were walking down the street in austin texas
[27:23.880 --> 27:31.560]  uh at night i bet cops would pull over and talk to them i mean they just reeked reeked of i'm a i'm
[27:31.560 --> 27:38.360]  a slime bag they're they're whole they're whole demeanor and then there's the footage of them
[27:38.360 --> 27:46.440]  smashing the watermelons and the papayas and the uh and dumping the milk in the gutter i just uh
[27:46.440 --> 27:50.440]  and then you can't have a all over the country they're announcing we've got to have inspections
[27:50.440 --> 27:55.400]  of your home garden you might be growing drugs guilty until proven innocent uh you can't have a
[27:55.400 --> 27:59.880]  garden uh you can't have one in your front yard well there's no law but we're gonna arrest you
[27:59.880 --> 28:05.400]  you can't have that tomato box now the good news is in oak park michigan everybody rebelled and
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.480]  it's reported that thousands began planting gardens in their front yard so they finally
[28:09.480 --> 28:17.080]  backed off they were uh on record coming to a raster for 93 days in jail but this is the mindset
[28:17.080 --> 28:22.520]  of a control freak government that doesn't think it's the servants it thinks it's the masters now
[28:23.640 --> 28:30.120]  i haven't even gotten in to the economy yet but in the interest of time i'm going to get more into
[28:30.120 --> 28:35.400]  what a downgrade means where the bankers are going to lead us how they're psychologically
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.440]  preparing us that it's our fault that we're going to have a total depression if they continue on this
[28:40.440 --> 28:47.720]  course and uh consolidate and engage in what is known as austerity as obama says his job now is to
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.440]  get us all to chip in unless your general electric running his economic council that's exempt from

[33:08.280 --> 33:20.280]  network
[33:20.280 --> 33:32.680]  i can go into the control room and look at the gauges of traffic visitors to info wars
[33:32.680 --> 33:41.080]  dot com and prison planet dot com it is surging near a record level right now and of course a
[33:41.080 --> 33:47.240]  massive amount of people listening to the free audio streams at info wars dot com not just the
[33:47.240 --> 33:54.280]  am and fm dial global shortwave and satellite of course and i do the sunday show four to six
[33:54.280 --> 33:59.320]  p.m because there's so much news i'm not going to just sit idle on the weekend i work around the
[33:59.320 --> 34:07.240]  clock but we also come in weekdays 11 a.m to 2 p.m central 12 to 3 p.m eastern adjust that for
[34:07.240 --> 34:13.720]  mountain or pacific um now i want to give the toll free number out to talk about what's happening
[34:13.720 --> 34:22.120]  with our economy and to also then get into the whole seal team six situation uh the biggest
[34:22.120 --> 34:29.960]  one day death of us troops in the close to 10 year war it'll be 10 years coming up in september
[34:31.320 --> 34:36.840]  and of course we predicted that you would see the rest of seal team six killed off
[34:37.880 --> 34:42.520]  and we're going to be getting to some of those predictions here in a moment and i'll break down
[34:42.520 --> 34:50.440]  exactly why we've been basically going that direction and it's of course because the official
[34:50.440 --> 34:57.240]  story of the bin laden killing is as phony uh as uh george harbert walker bush's pledge read my lips
[34:57.240 --> 35:04.600]  no new taxes or or obama saying he wouldn't hire any lobbyist or bill clinton saying i didn't have
[35:04.600 --> 35:11.480]  sex with that woman or richard nixon saying i'm not a crook uh no the official story has been
[35:11.480 --> 35:15.160]  proven to be a fraud we don't know exactly what happened with the whole bin laden raid but it's
[35:15.160 --> 35:21.480]  been admitted every facet of it to be a lie and so we predicted that seal team six would start
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.600]  going bye bye we're going to get to that uh in a moment and break down exactly exactly why
[35:27.400 --> 35:32.920]  and no listeners are tuned in to find out my view on that but i also want to discover your view
[35:32.920 --> 35:37.960]  and so the toll free number to join us it's a different number on the sunday show than the
[35:37.960 --> 35:44.200]  weekday show uh is eight seven seven seven eight nine a le x eight seven seven seven eight nine
[35:44.200 --> 35:51.640]  two five three nine and we will get you up and on the air uh but but first i just in case you
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.480]  just joined us i want to play geithner from two months ago on fox business saying that we would
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.560]  not lose our triple a rating uh but he said we would lose it if we didn't up the debt limit
[36:01.560 --> 36:07.480]  and then within one day they'd spent most of the debt limit increase one day they'd already spent
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.680]  half of it and then within two days it was all gone but uh this is the trap they get you in
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.760]  so um let's go ahead and play that club here it is all right connell thank you mr secretary thanks
[36:18.760 --> 36:25.000]  for joining fox business uh is there a risk that the united states could lose its triple a credit
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.280]  rating yes or no no risk of that no risk no risk again if you look if you listen carefully now
[36:30.280 --> 36:34.520]  you see the leadership of the united states of america the president the republican leadership
[36:34.520 --> 36:40.440]  in both houses and the democrats recognizing now this is the right thing okay economy that we have
[36:40.440 --> 36:46.040]  to put in place now now they had all these other debt limit increases in the past so how was this
[36:46.040 --> 36:51.480]  one different well it was a bait and switch it wasn't about the debt limit increase okay that was
[36:51.480 --> 36:57.880]  pretty much a uh standard position uh it's it's all the tax increases and things they want in there
[36:57.880 --> 37:03.720]  but that itself pales in significance to the new legislative body that was created well everybody's
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.120]  we got to get a deal we got to get a deal can't they get together can't they get something done
[37:08.120 --> 37:13.880]  the founders actually said separation of powers is good gridlock is good because if they could
[37:13.880 --> 37:19.560]  ram things through powerful men in history have a tendency of wanting to turn themselves into
[37:19.560 --> 37:25.000]  dictators and even if the first generation doesn't do that they amass more and more power into their
[37:25.000 --> 37:33.160]  hands until it always moves into a dictatorship and now this country on all things monetary
[37:33.160 --> 37:37.400]  and uh harry reads on records saying it affects all legislation including guns
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.720]  so the leader of the senate says it affects everything but the way i read it strictly
[37:42.440 --> 37:47.960]  it only deals with spending cutting taxes but that's pretty much uh you know the most powerful power
[37:47.960 --> 37:55.880]  right there alone and so now a super congress six house six senate and el presidente a total of 13
[37:55.880 --> 38:01.720]  they bring forward bills not when you watch schoolhouse rock as a kid that any member can
[38:01.720 --> 38:07.000]  introduce it and it's debated and there's amendments and there can be fellow busters no no no no
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.880]  sure for 200 plus years we've had that but who needs that in fact for 200 years of the congress
[38:11.880 --> 38:17.160]  had to authorize war but ah who needs that as obama said four months ago i've got the un
[38:17.800 --> 38:22.680]  who needs congress to pass carbon taxes the atf couldn't get them a couple months ago to pass
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.640]  new gun rules gun laws and so now they're just implementing them outside of law in the nr a
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.520]  suing them over it they just come in and say uh you just do what we say because guns are being
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.440]  shipped to mexico and the gun dealers say but wait a minute you're the one shipping them down
[38:36.440 --> 38:40.760]  there to blame the second amendment they're like we don't care we got caught and it's coming out in
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.480]  federal court the government's bringing in the cocaine that's in the el paso time chicago tribune
[38:45.480 --> 38:50.200]  i'll be getting to that later in the next hour if i have time i covered it a lot on friday and
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.160]  over the weekend we have a lot of special reports up at info wars dot com and i'm now of course doing
[38:55.160 --> 39:01.800]  info wars uh special report hour long and two hour long video reports and then starting september
[39:01.800 --> 39:06.520]  first we're gonna have a 30 minute uh show every night new show that's going to cover a lot of
[39:06.520 --> 39:12.120]  information condensed down uh seven p.m central and that of course will debut at prison planet dot
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.720]  tv we've already got literally scores of cable and satellite networks wanting to pick it up a lot
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.280]  of them wanting to just pick up the regular internet stream of prison planet dot tv and i've
[39:22.280 --> 39:27.880]  authorized some to do that mainly in england europe but uh some in the u.s show we're developing all
[39:27.880 --> 39:33.240]  of that towards that point but again it's the prison planet dot tv members that make all of that
[39:33.240 --> 39:42.440]  possible now let me get into the mysterious uh report of the helicopter being shot down
[39:42.440 --> 39:51.320]  uh and a few days ago and it being the highest number of u.s forces ever killed in the close to
[39:51.320 --> 39:57.880]  10 year action in afghanistan to secure the 500 billion dollar a year uh opium fields and now
[39:57.880 --> 40:02.680]  they put it on fox news singing in abc news that the troops give them the fertilizer grow it load
[40:02.680 --> 40:08.040]  it on trucks and ship it out how you mean to play those news clips again that's how dumb they think
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.680]  you are but that's why they're there pat tillman spoke out against it and they had to take him out
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.160]  they said al-qaeda killed him and then later it was admitted the military killed him
[40:17.160 --> 40:22.600]  and the headcorner said it was homicide but again the government's good for i guess the football
[40:22.600 --> 40:27.480]  star had to die for the for the patriotism because you're not patriotic if you don't bring narcotics
[40:27.480 --> 40:33.880]  in now uh continuing here and we've got a clip coming up in a little while i know i made these
[40:33.880 --> 40:39.400]  predictions over and over again uh we haven't been able to dig out the videos or audio yet
[40:39.400 --> 40:45.800]  but i'm looking for listeners to do that i'm sure it's in our email inbox but uh info wars ireland
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.120]  our spinoff over there did predict silt team six demise and the video is time stamps and i remember
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.320]  the article back on may 11th and we have a link to that and i'll be playing a clip of that a little
[40:57.320 --> 41:06.120]  bit later uh but here's the issue we know that the official bin laden killing was a hoax
[41:06.840 --> 41:12.920]  dr steve pacenek who wrote the book on psychological warfare for the pentagon and who was the
[41:12.920 --> 41:19.320]  under assistant secretary of state uh back in 2002 laid out how bin laden had died from marfans
[41:19.320 --> 41:25.000]  and kidney failure and had been treated by american doctors in the cia later that actually came out
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.720]  on cbs news that he had been treated by american doctors before and after 9 11 i then had two other
[41:31.720 --> 41:36.360]  white house sources because a lot of them lived here part time when bush was in office tell me
[41:36.360 --> 41:41.960]  the same thing and then separately another source known by me very well talk to another
[41:41.960 --> 41:47.960]  white house source um and i'm on record those articles were written at the time in 2002 those
[41:47.960 --> 41:58.120]  interviews were done now um the the the issue here that i'm getting at is if the official story
[41:58.840 --> 42:05.240]  of obama and the way they claim that they killed bin laden is a fraud then we have to look closely
[42:05.240 --> 42:12.840]  at silt team six people dying and i need to look at it with a little bit of a uh a critical eye
[42:12.840 --> 42:19.320]  you could say now now let's just briefly review what happened uh they they released a situation
[42:19.320 --> 42:25.960]  room photo and said obama was watching bin laden be killed live on video cam connections with the
[42:25.960 --> 42:31.080]  seals and you could see it with stage photos with hillary's hand over her mouth and all the men acting
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.240]  tough you you could tell a stage photo they later admitted it was a stage photo they weren't watching
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.400]  it live then they claimed bin laden was in a big shootout with them and used his wife as a shield
[42:39.400 --> 42:45.480]  that wasn't true then they claimed they threw him in the ocean as is islamic uh you know he has cement
[42:45.480 --> 42:51.640]  shoes now uh it went on and on and on and the whole story was a fraud then eyewitnesses said
[42:51.640 --> 42:59.320]  the seals got on the helicopter and it blew up now we predicted stay with us we'll we'll break it down

[47:35.720 --> 47:41.480]  to high heaven because you understand the modus operandi of the different organizations that are
[47:41.480 --> 47:51.880]  involved you understand propaganda and i know i predicted many many times that they would kill
[47:51.880 --> 47:58.120]  large portions of seal team six because it's already super secretive they don't even know
[47:58.120 --> 48:05.000]  how many units are in it governments routinely flush soldiers down the toilet they also do
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.200]  something called sheep dipping that's been declassified where they stage the deaths of a lot of military
[48:10.200 --> 48:16.600]  who don't really die they give them plastic surgery change their ears even get rid of
[48:16.600 --> 48:23.400]  their fingerprints or alter them so they can carry out clandestine operations more than 4 000
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.920]  us troops died from 60 to 64 in vietnam and it's now been declassified that they would send letters
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.800]  home that they died in automobile accidents helicopter crashes plane crashes sometimes there
[48:33.800 --> 48:39.320]  would be real plane crashes and they just tagged their names onto it other times they would just
[48:39.320 --> 48:45.480]  claim that they died in an accident in a warehouse the pallet had fallen over on them they would
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.760]  uh you know ship a sealed casket back home with a rotten body into somebody else or
[48:50.760 --> 48:55.000]  you'd really would have died in combat and i mean there's all sorts of scrambling going on
[48:56.440 --> 49:01.240]  and uh dr pacenic and others that we've interviewed you know have broken down the fact this is a
[49:01.240 --> 49:10.440]  complete hoax and a fraud we've gone over that now we i have two military sources off air uh
[49:10.440 --> 49:14.520]  who i don't know but have been accurate in the past and then another source who's called in on
[49:14.520 --> 49:19.080]  the show and has been very accurate who told us that micristal was going to be stepping down from
[49:19.080 --> 49:26.120]  the scandal months and months before he did um all confirmed that reportedly seals were killed
[49:26.120 --> 49:30.360]  when the stealth helicopter again another example there's a lot of stuff we don't know about there's
[49:30.360 --> 49:38.280]  a lot of secrecy when that big troop carrying um a helicopter uh blew up now pakistani tv and i
[49:38.280 --> 49:44.680]  witnesses said that nobody was shooting at it they got off got back on and it blew up on the ground so
[49:44.680 --> 49:49.320]  we don't know if it really crashed by pilot error or if the helicopter failed or if it was shot at
[49:49.320 --> 49:53.640]  or if it blew up with a bomb on it but you send the seals in to think they're killing bin laden
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.560]  their cia safe houses all over the area that's now admitted it's right by a pakistani military base
[49:59.560 --> 50:04.520]  that the u.s government admits they work closely with this guy's hiding out in this thing the whole
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.080]  story changes over and over again i mean do you really believe they threw him in the ocean and
[50:09.080 --> 50:13.080]  and they admit he had a big firefight with folks and that wasn't true and obama was watching it
[50:13.080 --> 50:18.440]  and that wasn't true and fake photos and the whole way it was rolled out as a pr stunt as an election
[50:18.440 --> 50:26.440]  ploy his approval rating went up that's what we're dealing with here and so then you get the biggest
[50:26.440 --> 50:32.760]  one day loss of life in the close to 10 years of the afghanistan war they call it a conflict or
[50:32.760 --> 50:40.760]  kinetic action and we're to believe that its seal team elements of seal team six flying around on a
[50:42.200 --> 50:49.480]  national guard helicopter and i've got a lot of military contacts here and i've been looking at
[50:49.480 --> 50:55.160]  a lot of the military sites and uh they're not buying it they're saying almost immediately after
[50:55.160 --> 51:00.280]  news of the crash began to spread we were placed in a internet and phone blackout that means
[51:00.280 --> 51:05.000]  communications with family friends and others back home is on real time is prevented until
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.360]  further notice the shinook shot down belonged to a national guard unit which is causing people to
[51:10.360 --> 51:15.560]  whisper an astonishment because that's not used by them uh why were some of the most elite american
[51:15.560 --> 51:20.760]  military in such large numbers tooling around a national guard helicopter right over the capital
[51:20.760 --> 51:26.120]  city uh continuing people were working in a military base in cobble airport north of the
[51:26.120 --> 51:30.600]  city where the helicopter flew from say the story hit the news too quickly i was told it
[51:30.600 --> 51:36.200]  popped up on cnn way too fast yeah within minutes showing again it was a staged event now
[51:38.280 --> 51:44.440]  we don't know if they were killing off some of the members that were part of seal team six
[51:44.440 --> 51:49.400]  that were involved in the raid or were they people speaking out about the official story
[51:49.400 --> 51:56.920]  not being true or did they just tag on the seals is dead who really died when the helicopter
[51:56.920 --> 52:04.200]  crashed and blew up months and months ago during the obl some have been lottery we don't know
[52:05.320 --> 52:11.080]  we don't know but just to believe them out of the gates and to believe the biggest one day
[52:11.080 --> 52:19.160]  loss of life in the whole again almost 10 year war would be seal team six first they said it
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.400]  wasn't still team six then they said it was still team six and it was people that were involved in
[52:23.400 --> 52:27.720]  the bin Laden raid then they said it wasn't a classic where they changed the story a bunch
[52:27.720 --> 52:34.200]  to just confuse everybody then people say well uh the Taliban took credit ladies and gentlemen i
[52:34.200 --> 52:38.200]  see ap articles all the time where they said there's a new bin laden tape or a new bin laden text
[52:38.200 --> 52:41.800]  at the bottom they say it came from a message board and a day later they admit it wasn't real
[52:41.800 --> 52:49.560]  you know they said that the al Qaeda did the shooting in Denmark excuse me in Norway um with
[52:49.560 --> 52:58.520]  Bravik was it true so you see this over and over again and the whole thing stinks to high heaven
[52:58.520 --> 53:04.520]  that's my point and it needs to be investigated now uh here's a clip from the great folks that
[53:04.520 --> 53:09.240]  we've interviewed before and they've just done great work uh info wars ireland the article
[53:09.240 --> 53:14.440]  by tony cartelucci at info wars dot com and you can go watch the full video where it's time stamped
[53:14.440 --> 53:23.560]  back in may um and it goes on info wars ireland predicts seal team six demise video is deklin
[53:23.560 --> 53:28.520]  oh shea of info wars ireland predicting the seal team six members that rated the compound
[53:28.520 --> 53:34.040]  in pakistan were not long for this world and would be liquidated to tie up loose ends now i put a
[53:34.040 --> 53:40.120]  video out yesterday because i can't keep track of all my predictions and i told you i mean over
[53:40.120 --> 53:45.720]  and over again that that that they would either have a fake crash to cover up for those that died
[53:46.600 --> 53:51.000]  when reportedly the pakistanis said there were dead bodies everywhere the pakistani
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.240]  military came and gathered them up and basically blackmailing the u.s government with it you saw
[53:55.240 --> 54:01.480]  that big diplomatic fight breakout right after that happened or whether they were knocking out some of
[54:01.480 --> 54:08.200]  the other team that was speaking out about it being a fable dead men tell no tales now remember
[54:08.200 --> 54:12.280]  pat tillman wrote letters home that he was going to come home and be anti-war and that he was angry
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.600]  about opium and all the rest of it and people are like oh that's ridiculous there's no opium being
[54:16.600 --> 54:20.840]  produced by our troops now because they can't hide it because the troops are speaking up they just go
[54:20.840 --> 54:24.360]  hide it in plain view so they have the marine corps colonel come out and say we give them the
[54:24.360 --> 54:32.040]  fertilizer grow it ship it out fox cnn abc news just go to youtube and type in us troops growing
[54:32.040 --> 54:39.960]  opium in afghanistan you'll get bbc just dozens and dozens of newscast now again they killed pat
[54:39.960 --> 54:44.360]  tillman just to cover this up and later it turned out they did kill him and they covered it up so
[54:44.360 --> 54:49.480]  they'll kill their poster boy over this stuff of course of course they'll kill cell team six or maybe
[54:49.480 --> 54:53.720]  nobody even died on the helicopter or maybe it was some regular army folks they say some afghans
[54:53.720 --> 55:00.280]  are on it with this much lying we don't know but the fact that it's still team six is very suspicious
[55:00.280 --> 55:09.160]  let's go to this clip of info wars uh ireland uh deklin oshae breaking it down for four years
[55:10.520 --> 55:19.960]  i'm not quite sure uh that in the fairy tale story of a sea of operation that they would
[55:19.960 --> 55:24.360]  whether they were ordered uh to go in and shoot to kill whatever individuals were
[55:25.240 --> 55:31.880]  in a so-called complex in in arab and in pakistan whether those individuals are in the know or not
[55:33.160 --> 55:40.760]  seal team six if you are quite aware that osama bin laden he couldn't be he's dead for
[55:40.760 --> 55:46.760]  nine or ten years that he wasn't there and you were briefed to keep your mic shut so whatever
[55:46.760 --> 55:53.000]  well i highly advise you to enjoy your lives and go out and go out to the local pub in caronado and
[55:55.240 --> 56:01.320]  be nice to your family and and to your loved ones and party when you can because you're dead
[56:01.320 --> 56:11.560]  me very soon if you're aware but quite possibly you went in and um there were three possible scenarios
[56:11.560 --> 56:19.720]  that you were briefed that indeed uh osama bin laden is there and perhaps they had a
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.320]  a double or whatever somebody was shot you might think that you shot osama bin laden you did not
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.720]  and it's highly all right well there you go and again i know i made all those predictions as well
[56:33.720 --> 56:37.720]  and folks would dig those up that always is good for the sheeple to see that and this stuff's not
[56:37.720 --> 56:42.680]  hard to predict once you know the pathology of the globalist remember uh just in last month i said
[56:42.680 --> 56:46.280]  they're going to raise the debt limit then they're going to get rid of the triple a rating and that'll
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.200]  just be the beginning of dollar devaluation and then they're going to blame the tea party
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.200]  well the white house is doing that today now i'm going to come back in the next hour go directly
[56:54.200 --> 56:59.880]  your calls left gone to all 13 or 14 that are on the board from ben to vencent from george

[57:08.760 --> 57:15.080]  in other areas but remember private jessica lynch turned out she hid she wasn't a hero but they wanted
[57:15.080 --> 57:19.880]  to promote that to get women in the military when members of her unit that survived began to speak
[57:19.880 --> 57:27.160]  out who were the heroes they killed five of them in one week inside the us in one case in phoenix
[57:27.160 --> 57:32.360]  the guy was cooking food in his backyard at a barbecue a guy in a black uniform with a black
[57:32.360 --> 57:37.960]  mask popped up double tapped him in the head so and then she later came out and said look it's all
[57:37.960 --> 57:42.840]  fake it's all fake because by the way we put the announcement out we told her go public
[57:42.840 --> 57:45.480]  that they're going to kill you all right we'll be right back stay with us

[59:09.320 --> 59:15.720]  the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention for the
[59:15.720 --> 59:22.040]  republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshort cartel held bent on destroying

[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:30.280]  horrible news the downgrading has begun they're blaming the tea party not the bankers not the
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.480]  derivatives the whole seal team six situation very very suspicious i got a lot of other news
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.360]  government drug dealing we're going to be getting into it's not fun to have to expose these people
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.920]  hopefully my public position will protect me and your prayers will but somebody's got to stand up
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.320]  against these people because they're still on the pension funds they're imploding the country
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.280]  total criminals are running things and people've got to stop being naive if we're going to reverse
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.880]  any of this ben and tennessee you're on the air welcome thanks for holding hey alex thanks for
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.160]  taking my call and thanks for all the great work you're continually doing uh i wanted to get to
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:17.000]  just the point you just made um about um this morning on the sunday uh uh talk shows uh political
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.840]  talk shows i noticed uh a threat a common threat running uh through them uh especially on abc and
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:32.040]  nbc of course we know nbc owned by general electric um one you had alan green span on nbc
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.960]  saying no we're not going to have a double dick recession no that's just not uh that's just not
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:44.920]  likely and on the opposite side of the table you had rachel maddowell uh just completely demonizing
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:51.560]  the tea party and saying that s and b had no credibility whatsoever and then on abc you had
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:02:01.240]  steve rattner the architect of the auto industry bailout uh who is on record calling uh any tea
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:08.840]  party member anybody who doesn't agree with the bailouts terrorists um and i noticed that it's
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:15.080]  a common thread running through uh the uh sunday morning talking points no no no i've got the stack
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.400]  i'm glad absolutely that's what i saw and that's what they're doing they're saying it's not the
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.520]  derivatives it's not the six megabanks uh it's not the big government it's the people who don't
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.480]  like big government now that we're going into the depression publicly it's all our fault
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.880]  they were driving the train over the cliff we tried to apply the brakes they wouldn't let us
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:40.040]  and now as we go off the cliff they're looking at us saying you did this exactly and for alan
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.960]  green span to even be allowed to come on these shows or for people to even think that he has an
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:52.520]  ounce of credibility left after allowing the derivatives to just go into hopper speed well
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.760]  that's right for those that don't know uh just to fill in what you're saying ben it was it was on
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.440]  his watch in 9899 they got rid of all the rules and let an inner group of megabanks just create
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:09.320]  infinity of currency uh and and instruments that we have to back up and now that we've back them up
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.040]  now it's our fault and i guess in a way it is our fault for letting these criminals do this to us
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:21.000]  well i agree with you and in closing i just want to encourage people to you know keep supporting
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.480]  what you're doing it's it's such essential work so thank you again and um god bless well then i
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.760]  appreciate your call um we're going to go to bring come back to jason linda ryan uh salvatore
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:40.680]  tarik uh roland scott george uh dana vencent and others uh and the toll free number to join us of
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:46.600]  course um we get so many calls i hear national shows begging for calls our audience is so big
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.400]  and so great we have a computerized phone system on the weekend show the genesis only has like an
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:57.080]  old-fashioned six line system but we do it out of our own studio we can um open the phone line up for
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.280]  about a minute sometimes just like 10 seconds they'll i'll give the number out and they'll open it
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.560]  and like 30 phone calls will just shoot in and if they leave it open hundreds go on the board
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.920]  uh but then that'll bankrupt me because i gotta pay for all those toll free calls
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.400]  and they could sure add up when i sit here with a big blow hard talking forever uh you know it was
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:20.680]  the best of times it was the worst of times there are so many good people in this country and worldwide
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:26.520]  there are there are so many inventions and ingenuity and and so many good people in government out of
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.840]  government so many good police officers so many good military people so many good talk show host
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:41.880]  but we don't run things the evil corrupt do and uh we better get the controls back away from them
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.720]  or we don't have any hope and i gotta tell you i'm really creeped out right now i got a lot of
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.200]  anxiety i've been telling you the last few months i've been having it i i'm having a lot of anxiety
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.760]  i think some really bad stuff's about to happen we'll be right back

[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:46.120]  and we can turn things around but we're going to have to stop being so naive and admit that
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:52.360]  corrupt elements have taken over almost every major position of power and that it's become systemic
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:07:00.120]  and that the sky is the limit if we don't get involved i mean everywhere i go
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.440]  i'd say half the people i walk by on the street or in a business or at the grocery store
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:12.120]  stop and talk to me or listeners great people i mean i i went to a restaurant with my parents and

[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:32.680]  like i'm going to be able to fix things all i can do is go hey you know here's here's 20 news
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:37.720]  articles that aren't getting national attention where the government's caught shipping guns in
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.720]  the mexico and cocaine in and they're not even getting in trouble all i can do is say we're not
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:49.720]  in kansas anymore all right i'm gonna go to your phone calls it's just that we really do have a
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:55.320]  case of tyranny we have cancer politically and it's not going to go away when obama leaves office
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:02.440]  just like it didn't go away when bush left office we the political ruling class i have these idiots
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:08.280]  email me and they say i like democrats the economy was roaring under bill clinton of course it was
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.360]  they were you know a fish when it bites on to a hook with a worm on it for about a split second
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:20.360]  thinks the worm tastes good and and and and and the way economies and societies go four or five
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:27.080]  years is is a millisecond they were hyper inflating the currency they were creating thousands of
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.680]  trillions of of of financial instruments and flooding the markets with it of course there
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:39.960]  was a bubble and and now alan greenspan and others are parading around on tv and the white
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.560]  house is blaming people that want to be fiscally responsible for the fact that we've lost our
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.680]  triple a rating we lost for triple a rating a long time ago we've been positioned into economic
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.040]  collapse and i'm going to be breaking that down after we go to your calls but right now jason
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:00.040]  in connecticut you're on the air jason go ahead alex man i'll tell you my grant my family came
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:06.120]  here in 1895 and this is not the america that they dreamt of and no disrespect to america
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.880]  we're in a bad time right now but a quick comment about steel steel team six um
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:20.520]  the comment was uh do you think that uh this is a typical good seller's godfather type hate
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:28.840]  where they got to shut everybody up so the truth doesn't come out we don't know we know that witnesses
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.640]  all over that populated area and i have the newscast posted on info wars dot com and present
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.880]  planet dot com reported that the people got on the helicopter and it blew up and then my military
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:46.760]  sources said indeed seals did die back in may um or even before that uh when was the bin Laden raid
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.040]  uh time gets scrambled folks pulled the date for me yeah it was may first so i was it was right may
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.680]  day yeah it was made may first i was just double check my memory uh yeah it was may first may day
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:03.480]  i mean what a globalist message that was we don't know we know that story was a lie that bin Laden
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.120]  didn't do the things they said that there wasn't human shields that you know throwing him in the ocean
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:14.680]  give me a break fake uh situation room photos of the president looking tough all of that was a lie
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.960]  our government sources say it's a lie uh and that seals did die and so how will they cover up
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.280]  that seals died they'll wait a few months tell their family they're out of contact you know
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.520]  their seals then there's another helicopter crash and then you just tag their names on to it that's
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:36.520]  that's the the most likely because we know that seals died in the bin Laden raid from our sources
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.760]  the proven very accurate and plus we have the helicopter crashing there it's not just like
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:47.800]  our sources are saying that uh so i don't know or did were they knocking out you know the rest of
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:53.640]  seal team six because they were speaking out like pat telman like jessica lynch's team who said she
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.360]  was hiding in fear this isn't true and they went and killed them and then she came out and said
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.800]  it's all fake i was told to lie by the pentagon they really kill people in these pr things if it's
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.240]  a pr event for their agenda they will kill anybody involved if they get in the way of it pat telman
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.800]  didn't want to be their pr guy anymore they could murder him uh you know jessica lynch's team and i
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.280]  went on air and i said jessica lynch you better come out and admit this was fake or they're going
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:22.120]  to kill you and say the hero died in a car wreck and she came out two days later i guess somebody
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.960]  else must have warned her i don't know and said it's all fake they told me to do it the book all of
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:32.840]  its fake it's all fake um i mean they don't play games uh jason i appreciate your call because
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.840]  it's not our government okay it's foreign banking interest run our military they run the greatest
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.120]  military on the earth they run our checkbook and they've run it into the ground okay and they're

[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.560]  maryland you're on the air welcome thanks for taking my call i sincerely want to thank you and
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:01.800]  your staff for everything you have done i've been a listener for about 10 years and i have today
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:07.320]  called to offer you some constructive criticism i hope you will be open to oh i need it i i you
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:13.160]  can i can't stand my own show tell me about it it's not your show it sounds like you've gotten
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:19.480]  into some very um difficult speech patterns and habits like guttural sounds when you stall to
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:27.880]  get your next thought and stuttering um and an incredibly scratchy voice when you speak slowly
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:33.640]  and deeply it's to the point where after 10 years it's it's become hard for me to listen to you and
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:38.760]  i don't want that to happen no i hear you but listen uh different different strokes for different
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:44.520]  folks i have to focus not to speak super deep and it's from screaming and rallies i mean have you
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.480]  ever seen like an 18 year old cheerleader uh and graduate in high school and she sounds like a man
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.200]  from screaming you know during the drills and that's what's happened to my voice and i have to speak
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.960]  at the front of my mouth to not sound super deep uh but but again that's actually the voice they look
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:06.520]  for in radio so a lot more people like it than than don't like it and it's very uh distinctive linda
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.440]  and there's really nothing i can do i mean you can call it a uh you can call it a handicap
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.800]  i also do have a lot of things going on in my mind sometimes i sound completely fluent
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.920]  and every word sounds like a poet wrote it other times it's a bunch of starting and stopping but
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.760]  the radio show is real i'm not reading off a teleprompter here i understand that maybe just
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.640]  to go back and listen to what you've already said might be of help and you might get a better
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.320]  idea of what i'm i'm speaking about but i want to continue listening to your show but sometimes
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:45.000]  it has become very very difficult for me oh dear linda would you rather this voice no linda when
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.840]  we get done with you we're going to ryan i can do this voice ladies and gentlemen we're going to be

[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.120]  as the emperor has foreseen when you pick up your speech uh your voice does come up a little bit
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:17.560]  and then you stop the scratchiness and i realize you have so much to say it doesn't come to your
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:24.280]  lips fast enough well that's what's happening oh i know it it sounds like i'm a chimpanzee on pcp
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.560]  sometimes i i hear you linda and listen i'm the boss up here so there's nobody you know i can

[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:22.600]  i'm trying here ryan in tennessee then salvatore and others ryan you're on the air welcome hey alex
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:31.880]  thank you for all that you do i'm thankful that uh i heard about you through conspiracy theory uh my
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:37.080]  family is now awake and i don't want to get off the point i want to say everything that you said
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:45.480]  about uh corporations running our country now i recently had a new truck that at 65 miles an hour
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:53.240]  uh it's shifted into first gear and my daughter and i flipped off the interstate and uh forward
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.080]  told me they were sorry for the inconvenience but it did i don't want to get off the point but it just
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.840]  goes to the american people have lost their voice uh no one listens to us and it doesn't
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:08.920]  matter what big corporations do they just keep right on trucking and they're emboldened there
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:14.680]  that's what the new world order is a global private government where they control the governments
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:20.360]  and and take our wealth away through socialism but then they're offshore it's fascism sitting on
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.800]  top of socialism and that's what the social engineers don't teach in schools but when you
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:31.080]  get into real government policy books they admit that's the global system but they don't teach that
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.680]  they say you can have right-wing fascism or left-wing communism those are your choices when the two go
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:44.440]  together well and like i said you've been right on with everything my my 70 year old parents listen
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:49.160]  to you and because of listening to you that my entire family got out of the stock market
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:56.120]  in less than less than a month ago and had we not have uh i believe that we would have lost everything
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:03.000]  well uh sir again i i i don't really give advice on the stock market per se but we have been saying
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.360]  that that the collapse would become more evident and that as soon as they did the debt increase
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.160]  that that they would start imploding things because it wasn't really a debt increase it was a change in
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:23.160]  law to allow the insiders at the super congress to completely and totally take over uh the congress
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:29.320]  i mean do you want folks think about it a super congress originates the laws now on taxes and
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:35.480]  spending i mean that is incredible bills don't come out of the lower house now uh the spending
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.880]  bills are supposed to come from individual house members and and if the house doesn't vote the way
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:46.040]  they want then it just it just goes through anyways i mean this is mind blowing and this is what's
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:51.560]  incredible they're just getting started if you think it's crazy that obama launched a war and
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:57.160]  congress said we've got to give you authority and he said fly a kite imagine what's coming next ryan
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:04.840]  well and that that was my whole point you listened to you uh no you weren't giving advice but everything
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.120]  you said uh you could see the writing on the wall you would say it a week within a week later
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:16.920]  it was happening whether the market uh in the news and i absolutely believe that and that's
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.960]  what's frustrating ryan is that i'm not that smart this is a globalist program they admit
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:28.520]  what they're doing all i'm doing is saying uh hey next uh you know they're gonna do this because
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.000]  that's their program i appreciate your call uh salvator in california you're on the air thanks
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.320]  for holding alex ditto thank you very much thank you by the way i will listen to you no matter what
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:45.560]  you sound like well is it true do i sound like a uh demonic chimpanzee you know when i was younger
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:50.520]  i was an activist and i had to do a lot of yelling and screaming and my voice suffered for it as well
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:58.200]  so i completely understand and uh no i don't think you sound like a demonic monkey okay go ahead
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.240]  what's what's on your mind today sir well uh a couple things i'm gonna try not to uh to be too
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:08.760]  long-winded like you but um i wanted to sum up a few of the things that have been going on in our
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:16.360]  world uh with what happened at the rossom foods here in la recently um the gentleman the schizophrenic
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:22.360]  homeless person that was beaten up and killed by police officers in fullerton um what happened to
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:29.880]  the amish people in pennsylvania the lady in michigan with her tomato garden um there just seems
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:37.560]  to be this this bum rush to take our rights away from us it's like they've just decided this is it
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.800]  this is our time let's go for you know why you know why don't you tell me because because the foreign
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:49.560]  banks have standardized the way the cities work the states they've bought off almost all the major
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.880]  leaders most the leaders are just social climbers who just do what they're told they're not even aware
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:59.800]  of what's going on people are kind of on an autopilot and the and the social engineers the globalists
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.640]  know that they have committed such incredible crimes that the american people and other nations as well
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.600]  are going to try to take their countries back that's why tyrants put tyrannies in is so they
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.360]  can get away with robbing you that's why when a bank robber comes in they say put your hands up
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.720]  and they tie up you know the bank president and the and the and the guard because they're about
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.280]  to do something really bad now that's why the nazis put a police state in before they did what they
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:34.360]  did and and so that's why they they are bum rushing uh to let the public know your slaves tsa is
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.800]  going to stick their hands down your pants we're going to radiate you we're going to steal your
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.760]  pension funds you know we're going we're going to do this to you they're they're letting us know
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.320]  they're letting us know they're they're trying to absolutely break our will right now because
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:52.440]  they know they've brought us in to a controlled depression and that brings me to my next point
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:59.480]  another fellow Texan of yours who is no longer with us named bill hicks said that the real threat
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:07.960]  to the establishment in this country is us and that's why shows like cops runs 24 7 on our
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:14.600]  television it's to remind us that state power will always win and they only show you to shovel
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.960]  trashy people uh to then give the image that the cops are always good the public is scum
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:27.080]  exactly and now i spent a lot of years in my young my young ambitious days in the political arena
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:33.480]  eventually i did become a political operative i worked for large multinational corporations
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:38.680]  and then after my father died the veil was ripped off and i saw exactly what kind of people i was
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:46.680]  working with and decided that's it i'm going to the other side i eventually became a newspaper

[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.400]  and we stop just accepting the government lies and is corrupt our country hasn't been perfect but
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.680]  it's been the greatest experiment in human history produced more wealth more liberty more patents more
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:59.720]  freedom more exploration than any other nation hands down countries that had much more uh
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:06.120]  cross uh you know you know much more resources than we've had but a lot less prosperity because
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.360]  they had a history of just letting tyrants rule over them and a corrupt class system
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:17.160]  where the upper class the ruling class tries to keep the lower class from ever entering the middle
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:25.640]  class this is the system and incredible corruption is growing it's it's racing through the body like a
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:32.680]  metastasizing cancer right now the founding fathers were obsessed with keeping corruption
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:39.480]  under control with jealously guarding liberty and freedom but now they've tried to sell the idea in
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:46.680]  the mainline dinosaur media that not trusting government that caring about your rights is kooky
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:52.760]  or terroristic or evil they tell police that if you talk about the constitution you're probably a
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.240]  killer you want to murder police that's in the training manuals that we've been sent by police
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:07.400]  and published for the public to see this is a dangerous situation that we're in and it's not
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:14.040]  going to get any better until we start standing up and saying no and really recognizing how corrupt
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:19.560]  the system is now the alternative media has exposed government gun running drug running
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.880]  child kidnapping all these horrible things but now the system just goes okay we're doing it
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.760]  and just reports it in a bland way so we've had victories but at a certain point they almost
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:36.760]  become defeats because it just sits there like an elephant in the room that's doing bad things in
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:41.560]  the room leaving all sorts of horrible things you step in and the elephant says I don't care if
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.480]  you see me here you know for a while the elephant was there and we finally started to see it and
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:51.240]  now the elephant says well I'm not leaving I'm a big giant elephant all right listen I want to go
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:58.120]  to Tariq Roland Scott George Dana Vincent and others in fact let's go to Hawaii first but let's
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:03.480]  go quick because I want to hear from everybody does anybody care about the debt limit being raised
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.680]  and giving a super congress power a new form of government does anybody care about the
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:15.480]  the AAA rating being lost and now S&P and others saying we'll probably lose more of our ratings
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.760]  I mean to the bankers that engineered the whole fraud and now the White House is demonizing
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.120]  the Tea Party the Tea Party isn't perfect but it's against the Federal Reserve against the
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.880]  globalist wants to cut spending cut down the size of the federal government it is the best
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:38.120]  main line answer out there so it's being blamed that'd be like Hitler being the presiding judge
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:47.800]  at the Nuremberg trials and after world war two and calling in calling in general Eisenhower and
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:54.440]  blaming him for running the death camps I mean that's how rich this is how ridiculous but hey
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:59.960]  they know the public's may be awake and it doesn't trust government anymore media but they still
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:05.000]  don't have the details because I saw the comments coming in the last few days I'm glad you got what
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:13.960]  you wanted we lost our rating thanks to you people like you Alex really really really it's not because
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.800]  tens of trillions to foreign banks it's not because of all the government spending it's
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.960]  it's not because the private fellow reserve that says it's above the law it's my fault now
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:28.840]  you got to love it here are the headlines world leaders race to head off fresh market turmoil
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:36.040]  bill ahead of stock markets opening worldwide the next few hours u.s. downgrade sounds alarm bell
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:45.240]  afp dollar to be discarded by world china rating agency says cnbc television stocks fall seven
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:52.120]  percent on u.s. debt white house advisor blames tea party for downgrade see here's the issue we've
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.480]  been signed on to the mega banks who run the rating agencies publicly who themselves are
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:03.400]  completely unsolvent but they're too big to fail so see we're signed on to their debt so now we're
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:12.760]  going to fail and then they stand up there lecturing us i mean this is so brazen this is so
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.960]  ridiculous that it may oh white house advisor blames tea party for downgrade a top white house
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.040]  advisor is blaming the downgrade of u.s. credit rating on tea party republicans who they say
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.880]  we're unwilling to compromise on how to reduce the federal debt what are you talking about
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:33.080]  that they the republicans led the charge to hand over power to the super congress and obama
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.040]  you got whatever you wanted none of the cuts even start till next year and their poultry
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:44.360]  government increases its growth it's impossible to pay for they've set us on a collision course
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.760]  along with obama and then you say this no this happened because now the bankers have got us where
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:53.480]  they want us because the super congress controls all spending now and and is going to give them
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:59.080]  whatever they want they've got their people in control now the house and senate voted its rights
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:05.880]  away treasonously when i use the word treason i mean it white house advisor blames tea party for
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.320]  downgrade the top white house advisor is blaming the downgrade on us credit rating on tea party
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:15.320]  republicans the advisor to president obama david axelrod i mean that guy looks like a demonic
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:21.720]  rat tells cbs faced the nation on sunday the decision by the standard and poorest credit
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.840]  agency to downgrade the us from triple a to double a plus for the first time
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:31.160]  was strong influenced by weeks of standoff between democrats and republicans over the
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:38.520]  debt axelrod calls the action in his words a tea party downgrade unbelievable the banks have been
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:44.200]  positioning us into this downgrade and you mark my words is going to get worse and worse and worse
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.280]  and worse by design these are parasites they're the ones that created the derivatives and sold
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:56.440]  them to everybody's pension funds they're the ones grandstanding as the saviors uh
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:02.040]  it'd be like if you came home and there was a guy with a black mask on coming out with your
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:07.720]  jewelry and your computer and the cops show up the guy goes hey uh you know alex jones is the
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.560]  criminal and the cops put me in handcuffs even though i've got my driver's license and clearly

[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.440]  else here because i remember he's been calling on over a couple of years and he said you know
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:03.080]  general mccrystal is going to be run out for a scandal here in the next few months it did happen
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.760]  rolling stone he's giving us a lot of other good information he's one of the caller sources but i
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.880]  have two separate army sources so i don't even know who they are that told me seals did die and
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:19.640]  that the helicopter blew up pakistani tv said that as well i'm going to him in a moment to
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:24.920]  to get his scuttle but i know he just got out of the military but he's got a news site uh but
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.600]  finishing up with dawn yes i know the name of the congresswoman who off record is telling people
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:34.680]  get ready there's gonna be a total collapse the federal government has been getting ready
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:40.360]  since they got rid of glass steel in the late 90s for total collapse it's designed to collapse us
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.720]  okay that's how we're economically conquered and it's just going to be incremental they've
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.640]  known we've been in a depression by every real economic number for three years but they keep
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:54.440]  telling you the economy's wonderful they tell you crime isn't going up they tell you unemployment's
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:04.360]  only 9.6 they know it's over 22 they lie they lie they lie they lie this is a program this is a
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:12.200]  globalist program so good points done uh let's go ahead and talk to colonel six colonel six real
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:20.600]  fast break down your take on the supposed navy seals of seal team six first they weren't on the
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:27.160]  helicopter the biggest one-day loss in afghanistan war the other decade then they were the seal team
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.840]  six that was involved in bin laden then they weren't um and and my information well tell us
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:39.000]  the scuttlebutt you've got okay let me uh just do one other thing right quick alex if uh people
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.240]  will go to come six dot com i'm gonna show you something back in march the norway socialist
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:53.720]  party said that they wanted israel bombed this ties into uh blondie and then the shooting in the
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:00.600]  and the bomb bombing and so forth and israel being voted on next month by norway uh palestine
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:06.520]  getting a seat let me tell you what is going on when we talked last it was a there was a
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:18.280]  mix up in the translation the helicopter that was in pakistan did blow up how it and i got
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:23.160]  they got turned around in the translations yes it did blow up now whether it was a bomb where
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:30.840]  it was the rpg to hit it because it blew up above the fence line okay now there were a number of
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:38.920]  members of seal team six in that plane last night yesterday the remaining members of that particular
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:47.160]  squad were killed i heard from a woman uh who's a relative of one of the people that was killed
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:54.360]  and uh just like i predicted they're not gonna say it's solid so i gave her the name and uh
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:51:00.920]  just phone number i have for c more harsh and um tell her to get in touch with him and okay but
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.800]  let me stop your colonel six because you've given us really good info and yes uh and that's what
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:11.000]  pakistani witnesses said the thing lifted off blew up dead bodies everywhere of the they tell us oh no
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.920]  that didn't happen a lot of people predicted look for the rest of the team to die and so uh you're
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:21.000]  saying that you talked to a relative of one of the people and that you've put her in touch with it
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:28.120]  with an investigative or Pulitzer prize winner at the um new yorker magazine what did she tell you
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:33.640]  was this to shut up the seal team i mean statistically yes it was to shut up the
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:40.440]  two seal team what the deal is like i say a number i don't know the exact number but she hit about a
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:47.800]  little over a half of the team that this particular guy was on was killed in in that supposed raid
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:56.360]  in order to keep them from doing the pat tillman the the other ones were killed yesterday in a
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:02.600]  supposedly with the taliban taking them but they were shot down somebody shot them down
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:09.480]  or they blew up some kind of way the taliban's taking uh you know responsibility for go take
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:14.040]  responsibility for the kennedy killing if you let them so well they took responsibility for the
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:22.200]  norway shooting well that's what i'm saying that that's that's what i'm saying uh this is a deal
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:27.000]  i need to get a uh number for you or let me give you my you know what colonel six you've given us
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.960]  great info probably five six times in a row and i need to learn exactly who you are i know your
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:37.320]  site's excellent we need to have you on as a guest so why don't i put you on hold and why don't we
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:42.360]  end up having you on in the next few days after i get on the phone with you and find out a little
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:47.800]  bit more because i've got a source at ford hood i've got a source at fort bragg they all basically
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:51.960]  say the same thing you're saying but they'll never tell me who they are uh and you just got out of
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:55.480]  the military i mean are you able to go public with who you are and really give folks more
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:02.360]  information not really i was because of the uh i'm in a situation uh you know i've got the
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:06.440]  situation i mean won't let me do that right now i understand well how are you running a website
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:14.120]  them oh the website is uh it's just there i mean it's not saying anything i'm putting things out
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:21.000]  there but uh it's not going to give anyone where i live or anything else like you give me no i
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.520]  understand i understand but i mean obviously the system knows who you are so why not just tell
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.880]  folks who you are now okay well i'm going to put you on holding it back with you but my information
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:35.640]  immediately was the old trick of if people die in a class clandestine operation you just say that
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:41.640]  they die later in a crash and tag their name onto it either in a real crash or you stage one uh
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:47.960]  you're saying no the word is they were getting rid of team members that were going to speak out what
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:52.440]  were they going to speak out on do you have any information on that that that bin laden wasn't
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:57.320]  killed uh or that seals did die in the raid why would they want to get rid of them like pat
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:03.480]  tillman they were going to come out and say one that uh other seal members were killed in the
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:11.640]  raid two that there was no raid for uh bin laden that it was that actually it was a raid uh for
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:20.600]  someone else someone else in the up in uh al-qaeda that they were looking for uh and uh that in the
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:26.600]  young lady told me that between her and other other people that are relatives of these of these
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:32.280]  people they just decided that they're not going to sit still and have this happen with that with
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.360]  that message probably getting out somewhere on along the base or whatever they decided to do the
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:43.880]  rest of them and just like i told you what four months before mccrystal anybody was even talking
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:53.640]  about it uh i want to tell you this when uh not too long after that but this is going to happen
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.480]  no you said there's going to be a scandal and mccrystal's going to go out from a scandal and
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:02.200]  no one was saying at the time in it it was true you said a lot of other things you said why
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:05.400]  they're gonna try to go into libya a few months before that even started but so you obviously
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:12.040]  have a lot of good sources my big issue here is that obviously they didn't bury bin laden and see
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:17.320]  obviously he was dead from kidney failure close to 10 years ago we have uh steve pacinic i mean
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:24.280]  impeccable source jimmy denranny you know but like i said go to color six dot com look at that
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:32.600]  no way touches party wanted to bomb israel and uh i'll tell you what i'll talk with you i don't
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.720]  know about going on the air and doing a full blown interview or anything with you but uh i'll talk
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.120]  with you know why not you call into the show your information's turned out to be accurate well well
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.760]  here's the issue you know they killed what five of jessica lynch's crew because they were speaking
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:52.120]  out they killed pat telman because he was going to speak out and wrote letters home about it um
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:59.240]  and now they've wiped these guys out is that going to anger and again folks 10 year war and it just so
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:05.400]  happens to be the rest of the unit that's left over from the seal team six that blew up and died
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:11.960]  at the so-called obl compound and statistically now they're the ones that die and they're on a army
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.920]  national guard helicopter and i'm getting military scuttlebutt and on the military sites and the
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:22.200]  emails i'm getting no one is buying this colonel six military folks you talk to what are they saying
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.160]  that was that right there the national guard helicopter you don't do that those are nowhere
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:35.320]  maintained as as well as the navy helicopter that they use okay you've got uh several things that
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:40.760]  one i've saw somebody said that put out that none of the members of the team that were people that
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:47.320]  were killed were members of the team that read billon's compound that tells me one thing straight
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:53.800]  up that they were when they said plus i say minus when they say go i say stop okay and i'm gonna show
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:00.120]  you how i do this i'll tell you how i do it uh and i can give you some other information
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.800]  but like you said you know i've talked to you on the air anyway um i just don't want to take up your
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:12.760]  time plus i know you work on your voice i i think of the diane rain uh voices what you should shoot

[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:35.160]  i tell you this is really starting to creep me out i mean if they would kill those navy
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:40.440]  seals like that and you know they did folks i mean come on i mean they killed pat tillman it's
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:45.400]  admitted they murdered him and then lied about it and got caught we'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m
