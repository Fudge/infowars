[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:32.720]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are live my
[00:32.720 --> 00:40.080]  friends it is Wednesday the 26th day of January 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three
[00:40.080 --> 00:46.960]  hours Lloyd Chapman is going to be joining us breaking down the state of our union he of
[00:46.960 --> 00:52.720]  course heads up the small business league of the United States with hundreds of thousands of
[00:53.680 --> 01:01.120]  members I did watch the state of the union last night I watched a recording of it and it was a
[01:01.120 --> 01:09.360]  compendium of lies and disinformation and mind control but basically the message was if you
[01:09.360 --> 01:15.120]  don't like what government's doing you don't believe in America America's good America's
[01:15.120 --> 01:23.360]  tough America's strong hope hope hope basically without using the word hope that together we thrive
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.560]  and that we've got this great bright future ahead if we just basically sit down and shut up
[01:29.360 --> 01:35.920]  and let's have the theater of the republicans and the democrats sitting together but we've
[01:35.920 --> 01:41.360]  got to have the carbon taxes why you know America has the cleanest water and the cleanest food which
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.520]  isn't true the government puts sodium fluoride in the water and allows all sorts of poisonous
[01:45.520 --> 01:50.000]  stuff we put in the food including stuff shipped from China and so if you're against the carbon
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.960]  taxes why you are against progress and that this is a human right to have this evil carbon dioxide
[01:56.960 --> 02:01.920]  cut when China and India and countless others don't have to he also made a joke of course about the
[02:01.920 --> 02:10.640]  TSA and the naked body scans and the groping and lied and lied and said that don't worry with the
[02:10.640 --> 02:17.680]  new high-speed train across America you're not going to have to go through checkpoints when
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.320]  the TSA and Homeland Security have announced that they're starting this and have already started
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.520]  putting checkpoints at train stations bus stations and at checkpoints on the highways of America
[02:27.520 --> 02:37.200]  and they're putting out PSA showing TSA at football games NFL football games helping search people
[02:37.200 --> 02:45.440]  that came out last week so lie upon lie upon lie also there have been a lot of attacks against
[02:45.440 --> 02:51.280]  foreign Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura locally on talk radio I heard a host attacking him yesterday
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.480]  and it was a similar attack to what I saw this morning on the view that my producers alerted me
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.960]  to we have that clip coming up and they only talk about him for about two and a half minutes and
[03:00.960 --> 03:07.680]  again it's a compendium of disinformation and lies I mean either these women are as dumb as a box
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.560]  of rocks or their liars I mean I'll have to stop the tape when we play it every 10 seconds because
[03:12.560 --> 03:18.640]  everything they say is twisted or false I mean it's just it's just amazing and they put an
[03:18.640 --> 03:26.800]  image of him up there and laugh at him and make fun of him and and and it's just all about taking
[03:26.800 --> 03:33.040]  serious issues and making a joke out of it everything's so funny in this police state
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.480]  that is unfolding so we're going to be breaking all of that down and then I want to get into
[03:38.480 --> 03:44.960]  the nanny state today a little bit here's a report out of the austin american statesman today
[03:44.960 --> 03:53.440]  travis county offers 58 48 500 dollars again travis county offers 48 500 dollars to bicycle
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.480]  accident victim and she was out in the county riding with a group of bicyclists let me tell
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.000]  you they act like they own the road they'll even have a shoulder and you'll just come by and there's
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.080]  people in a you know on a country road major highway just out the middle of the road and they
[04:08.080 --> 04:12.160]  act like again they have more rights than anybody out there and there's this hatred of cars by
[04:12.160 --> 04:17.520]  a cyclist I have a bike I like bike riding it's just that these people are very arrogant and and
[04:17.520 --> 04:23.360]  they get out there and they train their kids that they own the road and this woman hit a pothole
[04:23.360 --> 04:30.480]  on a county road shoulder and sued the county so uh I guess all those times I flipped off the
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.320]  handlebars riding down neighborhood roads I should have sued somebody I guess all those times I fell
[04:36.320 --> 04:42.800]  off my bike I mean this is this image in this mindset that the government's got to protect me
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.600]  from everything and if I go out and bike ride and get hurt it's the government's fault and
[04:47.600 --> 04:52.640]  taxpayers are going to have to pay for this so that's just incredible we're going to be breaking
[04:52.640 --> 04:58.160]  that down and also walmart's targeting eight-year-old girls with anti-aging cream ties into the same
[04:58.160 --> 05:04.720]  area alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on
[05:04.720 --> 05:11.200]  June of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended
[05:11.200 --> 05:15.680]  for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.800]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[05:20.800 --> 05:25.440]  in addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food

[08:15.280 --> 08:23.520]  okay we're gonna break down the state of the union that uh barack obama gave yesterday
[08:23.520 --> 08:31.440]  there has been a giant new development on the birth certificate issue uh about a week ago last
[08:31.440 --> 08:39.600]  tuesday the honolulu advertiser published the full text of a transcript interview with the new
[08:39.600 --> 08:45.920]  governor mr abacromby and abacromby said that they were unable to find the birth certificate
[08:45.920 --> 08:50.960]  and that this would be a campaign issue in the 2012 election uh he of course has known barack
[08:50.960 --> 08:57.440]  obama since he was about four years old uh he's been a long time congressman as well and friends
[08:57.440 --> 09:04.240]  of the family and since then it's been one of the biggest news stories out there with world net
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.600]  world net daily the dredge report and others uh covering it that abacromby a month ago before
[09:09.600 --> 09:15.520]  he'd gotten into office he was governor elect had said that he was going to go out and get that birth
[09:15.520 --> 09:21.760]  certificate and show it to people and now again last week he said well we couldn't find it in fact
[09:21.760 --> 09:26.720]  they can't even find out what hospital barack obama was born at in hawaii they've said two
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.240]  different ones now my mother remembers the name of my doctor uh at parkland hospital in dallas
[09:32.240 --> 09:39.200]  how do you forget that how does obama not know that um my dad knows the name of my doctor i have
[09:39.200 --> 09:45.680]  the original signed birth certificate with my footprints uh on it from the ink so they can
[09:45.680 --> 09:51.520]  tell which baby switch in case there's a mix up uh they've lied for three years uh into the campaign
[09:51.520 --> 09:57.200]  and now for the last uh two years of barack obama in office saying that we've released the birth
[09:57.200 --> 10:03.280]  certificate we've released the birth certificate when they released a receipt of one just the
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.840]  automated computerized systems that they print out that you use for routine documentation or for
[10:09.840 --> 10:17.120]  travel now abacromby has given an interview to well-known reporter mike evans i mean i've grown
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.720]  up listening to to him he's the hollywood reporter he's on 5 90 a.m every week here in austin uh he's
[10:22.720 --> 10:27.920]  on uh over a thousand radio stations uh in the united states and he's out of hawaii he's known as
[10:27.920 --> 10:33.280]  the hollywood reporter mike evans and he's good friends with governor abacromby going back to quote
[10:33.280 --> 10:39.840]  when abacromby was a taxi driver he knew abacromby before he got into politics so they've known each
[10:39.840 --> 10:45.280]  other uh for decades we're gonna play a clip of that uh coming up later when i get into all of this
[10:45.280 --> 10:51.520]  and he said yeah i talked to abacromby this is in his new report and my old friend and abacromby
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.440]  said yeah there is no birth certificate there's no record period there's nothing there's nothing
[10:57.440 --> 11:04.480]  in the state records this is a big deal now i don't know if he was born in kenya or hawaii but
[11:04.480 --> 11:10.720]  this claim that oh well his grandparents did a birth announcement well you know in the paper
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.920]  they weren't imagining that he would ever be president this is ridiculous no people routinely
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.840]  do birth announcements if they're planning to try to fake a birth certificate later or if they're
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.600]  planning to have their daughter get their grandson back into the country so they can be a us citizen
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.920]  that that that that's still prized today but especially in 1961 and you've got his grandmother
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.320]  in kenya saying that he was born there you got a statue in kenya saying he was born there you've
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.480]  got michelle sataro obama his wife saying in multiple speeches that barack obama you went
[11:42.480 --> 11:49.360]  back to his home country where he was born of kenya she said that in 2007 and 2008 in speeches
[11:49.360 --> 11:54.240]  and we've played those but what i can prove a hundred percent is they're covering something up
[11:54.240 --> 12:00.080]  and he gave up his u.s citizenship to become an indonesian citizen and we have his real name
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.200]  barry sataro and there's another fake name as well and so the issue here is there's a cover up
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.880]  going on we need a congressional investigation and boiling all of this down paul joseph watson
[12:11.520 --> 12:18.960]  is set here in the next 20 minutes or so to get a report up at prisonplanet.com
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.280]  on this subject in fact just a few minutes ago it wasn't up yet it's now up
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.880]  the headline is abacrombie shocked at failure to discover obama birth certificate
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.280]  and really i when i call watson this morning about doing this article i had said go with
[12:33.280 --> 12:40.800]  the headline i'm not saying this headline's bad that abacrombie confirms or abacrombie admits
[12:41.760 --> 12:50.800]  that no birth records exist no birth records nothing nothing i mean hospitals have admission
[12:50.800 --> 12:56.960]  records old hospitals in this country going back over 150 years there are birth records going back
[12:56.960 --> 13:02.400]  over 400 years before this country was even a country for the first 200 years when it was just
[13:02.400 --> 13:09.920]  colonies i mean this is insane ladies and gentlemen and if you want to join the fbi the cia the state
[13:09.920 --> 13:19.120]  police it's on record you've got to produce the original birth certificate but he's our president
[13:19.120 --> 13:26.240]  reportedly and doesn't have to present it this is a big deal but again the headline is abacrombie
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.680]  shocked at failure to discover obama birth certificate revelations of close friend of
[13:31.680 --> 13:36.560]  hawaiian governor contradict official claim that privacy laws prompted abacrombie to abandon
[13:36.560 --> 13:44.240]  search well again the advertiser newspaper last week did an article but then it added a transcript
[13:44.240 --> 13:48.960]  of the full interview so it's really just a footnote where he said yeah i looked it's not there
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.360]  this is going to be a big issue evidence shows he thought he was just talking to the reporter
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.440]  off record after the interview but the reporter put it all out there and didn't give it a shocking
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.320]  headline it was just buried in the article gerome course he found it did an article it went super
[14:02.320 --> 14:10.480]  viral other people have now written reports about it and now the hollywood reporter mike
[14:10.480 --> 14:19.280]  evans very respected a reporter he well we're going to play a clip of that coming up a little bit
[14:19.280 --> 14:26.720]  later in the hour now i want to start getting into the state of the union here first and
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.880]  last night got the kids to bed and everything and then i went back on youtube and watched the entire
[14:34.880 --> 14:42.640]  state of the union i didn't watch it live i watched it after it was archived and to describe it as
[14:42.640 --> 14:49.840]  propaganda it would be a disservice it's it's worse than propaganda it was mind control it was
[14:49.840 --> 14:58.320]  reeducation it was brainwashing it was a complete fraud everything he said was an abominable lie
[14:58.320 --> 15:06.000]  a fraud a a a group think twisting and the biggest issue here and i'm going to go through a lot of
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.720]  these points but i tried to write notes on it and it's i'm not going to go over all five pages of
[15:10.720 --> 15:17.520]  them but the biggest issue was they told members of congress to sit together well we need separation
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.520]  of powers we need people to fight within the democratic and republican parties against these
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.200]  illegal wars and the patriot act and the banking occupation and and and and looting that's going
[15:27.200 --> 15:34.240]  on we don't need to quote fix america to have everybody agree and to cut back the rhetoric
[15:34.240 --> 15:41.280]  but see this shows the republicans and democrats are circling the wagons against the people
[15:41.280 --> 15:48.240]  and against the tea party two years ago they were somewhat successful in the media running
[15:48.240 --> 15:57.360]  this mass hoax that only democrats were being heckled at town hall events or meet and greet
[15:57.360 --> 16:04.960]  events i remember in 2008 and early 2009 rick perry would be booed off the stage back when
[16:04.960 --> 16:11.040]  he was pushing garter cell and nafta highways and new world order stuff senator cornyn would be
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.320]  booed off the stage everywhere he went here in texas i saw videos on youtube and other sites
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.320]  just republicans democrats they had an 11 percent approval rating in congress both parties people
[16:22.320 --> 16:28.080]  were after democrats republicans but the media spun it as if it was a right-wing revolt were
[16:28.080 --> 16:34.720]  able to brand it as you only go and protest if you're a conservative against a liberal and then
[16:34.720 --> 16:38.960]  they made it left right and divided the people against each other where democrats say well i
[16:38.960 --> 16:42.960]  better defend the government's agenda because i don't want to be with those republicans then
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.040]  they branded it as racist oh you don't want government-run health care oh you don't want
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.600]  open borders oh you don't want gun control you're a racist so they so they really tried to divide
[16:51.600 --> 16:59.360]  people along race along class along you know social class warfare now the republicans and
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.640]  democrats we've seen all these republican leaders say yes we've got a tone down the
[17:02.640 --> 17:08.640]  rhetoric and and the big lie and he brought up the arizona shooting at the beginning of his speech
[17:08.640 --> 17:13.280]  uh in fact we can play that later he said uh you know it's great to have republicans and
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.520]  democrats it's great to have debate it's great to have arguments but then you got the arizona
[17:17.520 --> 17:24.000]  shooting and that has showed us to come together and to stop all this fighting so the big lie there
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.600]  is if you don't like what the government's doing and we are the people we are the government if
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.720]  we try to change it and put it back on a constitutional course we're causing shootings
[17:34.720 --> 17:41.040]  so it's a dirty thing to be angry and to be vocal and exercise your first amendment that
[17:41.040 --> 17:47.040]  created this country free speech started this nation it's why it's the first amendment it was
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.880]  violations of free speech and newspapers being shut down that spurred the 1776 movement one of the
[17:52.880 --> 18:00.880]  biggest uh factors in all of that and so that was really the big lie and uh ron paul uh last night
[18:00.880 --> 18:04.960]  before the state of the union was on wolf blitzer and blitzer said are you going to sit with somebody
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.680]  else and paul just starts laughing he says this is all just a show this is all just window dressing
[18:09.680 --> 18:14.560]  well it's more than that and he's right it's about blaming the first amendment for the shooting
[18:14.560 --> 18:20.480]  and implying everybody's got to come together and basically do what obama says and stop stop the
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.120]  heated debate because see they know the american people want liberty want freedom want to control
[18:25.120 --> 18:32.000]  the borders want to end the wars want to get rid of the tsa and they know that that's transpartisan
[18:32.000 --> 18:41.840]  and across the political spectrum so they're piling on to demonize people who object to what's
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.640]  happening people who speak out people who get involved i mean i was really shocked that they
[18:46.640 --> 18:52.240]  attack probably two to one or even more the the first amendment then they attack the second

[24:30.720 --> 24:39.920]  not just being continued but expanded you don't like america and he said that over and over again
[24:39.920 --> 24:45.360]  america strong america's good yeah we've had some knocks but we need to be positive we need to come
[24:45.360 --> 24:51.760]  together under the globalist leadership that is dissolving what was a free and prosperous republic
[24:51.760 --> 24:57.120]  and you've got to sit together and you've got to lower the rhetoric oh yeah it's great to have parties
[24:57.120 --> 25:02.400]  it's great to argue with each other but then you get a shooting like arizona and then we gotta come
[25:02.400 --> 25:09.600]  together it lets us know i mean he literally implied that america was in trouble because
[25:09.600 --> 25:15.360]  we're angry no people are angry because we're losing our liberties our freedoms our dollars
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.320]  being devalued the states across the board are going bankrupt and trying to erect all these new
[25:20.320 --> 25:26.560]  taxes and cutting benefits when that is a very small part of the equation compared to the offshore
[25:26.560 --> 25:32.480]  banking cartels debt in derivatives that we've signed on to we've had multiple economists on
[25:32.480 --> 25:37.120]  to break this down you could get rid of all entitlements social security welfare everything
[25:37.120 --> 25:44.000]  the entire defense department we are we have signed on to too big to fail the thousand plus
[25:44.000 --> 25:51.040]  trillion dollars created globally by the private central banks and that's how they've held us hostage
[25:51.920 --> 26:00.480]  they are holding us hostage in a big way they're saying oh the global economy is unstable keep
[26:00.480 --> 26:05.200]  giving us more money what did davos call for the big globalist kind of public billderberg
[26:05.200 --> 26:10.320]  confab what do they call for just yesterday same thing they called for the final reserve called
[26:10.320 --> 26:18.320]  for last week 100 trillion dollars in fact let's let's search engine that um davos calls for 100
[26:18.320 --> 26:25.360]  trillion in additional liquidity and that means 100 trillion to them and then they don't just
[26:25.360 --> 26:33.280]  fractional reserve leverage it 10 to 1 or 8 to 1 as was the old metric it's unlimited and they
[26:33.280 --> 26:39.920]  create new derivatives and manipulate markets with 100 trillion under the old fractional reserve
[26:39.920 --> 26:48.960]  banking system that is a quadrillion or a thousand trillion they're asking for a thousand
[26:48.960 --> 26:56.720]  trillion when they ask for 100 trillion in new liquidity headline you want to search it davos
[26:56.720 --> 27:03.600]  calls for 100 trillion and that'll pull it up 100 trillion into the banks now what did ron paul say
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.480]  what did ron paul do he hit the nail on the head when they said why aren't you going to sit together
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.800]  and i mean he just pointed out how this is ridiculous theater uh here is that clip
[27:15.600 --> 27:21.200]  of congressman uh ron paul sitting sitting tonight with a democrat or republican in other
[27:21.200 --> 27:28.080]  words you have a date no i do not i haven't made a decision on that why not everybody else seems
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.120]  to be making decisions on that you think it's a good idea that they divided up into uh you know
[27:33.120 --> 27:36.960]  they used to divide it up the democrats on one side the republicans on the other side this year a lot
[27:36.960 --> 27:43.760]  of people after tucson they want to sit together i think it's a bunch of fluff uh i said a bunch of
[27:43.760 --> 27:50.400]  what fluff i don't think it has a lot of meaning but i sit with i sit with denis kasinich and other
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.800]  progressive democrats when we want to talk about civil liberties and foreign policy and we do it
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.800]  root chaelian the middle of the of the uh auditorium middle of the house so i think that's the only
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.920]  thing that counts i think sitting together tonight because the media's gotten hold of this and making
[28:05.920 --> 28:12.960]  a big deal of it i uh you know i'm not against it i will i hope it does a lot of good but i i
[28:12.960 --> 28:17.200]  still think it's a lot of fluff a lot of fluff aren't that one final question i know uh you're
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.320]  living at least in washington with your son the newly elected senator from kentucky rand paul
[28:22.320 --> 28:26.960]  he's going to be joining us tomorrow how's that working out uh sharing a house with your son all
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.680]  right well it's still pretty new then he makes a joke about you know ron paul's told him he's not
[28:31.680 --> 28:37.680]  going to do the cooking and that uh and then rand's got to carry out the trash but i think that's
[28:37.680 --> 28:42.800]  great that they're living together in that condo because he can advise him uh us budget gap to
[28:42.800 --> 28:51.040]  widen to 1.5 trillion in 2011 on tax measures cbo says yeah here's obama says in a balance the budget
[28:51.040 --> 28:56.720]  ban earmarks and he's triple the size of government his first year and a half in office
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.000]  spent more money than all presidents before him combined but that's because we're coming to the
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.720]  end of this hyperinflation system and once you reach that very tail end uh you have more acceleration
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.440]  of debt and devaluation than you had in the previous hundred years that's how these systems
[29:14.080 --> 29:25.600]  always always basically uh work but but now we have devos calling for 100 trillion uh in increased
[29:25.600 --> 29:31.600]  quote liquidity uh or funds to the banks now we get back i'm going to continue with the state of
[29:31.600 --> 29:38.640]  the union and the tsa police state tie-in there's the president trying to prop up the tsa why
[29:38.640 --> 29:44.400]  is it so important to them why is the view and so many other tv shows attacking jesse ventura for
[29:44.400 --> 29:50.880]  his courage ensuing homeland security we'll break it all down on the other side stay with us we're

[33:15.760 --> 33:20.160]  i want to open the phones up specifically for listeners to give us your take on the state of
[33:20.160 --> 33:25.920]  the union here is this globalist teleprompter reading puppet um barack hussein obama real name
[33:25.920 --> 33:33.040]  barry sataro and bombshell info on his uh missing birth certificate out of hawaii coming up in a
[33:33.040 --> 33:40.720]  little while i want to get your take on what you got uh from the choreographed uh show or campaign
[33:40.720 --> 33:47.520]  stunt uh that was uh launched last night uh by barry sataro the toll free number to join us
[33:47.520 --> 34:00.400]  is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 now once you get into a 1.5 quadrillion and that's an old number
[34:00.400 --> 34:06.400]  again the washington post last year said 600 and change but whether it's 600 trillion or 1.5
[34:06.400 --> 34:12.000]  quadrillion 1500 trillion as many economists i have reported here on this show of derivatives
[34:12.000 --> 34:19.120]  it is a black hole that is impossible to pay back and uh by being held hostage by the bankers who hold
[34:19.120 --> 34:24.320]  this over our head and threaten total bankruptcy if we don't keep giving into them we just dig the
[34:24.320 --> 34:29.920]  hole the bottomless pit that much deeper but here's the london telegraph you can also pull up last
[34:29.920 --> 34:36.000]  week the fellow reserve the bank of england calling for it world needs 100 trillion more credit or
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.760]  liquidity says world economic forum now remember when they say that that means zero percent interest
[34:43.760 --> 34:52.000]  via the dollar the yen the yon the euro uh the s dr's to the private central banks who then loaned
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.800]  it out for five eight 10 12 15 some people's credit cards up to 30 percent that's been the credit
[34:58.800 --> 35:06.880]  card reform so they loaned you made up digital numbers for massive interest then the interest
[35:06.880 --> 35:12.560]  compounds then nations not just companies individuals lose their credit rating as california and many
[35:12.560 --> 35:18.160]  other states are doing as greece and uh irelander now having their their credit rating downgraded
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.960]  and then the countries aren't paying 10 12 15 percent just like an individual they're paying
[35:22.960 --> 35:30.800]  25 30 percent like argentina like uh some of the examples i use like nigeria i mean they know
[35:30.800 --> 35:37.840]  exactly what they are doing this is a stated trap in 2002 the imf world bank documents thousands of
[35:37.840 --> 35:43.920]  pages got leaked to bbc we had greg palestine we've been warning people for nine years red alert
[35:43.920 --> 35:51.360]  this is their plan i mean their plans fell into our hands people risk their lives inside of their
[35:51.360 --> 35:58.400]  to warn you okay people say well how do you know all this it's stated it's i mean we've known this
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.520]  is coming we knew when they got rid of glass stegel in 99 i had george humpfrey economist on
[36:03.520 --> 36:10.240]  i had many other economists in studio telling you what was going to happen so now they're saying
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.400]  this week at davos with all these criminal globalist meeting george soros and others they're saying
[36:15.360 --> 36:19.600]  oh and he's been convicted in foreign countries just like henry kissinger has been convicted
[36:19.600 --> 36:28.000]  they're saying that we've got to give them 100 trillion dollars backed up by taxpayers of the
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.520]  world now they then will loan it back to your government your corporation your individual
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.600]  uh credit card whatever they will loan it back and through fractional reserve banking they'll
[36:39.600 --> 36:47.760]  be able to loan out 1000 trillion under the old one dollar in the bank banks could loan out 10
[36:47.760 --> 36:53.120]  dollars that's the us model england it was one one pound in the bank they could loan out eight
[36:53.120 --> 36:58.800]  pounds it varies between eight to ten eight to ten times since 99 globally that was just gotten
[36:58.800 --> 37:04.080]  rid of they they leverage it ten to one then they sell derivatives on that then they sell
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.360]  derivatives on that and they layer these structured frauds on top of each other and at the end of
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.320]  the day it destroys society destroys your pension destroys your retirement their answer will then be
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.800]  and we're seeing this in other countries so we know how they do it to federalize all the pension
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.440]  funds the name of protecting them so that they don't lose all value and now you're under full
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.720]  government control itself borrowing money from the central banks that engage in the fraud to begin
[37:28.720 --> 37:35.680]  with this is such a big deal now going back to the state of the union i want to play a clip of
[37:35.680 --> 37:42.000]  barack obama making a joke about the tsa and as soon as i saw this last night i caught the big
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.800]  lie everybody's mad at him we have two great articles and info wars dot com by erin dixon
[37:46.800 --> 37:52.400]  curtain emo they both wrote both wrote on it about how he made fun of the sexual molestation
[37:52.400 --> 37:59.840]  but that's only one layer the big issue is that it's a lie see if you can catch the big fat lie
[37:59.840 --> 38:03.280]  i know jaren caught it this morning when i came and he brought it up see if you can catch the
[38:03.280 --> 38:11.120]  blaring giant lie in your face here's barack obama last night within 25 years our goal is to give
[38:11.120 --> 38:21.920]  80 percent of americans access to high-speed rail this could allow you to go places and
[38:21.920 --> 38:28.480]  half the time it takes to travel by car for some trips it'll be faster than flying without the
[38:28.480 --> 38:42.480]  pat down as we speak roots in california in the midwest are already underway by the chinese
[38:43.360 --> 38:49.680]  because we buy toasters and and dvd players and blu-ray disc and they take the money and actually
[38:49.680 --> 38:54.800]  invest it in infrastructure and uh by the way some of these trains go 300 miles an hour so
[38:54.800 --> 39:00.560]  so uh one of the slower bullet trains at over 200 would be basically three times the speed of a car
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.360]  but our rail lines are so ancient and so rotten uh that the systems they're building are limited
[39:05.360 --> 39:10.320]  lines and basically what you just heard was another line but the big lie did you catch it
[39:11.200 --> 39:17.600]  you're not going to be giving pat downs at the train stations really i saw governor ridge eight
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.000]  years ago say it on c-span and now they've for at least five years have had viper teams at train
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.760]  stations in florida new york texas uh they're searching people they're showing up at greyhound
[39:27.760 --> 39:32.480]  bus stations with tsa searching people tsa's announcing that they will be inside football
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.200]  games they're training state guard to search people going back at least six years ago i have that in
[39:37.200 --> 39:44.720]  my 2005 film 911 rise the police state i mean i show the news articles i show photos of them
[39:44.720 --> 39:49.360]  doing it searching three-year-olds in their hello kitty bag literally that's in the film
[39:49.360 --> 39:55.600]  film and they've announced they're going to federalize your local police and have them do tsa
[39:55.600 --> 40:00.800]  type operations and private goons and and metal detectors and body scanners at malls and hundreds
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.680]  and hundreds of federal and state courthouses from miami to denver are already getting them
[40:07.200 --> 40:12.800]  but he said don't worry there won't be any pat down so and again why why was that written into
[40:12.800 --> 40:17.920]  his highly choreographed speech because they know that if we ever get together if we ever have victory
[40:17.920 --> 40:23.520]  on an issue if we ever prove that tsa is a federal power grab and a fraud if we ever come together
[40:23.520 --> 40:27.840]  and get angry and have a victory against their agenda which they're always pushing pushing pushing
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.920]  if we ever turn them back anywhere like the spp nap the super highways in deep trouble almost
[40:33.920 --> 40:39.520]  defeated but it's like a hydra it's got many heads coming back uh we're defeating them on so many
[40:39.520 --> 40:44.480]  other fronts we're defeating their gun grabbing legislation the tide's been turned more and more
[40:44.480 --> 40:49.120]  at the state level against abortion the public's waking up to that so we're winning on many fronts
[40:49.120 --> 40:55.280]  so they're trying to bum rushes and get everything in place and overwhelm us with classically Orwellian
[40:55.280 --> 40:59.520]  things to just basically break our will and acclimate us so they're now having to respond in
[40:59.520 --> 41:05.360]  a state of the union to make it a joke and that's their tactic i listen to local talk radio i listen
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.000]  to national talk radio and most these people aren't controlled they just know to follow what the big
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.360]  talking heads on national television say and it's it's make a joke about them sticking their hands
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.680]  down your wife's pants make a joke about them taking a woman's bra off in front of people
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.840]  make a joke oh but you notice they just lost that lawsuit and they lost the one about filming in the
[41:23.840 --> 41:30.960]  airport uh in uh seattle oh it's just all funny and i listened to national radio and local radio
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.240]  last night i watched tv some last night and this morning and all over the place it was a big joke
[41:36.240 --> 41:43.360]  they'd show a photo of jesse ventura with his um thomas jefferson's excuse me benjamin franklin
[41:43.360 --> 41:49.920]  style haircut and make fun of him and laugh and laugh and laugh not about the issue but laugh at
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.760]  him and i heard another local talk show host say you know how dare him say that in the suit that
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.640]  this is sexual abuse well the law under state and federal losses if someone puts and we've had
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.040]  district attorneys on the show the district attorney out in the county that um san francisco
[42:05.040 --> 42:12.000]  is based in saying that he has officers deputies in that airport and if they touch you through the
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.760]  pants on your genitals it's a misdemeanor if they go in the pants it's a felony so it isn't something
[42:17.760 --> 42:26.160]  that whoopie goldberg and all the rest of these uh uh uh disheveled crusty crones uh are are uh
[42:26.160 --> 42:35.680]  laughing at it's not just that it's that they're making a huge joke out of it and
[42:36.560 --> 42:40.640]  other talk show hosts are making jokes out of ventura saying it violates my fourth amendment
[42:40.640 --> 42:46.480]  it violates my dignity it constitutes sexual assault the touching the squeezing the uh gripping
[42:46.480 --> 42:51.680]  the groping and and and it's admitted by hundreds of reporters who've had it done where they put so
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.400]  much pressure on your genitals it hurts men and almost women feel like they're going to be lifted
[42:56.400 --> 43:05.920]  up off the ground but see they just make a big joke out of this whole thing the toll free number
[43:05.920 --> 43:13.840]  to join us again is 800-259-9231 oh i've just been told by the network that we're going to be taking
[43:13.840 --> 43:17.600]  calls on our end they're having a phone system issue up at the network so let me give you our
[43:17.600 --> 43:25.760]  number here it's a 877-789 alex 877-789 alex on your take on the tsa and what's happening with
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.320]  ventura and on the state of the union since obama brought that into the state of the union
[43:30.320 --> 43:37.360]  discussion but but going back to this there is this concerted effort that jesse ventura is a
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.000]  leader he sticks his head up above the ground you know he's the merecat that's got the nerve to
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.160]  you know challenge the hyena coming up towards the towards the troop and the others are hopping around
[43:48.160 --> 43:54.400]  cowardly saying how dare him stand up how dare him get involved you know we think he's goofy looking
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.760]  he's not being sexually assaulted you know why doesn't he like being bathed in a radiation scanner
[43:59.760 --> 44:04.400]  why doesn't he like every time he flies being pulled out and having people put their hands
[44:04.400 --> 44:11.120]  all over him and on his genitals and up in his uh rear end i mean that's what he talked about on
[44:11.120 --> 44:18.480]  the show they actually go up in the crack between your buttocks this is outrageous and it's all a
[44:18.480 --> 44:25.040]  big joke let them eat cake look at them this governor doesn't like people sticking their
[44:25.040 --> 44:30.960]  hands in his pants or squeezing his genitals what a weirdo i've been with ventura when they pull him
[44:30.960 --> 44:36.640]  out and there's a crowd gathers around to watch jesse ventura being searched and he's more upset
[44:36.640 --> 44:41.440]  by old people going why are you doing that to an old lady in a wheelchair she's not a threat
[44:41.440 --> 44:45.920]  you know what are you doing this to me this is east germany alex and i'm standing 10 feet away
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.000]  this is why i want to move to mexico permanent i don't like living in east germany i can't
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.280]  believe my country's gone you know hurry up get it done and and then they just take their time
[44:55.280 --> 45:02.720]  smiling oh let me see we've gone from land of the free home of the brave to where low wage people
[45:02.720 --> 45:08.480]  are who aren't even sworn peace officers a sworn peace officer has to have an emergency situation
[45:08.480 --> 45:16.800]  or a warrant to stick their hands on your genitals but they're just doing this out in the open if
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.480]  the police are going to search you they've got to take you to the jail and then find the same sex
[45:20.480 --> 45:26.400]  person who's been trained to do it i mean this is prisoner training if you show up to serve a
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.600]  five-year stint in a medium or maximum security prison you know or ten-year stint this is what
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.720]  they're going to do to you okay they're going to stick their hands down your pants this this is
[45:36.720 --> 45:46.640]  prisoner training period now here is the incredible uh whoopie goldberg uh the view piece with all of
[45:46.640 --> 45:50.800]  these women liberal and conservative piling in against ventura now if you're a radio listener
[45:50.800 --> 45:57.440]  you'll miss the faces and you'll hear the laughing they put an image up of him as a wrestler and they
[45:57.440 --> 46:04.240]  say what's his problem you know why doesn't he like being touched and then another woman on the
[46:04.240 --> 46:11.200]  show another dingbat uh says there is no search that's too much there is no such thing as an
[46:11.200 --> 46:17.760]  unreasonable search and they just laugh and laugh and laugh and and they say just look at this photo
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.400]  of him and they put a photo up of him you know with his hair blowing or whatever in the wind and
[46:22.400 --> 46:30.720]  they laugh at that uh hoping you're weak minded this is a tactic and just laugh oh the government
[46:30.720 --> 46:34.320]  sticking their hands down my pants oh they're listening to my phone without warrants oh they're
[46:34.320 --> 46:38.240]  tracking my bank account and taking money out of it with no due process oh they're taking all my
[46:38.240 --> 46:42.160]  freedoms oh they're wanting to put me in a radiation scanner when a woman reportedly according to her
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.560]  it's looks like died when it set off her pacemaker she told him i got a pacemaker they put her through
[46:46.560 --> 46:53.760]  it and she died that's mainline israeli news it's so funny and what i hear on local radio
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.720]  yesterday i'll tell you this vinter is he just doing this for attention a lot of people are going
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.640]  to get mad him calling this molestation well uh really uh if somebody comes and grabs your genitals
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.120]  and you've got to fly three times a week both ways so that's six times a week when he does the show
[47:09.680 --> 47:14.240]  and i've flown with him uh and you've got to stand there in front of a bunch of people singled out
[47:14.240 --> 47:18.960]  because you got a prosthetic hip you got an artificial titanium hip and you've got to have
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.880]  all this done to you and then you let me tell you he's upset about it he's angry when i'm in the
[47:22.880 --> 47:28.400]  taxi cab with him he's he's he's talking about it all the time alex i'm done i'm gonna have to quit
[47:28.400 --> 47:33.520]  they've ruined me i can't do this anymore i gotta get out of here you know oh see i know it's real
[47:33.520 --> 47:39.360]  for ventura he's a real person that understands this is tyranny but their answer to him is just
[47:39.360 --> 47:43.840]  a laugh at him now i'm gonna stop this a few times or maybe i should just write notes during it but
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.400]  there's so many pieces of disinfo oh and they also say well look at just what happened in russia
[47:48.400 --> 47:54.240]  that happened outside the security area and what are they now calling for police and checkpoints on
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.640]  the road coming into airports and then there'll be bombings there and then it'll be on a highway
[47:58.640 --> 48:02.560]  coming into the airport then there'll be bombings there i mean we just have random checkpoints everywhere
[48:02.560 --> 48:08.320]  to stop bombers just like this woman with travis county getting a 48 thousand dollar settlement
[48:08.320 --> 48:14.800]  because of a pothole on a country road when she's on the shoulder on her 10-speed bike the government
[48:14.800 --> 48:19.600]  should have protected me from a pothole hey you go riding bikes around over the years there's a
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.720]  good chance you're gonna get hurt it's part of living you go skiing you're gonna sue colorada

[48:59.120 --> 49:06.560]  lab setting security hey lady you're pretty ugly i wouldn't be laughing at ventura alleging that uh
[49:06.560 --> 49:13.600]  body scans and pat downs quote exposed him to humiliation and degradation through unwanted
[49:13.600 --> 49:21.200]  touching gripping whoopee golbert looks like a troll intimate can i just show you this look at this
[49:21.200 --> 49:28.080]  where you'd be so lucky this is the man who does not want to be innocently touched right here
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.400]  and that's his job as a wrestler that's different but you know what you only get a pat down if you
[49:32.400 --> 49:38.000]  deny the scan okay hit pause i'm gonna come back from break and try to play it all unedited i just
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.440]  can't help it so they're putting images up uh of him and laughing at him uh and several of the women
[49:45.440 --> 49:49.760]  looked disheveled on the program like they're homeless people i'm not attacking homeless people
[49:49.760 --> 49:53.680]  and i'm not even attacking people on their looks but they're making fun of how he supposedly looks
[49:56.160 --> 50:01.760]  and then she says you only get the pat down if you refuse to scan that's not true they threaten
[50:01.760 --> 50:06.640]  you and say if you don't do the scandal do a pat down they do scans and pat downs i've watched it
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.440]  and they say they plan to end up doing pat downs as they phase it in for everyone so they always
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.320]  say oh it's just a little bit of you this is all psychological warfare off teleprompters

[58:17.120 --> 58:22.560]  if they'd have had this they did have the checkpoints they did have the scanners this was
[58:22.560 --> 58:29.760]  outside of the scanner so now checkpoints on the road coming in there'll be a bombing on that

[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.160]  you've covered this i wanted to alert you to a serious situation i think i know it's a little
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.760]  bit off-subject but um you know the same group that bought the world trade center complex two
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.640]  months before 9-11 has bought the sears tower larry silverstein and now they're trying to put
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.000]  their man rama manual in chicago okay see you're you're you're fully aware of it good and but

[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.560]  yeah they said they announced they're going to paint it silver too which is of course how nano
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:36.800]  it's how nanos explosives technology is applied so uh they can be easily they can easily stage
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  another attack there and then blame on the iranians or whatever they want to
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:49.840]  you know my mom um we took the kids uh uh you know on a trip this weekend and uh she she talked

[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.080]  just when you put all the pieces together i think uh i think you're on to something speaking of

[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.480]  pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i have a tremendous influence on our president
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.400]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:28.000]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.880]  world government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.360]  the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:21.680]  so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.480]  20 years ago before i was even on air i was watching alexander haig with some bizarre
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:35.200]  cable show he had that air in austin admitting that he was behind a company to put giant spy
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.560]  blimps above 100 000 feet in the air with face scanning cameras license plate readers you name
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.960]  it that was when i first learned about that then about 10 years ago right before 9 11
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.560]  fema started announcing they were testing giant blimps over cities you got to use a
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.960]  telescope to see them when folks started seeing these in the last six seven years the news would
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.880]  not say oh it's a homeland security blimp they would say is that an alien spacecraft i've got abc
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:08.160]  news aiming cameras at it in dalis and in salt lake city utah with propellers on them and saying
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  is it a flying saucer not saying look it's a blimp see because your government wouldn't spy on you
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.360]  it has to be aliens and then i've been made fun of everywhere for seeing there's government blimps
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.920]  even though they're all admitted but here's an article uh dealing with it even dhs is freaked out
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.720]  by spy drones over america police departments around the country are warming up to unmanned
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.320]  spy planes but don't expect the police department uh or the homeland security department to catch
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.880]  drone fever anytime soon again police departments around the country are warming up to unmanned
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.520]  spy planes but don't expect the department homeland security to catch drone fever anytime soon
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.400]  it's too controversial for an agency already getting hammered for naked scanners and junk
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:59.520]  touching sure dhs flies some predators along the us mexican border but a broader deployment
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.960]  above the majority of america skies to stop terror attacks not likely see either this writer
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:13.040]  spencer ackerman is ignorant or they're lying to you uh because you could just search homeland
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:20.320]  security launches surveillance blimps and drones and you can see one in an msnbc article from 2004
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:28.960]  above dc being launched and they they're unmanned they've got uh their power source solar panels
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.080]  all over the top skin so during the day they get the power there's cameras face scanners
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.360]  infrared scanners it's a lot cheaper than launching satellites into orbit and uh then it can fly
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.280]  around looking through the clouds uh and surveilling you but here's one dealing with utah and utah
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.840]  pops up over and over against one of the main testing grounds of these from our research uh it
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:57.840]  says ogden utah buys its police a blimp and it is a gigantic sucker very large it's got the cameras
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.840]  on it and all the other goodies uh and uh it is of course solar powered and it just flies around
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.800]  watching you so there you go and and homeland security says oh they're not involved in this
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.000]  baloney they're paying for it all with grants and has nothing to do with terrorist or open
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.200]  borders it's about surveilling you on the ground uh and it's about the defense department getting
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.000]  all these contracts militarizing the country uh let's talk to matt in minnesota matt you're on
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.120]  the year welcome hey alex thanks for taking my call uh quick question for you and then a comment
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.600]  about a uh tv show i wanted to bring to your attention um yeah you know i was watching cnn
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.960]  when neil amber kromby came on uh first about a month ago and said he's gonna look for a document
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.360]  i kind of joked on my little brother i you know i said i bet they don't find it now it's pretty
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.880]  surprised that they didn't even find documentation that it existed or any documentation there now
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.680]  this is a huge deal and for those that don't know that just joined us that's the new governor former
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:12:01.520]  congressman the governor of hawaii best buddies uh with a uh a major reporter who has now come out
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.400]  and confirmed that abacrame told him there's no records period that reporter of course is mike
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:14.320]  evans uh syndicated uh uh broadcaster uh he does the hollywood reporter uh a newsbite uh and he
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:22.320]  reported to kq rs fm uh that everything that we saw in the holly lulu advertiser was true uh and
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.880]  i'm gonna play this coming up and that indeed they can find nothing of his birth in hawaii yeah the
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.400]  kq rs up to a local minnesota fm channel here too um you know i think i i think i caught this on
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.720]  you guys as the web on info or as a prison plan about a year ago um it's my understanding that
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.320]  arizona the state of arizona past legislation about a year ago that specifically states a
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.800]  presidential candidate must provide proof of citizenship in order to be an art introduced
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:54.880]  last year it didn't pass uh it passed one house it's now been reintroduced again okay great i
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.560]  and you know i think other other states should uh definitely you know uh use that idea and a quick
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.520]  comment um this sunday night uh you know speaking of the viper squad and the police state this sunday
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.760]  night on the national geographic channel there's a new show airing called counter tear nyc and it
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:17.920]  looks like a total glorification of the nyc police state you know guys with smg's uh and rifles and
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.880]  checkpoints on the on the roads checkpoints uh in the uh subway and then that's used as a beta
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:32.320]  rollout they now admit with darryl gates in the 60s and 70s that the cia and pentagon funded shows
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:38.640]  like swat so that all cops had to get into it and this is all a predictive programming rollout
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:45.680]  of a a a total occupation of the us and our new expanded prison economy is basically all of us
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.160]  being prisoners and government taking blood at checkpoints without warrants sticking their hands
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.800]  down your pants and if you complain they'll have the view just sit up there and laugh at you
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.680]  yeah that's a good point but uh yeah so that's on that's a national geographic check out the
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.880]  check out the website i mean it when you go to the website and you look at it it's it's
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.440]  this glorification of police state it's it's kind of sad but yeah you're right it's brainwashing and
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.520]  the totalitarian tiptoe i hear you and i appreciate your call man i remember about 12 years ago
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:20.960]  seeing an episode of inside the la pd and it was on discovery channel if i remember correctly
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.840]  actually got the tape played it on air at the time caused quite a sensation we pointed it out
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.840]  but when it aired in plain view nobody got upset it took somebody who knows what's going on
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.880]  to get it and then play it and point it out and people got very upset and the neighbors hadn't
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.360]  seen their neighbor in five days they go knock on the door they call the police when the police
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:46.000]  see an nra sticker on the guy's bronco they freak out they call the swat team and they say look at
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.320]  this scum they actually say look at this scum he's in r.a and he had a veteran sticker too and i was
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.360]  like wow that's weird look at this scum and they go in and make fun of his dead body they make fun
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.240]  of the stink he was died of a heart attack they never said he just died natural causes and then
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.040]  the cops start stealing all his guns and they go look at this arsenal it looked like about 15 guns
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.680]  you know legal guns and they go i'm going to keep this one i want that one and then they went outside
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.840]  and said yeah that didn't get any worse than this nra folks if you think i'm joking that really
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.680]  happened it's like if i tell you i have newscast saying mercury's good for your children of course
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.440]  they're talking about injectable mercury into the blood is actually not good for your children
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:34.080]  and causes brain damage actually as a microscopic amount trace element it is in plants it is in
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.640]  fish you do need a little bit of it but when they spend things and say oh the shots got you know as
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.560]  much mercury as a tuna fish sandwich that's different i've had medical doctors in studio talk
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:48.960]  about this and agree with me that's bound in to the other elements that are in the food and almost
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.760]  all of it passes through you and tiny amounts are needed like the japanese eat tons of mercury fish
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.200]  they live the longest in the world on average so again there's always a little truth in what they
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.160]  say it's it's it's really sick but pumping it into a little bitty baby over and over again
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.280]  past the blood brain barrier uh-uh through the stomach is a different thing for very small
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.560]  minute amounts tied with other trace elements and rare earth minerals that are needed in overall
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.960]  metabolic use of the other mainline minerals vitamins and nutrients okay let's go to john
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:32.320]  in west virginia john you're on the air go ahead hello sir go ahead yeah i i watched the state of
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.320]  the union and uh at the end i watched a little bit of the uh the talking heads coming up and
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:44.480]  telling you what he said and uh i remember they said he had a a reagan moment and and i had a
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.400]  reagan moment just then because i i remember reagan came out and said that you know the
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.840]  government was too big and it was too much regulation everything and we got to stop this and
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:02.800]  and basically what he did was he expanded it all and then uh and by reagan moment they're trying to
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:08.720]  imprint us like baby ducks to this fake narrative that oh he's been reborn and the republicans are
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:14.240]  sitting with him and we'll fix america we all just sit down and shut up on this train and all hold
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.880]  hands and sing and and you as the train goes off the cliff you know don't get upset and and and and
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:26.480]  decelerate no no just hold hands and you know what though this is amazing john you actually called
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:34.160]  in on the subject i asked for this is this is bizarre john go ahead said obama said you know
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.840]  that this is the land of opportunity and you can you can use your abilities to get ahead
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.400]  and in effect the federal government his administration and all the administrations in
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.600]  the past have been putting it so that you know your only opportunity is to go work for some big
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.960]  corporation and and let them get the money from any great innovations you come up with
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.960]  and you know it's like you're the regulators just keep you from doing anything well i agree with
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:07.280]  you but the one of the other issues is baner it isn't that when a man cries it's bad because
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.320]  sometimes i'll be talking about children being murdered or the tyranny that's taking place and
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.280]  i think about my own family in their future and i'll get emotional and get a little teary eyed
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:24.800]  and maybe once every two or three months um but baner starts crying when people talk about him
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:30.480]  and his struggles when they're talking about iraq dead or whatever he doesn't cry uh he cries when
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:36.400]  they're talking about him and i mean baner just comes off every time i see him he's crying i mean
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.520]  this guy i think it's a sign of mental illness i i mean i have to be so i'm i'm sorry it's one of
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.320]  you cry every once in a while you know or or get a tear in your eye when you uh you know think about
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.480]  others being hurt but whenever he talks about himself and how he can't believe all the power
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:56.720]  he's got he's on such an incredible power trip he starts crying with joy and he remember he's an
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.680]  acolyte he's a minion of protege of newt genrich and and so what does that tell you
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:08.640]  him what else did you think about him uh opening the speech of it's good to have parties and
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.520]  people arguing with each other but we did have that shooting i mean he was saying right there
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:20.320]  oh see uh you you're causing the shootings and then he went on america's great and get behind me
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.040]  or you don't believe it is it was it was like he was saying he's america did you see that
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.880]  oh yeah and it was that was the theme throughout his his whole speech it was like it even ended
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:36.960]  you know saying you know we gotta be you know together to to follow me and and you know over
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:43.360]  the hill we're gonna we're gonna find uh you know uh milk and honey but you know in the in the meantime
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.560]  he's got the government you know it's just growing and growing and growing and and taking us all over
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.880]  well said and remember what he did three years ago in the campaign hope and change and he and
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.880]  everything's gonna be fixed and he's gonna kick out wall street people are like thank you president

[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.360]  the union by the globalist trader up there trying to get rid of our sovereignty let's talk in fact
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.200]  he talked about that we got to work with the world we got to do all of this what's he say when he's
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.560]  overseas all nations have a responsibility to the new world order let's go ahead and talk to
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.960]  rusty in texas rusty you're on the air hey alex how you doing good great thanks for having me on
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.480]  um listen just about a state of the union a lot of what i wanted to say was just that you know
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.280]  he didn't really do anything but just restate a bunch of things that he stated back when he was
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.480]  trying to become president if i'm not mistaken no he said almost exactly the same thing except
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.960]  not the hope and change he just said things are going to get better if you just don't fight with
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.360]  each other and don't get angry and basically do what we tell you right although i am a little
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.120]  bit surprised that you didn't mention anything about trying to take our guns away from us yeah
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.360]  gibbs said that he was going to bring that up so i guess gibbs is wrong well but that shows that
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.400]  they know they can't get away with this anymore because people are waking up yeah things are
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.760]  definitely starting to i think criminal around them um which is why i feel like they're you
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:45.760]  know really starting to push things on us um you know it's coming out you know they want to uh well
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.360]  i won't go into all that i'm saving a lot of time but you know i just wanted to you know say that
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.760]  that really he didn't say anything other than anything that i've already heard and you know
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:00.240]  it wasn't really much surprise i wasn't either rusty good to hear from you the scary thing is how
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.400]  a lot of the republican leadership is agreeing yeah we got to work together yeah we got to lower
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.360]  the rhetoric because they're worried about the more truly libertarian parts of the tea party
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.400]  kicking the rhinos out of office as we've seen started to happen so you really got the democrats
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.960]  and republicans to a great extent circling the wagons against the people the republicans are
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:25.280]  scoring some symbolic points like oh they repealed government health care in the house knowing full
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.400]  well that they didn't have it the senate why don't they start impeachment hearings for unconstitutional
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.880]  activity why don't they go after obama for having all these golden sacks people who are getting bail
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.520]  out money well then then they have to go after bush so see they don't want to do that they don't
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:45.600]  want to go after them for real issues let's talk to jim in texas jim you're on the air thanks for
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.960]  letting me uh express my opinion elix yeah thanks for calling jim what's on your mind well i kind of
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.080]  was you took my thunder away there i was going to say that that's what i got from this uh speech
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.960]  mostly was a dropping of the facade of the right left paradigm and then we're seeing you know basically
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.720]  them coming out and saying okay now we're unified which is what your listeners have known for a long
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.800]  time that it's a fraud the right left paradigm system it's a it's a puppet show uh uh secondly
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:21.920]  you know alex i'd like to suggest uh i love your show listen to it every day uh suggest maybe that
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.080]  you or if you didn't feel comfortable maybe you could get lindsay williams or somebody else to do
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:32.400]  a daily prayer because this is really a spiritual battle and at its core we're talking about a
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.040]  satanic cult that these people are and i think you would agree with that statement as wacky as it may
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:43.200]  sound well even if you're an atheist and don't believe in a physical satan i mean killing a
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.800]  million iraqis putting sodium fluoride in the water naked body scanning everything that's happening
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.880]  is devilish by every archetypal yardstick so i mean these people act and behave like
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.400]  satan masochistic psychopaths and they are and we know government throughout history gives us
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.640]  hitlers and mouths and stolents and it's happening again by this political ruling class that runs
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.160]  through major political parties globally who are in there in control of the tax money giving it to
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.360]  their corporate bosses that fund them but absolutely i know god's real i don't quote believe in god i
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.000]  know there's a creator and i have a personal relationship with that creator and i love liberty
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.640]  and life and that's the side i choose is life and the truth doesn't mean i'm perfect or on some
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.800]  high horse either but i think people should privately pray every day and even if you don't
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:36.320]  believe in god try to sit down and just quietly think and and and and i don't mean meditate in
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.760]  the yogi way but uh or like a buddhist but i mean you know just sit quietly and and really get to
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.880]  that still place and think about the things that are happening they don't want you to recognize
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:51.760]  tyranny they want to laugh i mean could you believe that laughing at jesse ventura and saying
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:58.240]  there's no search that's unreasonable and and lying and saying that they only pat you down
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.720]  if you don't go through the scanners i mean we and laughing at him it was purely demonic
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.760]  well i i agree with you and i i the more i uh i have learned that the less i really watch tv
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.240]  because it's totally the mind control device and you see it in everything from the local news
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:21.600]  broadcasting to the to the tv uh actual shows uh it's it's been written into the shows and these
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.240]  these little people on the view and all these other programs we're talking about they're basically
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.120]  cheerleaders the only thing they're missing is their pom poms with the corporate logos on them

[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:51.280]  we're now 99.9 percent assured that obama was not born in the state of hawaii like he claimed
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.640]  and we now have this from an interview the governor gave and then an interview he gave to
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.920]  another well-known reporter who's known him for decades that yeah he can't find anything
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:05.360]  not just the certificate nothing so that's coming up in the next hour and what is the
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.880]  constitutional ramifications of this or is this some stunt where the governor's claiming all this
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.040]  and they're going to produce it later it's going to have a political score to make all of the
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.160]  anti-obama stuff going on rest on this birth certificate instead of the gun grabbing the
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:27.680]  open borders that the carbon taxes the government health care you know the overspending is this
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:34.080]  uh some type of scam i don't know but they're sure trying to act like uh he's guilty of lying
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:40.480]  about where he was born and we got his wife obviously saying uh that uh he was he goes back
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.840]  to his homeland where he was born in kenya we've got his grandmother saying and i mean this is a big
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.280]  deal this is a big big big deal and we're going to be covering that coming up in the next hour
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.920]  after we take some more of your calls but i wanted to uh get to this subject before we
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.840]  talk to loyge Chapman the founder of american small business league to get his take on the
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:07.680]  state of the union briefly uh last night uh asbl.com uh we played the view attacking jesse vintera
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:13.200]  earlier in the last hour and there's a statement in there by one of the women i don't know what's
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:18.720]  the blonde's name i don't watch the show what's the blonde's name the the none of us know i'm
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.280]  kind of proud that our office uh no one knows her name uh but but but she says well you don't
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.440]  don't have to go through the the pat down which includes hands going in the pants sometimes
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.480]  are squeezing genitals if you go through the scanner that's not true they do scanner and
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.920]  pat down scanner or only pat down they admit they want to phase it all in i've witnessed this myself
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.760]  and and rob do and and uh erin dyke shot video of this i'm going to play that brief clip from the
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.880]  view and then show you our video of people coming out of the scanners and then having the
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:53.760]  rapedowns done to them uh here it is so that's different but you know what you only get a pat
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:58.160]  down if you deny the scan okay if you deny the right to scan i want to know what's going on
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:07.120]  when you sue homeland security and then there she goes barbara walters i do know her name uh
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.480]  then she goes on to imply that it's crazy to be able to sue the government oh i guess they're
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.560]  just unaccountable they're like god on mount olympus they can do whatever they want now i'm
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.800]  going to show you some video if you're a radio listener uh obviously this will be archived later
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.640]  at prison planet dot tv and then on youtube you'll be able to watch it but i'm going to play some
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:29.680]  video in the background uh of people coming out of the scanners uh and after they go through the
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.880]  scanners they are then brought over and they are patted down so they do whole variants of this
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.440]  their threat is if you don't do the scanners we're going to do the pat down uh but uh you know there
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.560]  she is now directing uh people over to be uh further search the guy's waiting you saw the
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:52.960]  guy in the shirt be sent through he's now waiting uh to be patted down and uh now there is the tsa
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:59.360]  worker beginning the pat down uh on him we got a whole bunch of this footage and then here comes
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:05.680]  another person through the scanner now being sent over uh to secondary uh screening and there it is
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:11.600]  seem uh being being patted down there you go okay and they plan to phase it in everywhere and the
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.960]  tsa has said they plan to make it mandatory for everyone chicago tribune six months ago
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:22.080]  and we have the el paso times after we were told by listeners a pilot that everyone in el pasos
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:27.920]  being forced through them last year everyone uh through the scanners uh then we searched it and
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.800]  found the el paso times reporting on it so there you go view and i could go through every second
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.760]  of that minute and a half clip everything they say is a fraud including two of the women sitting
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:43.120]  there uh falling over each other in the script to say there is no such thing as an unreasonable
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:49.920]  search and this is an unreasonable search there's no such thing as one uh you can go watch the video
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.080]  in the archive what we played earlier i don't even know these women's name except for the
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.920]  except for the uh barbara walters okay uh shifting gears now back into the state of the union uh here's
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:06.160]  their uh statement on it obama state of the union addresses historic um obama state of the union
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:13.040]  addresses highlights uh rhetoric uh without action and joining us to cover it is uh mr
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.880]  loy chatman founder of american small business league with hundreds of thousands of members
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.360]  out there defending american small business uh sir give us your take on the state of the union
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:32.640]  so it was obama sitting there reading a speech that was written for him reading off a teleprompter
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.040]  as you could tell that's when you see him looking left and right he's reading off a teleprompter
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:44.160]  he practiced it uh you know earlier that day and he's just like an actor reading his lines in a movie
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.920]  and it's it's it's what i call washington political theater you know them standing up and
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:55.280]  applauding the whole thing it's choreographed and it's just uh you know those aren't his words
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.240]  those are those are words that that someone wrote for him and those aren't his thoughts or his
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:06.720]  feelings that's just what the um the speech writing people thought you know would improve his ratings
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:14.240]  and quite frankly um uh i don't believe the thing that obama says to take truth uh he's he's just
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:21.440]  lied so many times and quite frankly remember i endorsed him i endorsed him i campaign for him
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:28.640]  he put my endorsement on the front page of his website so um he's broken as far as i know every
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:35.440]  single campaign promise that he made so really nothing that that he says really has much credibility
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:42.080]  with me and uh he also often say you know just live talking about the economy's doing better
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:48.000]  here's some statistics that uh we dug up here in fact here's a quote we broke the back of the
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.640]  recession really every every real indicator is it's getting deeper but he says it's over in
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.480]  june of 2009 i'll tell you something think about that think about that the pro united states who's
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:03.440]  supposed to be the leader of our nation going on national television and telling american people
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:10.080]  we've broke the back of the recession the truth is that um the labor department says
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:16.880]  u6 unemployment is 16.7 percent that doesn't include 20 of the population that's that's a
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:24.640]  self-employed unemployment is is over 20 percent uh home prices are projected to drop another 7.1
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:33.120]  percent they're down 34 overall um a a noted economist uh david levy is saying that we're
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:40.640]  almost uh or as highly likely another recession is going to happen in 2011 um golden sacks leaked
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:47.520]  something or something leaked at a golden sacks that they see unemployment going up uh in 2011
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:54.960]  and um you know the economy's doing terrible uh and of course the the thing that really just
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.200]  drives me up a wall is corporate profits are up so corporate profits are up
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:07.360]  uh home prices are plunging unemployment's going up i think that just kind of shows you
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.760]  where the focus is in washington and again i when i talk to people about politics and they
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.160]  sit there and they tell me how unhappy they are i always say the same thing it's much worse than
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.120]  you think it is well that's what obama's job and the republican leadership's jobs are is it just
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.720]  soft soap people conom string them along the megabanks are making the biggest profits in their
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:33.440]  history as the economy implodes they're able to consolidate the industry the media the smaller
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.720]  businesses and corporations they're laying more regulations more state and local taxes in
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:46.320]  which the megacorporations are on record lobbying for the food safety act written by big agra to
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.560]  shut down their competition when they're the ones that are responsible for almost all of the
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.960]  agriculture disasters i mean the business is going very very well and and obama's doing a
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.800]  fabulous job according to the globalist i mean that's like what uh george soros said last year
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:08.000]  he said i'm having a great crisis i love this i mean i mean they love the food riots and the
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.520]  people going hungry and the homeless numbers and the record foreclosures on houses because they are
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.080]  feeding on things through this predatory system and and let's go over some of the broken campaign
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.840]  promises uh because that's really what this was was just another campaign speech pushing more hope
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:31.440]  and change under other names they just went to the thesaurus and changed uh you know from hope and
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:36.400]  change to other variants of that and the message was come together and do what we tell you and
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.480]  things are going to get better america's great and if you don't agree with our policies you
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:45.040]  don't think america's great i mean this was literally like a pep rally for two-year-olds
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:53.680]  absolutely um the truth is that um you know the big corporations that backed obama's campaign
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.960]  are making record profits while the american people are on their knees you know trying to uh
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:04.480]  you know pay their rent and their mortgages and feed their families um you can't believe anything
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:10.240]  that obama says obama said uh for two years virtually every single day during the campaign if
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:15.920]  he was elected president he would enact a windfall profit tax on the oil and gas industry to try to
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:24.240]  you know keep the price of uh you know gas regulated and he never did that but uh he said that he
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.200]  would end the diversion of federal small business contracts to uh fortune 500 firms he didn't do
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:34.400]  that any anything that had to do with with the middle class american people in fact he's trying
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:38.720]  to have that secret blacklist that we you talked about a few months ago with us where they don't
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.160]  even have to let companies know if their bid was even looked at absolutely in fact he also said
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:49.920]  he'd have the most transparent administration history um since the last time i talked to you
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:56.640]  i filed a case with the supreme court and here's what i want i want the phone records of a guy named
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.080]  mike stammer at the small business administration i just want to i just want to see his phone records
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.560]  i've got the phone records of other similar people but i've got to go to the supreme court now
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:14.480]  and spend tons of money because i think this guy is um uh hiding information that shows rampant
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.760]  fraud and abuse in federal small business contract contracting programs i like to tell people when
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:28.000]  you watch obama talk and realize that every day that he's been president two billion dollars
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.520]  in federal contracts that by law should be going to small businesses the middle class
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.400]  have been averted to fortune 500 firms and some of the biggest companies of the world in europe
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:44.960]  and asia so i i think it's something like uh i think it's about a million to two million dollars
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:52.160]  a minute a minute in federal small business funds that these are funded by law are supposed to go
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.160]  to small businesses are being diverted to some of the biggest companies in the world and now
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:00.400]  they want to make it a secret that small businesses are to be blackballed and not even looked at when
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.480]  by law it's supposed to be going to the small businesses but i mean here's something we know
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:10.400]  is going on that's a hundred percent proven we know he's given out hundreds and hundreds and
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:16.000]  hundreds of waivers to his political contributors uh i mean you know one of the biggest of course
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.800]  being mcdonald's that they don't have to get insurance but the small businesses do that's
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:26.800]  an unfair trade advantage that is big city chicago mafia where their buddies get to operate
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.760]  but your business basically gets shut down right there we know they're engaged in classical
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:39.040]  political uh favors absolutely you know you know the thing that's so sad to me is uh um
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:46.640]  you know i i um i used to be very patriotic and was very proud of america and and and
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:51.680]  after suing the government for 20 years i've come to understand that our government is
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.440]  is just completely totally corrupt from one end to the other i don't care if they're democad or
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:04.640]  republican um those people are elected to congress on contributions from large corporations large
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:11.520]  corporations own that town here's a fascinating thing watch the sunday news programs and and
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:17.840]  watch who who's running all the ads it's lockheed bowing northrop incorporations
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:23.440]  watch lockheed and bowing running ads on television or what do they have that people can buy
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.680]  so so these guys well we know they're actually federalizing our police putting security blips
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.040]  up drones uh robots to fight the non-existent bombs that are supposedly going to be blowing up
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:40.720]  everywhere uh the military industrial complex is eating what's left of america you've got it
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:46.160]  you've got it the mill the military industrial complex that isonair warned us about over 50 years
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.320]  ago alex here here's a couple of my ideas to save the economy
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:57.600]  i think we should shut down those wars in iraq against them because we can't afford it
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:02.240]  you know we can keep those people out of our country we can protect ourselves you know in
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:08.960]  other ways we can't afford it um as you know that uh exxon mobile and g e paid no federal
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:18.320]  income tax last year zero not a dime google pays 2.4 yeah so we need to get these corporations
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.360]  paying their fair share of taxes and to me you know if you want to create jobs it's real simple
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.840]  ask a six-year-old kid this question two years ago the truth is from the us census bureau small
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.240]  businesses create over 95 percent of all net new jobs and the government by law is supposed to give
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:42.080]  contracts to them so at least some of our tax money comes back but not anymore no no so when you
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.480]  look at when you look at where the economic stimulus funds have gone small businesses have
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:52.720]  gotten a handful of pennies while goldman sacks and aig those guys have gotten hundreds of billions
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.320]  but think of the logic of this it's just it's real simple small businesses create 95 percent of all
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:05.120]  net new jobs you can't have the economy recover without getting unemployment down and obama has
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:10.480]  given small businesses virtually none of the stimulus funds and every day that he's been in
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.280]  president uh that he was in the office he's given the federal funds that were supposed to go to
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:21.760]  small businesses to large corporations and it's not me there's been i think 20 investigations
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:27.280]  the sb inspector general in report 515 said that the version of these federal funds to large
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:33.280]  corporations was one of the largest challenges facing our country today but it's just so irritating
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.880]  to see him get up on television and and just why to the american people and tell them that
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.040]  the things are getting better things are getting worse so here's what people can plan on housing
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:48.640]  prices are going to go down unemployment is going to go up cities are going to start to go bankrupt
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:55.760]  and uh things are not getting better and my guess is as as as the middle class suffers more and more
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:01.360]  and more i'll bet you that goldman sacks and these large financial institutions on wall street
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.480]  will make more and more profits well they are they designed they've designed the whole thing
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:13.040]  loy chappman american small business uh league uh founder and head and uh but small businesses
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:19.120]  need to band together join your organization get involved speak out against this basic fraud
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.160]  that's going on and goldman sacks jp Morgan they've all made record profits they've engineered
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.560]  this they've done this the third world countries over and over again it was obama's job to sell
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:32.480]  fake hope and change the republicans are involved in this scam as well and that's why they're so
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.520]  desperate now they're saying yeah let's work together americans don't be angry sit down and
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.960]  shut up it shows how weak they are and how scared they are the american people folks were upset by
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.840]  bush they voted for obama now they know obama's bad a republican goes in and doesn't immediately
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:52.080]  deliver the real awakening is going to happen there everything we've seen so far is just a
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:57.200]  prelude that's why they're trying to come in with an authoritarian police state to backstop this
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.000]  because they know we're waking up i mean we are entering incredible times in closing loy do you
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.440]  agree with that statement absolutely we're in big big trouble things are really are going to get
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:13.360]  very very bad and people need to do something so people out there listening do something call your
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:20.400]  call your congressman do something you know um go by their office complain call the white house
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.960]  but do something think about what you can do and do something don't just sit around and and yell
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.600]  out the television do something at least talk to neighbors and get the buzz expanding so people
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.280]  know they're not alone that's why we have this v for victory campaign you know just just so people
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.880]  understand there's a solidarity across political spectrum not left or right against what's going

[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.560]  long discussions he's doing it because he really does care i don't agree with every political view

[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:18.320]  takeover really happened to a great extent 1913 the banks take over the banking system the financial
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:23.840]  system from congress and then by 1933 they bring us into emergency receivership to the bank of

[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:53.040]  the state of the disunion the globalist takeover last night uh let's talk to martina in iowa you're
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:01:02.000]  on the air hello hello welcome hey i just wanted to say that a bunch of us on facebook
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:08.400]  are the terrorists were criticizing our dictator as he spoke last night
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:16.720]  and i found one thing out of this speech that fact that we're still fighting al qaeda
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:20.640]  and that we need to be afraid of them
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:32.000]  hello yes ma'am now and then i see an article that says obama wants to jail americans with new law
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.200]  from the european union times and it talks about that's not a real that's not a real
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.720]  website ma'am i appreciate your call uh let's go ahead and talk to rick in florida rick you're on
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.800]  the air go ahead good afternoon alex i called to ask a couple of questions about jesse ventura's
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:57.760]  conspiracy theory television show sure go ahead um are there any plans that you know of for a third
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:02.960]  season that's up in the air right now ventura is not going to fly commercial that's why he's
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:07.920]  got his lawsuit going and uh quite frankly i just told you earlier if you're listening he
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:11.280]  didn't particularly want to do either one of the seasons he did it because he wanted to
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.920]  you know expose the globalist uh but uh it's up in the air they don't know there's going to be a
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:21.120]  third season right now especially after the censorship of the show by homeland security and
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.880]  congressman cohen that's what i wanted to ask you about really is what do you what can you
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.760]  tell us about how that all went down the censorship of the fema internment the uh police state episode
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.880]  well i've talked a lot about it uh the problem is i was told internally about it about a month
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:43.840]  before it broke that happened back in early november and you know obviously people tell
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.600]  you stuff in confidence they're like we're waiting to see what's going to happen please don't tell
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:53.040]  all of this yet and then since then they've still asked me not to get into all of it but there's
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:03:00.160]  been harassment break-ins people's trash being dug through by men in suits uh homeland security adl
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:09.280]  visits uh at time warner putting pressure on tru tv uh congressman cohen uh reportedly you know was
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.920]  saying just take it off the air and i won't go crazy and and then now they took it off the air
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:19.040]  and he you see him running around on cnn when he's not calling republicans nazis uh you know
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:24.160]  attacking ventura and saying his show could cause new oklahoma city i mean so the reason i'm even
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.800]  able to talk about it because once you're told something in confidence you don't break that
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:34.640]  confidence as a journalist when i wear that hat uh is uh because uh cohen is running around everywhere
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.600]  all over the place demonizing the first amendment so there you have it i mean that's what's going on
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:48.400]  right one last question any plans to release either the first two seasons on dvd i have told them
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.280]  that that would be a great idea and obviously tru tv is not stupid they know it was a hit show
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.080]  they guaranteed on dvd it would it would be a big seller but uh you notice they moved it from
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:04.400]  wednesday when it was a number one show on their network to a friday at night which is the dead zone
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:09.120]  and then it still did incredibly well and so there's there's upper management
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.640]  i mean obviously strangling it so i wouldn't hold your breath for a third season
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:20.320]  thanks alex you bet that's the uh information uh on that i mean there's a lot of other stuff
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:26.800]  that went on and i've been asked not to talk about it kind of like when i knew mark cuban had gotten
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:31.520]  white house phone calls threatening him to not put out loose change final cut in theaters
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:36.960]  and i couldn't talk about it i just said he'd been threatened pretty much broke confidence to
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:42.480]  even say that i just can't help it but i didn't give out all the information uh and um then it came
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:46.800]  out the new york times the emails on top of phone calls uh you know with the white house and we're
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:50.640]  going to get you for putting that movie out and so they indicted him of course it was all fraud so
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:55.600]  we beat it i think they've re-indicted him now so uh there you go i mean we're not this is where

[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.240]  in my stomach but this guy and i know he's a human somewhere inside he's got to be human
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:11.680]  for him to joke about the tsa you know what if his daughters went to the same experience of tsa
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:17.600]  just lost that court settlement over you know what if these women on the view had to have a cavity
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.600]  search how funny would it be for them it just makes me sick it's like well they said there's no
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:27.120]  search that's that's too invasive on the show lie that's a lie and they're just they're just
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:32.320]  in well you notice that's the tactic obama made it a joke the view made it a joke i heard local
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:38.400]  radio make it a joke that's the america jellyfish response that we're supposed to have to tyranny
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.840]  is to make it a joke when somebody valiantly sues homeland security and then barbara walters
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:50.880]  marveling and the other women marveling that someone you can sue them how dare him there are
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:56.800]  kings the smartest people i know the people around these who go to college who are nurses who are
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:03.920]  doctors have all been indoctrinated with this laughter response you can show them facts you
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.040]  can show them government documents and instead of them wrapping their head around how evil this is
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.600]  they just laugh and it makes me sick to my stomach well they're under a form of hypnosis
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:16.640]  they're under a form of mind control i wouldn't laugh at them they're victims
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.640]  but they have gibbering delight in the face of a threat it's a super coward response a regular
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:28.240]  low-level coward uh you know knows they're a coward and get scared and just shuts up because
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:34.000]  that's scary but real cowards hardcore cowards dorge arwell wrote about this engage in crime
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  stop or double think they decide the threats a joke and tell themselves it's no big deal
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.560]  with cognitive dissonance and then it's also kind of an elitist attitude that if they can
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:49.600]  laugh about it it somehow gives them power good to hear from you leo and mass you're on the air
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.080]  and then it's also kind of an elitist attitude that if they can
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:56.000]  hey who's that guy here in the background on the radio
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:04.080]  he's going to come there in a minute hi hello hello hey leo how you doing buddy

[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:21.120]  gone uh in the um the view the game they're playing hello yes sir uh we see i've probably figured
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:31.040]  out what's going on rush limbaugh um savage hasselbeck they're all part of the same game
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:38.880]  and some of us don't really see it i see limbaugh as the perfect liberals caricature of what
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:50.720]  a conservative is he gets national uh vision uh savage he gets he's a hateful against the
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:58.160]  mozzams so he gets to go on hasselbeck she is an idiot george bush supporter who knows how to
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:04.560]  play ball and so she stays you see a game going on here oh i see it yeah but i think i think the
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:10.000]  whole thing is that the people at large don't see this whole game plus um i think the really
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:17.600]  important thing is that at times we tend to pin the tail on only one donkey but i see the donkeys
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:23.360]  is being a hydroheaded three hydroheaded donkeys one of which being the jesuit vatican and the
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:29.040]  other being the city of london and the jewish scientist in israel so you know we have to
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:33.280]  see the the donkey is having three heads is what i'm saying that's a scary donkey i appreciate
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:39.200]  your call leo uh rich runner in ohio then i'm getting into the uh big development on the

[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:56.320]  night and uh i would just say like what gondy said first uh you know they ignore you then they
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:02.160]  ridicule you then you resist them fight them and then you win and you're doing a great job and
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:09.040]  fight them and uh they're using ridicule uh to basically uh hypnotize everyone and make it
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:15.520]  hopefully it go away but jesse ventura's act of uh suing them and bob bar coming up with it is a
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:21.760]  great thing that's right they're getting scared right now rich runner and so they're trying every
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.320]  trick in the book they're attacking they're ignoring they're ridiculing they're basically
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:32.000]  doing it all at the same time but you see that all the polls show no one is buying it there's a
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.480]  small brain dead group out there across this political spectrum uh but but it's never been
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:43.760]  you know the jellyfish the spineless ones that change things it was five percent that started
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:49.840]  in one the revolutionary war really three percent started at five percent won it we're in an info war
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:54.160]  and if we can reach out to military police bureaucrats and others they're going to see they don't
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:58.240]  have a stake in the new world order they're going to see it's bad they're going to know how evil it
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:04.720]  is and and they can just passively support us by getting info out by speaking up a little bit
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:10.960]  by by by educating others all of us together none of us have to save the world by ourselves
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.800]  it's all of us just doing a little bit every day and and signifying and speaking up and and and
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:22.480]  not going along with this and spreading the word about good alternative media sources final point
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:30.080]  yeah um just an observation connecting some dots you had a your first speaker they were talking
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:36.880]  about the towers you know Shapiro made the point about absence you know an okc alcoma city in a
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:44.000]  911 obama's uh you know administration would be kaput and uh it just seems so convenient here you
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.960]  have napolitano lindsay williams talked about that friend of his and uh going to washington offered a
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:55.680]  job and then she didn't take it and then the politano said something's going to happen i can't
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:01.200]  tell you what it half is and then this stuff happens in her state it's uh you know there's
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:06.960]  mind control he was obsessed with it this Tucson guy and uh i don't know connecting some of these
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:13.120]  dots no no in fact in fact you just reminded me i heard chatter on this show other shows
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:18.720]  about something's gonna happen in arizona remember that in the months before and lindsay
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:26.240]  williams wow i've forgotten about that i appreciate your call it's it's crazy okay here's really the
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:31.600]  biggest development yet that i've seen in the whole soap opera that is barry sataro aka barack
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:37.840]  obama's birth certificate and just recapping we know that he gave up his us citizenship to become
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:42.560]  an indonesian citizen and his name is barry sataro that's not debated we know his grandmother in
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:47.040]  kenya claims he was born there we know that they never released the real birth certificate but claim
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:52.240]  that they had now they admit okay there's an original blueprint that has the footprints in the signature
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:56.800]  and the governor the incoming governor a month ago said abacrombie in hawaii said i'm going to release
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:04.480]  it uh then uh about eight days ago but last tuesday the uh honolulu advertiser had an
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:07.520]  interview with him and just a footnote about hey what about the birth certificate and he said well
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.920]  i've been looking and i can't find it and i know that's going to become a big campaign issue and
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.760]  i'm worried about it and we covered that in jurum course he covered it and drudge covered it and
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:22.800]  he got really big now a very well known reporter i've heard this guy for years mike evans he does
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:28.240]  kind of straight non gossip you know hollywood and and and tv reporting mike evans in hawaii
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:34.000]  friends for many years uh with the governor who was a congressman he's known him since he was
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.840]  quoted taxicab driver we're gonna play that uh i mean you'll just hear it from him but to say yeah
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.560]  i talked to the governor my good friend and he said they can find no records they can find nothing
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:48.720]  not just the birth certificate nothing obama has said it's two different hospitals they don't know
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:56.640]  which one it is uh i mean this is really getting suspicious and even the receipt of the birth
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.800]  certificate a lot of experts looked at it and said it was fake so this is a big constitutional
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:05.600]  crisis and it's now time for congressional hearings on this let's go ahead and play part of this
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:14.960]  radio uh clip on kq rs fm uh with them talking to the reporter uh who talked to neil abacromby and
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:20.000]  again the reporter is mike evans the hollywood reporter here it is next item no show business
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.680]  but i have a personal uh interest so i thought i'd share with you former u.s congressman from
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:31.120]  hawaii neil abacromby has been a friend of mine for decades in fact when i first met neil
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:38.400]  neil he was driving a cab in hornelulu well neil and i spent a lot of time together in
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:44.800]  washington dc during obama's inauguration neil told me then that he was going to run for governor
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:51.200]  of hawaii he had had had had enough of being a u.s congressman he also told me that his stories
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:57.440]  and he told me many times that after barack became famous that when he was in college going to the
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.320]  university of hawaii he was a friend of barack obama's dad and he remembers barack obama as a
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:08.880]  little kid he used to call him barry in fact i did a tv interview with uh abacromby at c span
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:14.720]  the day after the inauguration and we had a we had a stop twice because he referred to the
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.360]  president as barry which he if that's what he did he said i can't do i got to call him the
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.760]  mr president well neil promised me that when he became governor he was going to cut through all
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:27.920]  the red tape he was going to get obama's birth certificate get once and for all and in the
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:33.600]  stupid controversy that he was not born in the united states yesterday talking to neil's office
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:38.640]  neil says that he searched everywhere using his powers governor at the copilani women's and
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.360]  children's hospital and queen's hospital the only places kids were born in hawaii back when barack
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:51.600]  was born there is no barack obama birth certificate in hawaii really absolutely no proof at all that
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:59.600]  he was born in hawaii wow now he went out he loves obama i mean he purposely did this to get rid of
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:07.440]  that that question now got some agon in the face i mean now he admits publicly that there is no
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:12.000]  birth certificate honestly well i might be addendum to that is there's this story of that there was
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.480]  a birth announcement but it's been explained his grandparents could have called the newspaper and
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:21.360]  said hey he's you know we are grandchild was born and uh he didn't have to be born in hawaii for
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:26.080]  that so it's it's raising the issue again absolutely as there seem to be put to bed i asked him i go
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:33.760]  well do you when do you remember when do you remember barack when you first memory and he goes
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:42.000]  i remember him playing like in a t-ball league and i go like well he was like he was like five or
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:47.760]  six something like that i go what about before that he goes i don't really remember him much
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:54.480]  before that which i find is very odd ah anyway okay we're gonna go to break and it goes on the

[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:58.080]  homeland where he was born kenya uh the fact that his name is very saturo that everybody knew him

[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:27.280]  covering up we know they lied and said the official birth certificate had been released
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:32.080]  three years ago and a year ago and a month ago and they never have and now we've seen hardball

[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:27.040]  go now i i literally without looking see scores of these articles every day i know you do but
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:33.360]  remember two years ago steve shank of e-foods direct because he's the biggest storeable
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:37.920]  foods maker in the country it's all right here in the u.s and he said you won't believe how
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:42.240]  price is already going up but the media for wholesalers was lying about that saying oh there's no
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:47.120]  inflation then a year ago he said get ready it's really about to go up then six months ago he said
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:51.760]  i got to go up on prices for the first time in a decade mcdonald's is announcing massive price
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:37:00.320]  increases of their adulterated you know junk food world food prices jumped to record on sugar and
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:08.960]  oil seeds and this is out of bloomberg today here's another one again mcdonald's uh announcing
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:14.800]  they're going to have to go up in their food prices um obama tells us the world economic rules
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:20.240]  have changed basically there are new boss the issue is i wanted to bring steve on he's a sponsor
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:25.440]  but i called him last week i said i want to have you as a guest i mean really as a guest here
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:30.640]  because you are there you are getting the raw materials the non-gmo non-hybrid food without
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:35.120]  all the adulterations you're putting it together you're dealing with it you understand that you
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:39.840]  predicted this or i guess already saw it happening to give us your expertise on just i mean there's
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:45.600]  already food riots all over the world going on right now i mean you see it in the news and and
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:49.440]  i'm not what i've been told by inside sources is it's not that you want to be able to get food
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:53.360]  and you'll be able to afford it because of the inflation that's what lindsay williams has been
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:57.920]  saying so i remember two years ago going come on steve even if there's inflation it's not gonna
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:01.600]  be that bad he goes look you don't understand i'm already seeing it well now he's seeing an
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:06.880]  acceleration so i wanted to bring steve shank from efoodsdirect.com up with us because he made
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:11.840]  the point two years ago a year ago this stuff last more than 10 years it's high quality very tasty
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:17.680]  he said buy it now and it passes on the savings later see but but but that's not why he's here
[02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:24.240]  he's here to talk about his inside view on this and how he was the first person i heard talk about
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:28.160]  this more than i guess it was three years ago on our show steve shank thank you for joining us
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:34.240]  alex it's great to be with you again i appreciate the work you do i'm really sad to say you're
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:42.560]  right i'm i wish you were wrong steve so do i you know as i as i see this unfolding uh you
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:49.040]  know there there are times when you you look at at what you've seen coming and you know i'm out
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:54.960]  there in the mainstream we're we're trying to buy the the raw materials for the foods that we work
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:01.280]  with about a year ahead of time we're contracting them out a year ahead of time just for the simple
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:10.640]  reason that as the shortages continue to occur and the prices uh go up so we we have to do that
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:18.400]  in order to ensure that uh that people can can be fed but you know you and i talked and it was uh
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:24.800]  it was actually more than three years ago alex uh and and the one thing that we talked about was
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:33.440]  is the fact that at some point in time everyone on the planet would be thinking only of the issue
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:40.960]  of food all roads all thoughts all actions all circumstances all economies everything would
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:48.640]  be about food and i hate to say this my friend but we are there nations are telling people to plant
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:56.720]  gardens and it's too late to plant gardens it's uh absolutely absurd we've got we've got
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:01.680]  just it we've got a yeah that's really scary to hear the federal government and fema now
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:08.240]  saying plant gardens yeah when when they say it you know that they it's their last resort because
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:16.320]  at the same time they're trying to pass legislation uh which obviously well hopefully won't pass
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:21.600]  legislation to restrict people from planting gardens because if they happen to come up with
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:28.080]  E. coli or salmonella in in one shape or form uh then they'll be tracked back and condemned for it
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:36.080]  but uh it we have so so many dichotomies in our in our thinking but let me tell you the three
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:44.240]  the three issues we've got we've got food we've got energy and we've got money
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:52.960]  those three issues that we're facing right now are feeding a worldwide famine that's now
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:00.160]  here here we go with the numbers alex it's now in its sixth year now there are many
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:06.960]  who are studying the scriptures and are of a christian belief that uh are starting to see
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:11.440]  that this probably is that seven-year famine that was predicted in the book of revelation
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:15.840]  well i certainly hope that's not the case but regardless we know that it's crippling the third
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:20.320]  world nation's food riots everywhere we still have the dollar as the world reserve currency
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:26.880]  but as hujintow talks down the dollar as the dollars devalued unfortunately the historical facts
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:33.200]  say it's going to come here well the the fact is is that uh like i say i don't want to get into
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:38.160]  the seven-year famine thing but we're in the sixth year of one whatever the heck the the deal is but
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:42.560]  here are the three factors that that flow together and everything comes down to food
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:50.560]  food energy money just think food energy money now what's happening is as the energy
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:58.880]  uh is challenged in other words the oil which is right now worldwide based on the dollar
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:04.240]  and we're they're they're trying desperately to keep nations from changing from from the
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:12.640]  dollar to to buy oil with uh to other currencies but the fact is as we're printing the daylight
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:18.720]  out of this this funny money that the the fed keeps uh keeps pounding out into the economy we're
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:26.800]  now at uh uh two trillion as opposed to 800 billion uh in the economy it's just absolutely
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:34.080]  absurd or what's happening is that is causing fuel prices the oil to go up which is causing
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:41.280]  a problem with the the food we've got we've got riots all over the world with regard to food
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:49.360]  because of the the high costs of oil and uh not only the transport but the ability to grow the food
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:57.840]  so we've got just a an insane situation as they continue to print this counterfeit money
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:08.080]  uh by the by the trillions uh it it's completely destroying the economy of the world and it is
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:17.920]  it is centering all of it all of it's focus uh all of the results of of this this money printing
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:27.280]  and the energy problems on food food is now the one issue on the minds of every government leader
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:35.360]  worldwide and they've been paying people not to use the court as animal or or or human feed
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:41.360]  but to use it as ethanol and then i see headlines like walmart offers new makeup line for eight to
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:47.200]  twelve year olds for anti-aging they want to put statins in the drugs for children statins in the
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:53.120]  water uh statin drugs to stop cholesterol i have an article here out of and and and following
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:44:01.440]  where i'm going with this folks the statesman dot com travis county offers 48 500 to bicycle accident
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:06.160]  victim woman was seriously injured after hitting large crack in road near manor she's out on a
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:13.360]  country road they don't even really have shoulders she hits a crack susan and they settle for 48
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:20.720]  000 this is a knitting nation we've gone from the pioneers to people that think if they're out
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:26.560]  bike riding with a group of bike riders on a country road and hit a pothole and wreck and
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:33.040]  brakes her jaw that the taxpayers have got to pay for it we got 90 percent of people living urban
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:39.280]  in the great depression right at 90 89 percent if you want to be technical or rural and self-sufficient
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:45.200]  of the rural people uh which are 10 percent maybe half are fully self-sufficient if we have another
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:51.120]  full depression which we're clearly sliding into can you imagine the nightmare scenario
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:57.040]  with ninny entitled a lot of americans are hardworking the hardest with others are these
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:04.080]  entitled slobs who who literally want somebody to wipe their own hind end i'm sorry to talk
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:10.880]  like that steve but what is this army of self-propelled stomachs who expect everything on the silver
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:15.760]  platter what are they going to do if there's if they don't have money because it's been devalued
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:19.840]  to buy that food like weimar republic and we know we're going that direction what are they going to
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:24.080]  do i guess we just have to gather our firearms to protect ourselves and try to take over our
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:28.720]  counties and cities through the system so that we're prepared but the feds are taking them over
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:34.000]  for marshal law they're gearing up for what they've set up but i mean it just seems like a nightmare
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:43.280]  perfect storm scenario steve uh alex it absolutely is and if you if you look at you know you asked
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:48.960]  you asked to discuss the issue of of food and the high cost of it and the inflation and everything
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:54.240]  that's going on uh there are five there are five things that are happening and if you don't mind
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.280]  let me go through those yes quickly that will be very useful as people think about what's going on
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:05.440]  with food you know it's it's like the currents in the ocean you know you float along in a boat
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:12.080]  boat on top of the ocean but people don't realize that the currents underneath these great highways
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:17.440]  underneath the the surface of the water are connecting continents and and there's a whole
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.680]  completely different environment down there than they ever imagined what we've got is an
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:27.280]  undercurrent within our economies and it's all connected with food number one when the banks
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:33.360]  were bailed out they started refusing giving giving loans to farmers and to grocery stores to buy
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:39.760]  the produce to farmers to plant and and grow their their the food that we need the ethanol thing
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:44.880]  that you brought brought up you and i've talked about this ethanol fiasco many times and oddly
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:49.120]  enough the same environmentalists that were screaming for ethanol are now trying to sue
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:53.840]  to get ethanol stopped because it's bad for the environment come on give me a break but the fact
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:47:03.120]  is that corn in october of this last year had gone up by 45 percent now corn is uh is important
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:07.280]  as animal feed things like that but we've got a mandate that says that it has to be put into
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:13.440]  your fuel tank when we've got starving americans uh you put that all together the whole ethanol
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:18.960]  fiasco we could spend an hour on just by itself and how it's destroying the quantity of food that
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:25.840]  we can that we can grow in this country and the ability of people to afford food just because
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:33.840]  the the cost of the animal feed that is being replaced by fuel for our vehicles
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:40.080]  uh is going up so that a lot of the farmers that are raising our livestock and things are
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:46.080]  literally going out of business it goes on and on and on from there and then then the next thing
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:52.640]  oddly enough what the what's affecting the cost of food in many of these nations is war
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:48:00.960]  because some of these countries uh are shutting down the ability of of the transport of of oil
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:07.280]  because they disagree with what the united states is doing uh with regard to their their war
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:15.440]  activities and uh as a result of shutting down the fuel and the oil uh food can't be
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:21.520]  transported we've got riots in various countries and by the way uh dinner up steve uh while you're
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:25.840]  talking we're we're putting up mainstream news articles confirming this but just like they say
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:32.480]  unemployment is 9.7 when it's really over 22 even 60 minutes admits that california is up at 33
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:38.240]  they're lying and saying it's only going up two to three percent per year but anybody can go to
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.960]  the store and see even though they're adding more fillers and it's getting lower quality it's going
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:50.720]  up 10 20 percent or more and i wanted to talk about bloomberg robini says jump in food energy price
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:56.720]  can topple regimes another one grain soybeans rises food riots spurred demand for us exports
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:03.120]  uh here's another one risk of riots uh rising as governments cut food subsidies u n uh
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:08.400]  shuren says we're about to go to break we're going to do a couple more segments with you steve but i
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:12.880]  the reason i got you on here i know you're listing things that are all true briefly though and i

[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:46.880]  okay going back to steve but again how did you know because when i guess yeah 2007 2008 i was
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.400]  interviewing you and you were saying prices were already going up and then in the last year you've
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:57.040]  really been raising that alarm what are you seeing as a major you know a person that you know prepares
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:03.600]  and packages these raw foods well what i'm seeing is that we have to compete for food
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:11.840]  with commodities buyers people who have now been allowed to buy up these commodities you know the
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:17.840]  the basic grains and everything that americans need for their own food the bakery goods that
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:23.360]  we're talking about you know and also to to feed livestock and that type of thing
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:28.640]  we're having to compete it used to be that if you were going to buy commodities that you
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:35.600]  had to be able to take delivery on them or be in that industry but the bankers wanted to be able
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:41.440]  to these large funds and wanted to be able to take advantage of commodities buying and so now
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:47.200]  it's been opened up so they can buy our food and ship it overseas to the highest bidder and since
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:53.920]  we're in the sixth year of a of a famine what's happening is some of these other company countries
[02:55:53.920 --> 02:56:00.320]  that have huge numbers china for example had crop failures this last year they have huge
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:06.240]  amounts of american dollars that they can throw back at us and buy our food out from undress
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:13.360]  that is the fifth point that i was going to make with regard to what's forcing food prices up
[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:19.040]  up uh... they're condemning protectionism worldwide in other words for countries take
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:25.600]  care of their own and protect their own boundaries by refusing to export the foods america is the
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:30.320]  only country that i know of that is having food shortages that allows their own food to be exported
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:37.040]  and so but they're bragging about the fact that these exports are are solving the economic
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:42.720]  problems because they're eliminating the trade deficits by selling our food outside the country
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:48.960]  and getting back dollars which we don't need we need the food so that's what i'm seeing when
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:56.480]  when my buyers go out and uh... wrap up contracts for the raw materials that make these great
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:02.640]  soups that people are are ordering for the winter special uh... fact is that they're bidding against
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:10.320]  international uh... buyers commodities buyers and that's what's forcing the the the cost of raw
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:16.000]  materials up and you can't help but pass it on that's what's happening worldwide and the other
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:23.600]  thing is as long as they continue to increase the printing of this funny money alex what it's
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:31.280]  doing worldwide is it's devaluing the dollar and so we have to pay more for a big a bushel of oats
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.560]  than uh... than we had to before just because of the valuation of the dollar well steve just to
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:41.840]  throw this in just throw this in before this hour ends i hope for the best prepare for the worst
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:47.760]  and i'm really glad i've got a lot of storeable foods and you're very good deals you've got a

[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:52.240]  hide it anymore and there's just riots going on all over the world i just showed a whole bunch of
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:56.480]  articles about that but uh you know here's some of the headlines grain soybeans rise
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:01:04.000]  as food riots spurred demand for us exports robini says jump in food energy prices can topple
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:11.360]  regimes risk of riots rising as governments cut food subsidies un sharon says but they've done this

[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:18.880]  country when i say hundreds i mean hundreds it's 180 something countries and they do it in most
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:24.560]  third world countries on a decade basis to share the population to consolidate wealth they're taking
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:31.440]  the trillions in bailout money and pumping it into derivatives into commodities the very same
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:37.600]  suspects goldman sacks jp morgan bank of america they're all in there doing this and you add that
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:43.600]  to all the wars and famines it is a crazy perfect storm coming together and steve i really appreciate
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.520]  the line of work you're in and the high quality food that you do provide and i just hope that the
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:53.120]  good patriots out there do get prepared because i believe 110 percent what you're doing well thank
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:02:00.720]  you so much alexand and then the whole point is is that people need to uh we've got an urban
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:07.920]  population like what you said and uh they don't most people don't have the time or the ability to
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:13.280]  to throw gardens in and that wouldn't do it anyway so what we're trying to do is create
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:20.080]  the garden of the 21st century where they can take some of the bucks that they earn and throw it
[03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:26.800]  into a savings account of food and and if those folks three years ago when you and i started
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:33.360]  talking about this would have put in their year supply two year supply or whatever of food it would
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:39.440]  be so much less expensive right now and they'd already have it and as things go along and the
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:44.720]  prices get higher uh we're also going to have shortages where we're going to have to cut some
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:51.120]  items and replace them with other items and it's going to be just a bit crazy so the best thing
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:56.640]  people can do is get their own garden of the 21st century right now and get some food supplies in
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:02.560]  and prepare for their families that it's the one thing that they can do you can't control whether
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:07.840]  they're going to keep on printing money you can't control whether they're going to buy up the food
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:12.640]  and sell it to other countries you can't control the wars you can't control the ethanol horse bucky
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:18.480]  but the fact is that you can take control of the most important dependency that you have
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:25.840]  and get some food in and and get your family secured and prepared and and it's just it's all
