[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live. We're about to kick off the four hour transmission. It's hard to believe, depending on how you slice it, that we're only, what, 12 to 11 days? We count Fox, we're 12 days out, Counting Election Day, but if you look at just the calendar, it's 11 days until it kicks off.
[00:26.000 --> 00:35.000]  We have the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer joining us today with breaking news. We have Roger Stone, Larry Nichols and so much more. Huge breaking news today.
[00:35.000 --> 00:53.000]  But first, I'd like to kick the transmission off with an extremely powerful John Bowne report that cuts right to the heart of the matter.
[01:06.000 --> 01:17.000]  Many of the beneficiaries are still in a kind of limbo, unsure about whether their status would be renewed under President Trump and concerned that their family members could be deported.
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  The uncertainty was underscored earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a federal court injunction.
[01:24.000 --> 01:42.000]  I will do what I can as President. I'm hoping if we win back the Senate and we win the White House again, the Republicans are going to see the error of their ways and quit using immigrants to divide our country and quit taking the kind of mean-spirited actions that they do.
[01:42.000 --> 02:00.000]  You know, I was the first person to call out Donald Trump. I said, Basta, enough of this prejudice and paranoia and the kind of language that he used himself and quit using immigrants to divide our country.
[02:00.000 --> 02:12.000]  President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton couldn't even help the people they were attempting to illegally protect. The American Constitution and the 4-4 vote at the Supreme Court put a stop to that.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  Or maybe that knocking at your door is the Pentagon demanding their money back with interest.
[02:18.000 --> 02:32.000]  The LA Times reported short of troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago, the California National Guard enticed thousands of soldiers with bonuses of 15,000 or more to re-enlist and go to war.
[02:32.000 --> 02:49.000]  Now the Pentagon is demanding the money back. Nearly 10,000 soldiers, many of whom serve multiple combat tours, have been ordered to repay large enlistment bonuses and slapped with interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens if they refuse.
[02:49.000 --> 03:13.000]  After audits revealed, widespread overpayments by the California Guard at the height of the war's last decade. Roughly 30 million needs to be paid back. Meanwhile, the Pentagon's black budget, taxpayer money, fueling the unconstitutional COG shadow government, rose from 52.6 billion in 2013 to 59 billion in 2015.
[03:13.000 --> 03:31.000]  Or maybe that person knocking on your door is an Obamacare rep who stopped by to tell you that your premiums have gone up by at least 25%, warning you to be prepared when your medications have to be switched because the health insurance companies are jumping overboard from the Titanic.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  That is the Affordable Care Act.
[03:33.000 --> 03:44.000]  One fix that would drive premiums down. Look, once again, there's no sense which just has to be fixed. The law's working as designed.
[03:44.000 --> 03:57.000]  Well, whoever it is, you should probably exit your home from a back door and get out there and get in that early vote because at least that vote will put a stop to this bureaucratic liberal madness, right?
[03:57.000 --> 04:08.000]  As a voter, Lisa Howlett reported, Republican straight ticket was highlighted. However, the Clinton cane box was also highlighted. I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work.
[04:08.000 --> 04:27.000]  Chandy Clark also reported, I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton. Is it any wonder why Hillary Clinton is soaring in all of the fake polls while her VP candidate can only attract an audience of 30 to his rally?
[04:27.000 --> 04:40.000]  Trump and Pence bring in tens of thousands. The entire machine is rigged, not just the voting booths. The entire damnation that is our federal government top to bottom. It's the great American screw job.
[04:40.000 --> 04:52.000]  And just in time for election day, the scum that has risen to the top of the globalist owned and taxpayer funded bureaucracy want you to know just how much they really loathe you, America.
[04:52.000 --> 05:01.000]  It has become a giant circus. Distract us from the fact that our entire future is being stolen. We'll be back.
[05:22.000 --> 05:37.000]  Well, ISIS attacks on Iraqi border towns to relieve pressure from Mosul is a classic counter offensive move, but it's met with Iraqi militias desperate attempt to obtain information any way they can about the terrorist, including using children to do so.
[05:37.000 --> 05:47.000]  Disturbing video footage of the U.S. backed Iraqi soldiers and militia capturing children for information about ISIS. These videos show Mosul children caught in the crosshairs of this conflict.
[05:47.000 --> 05:57.000]  They're tortured by Iraqi troops being hit with hammers while interrogated. It begs the question our foreign policy is so run amok that we're paying troops to torture children for information about our enemies.
[05:57.000 --> 06:18.000]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:28.000 --> 06:36.000]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks. China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[06:42.000 --> 06:57.000]  Don't delay. Call 844-541-ALEXNOW and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins. Absolutely free. These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority. I personally own these survival packs and you should too.

[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.

[08:20.000 --> 08:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now only 11 days out and my head is swimming with the possibilities, with the probabilities, with the different developments.
[08:41.000 --> 08:53.000]  Wow, the Democrats and their operatives are promising to burn down the United States if somehow Trump gets in. Hillary plans to accelerate the deindustrialization and the Balkanization along racial lines.
[08:53.000 --> 09:03.000]  In that entire Divide and Conquer program, if she gets in, across the world, people are fighting back against world government and against the tyranny.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  It is an amazing time to be alive. We have so much here to go over. Wow. So much here to break down today.
[09:12.000 --> 09:23.000]  All over the United States, reports are flooding in and people are taking photos of it as well of where their votes are being flipped, but Texas is a major focal point.
[09:23.000 --> 09:34.000]  And driving into work today, I saw one polling place that had a line about 200 feet long out the door and I've tweeted that out at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[09:34.000 --> 09:47.000]  And that's what Texas election officials are seeing is record breaking turnout and quote, it's all for Trump, black, white, Hispanic, Christian, Jewish, even Muslim, you name it.
[09:47.000 --> 09:55.000]  Trump has come out after a dredge report linked to several of our articles detailing it in the last two days and is warning of vote flipping on machines.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  People are not happy. Big lines. What is going on?
[09:58.000 --> 10:07.000]  Also, an amazing video just showing hypocrisy video, rude CNN reporter asked Trump why he's taking time off and not campaigning hard.
[10:07.000 --> 10:18.000]  He's broken all records on average six stops a day, eight yesterday and is set to have seven today where he speaks up to an hour per visit.
[10:18.000 --> 10:28.000]  It's the stamina is just unprecedented. But in inversion world, Trump's a racist. He has no stamina.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  He wants to bankrupt the country. He's a criminal. He's a sexual predator. No charges of it. No claims until now.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  Meanwhile, we know who Bill Clinton is. They blame him being a Russian agent that it's all on Clinton. Just amazing. That clip is coming up.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  He just blows her away.
[10:45.000 --> 10:59.000]  Now, Podesta, it gets really good. The latest data dump from WikiLeaks from Podesta. He says, who told Hillary she could use a private email?
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  And that person needs to be drawn in quarter. That means you have your guts pulled out and ripped out.
[11:05.000 --> 11:12.000]  And then two horses are tied to your arms and legs and they rip you in four pieces.
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  Now, that's the guy that's been involved covering up for her. Serious felony every time you do that, not just with classified material.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  With classified, it gets even worse.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, if you snuck on a military base and stole a secret document out of it, you could get the death penalty.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  And the point is they are applying it that way to everybody else.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  Trump promises new deal for Black America.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  We've got the clip where he breaks that down. Meanwhile, guess what's in WikiLeaks?
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  They talk about how David Brock thinks Black people are stupid.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  Look at that creature.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  I mean, anybody that grows a fake Einstein haircut to make you think they're smart.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  By the way, liberals see an Einstein haircut, they bow down.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  Liberals are all about costumes and fastuning themselves with BS.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  Meanwhile, in the email, they talk about how David Brock thinks Black people are stupid.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Leftist controllers hate everybody, folks. I'd love to just say they're going for Black people.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  No, they want you all poor under their control. Period.
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.000]  It's in the emails. They want you dumb. They want you stupid. They want you under their control. They want you in debt.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  It's a form of slavery.
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  Meanwhile, New WikiLeaks Clinton campaign circulated Paul Ryan relative as possible Supreme Court pick.
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  Wonder why old blue eyes is like that. Ex-A department directive, a department employee, everyone since sensitive info to private emails under Secretary Clinton.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  They go on to say, honestly, she just did it, so we changed her policy and did the same thing. That's how it works.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary aid rushes to her side to help her climb a step.
[12:52.000 --> 13:00.000]  We have photos and video of her clearly falling down, beginning to fall down again and having to be helped because she starts to have one of the little minor seizures, little baby seizures.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  Meanwhile, get ready for civil unrest.
[13:03.000 --> 13:14.000]  I mentioned this survey finds that most Americans are concerned about election violence and a big index of tweets and Facebook posts by liberals shows that they're all basically almost all of them saying they're going to get very, very violent.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  Well, let me tell you something. I catch anybody trying to burn down a house with people in it or shooting at police or firefighters or anything.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  I'm going to defend this Republic. I'm fed up with terrorists. I'm fed up with scum.
[13:25.000 --> 13:34.000]  I'm fed up with people and firing globalists like Soros trying to destabilize this country, and I'm done.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  But don't worry, USA Today says Clinton builds lead in divided nation worried about election day violence.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  In every major poll where they only sample 9% more Democrats, that's the bottom.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  He's beating her by two, three, four, five points.
[13:48.000 --> 14:00.000]  But don't worry, USA Today, let's go look at the methodology. Oh, she's built a 10 point lead magically getting you ready for the fraud.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  We're going to be breaking that down in great detail.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  Again, I mentioned the election fraud that's going on. Don't let that discourage you.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  This is the animating contest of liberty.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  You have a right in your private polling area.
[14:12.000 --> 14:21.000]  The polling officials aren't supposed to be in there, and they're misinterpreting laws. We've looked at it, telling you you can't be videotaping with your own phone or photographing your vote.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  They're supposed to give you paper ballots if you want them. They're not doing it all over the country.
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  We confirmed right here in Austin. It's not happening at multiple polling places. We have it on video, and we're there to document it, not to interfere.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  We're outside talking to people in exit polls. That is what the media has always done.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  It's part of defending our Republic and the integrity of our election system.
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  But continuing, Donald Trump will win claims professor who correctly predicted every U.S. presidential election since he set up this computer program.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  And that's what the Google bots show. It's what Facebook bots show. It's what all the big corporate bots.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  And by the way, I'm hooked into it because I have a major website and I've got basically full access to Google.
[15:02.000 --> 15:11.000]  Most people that have sites just have smaller access to the analytics because I've been working with Google, working with the devil for at least 18, 19 years.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  We've got full access. We're going to do whole shows off the data we've got, but some of it's proprietary. We're not supposed to show it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  It's basically like an NSA interface, and it just shows Trump off the charts everywhere.
[15:22.000 --> 15:32.000]  I mean, Hillary has the excitement in the public of cleaning up dog crap out of your backyard when you're 12 years old and the dog's been out there for a week.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  You haven't been scooping like you're supposed to. And dad or mom says, get out there before I let you go to the movies and scoop up the dog crap.
[15:38.000 --> 15:47.000]  That was my job, bow the yard, pick up the dog crap. I hate to use a gross analogy, but the excitement she's got on the Internet is the level that you have picking up dog crap.
[15:47.000 --> 15:56.000]  I mean, that's it. On a scale of likeability, she's right there, not with dog crap, but with having to pick it up, having to deal with it.
[15:56.000 --> 16:04.000]  A rotten old evil demonic mafia crime boss representing the Chicago mafia, the Dixie mafia, the KKK.
[16:04.000 --> 16:14.000]  I mean, she is a despicable monster creature who, according to so many witnesses, her chef, you name it, constantly does not like black people serving her.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  And we'll say, just what is that inward doing? Get that inward in here now.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  And we'll write on notes like lawyers do. Get that inward out of here.
[16:25.000 --> 16:33.000]  I mean, I cannot imagine having a black person serving me or anybody else and calling them names, just the degeneracy. She doesn't give tips.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting. She steals furniture everywhere. She steals it out of the State Department, the White House, the cutlery.
[16:39.000 --> 16:52.000]  She's a egomaniac psychopath person who is not just a kleptomaniac, but a kleptocrat maniac.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down. The video is up on infowars.com. We posted it to Facebook.
[16:57.000 --> 17:07.000]  We shot it last night. Danny Williams is in contact with people like Biggs and others and was pointing out,
[17:07.000 --> 17:15.000]  hey, my YouTube has been taken down millions of millions of views just of his press conference, millions of views of the other videos that we've obviously shown here.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  And I called him up because the poor guy doesn't have any help.
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  The media is like, it's a big right wing conspiracy with a Trump behind it. No, he's all by himself.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  And I said, well, let's get Sean Speakerphone here. He was driving to pick up his kids after work.
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  And I said, let's get Sean Speakerphone and shot a report by early morning hours.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  They had reinstated it, but they said via community standards, he was racist.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  Nothing was racist set on the channel. Nothing was bad, but their community guidelines.
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  Oh, you've got a channel with 10 million views. We're not going to let you have that channel. We say you're a bad person.
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  So that's the new commissariat system. The world that Ellie reports YouTube back soft band on Clinton's black son.
[17:58.000 --> 18:06.000]  Now continuing leaked emails show Clinton staff are struggling to handle Bill's woman issues.
[18:06.000 --> 18:13.000]  We've got more on that coming up and what's in the WikiLeaks. We've got Trump coming out ahead and more polls.
[18:13.000 --> 18:22.000]  That's just some of what we're going to break down. Former Secret Service agent we frequently interviewed is getting ready to sue for defamation mainstream media.
[18:22.000 --> 18:31.000]  Also, there's a big stack of news here. Here's why Bruce Springsteen's blue-collared heroes have made Donald Trump their rock star and expanding on that.
[18:31.000 --> 18:39.000]  Some Jewish voters go against tide support Trump, a record number for a Republican. That's being reported out of CBS News.
[18:39.000 --> 18:48.000]  It's hats and t-shirts Trump fans rally in Jerusalem's old city. I thought he was the big evil anti-Semite.
[18:48.000 --> 18:56.000]  I'll tell you who the anti-Semites are, folks. It's the radical Islamists, the Communist Chinese or anti-Semitic, whatever weird reason.
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  But I'll tell you, really, it's George Soros and Marilyn Albright. George Soros helped round up Jews in mass.
[19:03.000 --> 19:12.000]  I'm going to skip this break and sell them out in Eastern Europe. He was like a bloodhound going and finding Jews and robbing them.
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  They would think they could pay him money to get out of the country. Of course, they never did. He'd take the money and then betray them. The Nazis loved him.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  Marilyn Albright's father did the same thing. And notice, these are the people that claim they represent Jews in America.
[19:24.000 --> 19:33.000]  They'd kill you for a dollar if they could. I don't care if you're black, white, Jewish. It doesn't matter. These are evil people.
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  And if they're going to have the Jerusalem Post calling me anti-Semitic, we're exposing people that round up Jews than I am.
[19:39.000 --> 19:48.000]  That's the big dirty secret that Dodgers Pachennic, who is a true Holocaust survivor, lost family members, barely got out of Europe in World War II.
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.000]  I'll have him on just for a whole hour on this because it really makes him mad at those type of folks.
[19:55.000 --> 20:07.000]  It's literally the neocons and so many of these other groups that made sure the Jews couldn't get out and got the money from the Jews.
[20:07.000 --> 20:14.000]  Planting they were going to let them get out and then stole it and didn't let them get out. And it's despicable and it's organized crime.
[20:14.000 --> 20:22.000]  And I decided to do some big investigative reports on that and just lay all that out because, you know, there are some real Nazis.
[20:22.000 --> 20:29.000]  We've got Hunting Hitler going on down in South America. How about Hunting Hitler's accomplices right here in America today?
[20:29.000 --> 20:38.000]  But they'll have the media grab some old jail guard who are not sure he's really a jail guard and might have been when they're 95 years old and can't talk and can't defend themselves and have some big show trial for them.
[20:38.000 --> 20:49.000]  They're a real Nazi, blow their head off. But when you've got real Nazis that go on 60 minutes and say, I don't apologize for helping round up Jews, then they get worshiped as the Jewish leaders.
[20:49.000 --> 21:03.000]  It's truly sick and I'm really glad to see Jews and everybody else that matter waking up worldwide to just corruption and evil. No matter what name or religion or race it comes under, corruption needs to be dealt with.
[21:03.000 --> 21:12.000]  We all need to come together of every religion, every race, every creed for basic freedom and to fight corruption because that's what we're dealing with.
[21:12.000 --> 21:22.000]  And Obamacare and all this stuff gets passed by big corrupt special entrants put into place so all these different mafias can battle over who gets to suck the most blood out of us.
[21:22.000 --> 21:30.000]  And there's no one mafia that's in control right now, but they're all trying to build a world government hoping they'll end up being in control of the technocracy.
[21:30.000 --> 21:36.000]  That's why all these different criminal groups support it because it's a megalomaniacal power trip, but I digress.
[21:36.000 --> 21:46.000]  Huge reports out showing Trump is polling 21 to 30% depending on the state, places like Michigan with black Americans.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  And again, the political correctness says African American, but then black folks are going to be called that.
[21:51.000 --> 21:59.000]  It's all about the media telling us what names we use for each other when we're all just human beings, but the point is black people, it appears to a great extent are breaking the trance.
[21:59.000 --> 22:07.000]  And if Trump could get in and actually deliver on major tax cuts, and I'm all for bigger tax cuts in these inner city areas than other places.
[22:07.000 --> 22:16.000]  That's true affirmative action for people that have been run over and left behind actually just let them have more money, let businesses have incentives to move into those areas,
[22:16.000 --> 22:26.000]  and then move out the leftist controllers that want to activate mobs, again, of organized criminals to burn down the cities to drive down the wages even more.
[22:26.000 --> 22:34.000]  So then they come in with a community reorganization package and fake gentrification run by the establishment and then move the folks out.
[22:34.000 --> 22:40.000]  This is how you're being set up. I want to expose how you're being set up. I want to expose how I'm being set up.
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  I don't like setups. I don't like economies based on fraud, economies based on renaissance.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Now there's so much more to get into.
[22:47.000 --> 22:56.000]  Obamacare Architect laughs about skyrocketing premiums. We're going to play all this today. Isn't that sickening?
[22:56.000 --> 23:04.000]  Gruber laughs about it and so does Ezekiel Emanuel. It's all very funny. They both laugh and say we're going to gouge you more money.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  Thank God you're so stupid. So more celebrating the criminal activity in your face.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  We're going to be getting to all of that as well today.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  But before I go any further, they want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to say the Russians are taking over the election.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  We've got to have international monitors from the EU and the UN run the elections.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  Trump is 10, 15, 20, 30 points behind, 100 points, 500 points, 1,000 points.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  And you're going to lie and say 30 points behind. Why not say 5,000 points?
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  But you're like, well, there's only 100 points in the election. I understand that.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  But they want us to lose hope and believe this so when they steal it, we buy it.
[23:40.000 --> 23:49.000]  Now they're panicking because there's such a landslide as early voting numbers come in from Florida to Texas, landslide for Donald Trump.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  Despite all the fraud, the illegals voting over and over again, the dead people voting from Colorado to Texas to Pennsylvania.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  He is ahead in all these states in the exit polls. They are scared. It's record voting. That's not good for Democrats.
[24:03.000 --> 24:13.000]  They do better when there's low voting. And ladies and gentlemen, now Mooc, Robbie Mooc, state of the race,
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  he's come out and said that Trump could win. So get out and vote. They're hitting the panic button. Here it is.
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  Donald Trump has been going around telling people not to listen to the polls and saying that he can still win this race.
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  Well, you know what? He's absolutely right. Hillary's got the wind at her back, but we can't become overconfident.
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  We call states like Florida, North Carolina and New Hampshire battlegrounds for a reason. They can go either way.
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  In fact, there was a poll that showed Donald winning Florida. We've seen polls tighten since the third debate, and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.
[24:46.000 --> 24:56.000]  Please visit iwillvote.com. Find out if you can vote early in your state. Or if you requested an absentee ballot, please fill it out and send it back as soon as possible.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  That's good.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  If you want to vote on election day.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  So that's getting him off the screen. I can't look at him.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  Now, why are they doing this? They wanted the New York Times, USA Today. They all announced a few weeks ago.
[25:07.000 --> 25:15.000]  She's going to win an early voting, and we're going to call it early with projections calling that a sampling for Hillary.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  The problem is the numbers from Pennsylvania, which is a true battleground.
[25:19.000 --> 25:29.000]  And Florida and other areas show him two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, even 10 points ahead in the samples that they're getting from early voting and its record level.
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.000]  So that's why they're panicking and saying, oh my gosh, get out there as fast as you can because they can't steal a landslide.
[25:36.000 --> 25:48.000]  It'll become too obvious if at midnight, you know, on November 8th, going into November 9th, they're having to do stuff like I did in Ohio, taking hundreds of precincts with thousands of voters.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  And each one and giving 100% to Barack Obama.
[25:52.000 --> 25:58.000]  I mean, they don't want to do ham-fisted stealing like they did with Mitt Romney because this landslide is even bigger.
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  Now, let's go ahead and go to the next one. Texas official, this is Fox, sees record breaking turnout and it's all for Trump. Here it is.
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  We are seeing that we have a record number of people registered to vote in Texas.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  We're having record turnouts the first day, the second day of early voting.
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  And it's not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary and it's not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary.
[26:20.000 --> 26:29.000]  But it is a new surge of Trump voters, many have never registered to vote, many have not voted in eight or 10 elections so they're not recorded in the polls.
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  I think this indicates it's going to be a crushing victory in Texas for the Trump campaign. It's very obvious to me.
[26:36.000 --> 26:44.000]  Do you think some of the polls are off or why do you think the numbers don't line up within your estimation what's really happening down there?
[26:44.000 --> 26:53.000]  Well, I know for a fact that the polls are off because they over-sample Democrats by about some of eight, some of them up to 16% are over-sampling Democrats.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  They're over-sampling women five to eight percent.
[26:56.000 --> 27:05.000]  So the Republican vote is under-reported plus there's no way to sample this extra 20 or 25% of new voters that are Trump voters.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  They're not Republicans, they're not Democrats, they're pragmatists, they're tired of the status quo and they won't change.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  And they say the Donald Trump campaign is he's the change agent.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  Yeah, that's Sid Miller who's dead on because we haven't really gotten into this.
[27:20.000 --> 27:28.000]  Normally the scamming is over-sampling women or calling the independence independence when they really know it's from a pool that's mainly Democrats.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  They can do that by demographic, by phone number, by there's a lot of ways to do it. It's all come out.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  Now, they're cheating over there too, but they're just doing it.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  Not eight points, Sid. I haven't seen one or eight. They're all nine and up.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  And he said, is high as 16?
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  We've shown it, the CNN polls, they do after the debates where they call 512 registered voters and they go, call us and you call the number.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  Are you registered voter? Okay, we'll call you back after the show.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  And then they call back and the people that answer and then they go, oh my, are you a Democrat? Yes, I am.
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.000]  Well, we're going to keep your vote then. 40-something to 20-something.
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.000]  I say this because it varies. 46% Democrat, 48% Democrat, 23% Republican, 27% Republican.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  I mean, that's how they would sample it.
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  Double the Democrats. We're not talking about 16% over-sampling. We're talking double.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  This is ridiculous.
[28:25.000 --> 28:33.000]  Of course, Hillary Clinton was winning by 68-70 points. Oh, just in. CNN poll, 30 minutes after the debate.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  We've got the first signer at poll. She's winning by 68 points. Well, she better be.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  She better be if you're double sampling. Hell, she should be at 80% of your double sampling.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  This is ridiculous. So again, that's why you see the votes being flipped.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  The report's coming in from Ohio. The report's coming in from Texas.
[28:55.000 --> 29:02.000]  You say, well, that's not a background state. Whatever they're doing it because they want her to probably try to win the popular too,
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  because it'll look bad if she doesn't. They're clearly doing this in Florida.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  They're clearly doing it in Pennsylvania. They're clearly doing it in Colorado. It's happening.
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.000]  By the way, we're starting an email address. We're going to check it every hour, 24 hours a day.
[29:15.000 --> 29:23.000]  Vote at infowars.com. V-O-T-E at infowars.com. Screenshots, photos, videos, YouTube's.
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.000]  You've shot yourself a fraud happening. Whatever. You send us that. We'll be checking it constantly.
[29:28.000 --> 29:34.000]  I want all the reporters to be checking it every hour with reports you've got, what you've seen, what's unfolded.
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  I saw a polling place this morning. Saw a line 200 feet long out the door.
[29:38.000 --> 29:45.000]  Hold over. Boom. Got a shot out the window of the car. Tweeted it out. It's just intel, intel, intel, intel, intel.
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.000]  All of it's important. Send us your intel. Vote at infowars.com. We've got big stuff coming up.
[29:51.000 --> 30:08.000]  For the last several weeks, Donald Trump has been warning us that the election could be rigged against him.
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  First of all, it's rigged. And I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.
[30:12.000 --> 30:23.000]  Because I think my side was rigged if I didn't win by massive landslides. I mean, think of what we won in New York and Indiana, California, 78%.
[30:23.000 --> 30:32.000]  And now he has indicated on Twitter that he is aware of reports of electronic voting machines that are flipping votes from Trump to Hillary.
[30:32.000 --> 30:44.000]  Meanwhile, Infowars has highlighted the fact that there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to a vote for Hillary Clinton.
[30:44.000 --> 30:56.000]  And now we have learned that billionaire globalist George Soros is controlling the voting machines in 16 states, including major swing states like Arizona and Florida.

[33:17.000 --> 33:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are only 11 days out and massive evidence of frauds coming in. All over the country flipping votes.
[33:36.000 --> 33:46.000]  Donald Trump is tweeting very concerned. Election officials have had to pull out some of the electronic machines saying, yeah, they're flipping and then turning them back on, going to paper ballots.
[33:46.000 --> 33:54.000]  We've got Democrats on video with Project Veritas from the director of New York's elections right down the people that are actually doing it.
[33:54.000 --> 34:05.000]  Admitting organized crime fraud on an industrial scale to steal the election. We have them admittedly being caught in WikiLeaks, paying companies to oversample for Hillary.
[34:05.000 --> 34:15.000]  In some cases, 40 plus percent. The average is about 16%. To show her ahead, this is crazy. And now we have them panicking in clips we just played.
[34:15.000 --> 34:25.000]  Mooc and others, the head of the campaign, saying that, uh-oh, you better go vote because it looks like Donald Trump really could win. So they're getting very, very scared right now.
[34:25.000 --> 34:36.000]  Then we have her crowd sizes, a couple hundred people, and we have 30 people for Kane, her almost falling down again today. That video is up on infowars.com.
[34:36.000 --> 34:47.000]  It is crazy to see all this happening. Meanwhile, Donald Trump will win, says the political scientist who's always been right in every major election since he launched his algorithm.
[34:47.000 --> 35:00.000]  That's the London Independent. So we're tracking all of this. We have more of the Obamacare Architects, Ezekiel Emanuel, and also Mr. Gruber, Jonathan Gruber, on TV, laughing at the public to their face this time.
[35:00.000 --> 35:12.000]  Saying we're going to raise premiums even more to punish you and penalties that do not exist. So we have reached an insane asylum level where these people are literally like the Joker laughing at us.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  We're going to go to our special guest. I mean, I knew that Roger Stone was coming on, but I'm really excited to see that right next to him is James O'Keefe of Project Veritas.
[35:20.000 --> 35:28.000]  So we'll be talking to them with major breaking news in just one moment. Before I go any further, this broadcast is viewer and listeners supported.
[35:28.000 --> 35:37.000]  We're obviously just like these two guys. It's great to have us all together. The tip of the spear, we need your support now more than ever because we need to have our investigative reporters in the field.
[35:37.000 --> 35:52.000]  It's very expensive to run this operation. That's why I bring you the very best products that I personally use, whether they're non-GMO, heirloom seeds, or high quality water filtration systems, or high quality nutraceuticals from things like oil of oregano right through to just things you need,
[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  like selenium, one of the key trace elements at infowarslife.com. And we've got our great new tropic that we're going to end the 25% sale this weekend.
[36:01.000 --> 36:11.000]  Brainforce available at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com, then the biggest sale ever. We've done this before, but never topped it. This is the biggest sale we've ever do.
[36:11.000 --> 36:22.000]  30 to 40% off all the super high quality, swarable foods at infowarsstore.com. You can also call toll 3888-2533139.
[36:22.000 --> 36:35.000]  We have one other big special we're announcing today. The Pro Pure G2 King, that's their biggest, gravity water filter cuts all the garbage out. Now 30% off at infowarsstore.com.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  So a lot of specials running right now, and that all goes to support the transmission. We have sold out of the Hillary for Prison shirts that we started. I thought we had enough to go through the election. It's over.
[36:44.000 --> 36:53.000]  Collector's item, it's gone. The Bill Clinton rape shirt, that's still available. Roger Stone designed that. The rape whistles available. The prices we're selling and we're not making much money, but it doesn't matter.
[36:53.000 --> 37:06.000]  It's about getting the word out. We have Trump is my president limited edition to wear out in public. It's red. So people understand that we're the majority across the board of every race, color and creed waking up with populism.
[37:06.000 --> 37:21.000]  So a very exciting time to be alive. Now, breaking news right now with Roger Stone, who as we get closer to the end here, we're going to have him on every day if he can do it.
[37:21.000 --> 37:37.000]  Along with James O'Keeffe, the heads up project Veritas that has just absolutely, I think would win the most valuable player award in this overall 2016 election exposing the organized crime and I mean, I hate to nominate him for that because I want that and I'm sure
[37:37.000 --> 37:51.000]  Drudge wants that. I guess Drudge is coming to coach and so is Roger Stone. But I tell you, most valuable player, the guy that scored most of the touchdowns in the game that have been so devastating along with WikiLeaks. It's hard to say who folks, but I got to tell you, James O'Keeffe doesn't want the credit.
[37:51.000 --> 37:58.000]  He wants to beat these people, but here he is joining us via Skype with Mr. Stone. So a great surprise to have you there with Mr. Stone.
[37:58.000 --> 38:09.000]  Hey, thanks, Alex. Roger's here because we're going to be releasing a little video tomorrow where Roger makes a little cameo in it. So he's in my office and he said you were doing the Skype and it's great to be here.
[38:09.000 --> 38:24.000]  Well, I know you're a busy man. So let's let you first tell us the latest, give us some hints on what's going to be breaking your take on what I just broke down. And then, of course, Roger, who's setting up the national operations grassroots to stop the steal can fill us in.
[38:24.000 --> 38:40.000]  Well, it's very humbling for you to say that. And we're very busy. I mean, we released four installments of the series this week. We found out that Hillary was personally involved, personally involved in addressing people up with these protests to elicit a violent reaction.
[38:40.000 --> 38:50.000]  And the White House has been asked about it and Trump brought up in the debates last week, as you saw, we released part four where they took money from a foreign bank account and then returned it.
[38:50.000 --> 39:07.000]  So two people have been fired. You know, there may be more fired. We're releasing another video tomorrow and as it relates to voter fraud, the New York City Commissioner of Elections after our video last week was issued a subpoena because he said that they bust people around and him and de Blasio right now were with each other.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  So he was issued a subpoena and we're going to see what happens there.
[39:11.000 --> 39:23.000]  Again, not shooting your horn, just breaking down the chain of events. You guys have been mirroring, I guess without even knowing the Intel WikiLeaks has, but then showing it in the real world, confirming it and triplicate.
[39:23.000 --> 39:35.000]  And then you've also, again, have Hillary confirmed in the videos that she's giving the direct orders and what Hillary wants she gets. And then we have the new WikiLeaks with Podesta saying, you know, Hillary's crazy, what the hell is she doing?
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  And we have the other email saying we're covering it up. We've got to, you know, clean all this up. I mean, we have them now.
[39:41.000 --> 39:52.000]  Yeah, I think this is her Achilles heel. The fact that I thought the voter fraud is important. The inducement of violence at the protests, that's a smoking gun and she hasn't even denied it.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  I mean, she won't even address it when she was asked on the airplane late last week about it. They said, well, what do you have to say for yourself?
[39:59.000 --> 40:09.000]  She literally ran away and said, time to get food. So it's, I think it's her Achilles heel that she was personally involved. Bob Cramer, the man in the videos, you know, he's no low level guy.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  He's the beating heart of the institutional left in the Democratic Party. And he has been, and that heart has been ripped out of the body right now.
[40:15.000 --> 40:27.000]  And he went to the White House 340 times, met with the president 47 times. The mainstream media is not doing it, but someone has to continue asking her over and over again.
[40:27.000 --> 40:38.000]  What do you have to say for yourself for addressing people up like Donald Duck? It's a stupid, silly thing that she did, but she did it. And that's why people were beaten and bloodied is because of what she did.
[40:38.000 --> 40:46.000]  And we know from the emails sending people in to basically elicit attacks on women or having security drag out women that were causing disturbances.
[40:46.000 --> 41:01.000]  I mean, this is premeditated. This is absolutely criminal. And when you say that their hearts been torn out, we're not just saying that. I mean, politically, even if she crawls over the finish line and steals the election, which is getting scarcer and scarcer, it looks like as a chance.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  She's going to end up getting indicted. I mean, she makes Nixon look like a saint.
[41:07.000 --> 41:19.000]  That's the point I was just about to make, which is, look, no one ever proved that Nixon knew about the break in at the Watergate, and he was removed essentially for dirty tricks and illegalities pertaining to the 1972 election.
[41:19.000 --> 41:30.000]  What Hillary is, as James says, you've got the smoking gun. She has been involved. Now, in the old days, Woodward and Bernstein would be on her like a cheap suit.
[41:30.000 --> 41:43.000]  Where's the Washington Post? Where's the New York Times? The very people who drove Nixon from office in investigative reporting because of irregularities and dirty tricks in the 72 election, I would remind you.
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  They're silent today. There's like, oh, nothing to see there. Keep moving.
[41:49.000 --> 42:01.000]  We're 11 days out. There's massive evidence of election fraud. O'Keeffe, again, and his crew blew it wide open. The premeditated like something out of a Batman movie where they're rubbing their hands together, giggling about how no one can stop them.
[42:01.000 --> 42:08.000]  I mean, literally, for listeners who just tuned in, go to Project Veritas and watch the videos for yourself.
[42:08.000 --> 42:18.000]  Now even more is coming out. What do you expect them to do? I mean, do they have enough rava to actually try to steal it now that we have them on video admitting they're stealing it?
[42:18.000 --> 42:32.000]  I think, Alex, you know, Roger's point, I think that you have a situation where Trump is a proxy vote against the entire system, the entire establishment, even in the unlikely case that Hillary pulls this one through.
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  No one has confidence in how the whole system is rigged. The whole game is rigged.
[42:37.000 --> 42:49.000]  And what I said to you last time is that this story is not just about the corruption and the fraud and the illegality and that she was personally involved in protests, which all of her people said that she was, and that they were talking about busting people across
[42:49.000 --> 43:05.000]  the state lines and proudly saying it. It's a story about how the citizens of this country are so fed up and so angry with the media that we're the barbarians at the gates. Millions of people on social media putting pressure on the mainstream to cover this story.
[43:05.000 --> 43:17.000]  This is a turning point in our country's history right now because you have millions of people with nowhere to go except for your show and they view Roger as a leader, they view Project Veritas as a leader.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  It's a turning point for our country. We don't need the Washington Post anymore.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  Absolutely. And we're not just saying this for listeners because this is so historic.
[43:25.000 --> 43:37.000]  Undoubtedly, they even admit this. They're hitting the panic button in a whole bunch of big publications, as you know, admitting they're dead, admitting everyone hates them, admitting they're a shadow of a shadow of a shadow, and admitting that they have destroyed all their credibility,
[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  and that if they're crazy enough to just put Hillary in now, that will be the absolute coup de gras tombstone.
[43:43.000 --> 43:50.000]  I mean, we have fought her, the people have fought her, and now the system is completely chewed up and bleeding to death.
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  That's right. No one has faith in the system anymore.
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  Look, we have an early warning on what's about to happen in these elections.
[43:57.000 --> 44:07.000]  I mean, since I announced the Stop the Steel Exit Poll program, by the way, the three networks conduct exit polls on a regular basis. They contract out to do it.
[44:07.000 --> 44:26.000]  No one accuses them of intimidating voters. But since we announced the Stop the Steel Exit Poll program and 7,000 selected precincts across the country in key states, the attack on us from the left and their running dog lackeys has been outrageous.
[44:26.000 --> 44:34.000]  Racists, thugs, a motley crew of stumblebums that are going to be threatening people at the polls.
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  Oh, they're going to be wearing badges, by the way, no badges. No, we're going to run a neutral exit poll.
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.000]  It's not like a guy comes up to you with a Trump hat and a Trump t-shirt and Trump buttons and says, hi, I'm taking an exit poll.
[44:47.000 --> 44:58.000]  This is going to be done on a scientific basis, and it has panicked the establishment because they know we can compare the exit polls with the actual results
[44:58.000 --> 45:04.000]  and have evidence, conceivably, that you could take into a federal court to overturn this election.
[45:04.000 --> 45:19.000]  The great danger is the rigging of the machines. It's not just voter fraud. James, I think, has uncovered a torrent of dirty tricks, and he's on the edges of their attempts to hijack this election.
[45:19.000 --> 45:28.000]  So you can see what's coming through what's happening now in Texas and other places. You're starting to see the machine twist those.
[45:28.000 --> 45:34.000]  And that's my question. We're awake. The world's awake. The frauds all come out. Veritas has them admitting they're trying to steal it.
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.000]  We have the WikiLeaks admitting they're trying to steal it. They're rigging polls. They're panicking.
[45:39.000 --> 45:47.000]  So now that they're with the lights on, trying to creep into the house and steal the jewels, are they still going to do it with a sports stadium of people watching them?
[45:47.000 --> 45:55.000]  I'll tell you that the attorney general of Delaware just put out a memorandum where they said, you're not allowed to film or expose things at the polls.
[45:55.000 --> 46:03.000]  So I just got that on my desk this morning. They're trying to stop people like Veritas from going and filming and uncovering it.
[46:03.000 --> 46:09.000]  They're trying to make it illegal. They're going to criminalize journalism. They're going to try to shut everyone.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  I always say, well, Hillary, it's elected. James, they're going to put you in jail. And I hope that I don't think the American people will stand for that.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  I don't think your audience would stand for it. I've been told, Roger's been told, they get back in. They're coming after all of us.
[46:19.000 --> 46:27.000]  Yes, they're going to come after us. Well, not unless your audience puts pressure like Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, kicked me off two weeks ago.
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  And 40,000 people sent tweets to Jack Dorsey and then they reinstated us.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  Since you mentioned that, they kicked with 10 million views on that channel, another 20 or so on his, three on ours.
[46:38.000 --> 46:45.000]  We're talking 30 plus million views. They kicked Danny Williams off YouTube yesterday saying his videos were racist.
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.000]  There was nothing racist in them. This is the new community guidelines. Now, because of pressure, they put them back today.
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  WorldNet Daily's reporting. What do you make of that?
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  Exactly. Because of pressure, they put them back today.
[46:55.000 --> 47:02.000]  So I think we're fine as long as your audience and Roger's audience and my audience, as long as you put pressure on the machine.
[47:02.000 --> 47:13.000]  But the whole of the fact that the United States Attorney General is making it illegal for me to film the fraud, now we're entering a brave new world.
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.000]  Sure. And how does he circumvent the laws that are already there that you can be outside?
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  Because we have crews outside and people are running up to us saying you're a criminal as well.
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  But they're letting people with Hillary stickers on them go in and actually solicit votes.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  In fact, here's a clip that came out on Twitter this morning.
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  It was sent to us by the activist. Vote at infowars.com folks. Send all your links there. Vote at infowars.com to that email.
[47:33.000 --> 47:42.000]  Here's a lady going up to a Clinton operative with a Clinton badge armband, basically, who's recruiting people to vote at the polling station.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Now, that is illegal. Here it is.
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.000]  Stickers, if you're registering people to vote in the state of Nevada.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  Can you show me the law that says that?
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  Yeah, I sure will. What's your name?
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  Really? You better hide your face because I'm going to call the news on this one.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  We're going to put you on info wars.
[48:00.000 --> 48:07.000]  So you're another one. You're about the fifth one in the state of Nevada wearing Hillary stickers.
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  You know you can't be wearing Hillary stickers if you're registering people to vote.
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  You can't. No, it's a free place. So what's your name?
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  So what's your name?
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  It goes on and on. It shows the polling place right behind her.
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  Now, again, the law varies, but I think she's on the edge of it.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  The point is, this is the brazen behavior.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  And notice, the lady that sent us this said, tweeted it at O'Keeffe, Roger Stone, and info wars.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  People understand those are the places to report this type of stuff. We will get it out.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  So thank you, Losers, for taking action. Roger, James O'Keeffe?
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.000]  Yeah, let me address this. The 50 states have different laws pertaining to the conduct inside and around a polling place.
[48:49.000 --> 48:56.000]  And most states allow electioneering a certain number of feet away, several hundred thousand, usually.
[48:56.000 --> 49:03.000]  Therefore, asking people outside a polling place when they leave, how they voted in a scientific poll.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  Well, as I said, the networks do it. It's very common.
[49:07.000 --> 49:17.000]  Videoing those conversations outside the polling place, which is at this point not part of our plan, but would be entirely legal.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  As far as electioneering, again, as voters approach the poll, outside a certain number of feet, generally speaking.
[49:24.000 --> 49:33.000]  But officials inside wearing Clinton paraphernalia, people going in and out wearing Clinton paraphernalia.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  This is clearly illegal.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  According to the Twitter person, a reporter, she was going in and out.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  The point is, she's talking to people as they're going in and going out. So am I wrong?
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  You shouldn't be talking to them as they go in, especially if you're festooned with Hillary badges.
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  Unless you're a certain number of feet. So if she saw people in the parking lot, let's take Connecticut, the state I know.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  I think it's 230 feet from the polling place, you're allowed to electioneer.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  Hold a sign, cheer, hand out, flyers, anything you want.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  But a certain number of feet away from the poll, you can't follow the voters in.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  So she can't be at the door to the grocery store.
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  Correct, exactly. But she can be on the outer edges of the parking lot of the grocery store.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  Okay, this is just too historic. What's happening? I'm skipping this break too.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  This is so great to have you two guys here with us.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  I know you've got to go in about 10 minutes, both of you.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  James O'Keefe, what happens if they try to steal it?
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  What does your gut tell you? Other key points, you've got the floor.
[50:26.000 --> 50:35.000]  Well, I think the FEC, you know, the video that came out Monday, where it showed the Hillary campaign illegally coordinating with these nonprofit organizations,
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  they're spending money to help the campaign as an FEC violation.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  So there have been a couple of complaints filed. Your point was, well, what do you do when they break the law?
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  And that's what is a cliche at this point.
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  But we were living in sort of a banana republic where laws were not a nation of political laws,
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  we're a nation of political will, where no one is equal under the law.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  And she breaks the law over and over and over again.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  So I catch it on video where she's personally involved.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Bob Cramer said she's involved.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  They're bragging about how they coordinate.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  Fox News, Brad Woodow said, of course I coordinate with Hillary Clinton.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  He's bragging about the fact that he's doing illegal campaign coordination.
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  We issued an FEC complaint. We sent out an email campaign to 100,000 people, put pressure on the FEC.
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  What more can we do? The law enforcement agencies of our country are not going to enforce the laws.
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  I mean, I'm a journalist. I can report facts. I can put it on video tape.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  But it's very concerning.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  And to quote him, he says, there's nothing the government will do outwear above the law.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  He literally does the famous criminal celebration.
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.000]  But wasn't the whole lesson of Watergate, no person is above the law?
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  Isn't that what the liberal said over and over again when they removed Nixon?
[51:44.000 --> 51:51.000]  Now it's very clear that certain people, call it elite deviants, if you will, certain people get a pass.
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  Let me ask you both, what happens if they steal it in front of God and country?
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  James and then Roger.
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  I think what happens is the people will revolt. People will, people are, I saw it.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  I saw it over the last two weeks. I've never seen anything like this.
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  I agree.
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.000]  We are witnessing a populist revolt on social media.
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  People don't give a crap what the New York Times says. They don't believe them anymore.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  So if you have 50 or 100 million people in this country who have no one to speak for them,
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  what's going to happen to those people?
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  I think that's a powerful movement of people that are going to literally revolt.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  It's not going to be with pitchforks. I think it's going to be on social.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  I think it's going to be on media. I think they're going to literally revolt.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  And I think we're already seeing that mainstream media admits.
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  Everybody hates us. We're losing subscriptions. We're losing sponsors.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  They've gone from being absolutely not trusted to being absolutely hated.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  Roger, what happens next?
[52:44.000 --> 52:52.000]  The important thing, Alex, is we just can't have a supposition based on circumstantial evidence that this was stolen.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  You need hard evidence that would be admissible in court.
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.000]  And that is why we at StopTheSteel.org are trying to create a legal record.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  That's why we're doing these exit polls so they can then be compared.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  Within an hour of the polls closing, we hope to have an entire analysis,
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  and we will be able to hand Donald Trump or the Republican National Committee,
[53:13.000 --> 53:20.000]  if they're really for Donald Trump, a package that shows that this election was heisted if it indeed is heisted.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  Again, don't get distracted by voter fraud. It's significant, but that's not the ballgame.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  Don't agree. The big issue is going to be the vote flipping by the machines, which we've confirmed in Texas.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  I have family that's scared to come on. It happened to them, okay?
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  I tried to go vote this morning. The lines were too long. That's why I have the photo.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  I just was like, good God, there's a 200-foot line.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  And inside the building was a, you know, a snaking 60-foot line and like 100 people waiting.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  So used to if I went and voted, there might have been five people there in early voting.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  That's why I like to vote early.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  So what does that signify?
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.000]  Giant lines everywhere, almost everyone voting for Trump according to election officials,
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  but people are telling him exit polls, and we're being told Texas is close.
[53:59.000 --> 54:04.000]  This is a part and parcel of the two-step.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  Step one, create a false level of anticipation, of expectations.
[54:11.000 --> 54:16.000]  Step two, rig the machines to meet those expectations. Nobody will be the wiser.
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  It's the perfect crime. That's why it has to be detected through exit polls.
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.000]  If they would allow us to inspect the software for the machines in advance,
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  we could determine that this is not happening, but they will not allow that.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  Secondarily, these machines can be rigged at the central server.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  They can be rigged by somebody inside the local board of elections,
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.000]  or they can be rigged by a person carrying a $15 device that he bought at Best Buy.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  And that's been proven by HBO. I want to get final comments from both of you,
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  because I know you've got to go and, of course, come out the websites.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  Talk about Project Veritas's huge queue last week. Here's Scott Fovle,
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  the number two minion of the top Democratic operative, Kramer,
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  saying, hey, we're above the law. It doesn't matter. We're not worried about the press.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  Here's that clip.
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.000]  The question is whether, when you get caught by a reporter,
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  does that matter, because there's attorney investigation or not,
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  in this case, in this state, where the answer is no,
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  because they don't have any power to do anything right?
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  So this is sort of maybe not stuff.
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.000]  So James O'Keefe, we don't have any power to do anything about it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  I've been asking the questions here. Other points you'd like to add, James O'Keefe,
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  of Project Veritas.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  Well, I think the point is, in that clip, Scott Fovle specifically said,
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  the Republicans are too weak in the knees to actually enforce the laws
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  instead of Wisconsin. Now, I will tell you that in the last couple days,
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  sources have told me we've been contacted by law enforcement agencies,
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  and they are planning on pressing charges.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  Now, whether they go through with it, this is what their plan is at this point.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Sure, they want to go forward, and then Loretta Lynch stops it.
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  Right, but the main, this is really shocking what he said.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  He said, I could FUCK my mother and get away with it in places like Michigan
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  and Wisconsin, because the Republicans are too weak in the knees
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  to actually do anything about it.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  That's the main story.
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  They could do anything and get away with it.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  And that's because they're really Democrats.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  The WikiLeaks prove that Rubio and Ryan are actual Democratic operatives.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  Yes, yes, it's worse than we think.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  They're unwilling to enforce the laws, and you've got a man very embarrassing to the Republicans.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  In closing, I want to say this right now, if you guys need five more,
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  I've got guests coming up, so I understand.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  But let's all spend some time talking about Project Veritas,
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  Cold Truth, and InfoWars.com. We are the tip of the spear.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  We're not bragging. In fact, it's not that fun to be under all these attacks.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  We need support. Buy my books, buy my videos, buy the high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  We have great prizes on high-quality, swarble food right now.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  Great. Trump is my president. Limited edition shards.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  25% off of some of our supplements. InfoWarsLive.com. I need your support.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  You guys, call for support.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  I mean, we are like the battle acts going up against the enemy.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  We need folks' support. They are supporting us.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  I want to thank the viewers and listeners, but Roger and then Veritas,
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.000]  you guys spend 30, 40 seconds apiece calling for support.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  Well, let me start here. I urge people to give to James' program.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  It is really, it is the tip of the spear.
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.000]  And he has been able to learn and document things that have been vital to this overall effort.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  You'll recall, Alex, that many months ago I said here on InfoWars
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  that the demonstrations at the Trump rallies that burst into violence
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  was all being instigated by Soros paid operatives,
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  wearing Bernie t-shirts as a false flag.
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  We now know that all of that is accurate thanks to the work of Veritas.
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.000]  So I strongly urge your listeners to pony up.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  No better bang for the buck than supporting Project Veritas.
[57:58.000 --> 58:01.000]  Absolutely. And no better bang for the buck than supporting Roger Stone.
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.000]  StoneCultured.com or InfoWars.com. It's a total war. Commit now, James.
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.000]  Thank you. Yeah, exactly what I mean. Roger is doing good work.
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.000]  He's getting the message out.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  We were talking before he came on the program about how I'm in cabs all around the country.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  My journalism and the cabs are talking about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  So stay tuned. We got more coming out, projectveritasaction.com.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  All right, gentlemen, I want to thank you both.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  Roger was talking in tomorrow. You can do it because so much is moving so fast.
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  Thank you so much, gentlemen.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  Thank you.
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.000]  Tomorrow, Alex, a special report on Pennsylvania.
[58:33.000 --> 58:38.000]  Pennsylvania now moves into the toss-up category with Donald Trump on the move.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  All right, very exciting. Now we're too straight ahead.
[58:40.000 --> 59:03.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[59:10.000 --> 59:17.000]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others.
[59:21.000 --> 59:27.000]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[59:35.000 --> 59:42.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[59:50.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Hard to believe Weldon Henson's been in this operation more than 10 years since he got out of the Air Force.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Now he's married, got kids, the whole nine yards.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  A good friend of mine, great country music singer as well.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  You can check out his website, but I saw him out here in the hallway.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  He went and voted too. He was just talking about how crazy.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Everybody talked to him. It was for Trump. Black, white, Hispanic, you name it.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  And literally 30 seconds ago, I said, drag him in here, set the chair up.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Let's get Weldon Henson, who's our shipping and store manager, doing a great job here getting them the InfoWars of the next level.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Weldon, I haven't heard what you wanted to tell me you were so excited about.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  I just said, say it on air. That's kind of my rule with the crew.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Say it on air because, you know, we're not just in a bubble here. We're talking to the whole world.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  You were super excited. What's going on?
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  No teleprompters here. No, I went out to vote this morning.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Obviously the lines were out the door.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  I saw 200-plus foot ones. I couldn't vote.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  What took me an hour? Took me an hour in line, but, you know, I'm sitting there talking to people.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  You know, I don't see how Hillary Clinton can win.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  That's what I was trying to tell you before he drugged me in here, but it was pretty amazing.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Everybody was excited. People were concerned.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  You could tell there was a genuine concern. People were, they were serious.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  I mean, they were excited, but they were serious.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  I just, I don't see how Hillary Clinton can win, I guess, but again.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  And if they cheat and put it around, they get even more serious. We can't lose.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  We can't, we can't lose for winning.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  I mean, it's true. You engage, you win when you're on the right side.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  It's like the founder of the Texas Rangers famously said, he said,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  a man in the wrong can't stand against a man who's in the right who keeps on coming.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  So I think we're going to keep on coming.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Well, absolutely. I mean, I think you're seeing the silent majority is finally starting to speak up.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  They're starting to come out and say, you know, this is our country for everybody.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Can you believe the WikiLeaks just prove everything?
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  They're even worse criminals than I thought.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  It's laughing and talking bad about black people. How they're dumb. What the hell?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  I stand in line. I brought some of this stuff up with, with some people that were a couple of folks back and,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  and people were actually engaging in conversation and talking about it.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  And they knew about this stuff. I mean, I vote every time, you know, the election comes up and you,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  usually, you can't talk about this kind of stuff in line, waiting to vote.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  I mean, people, they don't want to talk about it.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  People are coming out of their shell.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  Yes, absolutely. I think so.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  What do you make of how the Veritas info dovetails with all the WikiLeaks? It's crazy.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I mean, it's, it's astounding.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  We've got video, everything's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  We don't just have the emails. They admit it real. We have the video of these people literally going,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  we're going to rip them off. And then, and then Gruber and Emanue will go on TV and go,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  I'm going to rip you off. I'm going to hurt you.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  I mean, they can't, what the hell are these people?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  If they, if they steal this election, which obviously they're trying.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I mean, you're going to see some amazing things happen.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  The general.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Well, that's my concern. Look at camera four right there.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Well, what do you think your guts going to happen if they steal this thing?
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  I really don't know. I think there's going to be a backlash there. That's for sure.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Everybody's going to stop shopping at all these big corporate stores.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  We're all going to do research. We're all going to just weaponize in the info war.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Everybody's going to get more aggressive and we're going to take everything over.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  The communists and socialists and dirtbags infiltrated like rats forever.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  You're now about to see patriots infiltrate and then it's all over.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  And that's, that's not the folks you want to want to upset and get them engaged.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  I mean, and that's probably what's going to happen.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Look how they tried to take the bonuses that were promised under law from the veterans.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  They're signing bonuses. What the hell? I mean, they, I don't know what I would do
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  if they came back and said, I had to pay, pay my, my bonus backup for enlisting.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  That would upset.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  You signed a contract.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  It was, it's a contract.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  They never pay enough to even live.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  So they all go give you 10, 20 grand, whatever to sign up for another five years.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  That's not that much money, five grand a year or something.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Then you steal it later.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Did you hear they even wanted it with interest?
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  They're now saying.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  I did hear that.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  I can't imagine.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  But I can't wait to see what happens.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  You know, about that too.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  So these people are crazy.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  It's crazy.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Why do you think Emmanuel and Gruber go on TV and laugh everybody?
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Is that a confidence game deal?
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  It is.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  It is.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  It's kind of like a Caligula effect.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  I think.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  Caligula effect.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  There you go.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  That's what I like to call it.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  You know, but the thing is, is the folks, what I like to call the silent majority, the folks
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  that have common sense, they're starting to wake up and they're done with it.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  I think folks really are.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  I mean, this is, maybe it is a good thing.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  We've had to go through all this.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  You've been up here for 20 years talking on air.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  People think you're crazy.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Stuff's coming to fruition now.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  It's happening.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Maybe this is good that it's getting so crazy.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Well, like you said, folks aren't saying we're crazy anymore.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  No, not at all.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  And they're not laughing anymore too.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  It's not funny.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  I mean, it's serious.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Folks were engaged in conversation at the polling booths today.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  And they were engaged and they were serious.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Great job, Will.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  For the last several weeks, Donald Trump has been warning us that the election could be
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  rigged against him.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  First of all, it was rigged and I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  I have to be honest because I think my side was rigged.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  If I didn't win by massive landslides, I mean, think of what we won in New York and
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  Indiana, California, 78%.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  And now he has indicated on Twitter that he is aware of reports of electronic voting
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  machines that are flipping votes from Trump to Hillary.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  Meanwhile, Info Wars has highlighted the fact that there have already been numerous reports
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to a vote for Hillary
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Clinton.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  And now we have learned that billionaire globalist George Soros is controlling the voting machines
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  in 16 states, including major swing states like Arizona and Florida.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  I tell you, it ain't going to sit well down my way at all.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  It ain't going to sit well.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  We need a thousand paul reviewers.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, carriage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  And beef was for supper.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, want to shed some tears
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Let's fix it.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  at InfoWars.com.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  products that you need each month.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Just go to InfoWars.com, select your favorite product or products.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  And with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  The date is Thursday, October 27, 2016.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  We are now only 11 days out from the 2016 election.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Only 11 days.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  I'm your host.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  My name is Alex Jones and I'm the editor of National Inquirer.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  I had been covering news for 21 years.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  I got out of high school and got into RTF.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  I never got how they demonized the National Inquirer.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  That's where I heard about the plan to put in planable micro-chips in people 25 years ago, 10 years before it was on ABC News, and it was exactly right.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.560]  That's where I learned about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his Nazi ties, which shouldn't come out
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]  until decades later.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.280]  And it was exactly on target.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280]  So many other things.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.120]  Now people get confused by National Inquirer with like other stuff about Bat Boy and other
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.600]  magazines that are up there at the counter.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.640]  But I got to tell you, they got some tabloid stuff in there too about the stars and stuff
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.080]  because that's what folks buy.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.080]  But that's accurate too.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.560]  I mean, you don't want to get sued, folks.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.560]  You want to be accurate.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.120]  And I got to say, the National Inquirer is one of the most accurate publications out
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120]  there.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.080]  And I don't say that to kiss the butt of the National Inquirer.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.720]  I've been saying that for 20 years because the New York Times tries to lie.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.480]  And Jeff Rovin, the big whistleblower that's risking his life to come out and expose the
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.800]  Clintons along with other fixtures that work for him, like Larry Nichols, who's going to
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.080]  join us at the start of the next hour.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.120]  What they're saying is accurate.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.200]  What they're saying is documented.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.760]  What they're saying is proven.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.880]  And so nine times out of 10, it's places like the National Inquirer or Info Wars or
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.600]  DrudgeReport.com that are willing, I mean, was Drudge right about Monica Lewinsky?
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600]  They said he wasn't.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.840]  At first, he was right.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.120]  Was Drudge right about fees and fines for not having Obamacare?
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120]  He was right.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.240]  Were we right about the NSA Spine?
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.480]  Was the Inquirer right about it?
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.280]  I remember the Inquirer 25 years ago reporting on NSA Spine.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.960]  First place, I'd learned about it.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.120]  So I didn't mean to go into the Inquirer so credible line here, but is it there that
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.400]  credible or that the New York Times is that uncredible?
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.240]  So when Jeff Rovan, this big whistleblower comes out in the Inquirer, he said, look,
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]  you can't go to the New York Times.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  They're totally controlled.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.240]  WikiLeaks shows that.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.240]  Hillary runs them.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.240]  You go to the Inquirer.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.480]  So the Inquirer gets lumped in with all the other, you know, stuff, space alien invasion
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480]  stuff.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]  And they do that to me too.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.240]  They go, Alex Jones believes space aliens are about to invade.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.240]  Never said that.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.240]  Don't cover space aliens.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.240]  The people know the truth.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.840]  That's why the Inquirer is rising, mainstream media is falling.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.680]  So that's a whole other interview about mainstream media versus independent media and where the
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.120]  mainstream is going, how it's like an albatross around your neck.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.120]  But I want to get into their latest big installment this week that just hit newsstands.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.560]  We're getting an exclusive here.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.440]  Hillary Fixer breaks ranks, I arranged sex trips for her with men and with women, but
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.280]  it also just gets into her temperament and more and why he's going public.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.480]  So Dylan Howard, NationalInquirer.com, RadarOnline.com, now speaking out, it's great to have the
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.920]  editor-in-chief of the Inquirer with us.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.120]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.520]  So wow, a break this down.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.720]  I mean, new installments coming out, why Mr. Rovin went public.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.720]  This is huge.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:33.400]  Well, Alex, if you trace it back, the origin of this story is indeed the now infamous type
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.480]  of Donald Trump and Billy Bush on that bus.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:44.720]  Now as a result of that particular story, Jeff Rovin decided to break 24 years of silence,
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:50.680]  get from the shadows and unmask himself as the Hillary Clinton fixer, the hitman, the
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:59.000]  man who orchestrated and ran a backroom operation out of a Hollywood director's office and off
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.960]  the books operation whereby he dealt with the biggest scandals, the biggest controversies
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.080]  of the Clinton administration.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.720]  And this reaches the highest levels of the White House.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.560]  And what Mr. Rovin reveals is startling by its very nature.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:25.000]  He tells us that effectively Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton used brass knuckled tactics.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.880]  The type of tactics that you would think would be isolated to the mafia in an attempt to
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.800]  sabotage those women who made allegations against Bill Clinton and also sabotage the
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:41.840]  federal investigation of their whitewater land scam by special prosecutors.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.920]  How did they do this in the most disgusting and vile manner?
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.560]  Taking a page from perhaps something like the Sopranos, Bill and Hillary hired a squad
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:57.440]  of private eyes, people like Mr. Fixett, to shadow the movements of federal prosecutors
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.160]  as they closed in on potential indictment of the Clintons in the whitewater probe.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:09.320]  This is corruption at its very highest level, corruption seemingly business as usual to
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.680]  the Clintons.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.080]  And reading last week and this week's installments to the inquirer, I mean right there it fits
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.080]  into all my own research how Hollywood's involved really in mafia type activities in perception,
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.240]  in manipulation with some of the other people, famous quote private investigators actually
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.240]  with murders.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.640]  I mean this is really a whole mafia system being exposed when you say it's mafia-like.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.000]  I look at the Clintons, it seems like it is an amalgamation of kind of a Hollywood mafia
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.560]  slash Dixie mafia tied into all these different seedy elements.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.440]  Perhaps the strangest part of this whole saga through Jeff Rowan coming forward though Alex
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.080]  is, it's not really about the tryst that he supposedly organized for Hillary Clinton
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.760]  or the looting of Vince Foster's office.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:02.720]  But bizarre though it sounds to me that's simply a distraction on what the overall reality
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.200]  here at this particular story is.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:11.520]  Jeff Rowan bravely stepping forward exposes the rottenness at the very core of the Clinton
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.520]  operation.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:19.760]  It's about how they've used money, threats, intimidation, lies, all for one twisted purpose
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.280]  to ensure they're three decades of power in this country and they will stop at nothing
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  to do that.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.000]  They will delete 33,000 emails.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.560]  They will willfully take part in play.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.440]  If she wants cash, they get her cash.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.760]  If she wants to intimidate those that challenge the narrative, the public narrative of the
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.640]  Clintons, they do it.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.360]  If they want to blackmail people, they do it.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:54.240]  So at the very core of this is the notion of muggling, threatening, intimidating people
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.680]  for one very purpose and that is that she gets the White House.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:58.680]  Exactly.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.440]  I mean, look, it's like getting Al Capone on taxes.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  It's the cover up.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.240]  I mean, we have her doing all these mafia tactics to cover up the sex.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.880]  We're not even focused in as libertines on the sex.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.360]  It's that they're hypocrites and I guess that's why he said he went public going up to Trump
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.520]  for some edited 11 year old tape.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.520]  When this woman literally is not a thousand times that it's the hypocrisy.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.040]  Is that why Mr. Rowan went public?
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.400]  Indeed, he said that it was the hypocrisy of the mainstream media and the way in which
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:30.240]  they covered the now infamous Billy Bush tape that prompted him to come forward.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.200]  I had been looking at this story for the past two years.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:38.320]  I first met him two years ago and I told him that I was going to expose the corruption
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.960]  of the Clinton operation to which he responded that he was concerned that his confidential
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.680]  informants would be made public if he didn't participate in the story.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.840]  He was at that juncture that he decided to speak forward and by doing so, he's provided
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:59.120]  a glimpse into the very dark heart of the Clinton political system.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.720]  They facilitate this corruption and then they perpetuate it.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720]  They encourage it.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.320]  Again, once they get you involved, they've got dirt on you.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.320]  I mean, it's fun.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.360]  This is one of the closest people ever to the Clintons.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.640]  This is a, I mean, personal, almost no degrees of separation, a very trusted fixer.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640]  How did he get in that position?
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.800]  I know it's all in the new issue of the Inquirer, but flush that out for us.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.400]  It's amazing because they're not even really denying this right now.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.120]  They are very upset right now.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:28.760]  There has been a steadfast no comment from Bill Clinton's office and indeed the campaign
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.440]  of Hillary Clinton to president.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440]  That tells you a lot.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.960]  That tells you a lot.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:41.720]  This man first came into the orbit of the Clintons in the 90s as Bill Clinton emerged
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:44.920]  as the front runner to win the White House.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.600]  And the Clintons realized they had a serious problem on their hands.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.040]  There were these supposed bimbo eruptions that have been well chronicled for years on
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.000]  your show and from whistleblowers such as Larry Nichols and others.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.200]  And the reality was that this gentleman was connected to someone very, very close to Bill
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.760]  Clinton, one of his closest friends.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.440]  And it was through that that he was asked to engage in this off the books clandestine
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440]  operation.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.440]  He outlined to us a series of 12 fixes.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.360]  This came across his desk when he got the wink, wink, nod, nod to go and do what was
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.040]  needed to ensure that these particular stories didn't come out on one particular occasion.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:30.160]  He was offered a serious amount of money to a photographer that had seen compromising photos
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:40.800]  of the actress Markey Price in a limousine with Bill Clinton before that deal could be
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.840]  orchestrated.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.440]  The photographer studio burned down the night before.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:55.080]  This is a series of instances out of the pages of something like a script from Ray Donovan.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:02.000]  In another instance, he detailed how at the orders of Hillary, he was involved in a campaign
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.200]  to discredit Monica Lewinsky.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:11.120]  He provided to us a two page memo that circulated amongst the Clintons in a most confidance
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.640]  which in many ways validated his story to us because that was addressed to Deputy White
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.800]  House Chief of Staff Harold Ickes.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.800]  That fax memo bears a date and a time stamp.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.320]  Not only that, he provided payoff ledgers and we had independent verification of four
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:34.720]  other sources who confirmed Jeff Rovan's involvement in the Clinton operation.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:43.880]  But perhaps most alarmingly to me is the notion that the Clintons blackmailed federal prosecutors
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.880]  in the Whitewater probe.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:52.280]  This is a kin to watergate in my mind, to dig up seriously embarrassing material that
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.560]  intimidates the prosecutors so that Clintons could get away with their corrupt conduct.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.560]  That's right.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.760]  There's no statute by the way, federally, on murder, child molestation and bribing federal
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.400]  officials in treason.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.760]  There's no statute on those and now how much credibility does it add to the inquire that
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.920]  you've been reporting on this for 25 years, about 23 years.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.520]  And now it's all in the WikiLeaks, it's all in the Project Veritas, just like icing on
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:23.760]  the cake or a cherry on top really proving the fact that the inquire was there first.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.440]  I mean, how do you, how, how were you guys back when there was no alternative media,
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.520]  no drugs report, no Western journalism center?
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.920]  How were you able to operate like that?
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.120]  Well we are by our very nature investigators.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.880]  We are rogues and renegades who sit on the outside and not, we're not in the back pocket
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880]  of.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.800]  So you're a vestigial leftover of real investigative journalists.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.440]  Indeed and you know the reality is we, we put sources through polygraph tests to authenticate
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:55.080]  the veracity of their information and sure, we have a big checkbook and we pay for information
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:00.040]  but the reality is we authenticate that information and as you pointed out at the top of the hour,
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.280]  if we didn't, we'd get sued.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]  We are rogues and renegades.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280]  Exactly.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.280]  Listen, it's not just that I'm moral.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.440]  I go through a lot of authentication because if you don't authenticate, you're gonna be
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.440]  out of business.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.040]  And here's the reality.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.880]  The Clintons have never voluntarily told the truth about these actions.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.920]  We will continue to report on it.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.960]  Those who won't is the mainstream media.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:26.720]  This story came out and they've turned a blind eye and that is a very, very sad state of
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.440]  affairs for the forced state in this country.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.400]  The reality here is that this story goes to the very crux of one thing, character.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.960]  Who's fit to take the oval office?
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:46.280]  Do we want a president that is corrupt, that lies, that engages in criminal behavior or
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.080]  do we want another candidate?
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.400]  Now we don't have a dog in this fight.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.080]  We have endorsed Donald Trump.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.080]  We have said that we believe, our readers believe that he will be the best candidate
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.520]  for the role of president.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.560]  80% of our readers overwhelmingly have voted for Donald Trump.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.560]  Which is another important poll.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.040]  I mean, you guys have been nonpartisan.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.200]  The fact that 80% of your readers, that are registered readers, you know, subscribers
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.800]  are saying that that's a big deal.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:18.800]  The reality is that we will continue to cover, like we have with Gary Hart, John Edward,
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.640]  Jesse Jackson, and now Hillary Clinton, the big political scandals.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.760]  We'll do what the mainstream media won't, but it is an indictment on the media when
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:35.280]  people like Chris Hayes on MSNBC take a swipe at the National Inquirer and muster things
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.640]  about aliens and the such to try and discredit the particular story that we have done.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.640]  Well, that's a badge of honor.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.640]  I know you know that.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:47.080]  To have Chris Hayes or any of those people, I mean, those people have like 100,000, 200,000
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.120]  viewers, they are a joke.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:55.080]  They are, but they're doing a disservice to the industry of journalism to not investigate
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.080]  and cover.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.000]  The reality is, these people have never done an inch of investigative journalism in their
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  life.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  They contribute to the public discourse about who supposedly would make a better president,
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.080]  yet they haven't done any journalistic deed.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.080]  Instead, it's blow hard work.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.400]  Well, Dylan Howard, NationalInquirer.com, their second edition is out on this incredible
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.040]  investigative journalism.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.040]  Super dangerous.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.640]  Journalists say, yes, this is, well, they're not even denying it.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.120]  I mean, this, this is real.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.400]  You talk about dangerous folks.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.720]  This is cutting edge.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.400]  And you look at the mainstream media and how they are a shadow of their former selves.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.400]  They aren't journalists.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.960]  They read off teleprompters.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:36.400]  And we now know, Dylan Howard, again, the editor-in-chief NationalInquirer.com, RadarOnline.com.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.440]  We now know from the WikiLeaks that they literally, Hillary is the editor of the New
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440]  York Times.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:48.800]  Yeah, I mean, the WikiLeaks, and what gets on my God, Alex, is every time the mainstream
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.680]  media refer to WikiLeaks, they are the stolen WikiLeaks emails.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.480]  They're not the WikiLeaks emails.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.800]  They're not the documents that destroy Hillary Clinton, which in fact, they are.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.480]  Instead, they couch it.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.280]  They create this narrative that these documents are not credible.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:11.280]  But the reality is, whatever the origin, whatever the source, it's, it's, it's, it, it, yeah.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.800]  These emails are illuminating.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.120]  The reality about Bill Clinton's sexual life is that John Podesta, the campaign manager
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:23.760]  for Hillary Clinton, acknowledged that they had a problem with the energizer, Julie Torba
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:29.680]  McMahon, his longtime mistress, who we, at the National Inquirer, first brought.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.160]  They acknowledge that he's still involved in a relationship with her, and they point
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.840]  to the National Inquirer in these WikiLeaks emails.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:44.200]  Daggering that to this very day, Bill and Hillary Clinton are enabled by fixtures like
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:49.960]  John Podesta, not like Jeffrey Rovan anymore, by Sheryl Smil, by others.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.360]  These people provide for Clinton's whatever they want.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.800]  I was about to say, Andrea Mitchell on video last week, the, the, the, the spokesman hands
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800]  her the phone.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.320]  She looks nods, then asks the question.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.200]  They don't even care.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.120]  It's like they are totally insane.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.240]  Now, now again, we're talking to the editor-in-chief of the National Inquirer.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.560]  We've got 11 days left.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.680]  Obviously, more is coming out, I'm guessing, uh, from your source and other sources.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.080]  Other bombshells on the way?
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.120]  Well, yes, indeed.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.520]  We know all these factors as you've, we've talked, talked and discussed because of, uh,
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.840]  mystics at Jeff Rovan unmasking himself.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.920]  He was essentially one of the detectives tasked with shadowing the prosecutors involved in
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.960]  white water.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.120]  The revelation that we have exposed in the current issue we kicked Newstance yesterday
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.840]  is that a senior member of that prosecution team was followed to a seedy motel where
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:49.040]  he entered that motel in the company of, according to a source, a strapping young man, making
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.040]  sure not to use his own name when he rented the room.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.320]  They had essentially a blackmail operation.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:02.480]  That Clintons use this to leverage the prosecutor to step down from his involvement in the white
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.480]  problem.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.480]  Now, let's spell this out.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.200]  Well, this is intelligence operations, what the Russians do.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.880]  You're saying, coming out, this isn't the new issue, but they're using sex operatives
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.320]  to set up prosecutors.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:16.120]  This is incredible.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:23.440]  Their tactics were the kinds of stunts the mob could only look on in joy and glee and
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.240]  probably embarrassment that they couldn't orchestrate something.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.480]  Wow, there's the headline National Enquirer, Bill and Hillary to interrupt, Bill and Hillary,
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.080]  their mob tactics to intimidate investigators.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.240]  Now we know how they're controlling the FBI.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.680]  Wow, please continue, sir.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.680]  You've got five minutes left.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.760]  I appreciate all your time.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.160]  Just tell us everything, please.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.560]  Well, I think the reality here is we have to, before you go to the ballot box, you have
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.440]  to ask yourself the very question as to whom is fit to take the office.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:57.200]  The reality is that for three decades, the Clintons have perpetuated corruption at the
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.040]  highest level.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:05.680]  They have ordered a blackmail intimidation, threatening tactics against those that challenge
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.680]  the public space of the family.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:14.160]  The reality is, despite their hands-off approach, if you like, we weren't involved, other people
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.960]  were doing it, the reality is that the traces go straight back to the top of their tree.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.280]  It's a fix that provided payoff ledgers to support that.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.320]  And this should well be not only a fundamental question that voters ask themselves before
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.840]  they cast their ballot, but a question for law enforcement.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.280]  If prosecutors involved in the whitewater investigation were blackmailed, that is a
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:42.440]  crime and a criminal should not hold the highest office in this land.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.960]  Wow, I am just speechless here.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.440]  I know you probably got to go, sir, we're going to break it about three minutes, but
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.040]  I'm told you may be able to hold a little bit longer, because I want to come back from
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.320]  break it to five more minutes with you and play the clip from the last debate, where
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.840]  Trump points at her 24 hours after the project Veritas came out, where she ordered people
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.280]  dressed up as Sanders supporters to go attack Trump, obviously the demonized Sanders, her
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.720]  competition, and Trump, her competition.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.520]  I was told that by the Chicago Police Department, we have sources, we first broke that with
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:18.120]  Roger Stone, but to see it confirmed and him going after her, it seems like whole orders
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:23.320]  of magnitude of corruption worse than Trump making a few locker room comments.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.360]  I mean, I've got to be frank with you, I'm blown away by how much energy Hillary and
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.000]  her controllers have, because you get these emails from WikiLeaks, they're running hundreds
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.120]  of news agencies, and they've got interns basically running major newspapers telling
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.120]  them what to do.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.360]  I mean, you talk about a control freak, it seems like Hillary is the definition of it.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.760]  Oh, there's no doubt about that.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.120]  He was essentially the puppet master pulling the strings here for those that worked at
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.000]  the lower level of this clandestine operation.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.880]  But if you look back, you take a step back, let's put it in a context.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.600]  Here you've got the president of the United States facing potential impeachment, Hillary
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:04.160]  Clinton facing potential jail for her involvement in white water.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.840]  Then you have individuals like George Stephanopoulos, who is now at ABC News, who was essentially
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]  a Clinton aide.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:18.160]  You've got Harold Icky, the trail of money leads back to our mega, mega Hollywood name,
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.320]  a award-winning television and film producer.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.720]  His involvement is connected to Mr. Fixer, Jeff Rovan.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.960]  Jeff Rovan is committing these actions at the behest of Hillary and Bill Clinton.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.640]  This is a criminal conspiracy of the highest order.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.120]  It beggars belief that it has not been investigated by anyone but the National Inquirer, though
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:46.160]  I do give props to Michael Isikoff at Yahoo News, who was at Newsweek at the time, who
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:52.000]  in his book about the Clintons discussed many of these tactics that were used.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.200]  But it also begs the question, why is law enforcement not investigated?
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.560]  I think we're sitting on the cusp of something very explosive here.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.560]  I agree.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:07.320]  This is the definition of racketeering, where you've got Hollywood, the media, the prosecutors,
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:12.360]  the whole system, them packing the media with their admitted operatives so the scams could
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.240]  get even bigger into the future.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.960]  I've never heard of a criminal enterprise that had this big of dreams.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:24.560]  I would challenge the federal investigators involved in Whitewater to step forward from
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:31.920]  the shadows before election day and tell their stories about what happened, what happened
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.640]  to them, what they observed, what they knew, what the Clintons did.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]  Because there's safety in numbers.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.920]  Dylan Howard, National Inquirer Editor-in-Chief, please do a few more minutes with us.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.040]  Don't need to come back because you're a smart guy and give us your plan to change
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040]  this.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040]  I totally agree.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.040]  Safety in numbers.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.080]  Everybody needs to be all in, just like Jeff Roven, and tell the truth, let the chips
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.880]  fall where they may.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:30:01.400]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.480]  Whatever happened to billionaire Mark Rich, one of the world's most wanted fugitives,
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:12.080]  who 16 years ago was being indicted on one of the biggest tax fraud cases in American
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.080]  history.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.160]  And he was also involved in illegal trade deals with Iran and other crimes that were
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.480]  harsh enough to put him on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.400]  Well, Mark Rich may have been a career criminal, but he wasn't stupid because he knew the best
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:33.480]  way to receive his get out of jail free card was to donate money to the Clintons.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.000]  Mark Rich gave a half million dollars to the Clinton Library, and lo and behold, after
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.040]  20 years of running from the law, he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:48.520]  Rich died in 2013, but his business partners continued to donate huge amounts of money
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:55.960]  to the Clintons, including a $1 billion pledge to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960]  That is Clinton Justice.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.960]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:14.280]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.560]  at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.560]  it.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.080]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.040]  right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.640]  just kind of clears up.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:32.240]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.960]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.400]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.200]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.440]  done it without brain force.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.320]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.680]  force and came in.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:59.480]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.560]  It was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, God was in school, morality
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:34.800]  had a future, and beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.520]  We're the solution, Americans, I ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:44.240]  Storying Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, theatrical
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:49.960]  screenings on demand, DVDs now available, wanna shed some tears over the red, white
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:59.400]  and blue, revelation, the movie.info, Americans need to see this film, revelation, the movie.info,
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.400]  let's fix it.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:23.160]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder, another world, people had courage,
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:32.400]  and the story was written in the book, until it became challenge.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:43.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  broadcasting, worldwide.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.520]  I was talking to Anthony Gocharty during this last break, and he does some shows maybe
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.200]  once a week with us.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:53.120]  He's over our health writers and research for the nutraceuticals with a bunch of scientists
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.800]  and developers, and that's why I hired him, because he was so successful in natural society
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.880]  and the big product line he had, and inroads into a bunch of big nutraceutical companies
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.640]  that were all organic and supplied whole foods, and he said, man, it's like Fight Club, and
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:12.240]  I'm not bragging, you should just know the level of the awakening happening, as we go
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.120]  back to our guest in a moment who's the greatest hate for the whole hour, so I'm very pleased
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:21.480]  that he can do that during his lunch hour, the editor-in-chief of National Enquirer.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.120]  He went to the bank yesterday, and the guy at the bank goes, Anthony Gocharty, we just
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.240]  love you, we love Alex Jones, tell him we're all in, everybody was like nodding behind him
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.000]  and tell Alex we said hi.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.880]  That's one of our folks that's hardly on air, maybe once a week for 10 minutes.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.560]  Then he goes to Walgreens to get a prescription, and the pharmacists all come over and are
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.840]  freaking out, then he goes to get something else at the front counter, and he said they
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840]  were coming over.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.960]  I mean, folks, Trump is going to win by the landslide, they're going to try to steal it,
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:57.040]  and all I can tell you is, they want to cause, George Soros had met a civil war, that's in
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.040]  the emails too.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.840]  They want to get us killing cops and burning stuff down, and the government has been hijacked.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:10.120]  The government is not a cop riding a ticket or changing an old lady's tire or responding
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:13.200]  to a civil disturbance.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.880]  They got a tough job.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:21.200]  Imagine responding to civil disturbances, you have any idea how dangerous those are?
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.560]  I mean, I'm not lionizing police, I'm just saying they're not our enemy, and we have
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.960]  the crazy out of control Democratic party.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.160]  I've always been nonpartisan, because Republicans are bad as well, but they are literally trying
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:36.240]  to cause a civil war in this country, and national polls show Democrats are planning
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.160]  to blow stuff up, burn stuff down, and attack people if Trump wins.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.040]  Well, I say, I'm calling your bluff, fill your hand.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.480]  At a certain point, this country's got to wake up, and I'm telling you, I'm telling
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.200]  you it's happening right now, as we just indicated with Anthony and Weldon.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.560]  Weldon's got all these friends from the military that, oh, you guys go too far, he says none
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.680]  of them disagree now.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.480]  They call up and apologize to him.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.880]  America is waking up, the sleeping giants awake, I don't care what color you are.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.640]  You bleed red blood, you're part of that awakening, and it's exciting.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.640]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:15.160]  We're going to go back to Dylan Howard, radaronline.com, nationalinquire.com, the national editor,
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:19.320]  breaking stuff that's as dangerous as it gets, as dangerous as what Drudge has broke, as
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.640]  dangerous as what Veritas has broke, this is crazy stuff, we're going to go back to
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.720]  him and play this Trump clip from the last debate in a moment, but first, it's important
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.880]  to vote with your dollars.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.960]  The Clinton original foundation, their library foundation documents, judicial watch, sued
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:38.560]  two years ago, and so did the Western Journalism Center, Joseph Farah, World End Daily, and
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.600]  got the documents, 20 something thousand pages.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.960]  And Farah said off record to me, it was on record on air, but he said a lot of it's off
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.960]  record, it's so horrible, the surveillance of people, what they're doing, the mafia
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.400]  ties, he goes, we're just waiting to put a book out on this, well it never happened,
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.120]  but he released some of it on World End Alien here, and it was like, we can't let a new
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.640]  media develop like a national inquirer, we've got to demonize it, call it conspiracy theory,
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.000]  and try to shut it down.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.720]  We can't let it ever get any funding like the national inquirer or books.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.720]  So it's all about never letting us get funding, never letting a new media with new views who
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.680]  aren't bought and paid for or get in.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.560]  Now we see them put a democratic operatives in over the entire media, the next level of
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560]  their takeover.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.200]  If the Republicans were doing this, I'd go after them, I don't want a one party state
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.200]  folks, a ruling party, that's called dictatorship.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.640]  So fund us, we've got a Trump, he's my president, red shirt, everybody's going to wear red on
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.960]  election day and before and after to point out, hey, we're the majority in the streets
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.160]  with the cameras, just like the Hillary for President shirt, it's now history, limited
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.200]  edition, we're not selling anymore, everybody's copying it, that's fine, we're not making
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.200]  it anymore.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:48.000]  We have the red Trump is my president shirt, infowars.com, legalized freedom on the back,

[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.720]  show, again, find all the storeable foods at infowarsselect.com, but those are just suburls,

[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.280]  or publications like the Inquirer have the courage, because this is all vetted, this
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.720]  is all confirmed from my sources, they cannot believe that Jeff Rovan had the courage, because
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.760]  let me tell you, talk about Crosshairs on his back, the biggest fixer, bigger than Nichols,
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.040]  and Nichols has told me off, there he goes, this is the guy, this is the guy after I was
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.440]  not involved, they got, this is so huge, we've got to recognize the courage of this, and
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.800]  everybody should go to their newsstands and buy those national inquires and give it to
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.360]  everybody you know, because the great news is everybody I talk to says the Inquirer has
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.520]  more credibility than New York Times, of course it does, but they try to confuse it again
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:54.880]  with the other publications that are Batboy, now I've said that, I appreciate you joining
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.920]  us, I appreciate the editor in chief Dylan Howard of NationalInquirer.com joining us,
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:04.280]  I'm going to shut up for the next 12 minutes, we've got to break, you've got the floor,
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.280]  everything you want to cover, please break it down.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.760]  Well Alex, I mean you raised some very, very valid points, the mission of organizations
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:18.440]  like Infowars and the National Inquirer is to reveal the unvarnished truth about what
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:27.560]  occurs behind the fortified walls of the establishment, be it Hollywood, Wall Street, or the Beltway,
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:32.480]  and the discoveries that we make are very often very well out of sync with how these
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.960]  certain individuals like the Clintons portray themselves to the public, and that disconnect
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:45.440]  is the very reason why the Fourth Estate exists, it's where we live at the Inquirer as a publication,
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:51.040]  and what I will tell you is that if it wasn't for the relentless coverage of certain issues
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:55.360]  such as the sexual assault claims against Bill Cosby, it was the Inquirer that took on that
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.800]  story years ago, before anyone else dared, when Cosby was still a beloved TV icon, and
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.840]  today he's finally facing justice.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.040]  The interesting thing for me about the Clintons is that the founding fathers of this country
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:14.080]  never intended for people to turn their political calling into a lifelong job, unfortunately
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:21.200]  we've seen the rise and rise and rise of those that consider themselves to be career politicians.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:28.040]  The type of person that's riddled with foibles and has limitless ambition that wants everything
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.000]  for themselves, self-service, that is the definition of Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.200]  The Inquirer exists like Infowars to hold these individuals accountable, and if it wasn't
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:43.120]  for the National Inquirer, John Edwards could well have been president instead of a laughing
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:48.160]  stock who fathered a loved child and tried to lie about it.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.280]  One of the most notorious figures in contemporary politics, Gary Hart, may well have ascended
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:58.880]  to power if we didn't reveal monkey business.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:06.520]  We've been at the very front lines of investigative reporting this political election.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:12.920]  Our coverage has been hard hitting, and to many extents, it's been unrivaled by any other
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:18.120]  publication, and it has been bipartisan.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.200]  We looked into Ben Carson and we revealed a myriad of malpractices that dealt him a
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:36.880]  very heavy blow in the GOP primaries, and we need to continue to investigate the Clintons.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:44.280]  We have, and we're packaging this up, it goes to print next Wednesday, yet another investigation
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:49.760]  into the power and influence that they wielded, not for the greater good, but for their own
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.240]  self-interest, and that is unfortunate.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:58.240]  No person, no company, no politician, no organization should be too rich or too influential
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:03.960]  to be able to perpetuate corruption of the highest level, and we need to take it on.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.600]  This is not a partisan attempt, this is a bipartisan pursuit of the truth.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:08.600]  I agree.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.920]  I mean, you've always been bipartisan just to briefly interrupt with the editor-in-chief
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.920]  of the Inquirer.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.160]  We're talking to you right now, Dylan Howard.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.560]  I mean, we've talked to WikiLeaks, they've been public, they said, like, Trump's been
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.280]  hacked into, there's nothing there with the Russians or anything, it's all Hillary.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.680]  And so that's the thing about Trump.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.960]  He's so good compared to anybody else we've seen.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.600]  I mean, if he was anywhere near Hillary, we'd be against him.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.160]  I mean, I've been nonpartisan.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.200]  It's just such a clear choice for me.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.800]  Look, you know, I don't get to vote in this election.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.080]  I'm an international, I'm a green card citizen of this country.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.600]  We don't get to vote.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.560]  Nevertheless, the reality is, ask yourself this question when you go to the ballot box.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:59.000]  Do you want someone who has endured or perpetuated three decades of scandal, corruption and crimes?
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:06.360]  Or do you want someone who may have used the P-word in a video with Billy Bush?
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:10.120]  A number of women have come forward and made allegations against Donald Trump.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.760]  Some of it might be with Merritt.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.840]  Some of it might not.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:14.840]  That we don't know.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.600]  He's steadfastly denying the allegations, the women are steadfastly standing by it.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:25.720]  But the one thing, look at the ballot box when you make that vote and ask yourself the question,
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.600]  do you want the Clinton crime family back in the White House, or do you want to break
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.920]  down the borders of the establishment?
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:40.600]  Please continue, but I just want to add clearly, I mean, the vote is, you know, Trump's our
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:41.600]  proxy.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.600]  Clearly, you're for the establishment.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.600]  We voted against Trump.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.600]  I mean, we've got the Communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians, every horrible, evil organization
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.600]  against Trump.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.240]  I want to ask you why you think you're so scared, but separately, since you mentioned
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.840]  it, let's play this clip of Trump in the last debate, which really devastated Hillary,
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.040]  pointing at her and saying, you're the one that sent the people to attack my rallies,
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.040]  which is confirmed.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.920]  And again, the Machiavellian nature dressed up like Sanders supporters to demonize him,
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.240]  but also Trump, both are competitors.
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.480]  It just shows a true level of organized evil.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.520]  Here's that clip.
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.240]  Those people, I don't know those people.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:18.720]  I have a feeling how they came.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.280]  I believe it was her campaign that did it, just like if you look at what came out today
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:29.360]  on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.880]  where we had such violence.
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.640]  She's the one in Obama that caused the violence.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.920]  They hired people.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:43.880]  They paid them $1,500 and they're on tape saying, be violent, cause fights, do bad things.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.680]  And he goes on to say that is completely illegal.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.680]  It is.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.720]  It's mafia, but we were taught until the fifties hearings that there was no such thing
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.720]  as organized crime.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.920]  They had the FBI set it because they reportedly had photos of him dressed as a woman.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.000]  Whether that's true or not, they had the FBI in the forties and early fifties said there's
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  no such thing as La Cosa Nostra, the family or Italian mafia.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.120]  Well, there is mafia in every racial group.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.360]  That's how humans organize themselves sometimes.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:12.840]  And we know the Clintons represent this weird mafia and it's all coming out.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:17.080]  The reality is for the mainstream media to turn a blind eye to Project Veritas as they
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:21.360]  have Jeffrey Rovan is a disservice to the voter.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:28.280]  It falls on too few to make an impact on journalism today.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.560]  The National Enquirer has been around for 90 years.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.040]  We'll be around for many, many more to come.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:40.040]  And though we are admired in equal measure and trusted by our readers, those that don't
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.680]  want to appear in the pages of those that have something to hide, we're feared and loathed.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:49.080]  And for those that will make their decision on November 8th, I would encourage them to
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:54.600]  look into the investigative reporting of my team that has been working around the clock
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:59.920]  to report this story, traveling from corner to corner of this country in order to speak
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:05.680]  with many individuals who have firsthand knowledge of this type of behavior.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.280]  They've done an outstanding job.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.520]  We're not done yet.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:16.080]  The true face of the Clinton family, in my view, will be exposed within the next seven
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.720]  to 10 days as we put together our final issue before the November 8th election.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.360]  Well, I can't wait to read that because I'm so researched on this that when I read it,
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.360]  it's like 99%.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.320]  I know it's already true because I've already done it and then the little added points,
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.960]  it's just so, so clear.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.360]  When does that final issue come out?
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.360]  About five, six days?
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:36.040]  Yeah, it comes out next Wednesday.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:40.640]  We'll be on nationwide newsstands next Wednesday.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:45.360]  You know, we've interviewed Democrats outside polling places and they say to us, and they
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.760]  are the minorities, a very small group, it's mainly women, I feel sorry for them because
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.160]  the Clintons are in these emails talking about what idiots they are and how blacks are dumb
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.160]  and the rest of it.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:56.960]  You're just looking at WikiLeaks today, it's horrific stuff.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.080]  And they're in there and they say, well, you know what, she's immoral but for a good
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.080]  reason.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.640]  Well, that's very evil.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.640]  Injustifies the means.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.160]  What's your view on that?
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:14.000]  Look, I think that WikiLeaks has pulled back the veneer of what we see as Hillary Clinton
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.920]  and I don't want to get into too much detail, but suffice to say, yet another individual
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.760]  that is close to the Clintons has broken ranks.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.400]  Was in our office earlier this week, someone whose connections to the Clintons is undisputed.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:37.560]  They felt compelled to come forward to talk about the immoral nature and behavior of Hillary
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.920]  Clinton.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.400]  This story by its very nature is going to rock this presidential race.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.240]  It has the potential.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:57.920]  It has the potential to swing a certain demographic of voters towards Donald Trump and the GOP.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:05.120]  It is an explosive story backed up by a past polygraph test and documentary evidence.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  Wow.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.720]  Dylan Howard is the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:12.960]  You guys, I've never seen you hype something you don't deliver on.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:14.640]  You always over deliver.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:21.400]  You're saying the big November surprise is that you have a undisputed Clinton insider
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:23.760]  about to drop a huge bombshell.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.880]  So is it safe to say, as I've seen you do in the past, you've saved the best for last
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:28.880]  year?
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.480]  Let's say it's like a game of ping-pong.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.040]  When you get a hold of a big story like this, you bat it across the other side and you see
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.640]  what bounce it gets.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:46.920]  In this particular instance, Jeffrey Rovan, having the courage to step forward, how brave
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:52.760]  he was to spill the beans for the very first time, made other individuals feel comfort
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.240]  that they too could tell their stories.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.600]  We were contacted by this individual.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600]  He flew to New York this week.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.440]  We strapped him into the light-detected test.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.280]  He passed with flying colors.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.120]  He provided other evidence to back up his position as part of the Clinton operation.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:15.960]  What he tells us is a story so dramatic that I do believe that a certain section of the
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.440]  voting public in America could be swayed by this man's revelation.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.440]  Wow.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  Dylan Howard, it's funny.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.260]  The first question I had written down here to ask you that I didn't get to was, it seems
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:29.680]  like with Mr. Rovan coming forward and others, it's causing a chain reaction of courage.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:33.520]  You called for more federal prosecutors to go public, others too, so it seems like that's
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.520]  what's happening.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.520]  It is.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.920]  But my challenge remains to those who are involved in the Whitewater Pro, has the courage
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.920]  to come forward.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:48.080]  If you were blackmailed, tell your story because the very freedom of this country could depend
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.080]  upon it.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:50.080]  That's right.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.080]  It's all in the line.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.080]  We're back in three minutes.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.080]  Final segment with our guest, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.080]  We're talking to the editor-in-chief of NationalInquire.com.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.080]  Dylan Howard.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:58.080]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.080]  This is History Happening.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.080]  People are showing what side they're on.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.080]  Charlie Daniels.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.080]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.080]  Let me just read a little saying here from the June 21, individual rights will have to
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.080]  take a back seat to the collective.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.080]  Well, you know, the next move is going to be, don't you?
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.080]  It's going to be coming after your guns.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:17.080]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:19.080]  And beef was for supper.

[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.080]  You've got it.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.080]  11 days hard to believe.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.080]  This is like a lifetime.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:13.080]  This is like the campaigns that I've lowered my life.
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:20.080]  A couple things here.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.080]  We have Texas newspapers reporting vote flipping.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.080]  We reported on it.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.080]  Drudge linked to it twice.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.080]  We have Texas election officials reporting it with a letterhead.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080]  We have them on local TV.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.080]  We write two articles about it.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.080]  Drudge links to it.
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.080]  Trump tweets it out.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080]  Gives his sources.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:45.080]  And Politico comes out and says,
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.080]  Trump claims evidence of voting fraud in Texas.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:55.080]  Donald Trump pointed to Texas on Thursday as an example of presidential election being rigged against him.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:58.080]  And they wanted to say without giving any evidence.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:01.080]  Oh, but don't snopes run by a lady with a cat.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.080]  I'm not kidding.
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.080]  In some apartment, she says he's wrong despite the Texas officials.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.080]  This is why mainstream media is so incredibly discredited.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  This is why they're a joke.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.080]  Okay.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.080]  We have all the WikiLeaks.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.080]  We have them reading the polls.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:17.080]  We have them saying they're going to engage on all this.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.080]  We have the top Democrats saying they're going to have people vote 10 times a piece.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.080]  We have George Soros running in battleground states.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:26.080]  A bunch of the election machines.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.080]  Dylan Howell.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.080]  We've got about five minutes left.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.080]  I really appreciate your time.
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  Editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.080]  NationalEnquirer.com.
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  Also, RadarOnline.com.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.080]  What do you make of this?
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:41.080]  They don't seem to get that they're lying and dissembling doesn't work anymore.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:47.080]  Well, I think political journalism is at this very juncture, the wild, wild west of the
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:48.080]  media.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:55.080]  It demands a level of bipartisanship that an accountability, I should say, that is severely
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.080]  lacking in almost every media outlet.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:05.080]  You know, our reporters have brought years and decades of training and ethics, journalistic
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:12.080]  ethics to the table to expose the type of corruption with the Clintons that we have done with great
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:13.080]  success.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:21.080]  And I still remain filled with hope that this type of investigative reporting can be a transformative
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:26.080]  tool and an important tool in changing the public discourse.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:35.080]  Unfortunately, the way in which talking heads have swallowed up every inch of the television
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:43.080]  screen, it's re-engineered the way we discuss political scandals and stories, whilst not
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:49.200]  looking at the true cause and the true reporting that should be done, like what info wars and
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.080]  life, what the Enquirer has done.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:59.080]  So whilst I think that the medium of king head political journalism will continue in
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:02.000]  the industry, it shouldn't thrive.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:09.720]  We've got to get back to what Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward did in the Nixon administration.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:15.600]  It was a transformative tool that was done for the greater good of this country.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:22.160]  And it's all too easy to curate and aggregate content and rehash your own opinions and the
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:25.800]  opinions and talking points of a political movement.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:31.600]  But it is true good old fashioned boots on the ground reporting that the National Enquirer
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:35.800]  does that can play a pivotal role in the political discourse.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:36.960]  We don't give up.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.960]  We won't give up.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.960]  Our readers deserve it.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.600]  And I think the voter deserves it.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:42.600]  That's right.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:46.200]  Dylan Howard is the editor-in-chief of National Enquirer, NationalEnquirer.com.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:51.280]  Their big mega issue coming out next Wednesday, leaving bigger bombshells.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.480]  In closing, studying history, reading the old Muckrakers, the demonization of the Enquirer
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:02.480]  is because it was one of the last Muckraking old fashioned Mickey Spelane outfits.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:06.760]  Back when major cities had five, six, seven daily papers, sometimes three editions a day,
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:08.200]  it was all about who was Muckraking.
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:09.840]  It was all about the public being informed.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.720]  You go back to the robber barons 100 years ago, they said, we've got to get rid of this.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.720]  We've got to buy the media up.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.720]  They did that.
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:20.880]  Except for a few pockets, like drudgerport.com, thenationalenquirer.com, infowars.com, things
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:21.880]  like that.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:24.280]  Please pop back him next week if you can.
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:27.840]  You're a very busy person with the latest installment.
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:28.840]  And thank you for your work.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:29.840]  I'm Mr. Howard.
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:30.840]  No, don't worry.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:31.840]  It's any time.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:32.840]  Thank you.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.840]  Wow.
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:39.800]  All right, folks, hour number three now, straight ahead with Larry Nichols, the Clinton insider
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:41.840]  stay with us.
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:47.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:52.960]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.360]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.080]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:00.760]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:05.400]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.400]  my system.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:12.400]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:18.200]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:20.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:21.800]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:24.520]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:25.760]  You have the neem in there.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:28.840]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:32.120]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.120]  All right.
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.160]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.480]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.480]  Living defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.120]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:45.400]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.640]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:53.280]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:53.280 --> 02:00:08.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:14.080]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:23.640]  Remember, I get tired, I think about all the innocent people, the globalists who are attacking,
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:29.120]  and I will, myself, to point towards God and instantly energy flows down through the heavens
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:31.440]  into my soul.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.800]  Evil globalists make jokes about the fact that I love God.
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:38.240]  It's because they don't have a relationship with the Creator.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.240]  I do.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:44.680]  And I'll tell you, when you're in touch with God, you feel so ashamed because you see how
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.200]  fallen you are.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:52.040]  It doesn't matter because together, with God's help, listen to this song, crank it up, you
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.280]  can scale the heights.
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:57.480]  That's why they attack everything beautiful and say it's evil.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.280]  And everything evil, they say is good.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:07.280]  But to all those that have signed on to the devil's pact, and a Faustian deal, I'll tell
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:14.160]  you now, there's a wind on down the road where your shadows are taller than your souls.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:29.200]  There's a lady we all know, who shines white light, and if you go with her, you're going
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.240]  straight to hell.
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:37.400]  Devils have run around in some red capes, black horns.
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:42.040]  Devil's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen, and it sells you alive.
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:47.960]  It'll damn your soul to ever.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:48.960]  You'll be a rock.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.960]  You'll be a rock.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  And now.
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:52.960]  All right.
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:55.160]  I want to get ready for Larry Nichols to join us.
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:58.640]  We got a bunch of other clips I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:04.320]  There are just so many here to cover, like I just had my video list here.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:12.760]  I want to say, though, it is beyond amazing to see the Animating Contest for Liberty.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.680]  We're all engaged in right now.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:20.640]  And to look at these clips, Hillary's crowded West Palm Beach rally, plenty of space, Kane's
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:21.640]  got 30 people.
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:22.640]  She's got a couple hundred.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.000]  And I haven't played the video yet.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.960]  We cue it up in the next segment of her falling down or getting to fall down again with her
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:29.960]  handler.
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:36.640]  To me, her falling down, her listeners falling asleep is so emblematic how she's the zombie
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:37.640]  candidate.
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:38.760]  She's a zombie.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:43.800]  Her supporters are zombies, and they're in this delusion because they buy into the whole
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.320]  Stockholm syndrome that they're part of it.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.640]  I think she's quite a champion for them.
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:53.440]  We don't lose either way.
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.440]  Trump gets in.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.440]  It's a bigger fight.
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.440]  It's the right thing to do.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:59.200]  Justice will be done by the heavens fall, but they're going to attack him or get him
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.200]  from every angle.
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.200]  It's going to be rough.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.880]  Believe it, they've got a big plan B. But that's the right thing to do, so I'm supporting
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:05.880]  them.
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:07.880]  They're dumb enough to put her in.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:12.000]  Baby, throw me in that briar patch every day.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.520]  The resistance just was assured total victory very quickly, but it's going to be a rougher
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.920]  road, though, but very quick.
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.040]  Let's go to that first clip.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:27.160]  Hillary crowded Palm West Palm Beach, plenty of space.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.640]  What about the crowd?
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.640]  How many has she brought out?
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:36.400]  All right, well, here it's nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.920]  yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000.
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:39.920]  Take a look short.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:42.920]  There's maybe 1,000 to 2,000 people in your trade.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.920]  Yeah, 15,000 gets 30,000.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.840]  The clean rally is much smaller, and you can see there's empty space here.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.880]  She's supposed to speak in about 15 minutes, and I can tell you, it was the camera pan
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:54.880]  just totally alone.
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.760]  Yep, by the system that if we were in a Trump rally, almost all of the young women stumbling
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:03:59.760]  around.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.320]  We saw yesterday there was no open space.
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:06.360]  They had 15,000 people at that airport and the hangar yesterday.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.920]  So as I come back into the shot, we're waiting for Hillary Clinton, she'll be here in about
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:10.920]  15 minutes.
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:11.920]  Oh, we got a break here.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.640]  We have Hillary supporter falls asleep.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:15.400]  Let's go out to break with this.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:19.760]  We may not have time, but here is Hillary supporter falls asleep.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:24.440]  Let's make childcare affordable, and let's have more profit sharing.
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:27.600]  And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:36.080]  Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues,
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.480]  you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.480]  card.
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:44.160]  And I got to tell you, there we go.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.800]  One of the supporters asleep.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:46.800]  That's what it is.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.640]  I think we're paying when she says free health there.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:50.600]  She means federalization of your children.
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:54.200]  There's no free ride unless you're in a slave nest.
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:57.200]  We'll be back on the other side with Larry Nichols and more.
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:59.280]  This is 11 days out.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.280]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.440]  For the last several weeks, Donald Trump has been warning us that the election could be
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.960]  rigged against him.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:08.960]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:11.080]  And I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:17.880]  I have to be honest, because I think my side was rigged if I didn't win by massive landslides.
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.800]  I mean, think of what we won in New York and Indiana, California, 78%.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.160]  And now, he has indicated on Twitter that he is aware of reports of electronic voting
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.080]  machines that are flipping votes from Trump to Hillary.
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:37.280]  Meanwhile, Infowars has highlighted the fact that there have already been numerous reports
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:43.600]  of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to a vote for Hillary
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:44.600]  Clinton.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:49.960]  And now we have learned that billionaire globalist George Soros is controlling the voting machines
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:55.880]  in 16 states, including major swing states like Arizona and Florida.
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:59.360]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:02.600]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:06.880]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:10.280]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:12.600]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.360]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.920]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALAX.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:22.320]  It's a company I trust.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:26.960]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.200]  in an economic meltdown.
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:31.480]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:34.960]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.280]  on the move.
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:41.120]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:42.120]  finances.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.440]  You can play, call 844-541-ALAX now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.640]  store your coins, absolutely free.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:54.200]  These are dangerous times, and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:57.000]  I personally own these survival packs, and you should, too.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.600]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALAX now.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:06.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.280]  produce by the group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:13.720]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:15.920]  it's very, very important.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:22.560]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:24.840]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.920]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:31.240]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:34.120]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.800]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.600]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:41.880]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:42.920]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:45.600]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:46.600]  I take this.
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:48.480]  This is the product that I take.
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:49.480]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:53.000]  In the profit we make, we fight the global, we fight the new world order.
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:19.240]  Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  All right.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.280]  Larry Nichols is our guest for the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:29.440]  Anthony Geschardy takes over in the fourth hour.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.000]  There is evidence of vote flipping going on all over the country.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.240]  We have election officials talking about it in Texas.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.920]  Politico comes out and says Trump is completely insane.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.920]  There's no evidence.
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.920]  There's no election fraud.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:42.040]  But the Russians are overthrowing it.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.040]  Total fraud.
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:44.040]  We've got to federalize.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:46.760]  There's no fraud, but there's total fraud.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:51.680]  And Obamacare is free, even though it's doubled your prices, and now another 25% premium increase
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:56.880]  for the lowest level people, you know, the lowest bracket that has to buy it.
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:01.320]  So we're all, and I've got all these clips of the architect of it, Jonathan Gruber,
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:06.040]  and one of the main people making money off of it, and architect of it, is E. Colomanual.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.200]  Bragging, of course, it's meant to bankrupt things.
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:11.520]  I mean, these people are jokers.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:17.960]  I don't get why criminals, and they're criminals in my view, giggle about how you're gang-raping
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:18.960]  the country.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.080]  And they have a sense, though, when they take, they win.
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:28.000]  Not, I take from somebody, it lowers my culture and my society.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.800]  I mean, if somebody's coming on at me, I'll knock you down.
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:35.840]  I'll put you in the dirt, but a little satisfaction when you're there, but I wasn't looking for
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.840]  the trouble.
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:40.040]  My instinct to knock you down is when you come at me, not because you're just sitting
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:43.640]  there like, here's a five-year-old kid, I'm an adult, let me hit him in the back of the
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.960]  head with a baseball bat, because I can.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:47.360]  I mean, that's the criminal energy attitude.
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:51.040]  But here's a few minutes from yesterday, this is now backfired on them, WorldNet Daily's
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:56.000]  reporting on it, and others, Danny Williams has over 30 million views on our platforms
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.720]  and his platforms of his press conference, which was a bunch of Newsweek people interrupting
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:01.720]  him the whole time.
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:02.720]  It's not even that good.
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.240]  But the point is, they're scared of this, because they're the mainstream media.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:09.280]  They wish they had 30 million views their whole career.
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:12.040]  YouTube backs off on ban of Clinton's black son.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.360]  Here's what happened yesterday live.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:19.880]  There's less than 12 days left before the most historic election in U.S. history.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.240]  We're seeing massive censorship being intensified.
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:29.520]  Now Danny Williams is reportedly Bill Clinton's illegitimate son from a black prostitute in
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:31.240]  Little Rock, Arkansas.
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:35.840]  And Bill Clinton has basically been caught giving him money and presents over the years.
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.440]  But I interviewed his aunt 20 years ago and thought this story was extremely credible.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:43.040]  The man's very handsome, he looks a lot like Bill Clinton.
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:46.120]  And regardless of what you say about Bill Clinton, when he was young, he was a handsome
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:47.120]  guy.
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.620]  But now that YouTube has shut down a video that had incredible millions and millions
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:56.000]  of views, and we now learn it's shutting down other videos of Danny Williams across
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.680]  the web, it only adds credibility.
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:01.760]  Now, I just hung up with him minutes ago.
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:03.600]  We taped it live.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:04.600]  Here it is.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:09.960]  This is what Hillary Clinton is scared of and does not want you to see him.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:11.460]  That's the key.
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:13.160]  This adds a lot of credibility.
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:23.320]  They do not want you to see this.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:29.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, 20 years ago, I interviewed Danny Williams' aunt.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:34.120]  Bill Clinton for years sent $700 a month to their home, sent Christmas presents.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:40.040]  Danny Williams is a spitting image of Bill Clinton.
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:43.680]  He had him on a few weeks ago, and it was big international news.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.960]  Then last week, hours before the debate, there was to be a big press conference.
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:52.360]  Hundreds of cameras were there, CNN came and threatened the hotel and said, this press
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:53.760]  conference isn't happening.
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:55.800]  They told Danny it was canceled.
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.240]  Then we later learned that was a fraud, and about 15 members of the press covered it.
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:06.120]  There were more than 20 million views on Facebook and YouTube of the live conference that our
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:08.880]  reporters covered.
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:14.000]  Now, Danny Williams, we've learned today, had his YouTube channel with over 2 million
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.720]  views on his press conference, just on that channel.
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.560]  The number one video on YouTube deleted, and in fact, if in a moment if Joe Beggs will
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:27.000]  come in for TV viewers, we can show folks a shot of this, where they've told him his
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.880]  account is suspended, and that's the end of it, for community violations.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.480]  This is just where they have a bunch of Democratic cattle tales saying we don't like something
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.480]  and it's banned.
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:41.680]  So, whether you believe a story is true or not, I know it's true, the evidence is overwhelming.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:44.960]  What's incredible is they're attempting to cover all of this up.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.440]  So when the time comes, we'll do a document cam shot for TV viewers, and give a shot of
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  this in a moment.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:54.240]  But Danny Williams, who I just caught on the phone, he's driving to go pick up his kids.
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.640]  He drives through Arkansas in the middle of nowhere.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:58.640]  Danny Williams is here.
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:03.240]  He's going to tell you what's happened to his YouTube channel with massive censorship.
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:04.240]  Danny, thank you for joining us.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:06.240]  Go ahead and tell folks what's happening.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:07.240]  Yes.
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:13.240]  Basically, today, we found out earlier last night that they picked up a YouTube channel
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:22.240]  saying that it was a violation of the community or what not, for the person who needed it.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:27.240]  But, technically, I got over so many viewers and a lot of good response.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:34.240]  I don't feel like I've been anything to violate anyone, but yes, they kicked it out and we
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:38.240]  are trying to figure that out right now.
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:45.240]  Well, they've done this to me whenever I expose reports of Bill Clinton or rape or whatever.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:47.240]  They'll say community guidelines strike where people complain.
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:50.240]  They say, yeah, we think this is mean, so they take it down.
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.240]  I've had videos about World War III they take down.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:56.240]  But here you are, very polite in the press conference video they took down.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:59.240]  There's a copy of it on m4wars.com as well.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:02.240]  We used to have another video taken down last week with us.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:07.240]  We want to shut down our channel right now, so there's a real push 12 days out from this
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:08.240]  election.
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:10.240]  Talk about what was on the video that they banned.
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:12.240]  I mean, it wasn't nothing negative.
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:14.240]  I mean, no profanity.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:20.240]  All I did was speak about the story of me, Danny Williams, and my claim is more than
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  what they did.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.240]  That's what all the big-time-
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:27.240]  We're going to fade that down to a little Larry Nichols, but that full interview that
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:31.240]  they've tried to censor his press conferences up on m4wars.com.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.240]  The fact that this press conference he did, that over 30 million views on four different
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:39.240]  platforms total.
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.240]  Our platforms were like 2 million and 3 million and 5 million, but his platforms were over
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.240]  25 million.
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:46.240]  That's really got to scare the power structure.
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:49.240]  And Larry Nichols, the consulate Clinton insider, one of the main sources for the
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:55.240]  Enquirer reports that are so dead on that are coming out, joins us right now from Arkansas
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.240]  to break down the latest developments and where he sees all this going.
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:00.240]  Larry, thank you for joining us.
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.240]  You bet, Alex.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.240]  How are you?
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:04.240]  My head's been in 11 days out.
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:06.240]  I mean, how do you see this whole thing?
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.240]  I can tell you where I see it.
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.240]  I believe Donald Trump's winning.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:16.240]  I believe, Alex, it's time now for us to tell people exactly what to do to fight voter
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:17.240]  fraud.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:21.240]  And what they're going to do, Alex, is that we've talked about them bringing in.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.240]  I'm trying to get into the center of the shot.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:24.240]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.240]  What they're trying to do is they'll be bringing in vans, which I told you about over a year
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:34.240]  ago, and now you've got the tape, where they're actually saying they're doing it.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:38.240]  Well, there's another thing that we've all got to do.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.240]  Number one, when you go cast your vote, here's what you better do.
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:51.240]  If it's a touchscreen computer, make sure that that precinct shows you a recorded,
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:58.240]  a printed proof of how your vote was recorded.
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.240]  Now, we've gotten, I've already gotten several, several responses, Alex, where people, one
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:09.240]  lady in Georgia, voted for straight line Republican when she saw proof of what she voted for.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:14.240]  She had voted for Clinton and it took her four or five times to get them to rerun it before
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:18.240]  it ever showed voting for Trump.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:24.240]  So what you've got to do is you've got to make people at the precinct prove your vote
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.240]  was recorded properly.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:34.240]  Now, if they can't show you proof, then demand a paper ballot.
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.240]  Demand it.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:40.240]  They're supposed to have paper ballots, but if they don't find out where you've got to
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:45.240]  go to get a paper ballot, because Alex, when you're on these computers, I heard you earlier
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:50.240]  say that Soros owns the voting equipment that's used in 16 states.
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:51.240]  He does.
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:57.240]  But what people don't realize is he owns the majority of several other voting machine
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:58.240]  companies, but he owns them.
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.240]  No, I know that.
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:01.240]  I mean, that's come on the last 10 years.
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:05.240]  And, and so bottom line, Hillary's got to be really upset, though, that Trump isn't just
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:07.240]  going quietly into the night.
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:08.240]  He's openly exposing all that.
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:12.240]  How does that upset her apple cart?
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:18.240]  Alex, she, she's going to lose and she knows it unless she can amass and pull off the biggest
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:21.240]  amount of voter fraud in the history of this country.
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:22.240]  Now, I agree.
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:26.240]  Our preliminaries, as we're getting from early voting, showing landslide for Trump.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:27.240]  Well, yeah.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:32.240]  And I don't know that it'll be a landslide, but I can tell you this.
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:34.240]  Hillary's defeated and she knows it.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:37.240]  So they've got a cheat now to back that up.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:39.240]  So you don't think I'm just making this up.
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:47.240]  The DNC filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls.
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.240]  Why would they do that if they know there's no cheating going on?
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.240]  Why would they fight the, you know, photo ID to vote?
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:00.240]  Why do that if they don't plan to have massive voter fraud?
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.240]  Look, I say this to your audience, Alex, please.
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.240]  This is your vote.
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:06.240]  You got one.
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:08.240]  You've got one.
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:10.240]  You got to protect it.
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:16.240]  If you allow your vote to be changed, then we've lost.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.240]  We've lost all.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:18.240]  No, I agree.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.240]  We expose it.
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:20.240]  We show the fraud.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:22.240]  We have millions of people reported to that happens.
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:24.240]  It's game over just from perception.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:29.240]  Now, I've looked at the end trials as I know you have of several polls.
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:31.240]  Here's what they're doing.
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:36.240]  They're trying right now, Alex, to make everybody believe this election is over.
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:42.240]  For the next 11 days, it's going to be the media mainstream media and Hillary's job
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:45.240]  in her campaign to make people believe this election.
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:51.240]  Well, they say from CNN to MSNBC to the New York Times, she's already measuring the new
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:52.240]  drapes.
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:53.240]  They say she's in.
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:54.240]  It's done.
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.240]  Well, let me tell you why that is.
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:59.240]  Hillary's already got every vote she's going to get, Alex, and they know it.
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:02.240]  They know there's nothing they can do to increase that.
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.240]  So they've got one move left, and that's to convince people that are going to vote for
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:08.240]  Trump.
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.240]  You might as well stay home, owe your yard, go to a movie, do something worthwhile because
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:15.240]  it's over.
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:17.240]  Don't waste your time.
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:19.240]  Folks do not believe it.
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:29.240]  When I looked at the internals last week of a poll, that was an MSNBC poll.
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:34.240]  Now, Fox News reported it as the gold standard of polls.
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:39.240]  When you looked into the internals of that poll, Alex, here's what you find.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:45.240]  60% of the people interviewed or 60% of the respondents were Democrats.
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:46.240]  Stay there.
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:47.240]  Let's go to the rest of it.
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:48.240]  Oh, that's in WikiLeaks.
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.240]  They're over-sampling across the board like we're the biggest idiots in the world.
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:56.240]  It's like starting a football game and giving the other team 15, 14 points.
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:25.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:55.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:22.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:48.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:22:14.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:40.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:22:40.240 --> 02:23:06.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:32.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:58.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:31.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:25:00.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:29.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:59.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:26.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:53.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:27:20.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:49.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:28:16.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:45.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:29:15.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:45.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:29:46.240 --> 02:30:15.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:45.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:30:46.240 --> 02:31:15.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:44.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:31:45.240 --> 02:32:14.240]  I'm going to kill you all to know that's a fraud.
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:41.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:32:41.240 --> 02:33:00.240]  That's a fraud.
[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:33.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:34:02.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:29.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:51.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:35:18.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:47.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:36:09.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:36.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:37:05.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:34.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:38:02.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:27.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:54.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:23.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:52.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:40:15.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:42.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:41:08.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:37.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:33.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:43:02.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:21.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:48.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:44:14.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:41.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:45:08.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:34.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:46:01.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:23.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:50.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:47:17.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:44.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:48:06.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:35.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:49:02.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:29.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:55.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:50:22.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:51.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:51:18.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:45.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:51:45.240 --> 02:52:12.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:39.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:53:00.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:28.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:55.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:53:55.240 --> 02:54:24.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:53.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:55:23.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:50.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:56:19.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:49.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:57:19.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:47.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:58:14.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:43.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:58:44.240 --> 02:59:11.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:37.240]  I'm going to kill you all.
[02:59:37.240 --> 03:00:03.240]  I'm going to kill you all.

[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:05.240]  I want to play this clip before we go any further. Let's play this clip. This is Morning Joe.
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:13.240]  They spent at least 17 minutes talking about this. I want you to hear the comments that Joe Scarborough points out.
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:42.240]  I want you to hear the comments that Joe Scarborough points out.

[03:18:34.240 --> 03:19:03.240]  I want you to hear the comments that Joe Scarborough points out.
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:08.240]  Hillary Clinton doesn't have that problem. She could care less what you say about her. She doesn't have a conscience.
[03:19:08.240 --> 03:19:17.240]  She has been a criminal for so long that nothing you could point out that is true about her would even bother her.
[03:19:17.240 --> 03:19:26.240]  It's all true. She doesn't try to defend herself. They also talk about, say, ban described how they helped expand a fruitful relationship with the Swiss Bank UBS,
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:34.240]  introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation,
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:49.240]  agreed to pay Bill Clinton for the speeches. UBS paid Clinton about $2 million in speaking fees between 2011 and 2015 for a series of appearances alongside fellow establishment member George W. Bush.
[03:19:49.240 --> 03:19:59.240]  They're all in it, folks. Donald Trump is the independent in this campaign. The Republicans won't give a dime to him and they won't spend a dime to attack Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:59.240 --> 03:20:28.240]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:29.240 --> 03:20:58.240]  We'll be right back.

[03:24:21.240 --> 03:24:27.240]  Also, we have the full Michael Moore tape, which I think you really need to hear.
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:33.240]  And of course, Michael Moore thinks that he's trolling the right wing, thinks that we're all going to go watch Trump land and be convinced.
[03:24:33.240 --> 03:24:41.240]  And I just have to say, Michael Moore fully understands why people are voting for Donald Trump.
[03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:50.240]  He understands that we know that the system, that the elitists, that the globalists have destroyed our economic lives.
[03:24:50.240 --> 03:24:56.240]  But then he thinks that he's going to turn us around and get us to vote for the most corrupt person to ever run for office.
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:25:03.240]  Absolutely no way. Michael, you're not going to fool us. We're not idiots on that respect either.
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:07.240]  Let's go to our callers, Mark and Oregon. Mark, go ahead.
[03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:11.240]  Hello, David. How are you?
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:16.240]  David, I'd like to comment very quickly on what you just mentioned about Hillary.
[03:25:16.240 --> 03:25:33.240]  I'll be more specific in a moment if I may, but I really want to give him the information to you that I think will either make or break the reality of the future relative to whether Donald Trump gains the White House or not, whether he's the winner.
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:49.240]  Hillary Clinton became involved at her parents' direction when she was about six years old from the best I can gather from the documented evidence into their own family's cremation of care ceremony.
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:55.240]  Of course, her father was the mafia done for the Jewish mafia in Chicago. It's all very interesting.
[03:25:55.240 --> 03:26:02.240]  Where's your source on this? Because I haven't heard several these things. What's your source on that?
[03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:14.240]  I listen to people such as David Rintz, Alex. I can't separate that out right now, but I'm going to be very good sources of information.
[03:26:14.240 --> 03:26:41.240]  Today, she has turned into a person that has no conscience, as you mentioned. What will just do a little extrapolation. You have the engineering mind. You understand that she's going to go right to the direct wholesale destruction of the unwanted, the irredeemables, the unpardonable in this country.
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:51.240]  Oh, yeah. She's very vindictive. Yes. Now, David, as I mentioned, of course, you know it. Many of us know it. You have a degree in engineering.
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:59.240]  So I'm going to present this very logical to you so that it'll be just quick, concise and succinct.
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:11.240]  Donald Trump cannot win the election unless the only vehicle which the dark side is employed to prevent him from winning the election and that being the phony polls are allowed to stand.
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:30.240]  They have to be disputed by Donald Trump is the most logical choice. Other people that would help even Alex's organization or a conglomeration of organizations to actually begin doing polls immediately, which are then publicized by the organization and it will catch on into the media
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:44.240]  because Alex is a known known quantity and polls mean a lot. These polls have to be disputed or they're going to be used as a basis for low expectations, which is already forming a moralization of the Trump forces.
[03:27:44.240 --> 03:27:56.240]  The people who are for Mr. Trump. Mark, we've already had documents that have been released where the Clintons are talking about how if we just over sample certain groups, then we can flip the polls.
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:28:07.240]  And we see that they are dramatically over sampling Democrats, for example, in many of these polls. And when you look at this, they tell you that it's a scientific poll and it's got a margin of error of four points.
[03:28:07.240 --> 03:28:15.240]  Another one's got a margin of error of four points and they're 12 points apart. You got to ask yourself, what's going on with this? It doesn't add up. They can't both be scientific polls.
[03:28:15.240 --> 03:28:21.240]  And so we know that there's a lot of push polling going on out there. We know there's over sampling. There's all kinds of games that they're playing.
[03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:29.240]  I think there's a lot of metrics, Mark. There was one that just came out today that was on the Drudge Report. Trump wins an election in a high school mock election.
[03:28:29.240 --> 03:28:41.240]  Those are usually pretty accurate reflections of what the parents are talking about, quite frankly. And this is in Minnesota. This is Al Frankenland, where the high school students voted for Trump.
[03:28:41.240 --> 03:28:57.240]  What are we going to do about it, David? If nothing's done about it, if these phony polls are allowed to stand in the public's perception and the real polls are not put out there by the people of Trump, which are the unpardonables by the evil side in this country,
[03:28:57.240 --> 03:29:10.240]  because we're just the best there is in this country. And Donald Trump is the best of the best. He's going to lose. And the alternative media, the, of course, the mass media conglomerate that's putting these phony polls out.
[03:29:10.240 --> 03:29:21.240]  Nobody is focusing on the fact that on the good side, on our side, that legitimate polls have to be presented to the public. And it can be done through Donald Trump.
[03:29:21.240 --> 03:29:25.240]  He's already got his internal polling organization. It can be expanded into public.
[03:29:25.240 --> 03:29:40.240]  Well, I agree. I agree. And I, you know, we get the word out that they can rig the polls. We know from internal memos that they're talking about how they would rig the polls. And I even talked to Nigel Farage. He said the day of Brexit. We saw this happen all this this year in Britain.
[03:29:40.240 --> 03:29:50.240]  The day of Brexit, they had their premier polling organization say that Brexit had lost by 10 points. Didn't happen. So the message has to get out there. We'll be right back.
[03:29:50.240 --> 03:30:01.240]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:01.240 --> 03:30:08.240]  For the last several weeks, Donald Trump has been warning us that the election could be rigged against him.
[03:30:08.240 --> 03:30:23.240]  This was rigged. And I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest. Because I think my side was rigged if I didn't win by massive landslides. I mean, think of what we won in New York and Indiana, California, 78%.
[03:30:23.240 --> 03:30:44.240]  Now he has indicated on Twitter that he is aware of reports of electronic voting machines that are flipping votes from Trump to Hillary. Meanwhile, Info Wars has highlighted the fact that there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to a vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:44.240 --> 03:30:56.240]  And now we have learned that billionaire globalist George Soros is controlling the voting machines in 16 states, including major swing states like Arizona and Florida.
[03:30:56.240 --> 03:31:15.240]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[03:31:37.240 --> 03:31:46.240]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.

[03:33:04.240 --> 03:33:16.240]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:16.240 --> 03:33:22.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to go back to our callers in just one moment before we do.

[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:43.240]  Let's go back to Reggie and Arizona. I want to take one more call and then I do want to make sure that we get to a couple of these clips here.
[03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:56.240]  Also, we've got Judge Napolitano asking what happened to the FBI. And he goes through the timeline and an essay here of what happened why they didn't investigate Hillary Clinton.
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:02.240]  So I want you to hear what Judge Napolitano has to say about that. But first, let's go to Reggie and Arizona. Go ahead, Reggie.
[03:35:02.240 --> 03:35:10.240]  Hello, David. Hey, go ahead. Out here in Arizona, you know, it's all Trump. Wherever you go, it doesn't make any difference.
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:23.240]  And very little percentage that he won't be our next president. But what I'm, my question is, if he is elected president in November here and say it's officially through,
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:33.240]  will he have any kind of an authorization or a poll to stop the corruption of Obama and, you know, illegal immigration and everything that he's trying?
[03:35:33.240 --> 03:35:40.240]  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of things that he can do. Look, he's got, it's the first time the Board of Patrol has ever endorsed a candidate.
[03:35:40.240 --> 03:35:49.240]  They are sick and tired of the president and his, the people at the top of the Justice Department shutting down them and forcing the law.
[03:35:49.240 --> 03:35:54.240]  You have to understand that what's happening right now, it isn't that you're going to have dueling executive orders.
[03:35:54.240 --> 03:36:01.240]  You've got Obama by executive order telling people they cannot enforce the law right there in Arizona.
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:12.240]  You've got Obama coming after Sheriff Arpaio going to lock up the sheriff who enforces the immigration rules but allow the people who violate the immigration rules to go free.
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:17.240]  I mean, it's an upside down system. And so absolutely, there's a lot of things that he could do.
[03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:25.240]  You know, he's talked about cutting the bureaucracy 75% and people say, well, he can't do anything like that.
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:34.240]  You have to understand, I've reported on this before, the Congress continues to fund most of these bureaucratic agencies that are a law under themselves,
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:40.240]  they operate as their own little personal fiefdoms, okay? They write their own, they write the law, we don't elect them.
[03:36:40.240 --> 03:36:47.240]  It's legislation without representation, but they write the laws, they've got their own police forces, they've got their own courts where, by the way,
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:54.240]  you are guilty until you prove you're innocent because they say this is a civil accusation, not a criminal accusation.
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:37:02.240]  So they play this little fictional game that the Bill of Rights doesn't apply as long as it's a regulation that they say that you're violating.
[03:37:02.240 --> 03:37:13.240]  And of course they give people excessive fines, but these organizations throughout the bureaucracy of the District of Corruption are continuing,
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:20.240]  they're continuing being funded by the Congress, and yet the Congress is not re-upping in many of these cases their charters.
[03:37:20.240 --> 03:37:24.240]  So these people don't even have the legal authorization to operate, even though the Congress continues to fund them,
[03:37:24.240 --> 03:37:27.240]  even though the Congress abdicates its authority to these organizations.
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:33.240]  And so there's a lot that a president could do coming in. I really do think that he could do a great deal, Reggie.
[03:37:33.240 --> 03:37:37.240]  And I think he would put in a special prosecutor. I mean, he even said it in the second debate.
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:43.240]  He said, I'm going to put a prosecutor to come after you. The guy to do it would be Rudy Giuliani. He wants a piece of Hillary Clinton as well.
[03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:49.240]  Thank you, Reggie. Let's go to Lisa in North Carolina real quickly. Lisa, go ahead.
[03:37:49.240 --> 03:37:52.240]  Yes. Hey, David, it's a privilege to talk to you.
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:54.240]  Well, thank you for calling.
[03:37:54.240 --> 03:38:08.240]  Okay, two quick things. A previous caller, I've heard Larry Nichols say that Hillary was her father, and Dan Rostinkowski took over the mafia in Chicago for what it's worth.
[03:38:08.240 --> 03:38:10.240]  Okay. All right.
[03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:19.240]  Okay. And secondly, what I'm calling about is I found a document on Dr. Steve the Chesnick's Twitter page.
[03:38:19.240 --> 03:38:34.240]  And it's called a salvage plan. Okay. And the letterhead has Benenson group or whatever, and also the letterhead of Clinton Foundation on it.
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:35.240]  Okay.
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:44.240]  And Benenson is the primary strategist for Hillary. And I just wanted to know if it was real. It's a little scary.
[03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:48.240]  Is that the one I said that they would do a false flag UFO situation or?
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:49.240]  Yes.
[03:38:49.240 --> 03:38:56.240]  Yeah. You know, I've had, I haven't covered that because I've had people look at it and they say, well, the address is an old address.
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:00.240]  And yes, they have used this group, but the logo has changed and so forth and so on. I don't know.
[03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:07.240]  You know, it was interesting when we had the film contest here at Info Wars, we had somebody that got their entry in late.
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:14.240]  But if you remember, it was a really excellent film and he had a Reagan speech. It was only maybe about a minute and a half, two minutes long.
[03:39:14.240 --> 03:39:22.240]  And Reagan making a speech, he said, you know, the thing that would unify America, unify the world would be to have an alien invasion and so forth and so on.
[03:39:22.240 --> 03:39:29.240]  And they show a false flag alien attack. I don't know. I mean, certainly I wouldn't put anything past these people.
[03:39:29.240 --> 03:39:40.240]  The key thing is, we don't want to have people that we know are corrupt, that people who have spent their entire life doing nothing but accumulating power and money ruthlessly.
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:45.240]  No matter what they had to do to get rid of the people that were in their way, we don't want people like that in office.
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:50.240]  If Americans are going to vote for people like that and put them in office, we're done.
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.240]  Like I said before, because she's a woman, we're supposed to give her a pass for this.
[03:39:54.240 --> 03:39:58.240]  You know, because she's Alis Capone instead of Al Capone, it's okay.
[03:39:58.240 --> 03:40:02.240]  You know, Bernice Mattoff instead of Bernie Mattoff, this is ridiculous.
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:06.240]  We don't want somebody like this in office. People should reject that.
[03:40:06.240 --> 03:40:11.240]  Thank you, Lisa. I want to point out, and I'll be forward since you brought this up, I've got a couple of other articles here.
[03:40:11.240 --> 03:40:13.240]  I didn't know if I'd have time to do it.
[03:40:13.240 --> 03:40:24.240]  This thing from WikiLeaks today where they have the creep shots of Bernie relaxing by the pool in a swimming suit with, you know, putting this up and trying to shop that around to the media.
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:32.240]  You know, this type of thing, we see the Clinton team taking a picture that they think might make Bernie Sanders look bad,
[03:40:32.240 --> 03:40:36.240]  because you know, it's an old guy in a bath in a bathing suit or whatever.
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:41.240]  It just makes the Hillary people look creepy. It doesn't make Bernie look creepy, right?
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:48.240]  But it's also the same types of things that we see Hillary accusing other people of that she does.
[03:40:48.240 --> 03:40:51.240]  For example, not only were they going to put this out, this picture to make him look bad.
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:57.240]  You know, he's got a baggy bathing suit on here, but then they also did this.
[03:40:57.240 --> 03:41:09.240]  They said, I wonder what Mike Bloomberg would think about all this? Bernie Sanders lounging at the elite Martha's Vineyard pool summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists.
[03:41:09.240 --> 03:41:19.240]  See, Hillary Clinton is Mrs. Wall Street. She has prostituted herself to these people beyond belief of what anybody has done,
[03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:29.240]  and yet she will take her character flaws, and she'll take Bill Clinton's character flaws with women, and she'll project her issues with Wall Street onto Bernie Sanders,
[03:41:29.240 --> 03:41:36.240]  and she'll project her issues with her husband's issues with women, and of course, her issues as well, project that onto Donald Trump.
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:40.240]  They accuse other people of doing what they do, and that's precisely what they did.
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:42.240]  And they got people to pick this up.
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:51.240]  They had Perez Hilton put the photograph out, and they had stories about Bernie Sanders attending fundraisers for Wall Street put out as well.
[03:41:51.240 --> 03:41:54.240]  They get what they want from the mainstream press.
[03:41:54.240 --> 03:42:01.240]  And then, of course, there's a story from Paul Joseph Watson on our site today, the WikiLeaks email, where you've got David Brock, and they're going back and forth.
[03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:06.240]  They say, you know, hey, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign.
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:12.240]  We publicly claim that Bernie Sanders didn't care about black people. Remember all this stuff? You know, she was fighting him for the black vote.
[03:42:12.240 --> 03:42:17.240]  And so Brent Badowski was not very happy with what David Brock did.
[03:42:17.240 --> 03:42:24.240]  So he says, Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters.
[03:42:24.240 --> 03:42:26.240]  He tells a lie that people will know as a lie.
[03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:29.240]  So we know that the Clintons are lying to us.
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:32.240]  You know, Michael Moore knows it, but he's going to vote for it anyway.
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:36.240]  All right, we know that you're lying to us.
[03:42:36.240 --> 03:42:45.240]  You insult the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:50.240]  I guess Brock's plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie.
[03:42:50.240 --> 03:42:56.240]  He says, I can't think of anything more desperate, more stupid, more self-destructive than David Brock.
[03:42:56.240 --> 03:43:04.240]  Lying about the Bernie ad, playing a seamy brand of politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf.
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:07.240]  What do they do? All they've got is the politics of race.
[03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:11.240]  All they've got is to project their flaws onto other people.
[03:43:11.240 --> 03:43:15.240]  And in this particular case, their stupidity, they're projecting onto black voters.
[03:43:15.240 --> 03:43:19.240]  So she projects her Wall Street connections onto Bernie.
[03:43:19.240 --> 03:43:28.240]  She projects Bill Clinton's hedonism and rape onto Donald Trump, and then they project their stupidity onto black people.
[03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:30.240]  Projection, that's what they do.
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:34.240]  Now, let's take a look at the projection of CNN.
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:45.240]  Coming after Donald Trump today, this is an article we have on Infowars.com video, rude CNN reporter asked Trump why he's taking time off to open a hotel.
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:49.240]  Let's play that clip.
[03:43:49.240 --> 03:43:58.240]  There's new audio tape of you talking about the fact that you really have relied on your popularity and the fact that people come to your events,
[03:43:58.240 --> 03:44:03.240]  and that helps you with free advertising. Is that what this was about?
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:08.240]  No, not at all. This was just under budget ahead of schedule. That's what this is.
[03:44:08.240 --> 03:44:17.240]  Under budget ahead of schedule, we built a hotel that is going to be one of the great hotels of the world, just opened today, it officially opens today.
[03:44:17.240 --> 03:44:24.240]  And we built it for less money than was anticipated, and we built it ahead of schedule by over a year.
[03:44:24.240 --> 03:44:29.240]  And if the country would do that, we would have a country that would be in much better shape than it's, you know, highways.
[03:44:29.240 --> 03:44:32.240]  They built highways for double and triple the cost. They built hospitals.
[03:44:32.240 --> 03:44:37.240]  And so to people who say you're taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?
[03:44:37.240 --> 03:44:43.240]  I say the following. You have been covering me for the last long time.
[03:44:43.240 --> 03:44:49.240]  I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I've been doing this for weeks straight.
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:55.240]  I left here, I left there for an hour and a half. I'm going to North Carolina right now, then I'm going to Florida, I'm going up to New Hampshire.
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:45:02.240]  For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting, because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps.
[03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:07.240]  And yet you'll ask me that question. I think it's a very rude question to be honest with you.
[03:45:07.240 --> 03:45:12.240]  And what I do is I want to back my children. My children work very hard, Ivanka in particular.
[03:45:12.240 --> 03:45:16.240]  And at the opening of the hotel, I want to back my children. Very important to me.
[03:45:16.240 --> 03:45:24.240]  Okay, so having a hotel that came in under budget, that he did it faster than they had anticipated, that's an accomplishment.
[03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:29.240]  When you run for president, you talk about your accomplishments as part of your campaign issues.
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:34.240]  And he pointed out he had eight stops a day before, three major events.
[03:45:34.240 --> 03:45:40.240]  Tens of thousands of people when the Clintons can't get more than a couple hundred people.
[03:45:40.240 --> 03:45:43.240]  He got that reporter saying, well, I think there's maybe a thousand people here. No, it's not.
[03:45:43.240 --> 03:45:49.240]  If you go regularly to a church and you look at a crowd, you know, that's about two or three hundred people max.
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:53.240]  Not a thousand people there. But it's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:45:53.240 --> 03:46:00.240]  They don't have anything to say when Hillary takes an entire week off to prepare for a debate each time.
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:06.240]  CNN doesn't have anything at all to say about that. So he's right. That was ridiculous. It was insulting.
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:15.240]  I want to get to this Michael Moore video because we played a little bit of this yesterday and Alex and Paul Joseph Watson and Joe Biggs all talked about this.
[03:46:15.240 --> 03:46:20.240]  I want you to hear this and I want you to hear the full four minutes of this.
[03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:26.240]  And then Michael Moore is laughing. He says, hey, you know, Trump has put this out and all these guys put this.
[03:46:26.240 --> 03:46:31.240]  You don't realize that I don't support you guys. And we've got about eight million views.
[03:46:31.240 --> 03:46:37.240]  That's going to sell a lot of my little mockumentary Trump land. It's like, no, you're not selling us anything, Michael.
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:45.240]  You have identified the reality here. You have a great speech, quite frankly.
[03:46:45.240 --> 03:47:00.240]  I mean, it is like something out of John Steinbeck's grapes of wrath. You know, Michael, we know where we know the vineyard where the grapes of wrath were stored and we know where they were grown as well.
[03:47:00.240 --> 03:47:08.240]  We know about this elitist game that's being played by the globalists. We know all about that. And you're right. We're pretty angry about it.
[03:47:08.240 --> 03:47:15.240]  And if we don't get Trump, we're going to give a big FU to the rest of the system in one way or the other. It's going to change.
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:19.240]  But for you to put this out, you understand this and you can look at all this stuff as an anthropologist.
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:23.240]  I'm going to play the full tape here. You can look at it from my anthropological standpoint.
[03:47:23.240 --> 03:47:29.240]  And, you know, I remember there was a movie called The Apostle and it had Robert DeVall on it.
[03:47:29.240 --> 03:47:35.240]  One of my favorite films. I thought it was really good. It shows you a guy who's got big character issues.
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:39.240]  But he also has a passion for God in this movie.
[03:47:39.240 --> 03:47:47.240]  And in the additional supplemental material that's on the DVD, somebody talked to him about it.
[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:52.240]  And he had a lot of Christians that were there with him. He said, yeah, I saw a couple of guys get saved on the set and everything.
[03:47:52.240 --> 03:48:01.240]  And they asked, are you a Christian? Oh, no, no, no. He could take a very detached view of this whole phenomenon.
[03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:08.240]  He looked at it as like an anthropological phenomenon that was from the south and Christianity, whatever.
[03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:14.240]  He could look at it from a distance, arm's length, and he could say, yeah, that's kind of interesting,
[03:48:14.240 --> 03:48:19.240]  but I'm not going to get involved. It doesn't make it not real, whether or not he appreciates it or not.
[03:48:19.240 --> 03:48:27.240]  And whether or not Michael Moore appreciates what's going on, he can look at this anthropological phenomenon.
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:35.240]  And he does understand the anger that people have. And so let's play this for you because what he has to say here is very eloquent,
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:40.240]  even though he wants to try to use this ultimately against Trump. Let's play what he has to say.
[03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:51.240]  Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor Executives and said,
[03:48:51.240 --> 03:48:57.240]  if you close these factories as you're planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico,
[03:48:57.240 --> 03:49:04.240]  I'm going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody's going to buy them.
[03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:14.240]  It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat had ever said anything like that to these executives.
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:25.240]  It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the Brexit states.
[03:49:25.240 --> 03:49:29.240]  That's right. We live here in Ohio. You know what I'm talking about.
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:36.240]  Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things to people who are hurting.
[03:49:36.240 --> 03:49:45.240]  And it's why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump.
[03:49:45.240 --> 03:49:51.240]  He is the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for.
[03:49:51.240 --> 03:49:57.240]  The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.
[03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:06.240]  And on November 8 election day, although they've lost their jobs, although they've been foreclosed down by the bank,
[03:50:06.240 --> 03:50:13.240]  next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The cars have been repowed. They haven't had a real vacation in years.
[03:50:13.240 --> 03:50:19.240]  They're stuck with the Obamacare bronze plan where you can't even get a percusset.
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:28.240]  They've essentially lost everything they had except one thing.
[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:38.240]  The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution, the right to vote.
[03:50:38.240 --> 03:50:41.240]  They might be penniless. They might be homeless.
[03:50:41.240 --> 03:50:45.240]  That's right. We're going to play the rest of that when we come back. Let's play the rest of that when we come back.
[03:50:45.240 --> 03:50:52.240]  We have one thing left. You look at these tens of thousands of people who show up at the Trump rallies.
[03:50:52.240 --> 03:50:58.240]  These people who show up for Hillary Clinton with their little million dollar soirees.
[03:50:58.240 --> 03:51:01.240]  We've got more people on our side. We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.240 --> 03:51:08.240]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol or irregular heartbeat?
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:12.240]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:12.240 --> 03:51:18.240]  You hear the ads all the time. If this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[03:51:18.240 --> 03:51:21.240]  That's easy. Doctors are not trained in natural medicine.
[03:51:21.240 --> 03:51:28.240]  Extendivite heart tonic does want you to be as healthy as you can be. And it really works.
[03:51:28.240 --> 03:51:34.240]  Take Extendivite for six months and your doctor will say, I don't know what you're doing, but don't stop. It's working for you.

[03:52:00.240 --> 03:52:03.240]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:07.240]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:52:07.240 --> 03:52:13.240]  Something's wrong and we all know it. I'm Charlie Daniels and I'm here to tell you about it.
[03:52:13.240 --> 03:52:18.240]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:52:18.240 --> 03:52:24.240]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:30.240]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.

[03:54:09.240 --> 03:54:16.240]  I'm David Knight and I want to finish this Michael Moore clip that he's using to promote his movie, Trump Land.
[03:54:16.240 --> 03:54:20.240]  Donald Trump Jr. tweeted out. He says, I probably don't agree with him a lot,
[03:54:20.240 --> 03:54:24.240]  but Michael Moore gets this one right 100% and retweet it.
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:28.240]  And I think that's right. I think people should hear this clip that Michael Moore has.
[03:54:28.240 --> 03:54:34.240]  I have to understand that Michael Moore is too tribal. Let's just put it that way.
[03:54:34.240 --> 03:54:40.240]  He's too tribal to ever vote for anybody that has a Republican label or that comes out as an independent.
[03:54:40.240 --> 03:54:44.240]  He is the Democrat tribe first, last and always.
[03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:48.240]  He doesn't care if these people destroy our lives and sell us down the river.
[03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:51.240]  He doesn't care if Hillary Clinton is hopelessly corrupt.
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:56.240]  He laughs at it and he goes, hey, Trump Jr. in the right wing thinks my movie called Trump Land is pro-Trump.
[03:54:56.240 --> 03:54:58.240]  Please don't tell them otherwise.
[03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:01.240]  Yeah, they got about 8 million views on this thing.
[03:55:01.240 --> 03:55:07.240]  And it should have a lot of views because what he says in this four-minute clip is exactly true.
[03:55:07.240 --> 03:55:09.240]  I want to play the rest of this before we run out of time.
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:12.240]  Let's pick it up about halfway through. Let's go ahead.
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:22.240]  There's one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution, the right to vote.
[03:55:22.240 --> 03:55:32.240]  They might be penniless. They might be homeless. They might be over and it doesn't matter because it's equalized on that day.
[03:55:32.240 --> 03:55:37.240]  A millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job.
[03:55:37.240 --> 03:55:43.240]  There's one. And there's more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class.
[03:55:43.240 --> 03:55:47.240]  And there's a lot more Trump supporters who will win if they don't steal the election. That's right.
[03:55:47.240 --> 03:55:56.240]  The dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen,
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:56:09.240]  and put a big f***ing X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives.
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:19.240]  Donald J. Trump. They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:31.240]  Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump after they loved him and created him.
[03:56:31.240 --> 03:56:39.240]  And now hate him. Thank you, media. The enemy of my enemy is who I'm voting for on November 8th.
[03:56:39.240 --> 03:56:59.240]  Yes, on November 8th, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow, all the blows get to go and blow up the whole f***ing system because it's your right.
[03:56:59.240 --> 03:57:08.240]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest f*** you ever recorded in human history.
[03:57:08.240 --> 03:57:12.240]  And it will feel good.
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:20.240]  It will feel real good. I'm going to so enjoy pushing that button or lever or whatever I've got.
[03:57:20.240 --> 03:57:25.240]  You know, he talks about all these Joe blows going to blow the system up. You know, it's really the Jodes.
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:32.240]  I mean, go back to the grapes of wrath, right? All these people who were in the Depression were fleeing because of the Dust Bowl.
[03:57:32.240 --> 03:57:40.240]  The Dust Bowl was a natural disaster. The Rust Bowl, however, which is where he began, the shutting down of our industry in Detroit and other places.
[03:57:40.240 --> 03:57:49.240]  The Rust Bowl, that is a man-made crisis. It's a manufactured crisis, manufactured by all these people he just talked about.
[03:57:49.240 --> 03:57:57.240]  Wall Street, the media, the professional politicians and on and on. We know precisely who did it. We know precisely why they did it.
[03:57:57.240 --> 03:58:03.240]  We know where they're going with this. And so does Donald Trump. And so it isn't just an FU to the establishment.
[03:58:03.240 --> 03:58:07.240]  It's a way we're going to change the direction of this country.
[03:58:07.240 --> 03:58:33.240]  Join us tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News, 7th Central, 8pm Eastern. I'm David Knight.
[03:58:37.240 --> 03:58:39.240] .
