[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:36.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.880 --> 00:44.400]  info wars because there's a war on for your mind it just hit me sitting here
[00:44.400 --> 00:51.240]  seconds before I went live surveying the giant stack of huge NSA Big Brother
[00:51.240 --> 01:00.040]  news not just here but worldwide that there is a giant absolutely giant
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.200]  awakening to the fact that we have a predatory global corporate anti-free
[01:05.200 --> 01:11.160]  market system manipulating our society and civilization through the media
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.440]  through the culture and attempting to really create an artificial environment
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.440]  to fully envelop and capture humanity from an unescapable prison that's
[01:22.440 --> 01:26.240]  basically how the globalists describe their technocracy if they complete it
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.600]  and we're already pretty far down the rat hole as folks begin to discover it and
[01:31.600 --> 01:37.880]  we've reached that critical that critical point where humanity's kind of waking up
[01:37.880 --> 01:42.480]  to it but of a give America and the rest of the world discovers this but then
[01:42.480 --> 01:48.120]  lays down and doesn't remove the system it will then submit itself and roll out
[01:48.120 --> 01:56.560]  with the next phases of oppression just like Obama is engaging in 100% total
[01:56.560 --> 02:03.320]  classic oppression and becoming a dictator I saw Obama on the news last
[02:03.320 --> 02:07.600]  night I turned the television on because I couldn't sleep at about midnight and
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.080]  just turned it right back off but it was Obama saying fact I forgot to tell you
[02:12.080 --> 02:16.120]  guys to look for this McBrain saw it too he's telling me about this morning he
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.320]  said listen it's a conspiracy by Republicans that we ever targeted the
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.880]  Tea Party or anybody with the IRS that came out in Congress tens of thousands
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.240]  of audits, harassments, indictments, FBI, you name it, of libertarians,
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.080]  conservatives, gun groups, pro-life groups, Tea Party groups, Army manuals,
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.280]  demonizing them, I mean it's all out there and that the IRS got caught lying
[02:39.280 --> 02:43.560]  about it and then now we learn the FBI blocked investigations of it and that
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.720]  not one communist progressive authoritarian group calling themselves
[02:48.720 --> 02:52.600]  liberal got audited they were all given their tax exempt status and were not
[02:52.600 --> 02:59.000]  investigated not one and that's on record he gets up there and says listen
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.320]  you're gonna keep your plan and the price is gonna go down and you can keep
[03:03.320 --> 03:06.640]  your guns all of them we're not coming after any of them it's a lie I'm not
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.960]  gonna hire one lobbyist and I'm a peace prize winner so everything's fine on and
[03:12.960 --> 03:16.160]  on and on and then he said oh we're not funding al Qaeda in Libya and Syria now
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.640]  it's all admitted I mean this is such incredible lying that it just becomes
[03:21.640 --> 03:25.160]  bizarre a world and you realize they're psychologically doing this on purpose
[03:25.160 --> 03:30.280]  just to totally break us where he stays in office he gets away with everything
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.960]  and then that's just the way it is people think just because all this is
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.480]  coming out that it's a total victory no it's not a victory if we don't push it
[03:38.480 --> 03:41.960]  all the way through and bring them to justice if they can just flaunt the law
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.960]  and just run around in front of everyone doing whatever they want that is their
[03:46.960 --> 03:52.000]  revolution against due process their revolution against checks and balances
[03:52.000 --> 04:02.000]  their revolution against freedom and equality because there is no equality
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.920]  when they've got all these laws that are unconstitutional they throw it us and

[04:09.400 --> 04:15.120]  all the common sense nakedly just running around engaging and inventing new
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.000]  forms of corruption so big so huge I mean really it's been said many times by
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.280]  many a famous crook that if you're going to steal steal big is the systems
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.880]  geared to bust little crooks but if you steal a billion dollars or a hundred

[14:16.640 --> 14:23.940]  media it's just one has to marvel at how pathetic they are and how they
[14:23.940 --> 14:30.200]  all fawn over each other and report 20 year old 15 year old data that the
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.960]  alternative media broke decades ago as if they are reporters they are idiots
[14:34.960 --> 14:41.040]  take USA today three weeks after info wars comm and story leak comm broke it

[14:50.680 --> 14:54.600]  that won't really be turned off that's a military operation to lie to the enemy
[14:54.600 --> 14:57.480]  where the enemy that turned out they didn't turn anything off they're not
[14:57.480 --> 14:59.880]  going to turn fluoride off in the water and all the other stuff they put in
[14:59.880 --> 15:03.000]  they're not turning the GMO off and they're not turning off the murder of
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.480]  you and your family you can be absolutely assured of that and all you
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.320]  cowards that work for the system have got to do is go research everything I'm
[15:11.320 --> 15:14.440]  saying and find out it's true and you'll still give your kid fluoride and still
[15:14.440 --> 15:18.320]  give them vaccines and still do everything because you are cowards and
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.000]  you cannot admit you're under attack you want to imagine you're on the winning
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.240]  team I know a lot of people in the system are awake and don't know what to do
[15:28.240 --> 15:32.000]  quite frankly I don't have all the answers either I mean we are facing
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.400]  something bizarre I'm sorry I just get one article and stop them let me just
[15:35.400 --> 15:42.440]  keep giving you headlines here let me just keep giving you headlines here so
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.920]  Rockefeller attaches cyber security bill to national defense authorization act
[15:46.920 --> 15:50.640]  guys will you pull up senator Rockefeller says we'd be better off without
[15:50.640 --> 15:54.240]  the internet that's on YouTube I want to play that clip later this is the guy
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.680]  that said we'd be better off with ever out having the internet yeah the DARPA
[15:58.680 --> 16:02.480]  boys had you design it to totally control and surveil but we're using it
[16:02.480 --> 16:08.720]  right back at you because any tool can be used back and oh you kind of figured
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.240]  out the algorithms that we're going to absolutely smash you because of the
[16:12.240 --> 16:17.600]  instinctive life force of humanity the more the more you attack us and we've
[16:17.600 --> 16:20.720]  been down for a while the more it's going to boom and ring back on you when
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.400]  we finally bounce up your only way to win long term is to release the bio
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.720]  weapon now and kill everybody except a few thousand of you and you know that's
[16:29.720 --> 16:33.400]  not going to work because you've done the breakdown that your own minions
[16:33.400 --> 16:38.400]  before they die will take you out and of course that's the key if they release
[16:38.400 --> 16:41.640]  the plagues they've got designed a whole bunch of them that kill almost
[16:41.640 --> 16:47.680]  everybody 99% conservatively recombinant mouse plagues for homo sapiens sapien
[16:47.680 --> 16:54.440]  homo sapien tyrannous will not escape homo sapien sapien in the death rows you
[16:54.440 --> 17:00.840]  will be taken out so I would suggest you back off right now because everybody in
[17:00.840 --> 17:04.200]  the establishment will still kind of halfway listen now and go listen right
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.440]  about everything else maybe we should look into this look you'll believe it if
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.600]  they release it so just remember this transmission then and then you know what
[17:11.600 --> 17:14.680]  you've got to do it some would say that's terrorism that if the global
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.720]  issue genesis release bio weapons and are killing everyone killing billions
[17:18.720 --> 17:22.120]  that we have no right to fight back and you're actually right I'm politically
[17:22.120 --> 17:27.840]  correct you should when you're dying in the CIA FBI federal agencies banks the
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.040]  establishment the universities when you and your family are dying you shouldn't
[17:32.040 --> 17:35.960]  try to do anything against those that did it because they'll have some made up
[17:35.960 --> 17:39.360]  story of why it's happening even though two weeks before they'll all disappear
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.480]  to bunkers and ships and so you should take your children out in front of the

[18:10.160 --> 18:14.160]  time and speak to them because they're the ones that built this sophisticated
[18:14.160 --> 18:17.880]  system doesn't that prove that they are allowed to do this to us you didn't
[18:17.880 --> 18:22.880]  build anything you sat there using the intelligence of the native humans and
[18:22.880 --> 18:27.600]  then by trial and error having good free humans with with the spirit of
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.920]  creation and then build things believing it was for one thing so you would then
[18:31.920 --> 18:38.520]  put it together like a Lego set to build your larger design and we've now
[18:38.520 --> 18:42.280]  reverse engineered it did you not think the spirit of humanity that took us as
[18:42.280 --> 18:46.680]  far the survival instinct in all of us would to start emerging and analyzing

[25:38.920 --> 25:45.840]  last album all right ladies and gentlemen getting into the news continuing
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.440]  here let me give you some more headlines Reagan advisor market valuation has
[25:50.440 --> 25:56.480]  lost every anchor to the real world that's from zero hedge and we're going
[25:56.480 --> 26:01.720]  to be playing that clip coming up the current malaise of news data and spin
[26:01.720 --> 26:09.440]  is meaningless David Stockman tells Bloomberg's Tom Keane adding that
[26:09.440 --> 26:14.600]  markets are exhibiting the kind of speculative froth you get at the top of
[26:14.600 --> 26:20.560]  a cycle where valuation loses any anchor to the real world from earnings or the
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.160]  prospects of the economy and they go on in the clip we're going to play an
[26:24.160 --> 26:31.200]  analyze they go on in the clip that's up on infowars.com and actually admit well
[26:31.200 --> 26:37.000]  it's totally rigged but the Federal Reserve sets the parameters for the
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.840]  stock market to then have this false reality but the stock markets dominated
[26:41.840 --> 26:48.320]  and predominantly owned and steered by the big five or six megabanks who are
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.960]  the private shareholders in the management group of the Federal Reserve
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.920]  that's private but quasi-governmental and which Greenspan famously said is
[26:57.920 --> 27:02.840]  above the law and Congress cannot affect even though Congress has the power of
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.760]  the purse and created the Federal Reserve so they're just telling you the
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.680]  Federal Reserve's dictatorial the president is dictatorial but Congress it
[27:09.680 --> 27:13.520]  doesn't have any authority and the individual has no authority even though
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.240]  the individual in America is at the top of the pyramid now granted they've done
[27:19.240 --> 27:24.040]  the individual down so that the individual is a laughable quantity on
[27:24.040 --> 27:27.720]  average but you can rehabilitate rehabilitate the average individual very
[27:27.720 --> 27:35.080]  quickly once you can shake them out of the daydream spell of mind control and
[27:35.080 --> 27:40.560]  low brainwaves low consciousness on record that the general public's under
[27:40.560 --> 27:45.600]  that's induced by dinosaur television by establishment state-run media that is
[27:45.600 --> 27:51.520]  all designed and timed to be vapid and moronic and stimulate lower areas of the
[27:51.520 --> 27:57.320]  thought processes to make you a bestial creature instead of reaching for the
[27:57.320 --> 28:04.920]  stars they have you staring down into the amoeba infested swamp lands so there
[28:04.920 --> 28:11.240]  it is speculative froth that you get at the top of a cycle and of course when
[28:11.240 --> 28:14.760]  they plunge this cycle again like I did five years ago but it'll be five six
[28:14.760 --> 28:17.240]  times worse I predict when it finally goes down it could be a month from now
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.760]  could be a year from now probably gonna be the middle of next year we're already
[28:20.760 --> 28:26.720]  in a depression recession depending on where you are regionally globally but
[28:26.720 --> 28:30.120]  that's why they're getting all the armored vehicles and storeable food ready
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.240]  and the rich are fleeing the you know rural areas around the planet with
[28:34.240 --> 28:39.840]  armored redoubts private security firms escape choppers you know copters on the
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.640]  roof I mean this is what they're all doing because they have created such an
[28:43.640 --> 28:49.760]  unstable fraud where you have unreality in sectors they control and then we
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.680]  living out in the real reality bombard of all their fake statistics all the
[28:53.680 --> 28:59.400]  rest of it have to live under their their their apartheid system of the new
[28:59.400 --> 29:06.480]  world order being above the law being exempt having diplomatic immunity think
[29:06.480 --> 29:09.520]  about how that's the ultimate form of discrimination where if you're a

[34:47.080 --> 34:54.120]  this club and said at a speech that the IRS never targeted anybody that's never
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.800]  targeted the team or that's just a lie that matter it's admitted in Congress
[34:57.800 --> 35:01.680]  they've been caught perjuring themselves in testimony the head of that
[35:01.680 --> 35:05.760]  division it doesn't matter she got a golden parachute and just retired on

[35:47.640 --> 35:53.840]  party and it's time for the Democrats to try to bring back old-fashioned
[35:53.840 --> 35:59.720]  Democrats like we saw in you know Thomas Jefferson's days or whatever we do
[35:59.720 --> 36:05.160]  not want people in there that are hardcore fascist using socialism as a
[36:05.160 --> 36:08.720]  tool of social control but exempting themselves from all the rules and
[36:08.720 --> 36:14.800]  setting up fascism on top of it to extract and literally mine the culture
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.640]  as Dylan Radigan said and then got shown the door and his contract not
[36:19.640 --> 36:24.840]  renewed even though he had the highest ratings in the morning or daytime see it
[36:24.840 --> 36:29.280]  isn't about ratings folks in controlled media it's about pushing the party line
[36:29.280 --> 36:34.560]  because at the top it's a rigged economy this is not capitalism and then they
[36:34.560 --> 36:38.760]  demonize what's left of capitalism that still makes us one of the most
[36:38.760 --> 36:42.120]  profitable prosperous countries compared to the rest of the world that's
[36:42.120 --> 36:48.960]  already fallen to tyranny they then demonize that our life raft as the
[36:48.960 --> 36:53.280]  reason that we're in the situation we're in and they they used England as the
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.640]  model to pass Obamacare when Obamacare is not even the same thing it's even
[36:58.640 --> 37:03.160]  worse and England has one of the worst social health care systems in the world
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.160]  on record I actually watch parliamentary debate actually read British
[37:07.160 --> 37:13.280]  newspapers and UK newspapers I actually have people that I know that live there
[37:13.280 --> 37:22.720]  I've been there many times I'm informed I know how hellish it is I mean they're
[37:22.720 --> 37:26.480]  there to kill you they're there if you've got a pneumonia to not give you
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.040]  treatment for a month and then you die by the way this is not really on the news
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.240]  every time there's some fake flu like H1N1 that's really weak and then they've
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.160]  got something in a special vaccine they want to get into your body bunch of
[37:38.160 --> 37:43.640]  different microplasms they hype it up but when it's a real killer viral flu or
[37:43.640 --> 37:51.160]  killer viral pneumonia you will not hear about it I know personally two young
[37:51.160 --> 38:01.560]  people 135 134 and then Rob do has one of his best friends is one of his wife's
[38:01.560 --> 38:09.440]  best friends in New Jersey 34 died of viral pneumonia boom and asleep just a
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.560]  few days ago and let me tell you it's weaponized ladies and gentlemen and
[38:14.560 --> 38:19.320]  there's no vaccine for it in fact the big Canadian government study that came
[38:19.320 --> 38:24.520]  out three years ago admitted the H1N1 vaccine doubles your chances of getting
[38:24.520 --> 38:31.120]  the regular flu the next year and other other diseases other pathogens other
[38:31.120 --> 38:36.600]  airborne bacteria viruses because it destroys your immune system it annihilates
[38:36.600 --> 38:42.040]  your immune system and I'm not against Western medicine I'm against the
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.360]  corruption of it with a eugenics Trojan horse within it let's get that
[38:46.360 --> 38:52.320]  straight what's your against vaccination it's I'm against big pharma known to run
[38:52.320 --> 38:57.080]  secret testing in Germany England and the United States Mexico Japan you name
[38:57.080 --> 39:03.480]  it all the same big companies in the 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s 2000s
[39:03.480 --> 39:09.000]  right through now it came out they did lethal testing in Huntsville prisons in
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  East Texas that killed people including jail guards in the 80s and 90s I mean
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.840]  that's just one example that's been in the Houston Chronicle and the only time
[39:18.840 --> 39:21.600]  they would stop it was when they would get spread into the town and kill a
[39:21.600 --> 39:24.800]  bunch of jail guards families I mean ladies and gentlemen they're doing all
[39:24.800 --> 39:29.200]  sorts of stuff they are pharmaceuticals I only use this because it's a well-known
[39:29.200 --> 39:35.640]  example for 11 years knowingly shipped out factor 8 hemophiliacs that they knew
[39:35.640 --> 39:41.440]  had HIV and three forms of hepatitis in it a death sentence guaranteed you're
[39:41.440 --> 39:47.680]  getting HIV guaranteed you're getting hepatitis and the documents came out in
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.040]  the French courts nobody else went after them where the executives were
[39:52.040 --> 39:59.400]  saying in the meetings well there are too many of these hemophiliacs and I'm
[39:59.400 --> 40:05.080]  supposed to take my kids to the doctor with big pharma all of them Eli Lilly
[40:05.080 --> 40:11.920]  Merck all of them bear me Nazi companies folks and I'm spoke beyond Nazis
[40:11.920 --> 40:18.880]  proto Nazis and I'm supposed to go to them and trust them and roll my sleeve up
[40:18.880 --> 40:25.400]  when it turned out the H1N1 did have a quote virus tracker in it and that they'd
[40:25.400 --> 40:30.920]  actually put it out as a viral simulant the year before in vaccines and that
[40:30.920 --> 40:33.800]  came out in the literature and no one even and I don't even understand it it's
[40:33.800 --> 40:38.480]  unsophisticated but I mean they're doing some really sick stuff with us okay you
[40:38.480 --> 40:40.640]  don't just think they're putting fluoride in the water you don't just
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.800]  think they're feeding us GMO to dumb us down and hurt us on record now there it
[40:45.800 --> 40:52.120]  is there's the article Mercola comm bear sells AIDS infected drug banned in US
[40:52.120 --> 40:59.760]  and in Europe Asia and it says recently on earth that was back in 2006 well yeah
[40:59.760 --> 41:02.800]  Bill Clinton was one of the main suppliers of the blood they just kept
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.800]  selling it after it was banned here they would sell drugs in the Arkansas state
[41:06.800 --> 41:11.120]  prisons and it was like vampires they would let people give blood every
[41:11.120 --> 41:14.120]  couple days till they would actually shrivel up and die actually had the
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.160]  doctor that was working in the prison who went public they fire bombed his
[41:17.160 --> 41:20.840]  private practice offices and they would have all these drug addicts and they're
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.800]  giving blood every couple days until they died for the drugs and then they
[41:24.800 --> 41:29.000]  would fence the blood knowing it had HIV that's they were looking for to a
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.840]  Canadian company that also got attacked the hemophiliac a society exposed and
[41:33.840 --> 41:40.280]  got attacked and they would ship it up there to Canada and say it was Canadian
[41:40.280 --> 41:45.840]  certified red cross blood and then ship it out because it was key to get the
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.280]  infected blood and then mix it in the larger batches to then be rendered down
[41:50.280 --> 41:57.560]  to the platelets and the loving factor a so was a loving gift on record
[41:57.560 --> 42:03.520]  premeditatedly for the children well I'm a Democrat I'm the first black
[42:03.520 --> 42:12.360]  president doesn't that make it okay there are too many hemophiliacs aren't
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.120]  there I mean that's why I've gotten a little warped and a little sick about
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.560]  all this because I what I'm telling you is one one ten thousandth of rule of
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.280]  what I know on record and if you're a radio listener we're putting articles
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.720]  on screen as I say this it's not even preplanned they're searching whatever I
[42:30.720 --> 42:37.320]  say and pulling it up exactly what I told you they want you dead can you get
[42:37.320 --> 42:44.120]  that through your coconut brain can you get it through your walnut brain can
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.840]  you get it through your Easter Bunny brain I don't know what brains people
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.360]  have got out there do you have do you have any gray matter up there because
[42:53.360 --> 42:59.120]  our government with the British government created linen and Stalin and
[42:59.120 --> 43:04.880]  Hitler didn't say they ran them they created them on record that came out
[43:04.880 --> 43:08.600]  in congressional testimony I'll go to your calls some of the other news big
[43:08.600 --> 43:15.200]  news I've got here Christians are being burned alive beheaded crucified
[43:15.200 --> 43:23.600]  tortured to death and imprisoned to die in small containers all over central
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.480]  Africa all over the Middle East and all funded by Saudi Arabia and our
[43:28.480 --> 43:33.000]  disgusting murderous criminal hijacked government and that article of the new
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.240]  Americans up on info wars calm we have a bound piece on that that I want to queue
[43:37.240 --> 43:42.040]  up because we're going to play that in a moment but here's the article actually
[43:42.040 --> 43:47.000]  out of the Washington Times lawmakers see false narrative of Obama as a
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.360]  terrorist fighter folks Republicans you have been supporting these fake wars
[43:52.360 --> 43:55.800]  al-Qaeda and Libyan Syria now some of the junior Republicans tea party
[43:55.800 --> 44:00.040]  Republicans are waking up we've put out the talking point which is a fact for
[44:00.040 --> 44:04.280]  four years about Libya three years about Syria it's come out I mean there's
[44:04.280 --> 44:07.720]  videos and photos every day the main armies where al-Qaeda uniforms fly all
[44:07.720 --> 44:11.320]  kind of flags they even have a flags that aren't even al-Qaeda they call
[44:11.320 --> 44:16.200]  themselves like basically super al-Qaeda they call themselves Osama bin Laden al-Qaeda
[44:16.200 --> 44:21.760]  in fact I'm on info wars calm right now if you guys punch up my screen I can
[44:21.760 --> 44:25.960]  actually show them I've studied this before I'm going for me I believe that
[44:25.960 --> 44:31.320]  is actually an al-Qaeda brigade al-Qaeda flag a bin Laden brigade al-Qaeda flag but
[44:31.320 --> 44:34.120]  you can type those into the search engine and pull them up and look and then
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.320]  just watch the news even seeing it'll go the valiant fighters and it'll show them
[44:38.320 --> 44:42.320]  with the flags knowing the average person doesn't know even one of the
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.160]  American flag is pretty much or a state flag much less an al-Qaeda flag and I'm
[44:47.160 --> 44:53.920]  looking at al-Qaeda bin Laden brigade number seven or number 14 and videos of
[44:53.920 --> 44:58.400]  them throwing little kids off five-story buildings and blowing up churches and I
[44:58.400 --> 45:06.320]  mean it's just incredible so many of them and the good news is at least some of
[45:06.320 --> 45:10.000]  this is now coming out but that's why I'm so angry at the TSA because I know
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.680]  they're a federal rollout to condition us for martial law and I know it has
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.240]  nothing to do with fighting al-Qaeda and I'm just like man let me fly where I
[45:19.240 --> 45:24.560]  want this is internal currency capital controls you're being set up to roll out
[45:24.560 --> 45:27.840]  martial law and to keep people from leaving the country during a collapse
[45:27.840 --> 45:33.320]  and that's now all admitted now so let's just be honest what this is all about
[45:33.320 --> 45:37.360]  let's be honest with all of it's about the military trains to take on the tea
[45:37.360 --> 45:42.760]  party they don't train to fight al-Qaeda now and by the way let me clear I don't
[45:42.760 --> 45:47.280]  say al-Qaeda works for the western governments it is created steered and
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.640]  funded like a Frankenstein they turn loose to scare the village into
[45:51.640 --> 45:58.520]  submission do you got that they drive up they got a wind-up toy monster they let
[45:58.520 --> 46:01.920]  it go down the street and then they'll blow it up later if they want because they
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.640]  got a whole factory of them that's what the Abu Ghraib and all these things are
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.760]  are factories to create real al-Qaeda and to recruit double agents I mean it's
[46:11.760 --> 46:16.760]  just sick in fact it's come out that it can't x-ray at Guantanamo they have
[46:16.760 --> 46:22.720]  like army psychiatrists at the CIA part of the base blamely Virginia will be
[46:22.720 --> 46:26.240]  watching this video because this is not public and I'm about to tell you some of
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.400]  it came out but we I confirmed they come in and tell them we're actually Muslim
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.000]  and Obama's actually a Muslim and we want you brother to go infiltrate and
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.040]  take over and then they go here's a message from your other leader two
[46:37.040 --> 46:41.440]  years ago who left see he's doing well now fighting jihad and they actually then
[46:41.440 --> 46:45.200]  go thank you we're gonna bring down the infidel and then these these mind
[46:45.200 --> 46:48.880]  controlled nutballs because they're culturally mind-controlled perfect for
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.400]  the globalist are then sent out to do I mean it's so sophisticated ladies and
[46:52.400 --> 47:00.640]  gentlemen it's so sophisticated and they get them addicted to high-tech
[47:00.640 --> 47:04.320]  synthetic drugs and stuff they got different ways of breaking them and
[47:04.320 --> 47:09.120]  and that's not that's just one of the black sites the camp x-ray has a sub
[47:09.120 --> 47:13.280]  CIA base in it you can look that up that's confirmed they've got hundreds not
[47:13.280 --> 47:17.360]  30 plus you know it Romanian horse ranches and you know
[47:17.360 --> 47:22.560]  under shopping centers and just the literal laboratories doing hellish stuff
[47:22.560 --> 47:27.120]  because I want to explain this to you they like torturing people
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.760]  this is where you can legally it's not really legal but they say it's legal
[47:31.760 --> 47:38.160]  do unspeakable things including torture people's children in front of them
[47:38.640 --> 47:44.080]  and it's all this yuppie scum folks to really get off on they're doing this
[47:44.080 --> 47:48.640]  for America and and and but really they just like to torture people
[47:48.640 --> 47:52.400]  and and they're coming for us you need to understand that they are coming
[47:52.400 --> 47:57.520]  for everybody but we've blown your cover we've we've exposed you and most
[47:57.520 --> 48:00.400]  people in the government by the way CIA FBI
[48:00.400 --> 48:03.520]  military you name it hates you and now know it's all true
[48:03.520 --> 48:06.800]  their compartmentalization is blown they know the truth you're in deep trouble
[48:06.800 --> 48:09.520]  we're going to go to break and come back with calls but here's john bound's
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.240]  report on christians being burned alive beheaded crucified tortured to death

[48:17.920 --> 48:21.920]  jihad al-qaeda brigade forces here it is the mainstream media
[48:21.920 --> 48:27.440]  and our elected corporatized politicians are completely ignoring a worldwide
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.640]  phenomenon the growing numbers of murders and incarceration
[48:32.640 --> 48:38.560]  of christians worldwide a taxi driver was beheaded by islamists in Egypt because

[49:36.720 --> 49:40.000]  anti-abortion activists were a radical terror threat
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.920]  and that anyone found to be supporting these groups would be subject to
[49:43.920 --> 49:48.480]  discipline under the uniform code of military justice
[49:48.480 --> 49:53.360]  from a speech given by john adams to the military in 1798
[49:53.360 --> 49:56.960]  our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people
[49:56.960 --> 50:00.160]  it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.400]  due to the interest of time i've barely scratched the surface of atrocities
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.960]  endured by christians globally for info wars dot com
[50:08.960 --> 50:13.120]  john bound reporting that's right millions of christians have been killed

[50:56.400 --> 51:00.560]  and humanity's awakening stay with us
[51:00.560 --> 51:05.120]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.400]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.280]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is an halogen family
[51:13.280 --> 51:18.240]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government
[51:18.240 --> 51:23.520]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[51:23.520 --> 51:28.720]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[51:28.720 --> 51:32.560]  a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[51:32.560 --> 51:36.240]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[56:47.040 --> 56:50.640]  it isn't hype this is incredibly good coffee uh yeah folks
[56:50.640 --> 56:54.960]  i could have come up with coffee years ago and i got approached by a bunch of
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.000]  companies
[56:58.080 --> 57:01.200]  to do it because everybody you know does their own brand of coffee and i said no
[57:01.200 --> 57:04.000]  this all tastes like crud i said how about this stuff i like
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.520]  that comes from southern mexico it took me two years to finally get a

[57:12.960 --> 57:18.240]  and you know it's not hype if it's true it's it's no brag just fact
[57:18.240 --> 57:22.160]  as a famous western actor said i forget his name the point is is that
[57:22.160 --> 57:25.520]  it may not be your favorite it's my favorite everybody that tries it goes

[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.800]  135.8 below zero that of course is the global warming
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.000]  we told you a few years ago the sun started dimming
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  which it does it goes through cycles and we says it's going to get cold
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.680]  i'm not a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon of course all the
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.840]  scientists said that's what would happen if we weren't on the payroll the

[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.480]  uh so uh coldest temperature ever recorded on the planet earth by the way
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.880]  so uh there you go uh that means we're warming though when you
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.560]  okay let's talk to uh cori in north carolina
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.160]  you're on the air my friend hey alex uh first-time caller but a sort of
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.800]  long-time listener i've been listening since 2008 i met you at bill de berg
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:55.440]  in 2012 and i entered the uh paul revere contest uh this year well done lord
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.560]  veda yeah thank you all you actually got me active
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.640]  when i saw your report on fluoride and i felt like that was
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.800]  kind of the easiest way to take action locally
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.760]  um and then personally i i really experienced um
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.000]  uh i i guess you call it an expansion of awareness after i stopped drinking the
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.560]  fluoride and it kind of helps you see how we have been uh
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.560]  mind-controlled and and um manipulated with
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.040]  the uh just a system at large i mean i know that's kind of broad but
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.800]  well i mean sodium fluoride and its other fluorine derivatives are a hardcore
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.040]  drug but the main ingredient and the whole
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.920]  serotonin reuptake inhibitor family on record and it's an accelerant a
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.560]  stimulant a adjuvant is the proper word a turbo charger for all the other
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.200]  chemicals they're adding to the food and water and yes you get high getting off
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.040]  fluoride because you're meant to be high on life and then you add real nascent
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.720]  iodine to it oh let me tell you it is
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.680]  absolutely i want to drink and stuff just so i'm not so high on life but i've
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.920]  not been doing that so i'm really high on life
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.240]  i mean that's why we dumb ourselves down because being clean
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.920]  being clear-headed is the ultimate high sorry go ahead
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.600]  you're right and i got i got like five or six bottles of nascent iodine i know
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.760]  i would agree with that statement but but the reason i'm calling is because
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.360]  you know being high on life you you you know you
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:31.840]  you realize how far down the rabbit hole we really are and
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.720]  you've had a couple callers in the last week
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.320]  call in about the corporate fiction that
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.120]  you know we are sort of signed into when we're born
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.720]  and i know you like to talk about solutions and i wanted to get your
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.520]  opinion on on this as a solution which is
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.520]  you know i don't have any kids yet but i i will at some point
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.720]  you know i think we the only way we can take this country back is
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.360]  is if we start at the family and go up what do you think about
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.360]  um just kind of like in the movie the matrix like the matrix
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.680]  two tanks said you know that there was people born in xion without the plugs
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.600]  in their head they're they're sort of the only natural born
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.040]  people anymore what about having kids and just
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.960]  having them completely out of the system out of social security out of
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.800]  birth certificates or the corporate i think if you if you're in an area where
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.840]  you have rural support networks and you can do that
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.600]  or you can even do that in major cities then i think that's the way to go
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.960]  but you also need to teach them about the system so they have street smarts
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.120]  and are aware of it or they'll end up rebelling and running to the matrix
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.760]  so i think you should show them the matrix but absolutely what we really need
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.080]  is people like morpheus and that's who all of you are to go out there and
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.480]  reach out to the neos because all of us together are neo
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.760]  when we break with the system they want us to all be agent smith
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.080]  copies and we don't want that a little over a year ago
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.480]  i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good size meal
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.240]  that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.160]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.240]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need

[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.120]  we have a very special guest on dealing with the missing nuclear weapons
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.800]  from dais air force base a few months ago that we broke
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.080]  so that guest will be joining us to give us his intel on what's happening
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.120]  the last 30 minutes we're going to your phone calls here in just a moment then
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.440]  i'm going to get into all the news we haven't covered
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.040]  that we didn't get to in the first hour there is a lot of it on the economy on
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.800]  what's happening militarily between china japan south korea forced in
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.920]  oculations in new york is totally unconstitutional
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.080]  we're going to be looking at all that but first off last night
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.880]  um i i couldn't sleep and i i got up and got a drink of water turned the
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:12.000]  television on and i was looking through news channels and i saw
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.840]  obama i guess he'd just been on the hardball
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.840]  with slime matthews and he was saying hey you know we have a
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.080]  Cincinnati office it was just streamlining who can be
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.640]  tax exempt and who can't be new ones but also old ones and
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.000]  you know none of this was political and there was no persecution it's made up by
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  by republicans now he had said earlier in the year
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.880]  we're going to play that clip in a moment that indeed he saw the reports that
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.840]  was wrong and then lowest learner the head of that
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.080]  division i think number three in the irs she got caught lying before congress
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.320]  but also took the fifth but then went on and lied
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.200]  the fifth just means you don't talk doesn't mean that under oath you don't
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.440]  then say i take the fifth covering being able to lie
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.440]  and other sub commissioners and we have those articles we can pull up
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.440]  have admitted that they were told to target
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.320]  conservative groups libertarian groups second amendment groups
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.080]  pro-life groups there's a headline irs auditor reaffirms the conservatives
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.640]  not liberals were targeted iris inspector general said this week
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.240]  that while some liberal groups were given extra scrutiny by the tax age so
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.760]  they were not subjected to the same invasive queries as tea party groups
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.120]  folks they went after them in some cases criminally
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.200]  and then would deny them their tax exemption i mean we've seen the press
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.320]  being persecuted we see democrats now saying this is the
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.240]  most oppression towards the press they've ever seen
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.160]  but the issue is it's like obama saying you'll be able to keep your doctor and
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.800]  it will go down to the price of a phone bill or cable bill
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.160]  and nobody's going to be kicked off their insurance he said it hundreds of
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.800]  times hundreds of times in print and on video and
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.320]  in speeches and in the state of the union we've played all that i'm not
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.040]  going to play it again then he came out and said
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.800]  i never said that and then he said well i didn't mean that
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.840]  i mean you could keep your doctor if you paid more no he said the same speeches
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.600]  wouldn't go up in price in fact it would go down
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.160]  so it's the same deal where where he's now saying
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.760]  we didn't target tea party groups folks they target a lot more than that
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.640]  every talk show host i know that's libertarian or
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.960]  anti-new world order gets harassed all the fbi all the state police all the
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.400]  homeland security all the pentagon training manuals
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.920]  west point you name it we cover them here every day
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.560]  new ones every week but we talk about it every day but every week there's
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.240]  something new you've seen it i mean i'd first published this stuff five
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.080]  years ago when our sources would send it to a state police fbi federal
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.800]  marshals you name it and people wouldn't believe it and
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.080]  the news would call the fbi they go yeah that's our
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.280]  internal manual you're not supposed to have that
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.720]  now it's just well big deal but then separately because people are figuring
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.040]  out this is persecution this is how the nazis started out
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.240]  politically and using the tax police this is what the russians do
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.760]  it's classic oppression it's it's it's the robin hood stuff
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.680]  what prince john was up to historically that really happened
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.480]  a lot of the things surrounding robin hood is legend but the real character and
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.720]  what happened is real the core of it's true this is how they destroy you is
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.760]  with taxes as george washington said the power to tax is the power to destroy
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.840]  and so he denies it now now here he is a few months ago
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.200]  earlier this year it's about six months ago admitting it
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.040]  and then here he is yesterday denying it let's let's first go to him admitting
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:42.000]  it here it is well let me take the irs situation first
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.680]  i first learned about it from the same news reports that i think most people
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.920]  learned about this i think it was on friday
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:58.080]  and this this is pretty straightforward if in fact
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.000]  irs personnel engaged in the kind of practices
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.760]  that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:13.280]  conservative groups then that's outrageous and there's no place for it
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:19.280]  and you know they have to be held fully accountable
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.120]  because the irs as an independent agency independent
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.040]  requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that that's
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.920]  enough applying it by the way in the associated press reported
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.760]  when my dad was actually approached by a senior irs person
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.560]  years ago and told this and i just couldn't believe it
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.760]  and so i never even went with it but then it came out later in the associated
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.400]  press that in austin
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.400]  it was over 90 million dollars was sent to one address and no one got in
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.360]  trouble and then it was 80 something million in in
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.880]  Atlanta and all the rest of it at one address and this is the democratic
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.000]  party sending money to itself it's then fenced through to their campaigns and
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.080]  stuff i mean they really are a mafia
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.440]  and again i'm not glorifying the republican party they're just as bad at
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.320]  certain levels but you know you can't go into a republican
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.280]  office like a current and say i want to run child sex slaves and have them go
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.240]  yeah that's a great idea
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.360]  and in texas you can go into democratic party offices after offices we played
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.960]  the project veritas videos there's hours of them out now
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.320]  where you go in and then they go we're in a criminal takeover of america we're
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.960]  going to be illegal aliens vote we're going to take the guns everything
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.920]  yeah that's our plan we're taking over
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.560]  i mean they are a premeditated mob of miscreants
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.320]  i'm going to go to your phone calls jared in canada alice
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.080]  in wonderland uh shan in california micah detroit and everybody
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:57.360]  but but let's go ahead and play the new clip of him with slime bag
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:04.160]  um let's go ahead and go to chris matthews and
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.160]  el presidente you've got an office in cincinati
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.520]  uh in the irs office that i think for bureaucratic reasons is trying to
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.880]  streamline what is the difficult law to interpret about whether
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.360]  uh uh nonprofit is actually a political organization deserves a tax exempt
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.600]  agency and they've got a list and suddenly everybody's
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.040]  outraged by the ones he forced tricky to begin with to begin with and by the
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.280]  way chris i'll point out that there are some so-called progressives
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:39.120]  and uh uh you know perceived to be liberal commentators who
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.680]  during that week just were outraged at the possibility that
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.720]  uh these folks uh you know had had been
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.400]  in the direction of uh the democratic party in some way uh discriminated
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.760]  against uh tea party folks and you know that is
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.520]  uh what gets news that's what gets attention now
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:04.240]  here's what i will say uh you know there are a couple million people working
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.120]  for the federal government uh and i remember bob gates uh
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.800]  my former secretary of defense wonderful public servant had served under
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.800]  seven presidents when i first came in i asked him uh
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.720]  so bob you got any advice for me says miss president just understand
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.320]  uh you got a lot of people working for you somebody somewhere at this very
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.560]  moment is screwing something up and that's true
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:36.640]  and so so i so i have to uh consistently push
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.320]  on every cabinet secretary on every single agency
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.440]  how can we do things better and we can do things better part of what we need to
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.000]  do is reorganize the government which was designed
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.080]  primarily in 1935 or 45 we could consolidate agencies
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.240]  we've got to do a much better there you go folks uh trying to sound reasonable
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.360]  trying to sound like a fireside chat with everybody
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.400]  while he's basically saying it's made up that that even happened and it was a
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.560]  hoax and i can't believe we believed it it's come out in all the hearings
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.000]  that after that first news broke six months ago have gotten
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.160]  almost no coverage and what he's doing there is lying to everyone
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.280]  and then saying someone somewhere screwing something up no
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.360]  it's you and the foreign banks that own you you're the one trying to screw stuff
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.840]  up on purpose you're the one bringing us down to consolidate power
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.160]  you're the one now there's certainly people screwing things up because they're
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.720]  crooks or they're idiots but this isn't
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.640]  little isolated things this is organized premeditated
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.160]  crime let's get that straight now let's go ahead and go to Jared in Canada
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:50.080]  you're on the air go ahead hi Alex um just gonna make a couple points here
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.320]  about um and your opinion on something you know first off
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.840]  Canada website doesn't like that you say we used to you
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.360]  says we stopped using it doesn't say a year though
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.320]  well that's good i'm not an expert on Canada but i know a lot of countries are
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.560]  using depleted uranium now as a weapon and it it hurts the people that fire the
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.920]  weapon uh statistically almost more than the people
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.360]  they shoot at that because you don't always hit your target and kill somebody
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.640]  so you're always breathing it when you fire it whether it's an Abrams
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:26.000]  or whether it's a Barrett 50 cal uh round uh you do not want to use do you
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.040]  and secondly um Canada Calgary flood with a total force by just uh
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.160]  just to drill the soldiers into taking people's guns and
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.880]  getting people to buy water well i'll say this they certainly use that flood to
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.880]  go confiscate people's guns i don't know if they stage the flood what do you
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.600]  think oh i'll have to get staged it they knew
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.720]  it was coming though it happens every year but just not that
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.800]  intensely you know what Rahm Emanuel says about crises right
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.440]  yeah they're not to be put to waste or something like that
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.160]  yeah what do you think about Rahm Emanuel's brother admitting they want
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.680]  to jack up your prices and bankrupt you and and the death panels to kill you
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.320]  that's pretty liberal isn't it very liberal liberal
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.360]  more terrorist and and other stuff but yeah
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.720]  and um i want your opinion on something i don't know if you're able to do this
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.240]  but um i'm an extra about student with stupid student loans on my back
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.080]  and um they diagnosed me with schizophrenia because i went
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.160]  um i was nuts after i went through a year of school
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.800]  that much stress and um i'm on pills now bill if i'm not too sure if i'm really
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.960]  supposed to be taking them too much well look everybody's a little crazy
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.160]  nowadays there'd be something wrong with you i mean you know if you're not
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.120]  crazy you're nuts and you got to watch the people that don't
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:48.960]  think they're crazy but uh you know just varies and the higher
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.000]  intelligence you are the statistically the more
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.440]  apt you are to have problems just be glad you're not a moron
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.880]  think about it yourself talk to an alternative health practitioner

[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.480]  uh she wants to talk about a huge explosion at a plant go ahead tell us
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.240]  about that alex yes um alex thank you so very
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.840]  much for taking this call remembering fu kashima and how the official story
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.840]  told to the victims of fu kashima not to be worried that everything was fine
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.120]  fine fine and then we find out later they were lied to and dying of radiation
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:31.520]  poisoning we had a report in the morning uh 745 am about a
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.200]  ground shaking explosion that happened at the nuclear plant in
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.880]  rustleville um arkansas and it said that fire broke out
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.120]  that one person was killed several people were taken to the hospital
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.200]  and uh they had to shut down completely unit two
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.560]  the story that was given in the morning um by witnesses who called in who said
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.400]  that they were um neighbors to the plant
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.560]  actually felt the ground shaking and saw pillaring smoke pouring out of the
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.160]  plant gave a completely different testimony in the
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.680]  morning that was removed from the internet and then the
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.280]  official story put in which was completely different i'm
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:19.040]  wondering if your listeners could help you uh by calling in and help us uh get
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.400]  to the bottom of what really happened because i don't trust the official
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.080]  statement well that's true with all sorts of industrial
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.640]  stuff now they use homeland security rules to cover it up so if you build a
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.000]  doghouse in your backyard in areas of colorado or wherever they'll
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.440]  use google satellite stuff to come arrest you because of environmental things
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.960]  but and if you want your nuclear reactor your chemical plant or whatever the
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.400]  case is if you're an establishment group under infregard
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.840]  you can get away with bloody murder so great points alice we will
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.320]  look into that and listeners can send us any tips at showtipsandinfullwars.com

[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.760]  because of taxes and regulations some of these shirts were coming out with
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.160]  cost twelve dollars a piece to be made in america

[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.840]  say you know that they look eastern and muslim
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.680]  um yep possibly but let's just be clear
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.920]  think about it they say we don't profile which i don't think they should
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:13.280]  you know whole groups of people but they can profile backgrounds and and types
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.880]  of folks they're known to have a proclivity but understand something
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:20.640]  here since you raised this and this is the key well make your point and then
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.200]  i'll make my point go ahead well i'm just saying that they said the people
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.040]  that they don't know about are ready that when they get a ticket they already
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.760]  run your name so the people that they don't know about
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.480]  is the ones that they're going to check when they come through
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.600]  so if you're in the computer and you're like uh let's say you know you're in
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.840]  the government and you love the government because you sign up for
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.000]  this and that and they know everything you do
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.520]  then they're going to turn around and oh hello mr peterson as you go through
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:46.560]  and they could take the liquids on they could take their lighters they do not
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.920]  get searched all the way up into the plane as to where
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.520]  they take a selective view out of that line and just go ahead and say hey this
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.960]  is the way it's going to be in there they're all american i noticed there
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.240]  yeah let me let me break this down for you and and god bless you you should
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:04.000]  shoot video of this next time and then put it out for folks before i give you
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.720]  my analysis of this would you like to add anything else
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.560]  uh well no just that the uh the other information thing is that they uh
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.640]  it's a cult like you say record cult uh you got a person down the street here
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:18.480]  they got a a ticket a warning ticket last night
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.160]  because he's burning wood in his fireplace and they said it's polluting the
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:26.400]  air because it's a clean air day and that they go to jail they gave a warning
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.400]  ticket a 1400 dollars was that in the news or are you told about that
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.000]  no no this is a guy i go down to the park and i hang out with a park all right
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.360]  well listen as a citizen reporter you should go talk to him shoot video him
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.640]  talking about it show the warning ticket that's national news
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.280]  they want to stealth implement this europe already started this about 15 years
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:49.200]  ago then they banned space eaters and they banned single family homes
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:54.800]  this is total absolute mega tyranny god bless you i appreciate your call
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:01.600]  i need to do an entire video on what he called in about with the tsa
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.760]  my dad and mother flew to europe uh where they've been probably i don't know
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.600]  20 times in my lifetime at least i mean they go
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.280]  every couple years so i think they've been more than 20 times the point is is
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.040]  that they went my dad said it was incredible
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:22.320]  flying out of austin flying out of uh the us because they flew i think austin
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.200]  new york and then an austin to atlanta and then to uh
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.480]  into europe that's right and then flying back just
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:36.960]  they knew who he was hello dr jones and my mom his wife right through and we
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:40.240]  always told you this they're going to grope you they're going to body scan you
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.640]  they're going to enslave you going to treat you all horrible and then
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.840]  right when the whole nsa debate begins they're going to roll it out and say we
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:52.480]  data mines you you are trusted they said this 12 years ago
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.600]  11 and a half years ago when i watched a two-hour c-span meeting
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.080]  with the new head of homeland security at the time governor tom rich
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.080]  and when i watched that i watched it for two hours
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.600]  they said you're going to have to get tsa approval for a job anywhere
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.560]  everything's going to be in a data system it'll be through the fret fusion
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:13.760]  centers then we're going to have checkpoints on the highways for security
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:16.640]  and all major events and then finally shopping malls
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.000]  grocery stores and even random checkpoints in neighborhoods
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.240]  under transportation safety administration regulations
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:28.240]  so you have to follow approved regulations that nullify the bill of
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.480]  rights the fourth amendment the whole deal
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:36.320]  so i've told people no exaggeration probably 300 400 times that they would
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.560]  then put in because they said this at the time
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.440]  the smart tunnels that lock you in them when you go into them
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.920]  and at first they said there's been like us today articles on this a few years
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.120]  ago actually so it's now being rolled out they tell you beforehand but they
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.960]  spin it like it's a good idea you'll have three times three
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.400]  types of travelers and i'm going from memory they give specific names that
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.720]  they say basically the low-risk traveler who almost always just gets to walk
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.840]  right through and his thumb printed face scanned and
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.000]  added to the database and checked you'll just walk through when they're done
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.320]  but then it closes behind you to scan you opens back up scans face scans body
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.120]  scans you go out
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.000]  at first though to roll it out they're going to scan nobody it'll just be a
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.080]  little kiosk oh you can go right through or they're
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.920]  going to direct you into a tunnel to be face scanned added to your name
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:29.600]  confirmed who you are for next time you can fly easy
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.800]  so they have the low risk medium risk and then high risk
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.720]  and then you actually go into these areas it locks
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.280]  and then they have a side door which they literally disappear you out of for
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:44.160]  interrogation so they're basically like the showers at
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:47.280]  nazi germany where you show up and you're going to be the louse and you
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.040]  know you know what really happens and so that's what it is is total
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:56.960]  prisoner high-tech induction and they're putting in the tunnel systems now
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:02.560]  first with the exit systems where it scans you your ticket who you are
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.240]  you go out it closes again it confirms lets you go
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:10.000]  they're going to have those where your family member and i already saw this in
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.600]  london when i flew out to actually had this uh for VIPs
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.960]  so i i was supposedly a VIP because i had a better ticket and the reporter that
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:24.320]  flew with me was in coach so she had to go through all the stuff
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.400]  and in london they were hello mr jones right through the system but
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.080]  it's like a hotel counter but now it's going to be basically everybody but
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.840]  they'll decide to shut off who they want and this is how they sell you on the
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.200]  data mining and slavery but in the future they can selectively
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.240]  oh we need you to go over here for secondary even though you've quote been
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:44.480]  screened and they know you're not a terrorist
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:48.160]  see how they use first they put the pressure on make you hate it then bring
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.000]  in this new system but the tsa still there then everybody says oh well i like
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.280]  flying again now but then they'll bring back in the
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.040]  control you will watch this unfold you understand i know how
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.080]  they work plus i don't have to know how they work
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:05.920]  i they admit all this okay this is a diabolical
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:11.920]  premeditated plan uh let's go to eric in new jersey thanks for holding
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:17.120]  hey man um i was just thinking i spoke to you years ago about this and i know
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:22.720]  you've covered it but the uh the heart rub me commission uh i printed that out
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:26.400]  probably about seven years ago which now i don't even know if you can find it in
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.000]  any full form online yeah that's the council on farm relations
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.880]  commission that set up the entire police day
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:36.560]  right which was essentially the the more broad
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.400]  i guess globalist version of the p-neck and
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:43.840]  and he said we're going to use this disaster to bring in a new world order
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.360]  and they bragged that their report published a year before 9 11 laid out
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:50.400]  giant terror attacks are coming and when they come we're going to radically
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:54.160]  transform your world and it was the heart uh commission
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:59.920]  that i saw on hardball in july where they said big buildings are coming down
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.800]  army's going to be on the streets life is going to change
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.240]  and matthew's being a big insider said thank you for sharing this with me
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.000]  and they were celebrating on hardball somebody can find that from
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.360]  early july and then all the pieces fell together
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.480]  because they love to brag publicly go ahead yeah so it just seems to me i mean
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.800]  you know i i got a bug about it and i thought i would go and start looking
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.800]  through it again and you know i it's it's blatant when you
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.080]  look at it i mean you can you can use this and show
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:33.440]  that there was poor knowledge of all this just by showing oh no we have this
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:37.680]  i'm gonna come back to you but you're absolutely right this shows

[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.360]  the thing is they've all written how they did it

[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:07.680]  pretty bad I tried one world way and found it to be
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.520]  delicious after 10 weeks on one world way my wife commented you have more
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:14.240]  muscles and your leaner than when you were 20 years old
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.800]  my body has changed dramatically I'm a cyclist normally I'll ride two days on
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.000]  and take two days off after being on one world way
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.240]  I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:29.360]  servings of one world way and then work out at the gym for another
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:32.560]  hour and a half I just couldn't believe these results
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.800]  my normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone

[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.600]  wow so much to cover here I've already covered a lot of news today and I'm
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:06.800]  taking your calls and each call brings up another issue of the tyranny they're
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.120]  putting us under but after I take some more calls I
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.280]  must get to this in the next hour ahead of our guest
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.160]  Reagan advisor says market valuation has lost every anchor to the real world
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.680]  I've got this fake santa that's kind of an oxymoron they're all fake
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.800]  from Greenpeace coming out and saying there'll be no more
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.640]  Christmas 2013 there's a global warming under record temperature drops we're
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.400]  going to play that and then play my own Santa Claus joke I shot Saturday
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.640]  concerning Obamacare and then we're going to
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.640]  get to the latest NSA news but let me cover this
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:49.200]  right now briefly Italian riot police remove helmets join anti-eu protesters
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.320]  I think I'm going to shoot a special report for the nightly news about this
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:56.240]  because this is what's going to bring down the tyrants
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.640]  in chelchescus romania under communist dictatorship when the police finally
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.080]  didn't go along with the tyrant that's when he fell in just about 12 hours
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:07.200]  same thing in east germany when the police of military wouldn't shoot
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.800]  at the citizens tired of the tyranny when the riot police just took their helmets
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.480]  off and joined them that's starting to happen in spain portugal greece
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.000]  more and more the riot police has taken their helmets off and joined the people
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.240]  because the government is illegitimate and you don't normally want that to
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.120]  happen because any crowd could show up and you know communist whatever and
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:27.680]  take over but when the government's totally manifestly
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:31.840]  evil and robbing everybody that sends a message to the establishment they
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:34.720]  better knock it off so we are starting to get to
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:38.720]  that point in this country with the lawlessness separately here is a report
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.600]  that's just a prelude to the nightly news tonight

[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:57.840]  interactive games where millions of people can play simultaneously
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:01.520]  things like world of warcraft they're spying on it for terrorists turned out
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.960]  there were no terrorists they're actually recruiting people in there folks
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.840]  that's what they're doing in these giant threat fusion centers
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.480]  here's jacari jackson's report the mainstream media has finally gotten
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:15.760]  around to admitting that your video game can spy on you

[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.960]  world of warcraft and and have people playing the game seen any effect

[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:13.840]  have the wherewithal to dig in but i mean there's charts there that actually
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:17.920]  show homeland security bracketed out they show the nsa bracketed out
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:22.240]  it's there it's in picture graphs that any normal person could look at
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.160]  yes sir i made five films on nine eleven
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:31.760]  and the nine eleven road to tyranny emergency release
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:36.400]  is online now was something i just did locally in the air on the radio
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:40.400]  it's about two and a half hours long and sir i i i talked about heart rudman
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.400]  before nine eleven and they said homeland security
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:51.040]  uh you know dhs uh tsa nsa how it all everything it was all preplanned
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:55.280]  and they staged it and they went on chris mathews in early july
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.680]  i watched it on the treadmill and they literally basically said what they were
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:02.720]  going to do they said there's about to be big buildings attacked
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.840]  the army's going to be on the streets america will forever change this
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:09.200]  and they were talking about a radical transformation in american empire
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:14.080]  and it was only a conversation for them and a few other thousand insiders it was
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.080]  literally guys saying we're going to rob the bank next monday morning
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.640]  at the corner of washington and liberty and they were just literally
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.680]  signaling and then warren buffett with dhs that was already set up actually
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:32.640]  years before they had thousands of top ceo's
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:36.240]  board of plane the morning told a secret meeting to have him in a hangar
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:39.760]  when nine eleven happened i mean come on and they got some private message from
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:45.120]  someone on a jumbo tron i mean that's in the news that was in the
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:49.600]  nebraska newspaper i'm sorry no i know you're saying do we have the power do
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:53.360]  we have the background this is the problem i know all this
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.520]  stuff because i do this seven days a week
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.600]  and that's why i'm so whacked out that's why people go they call in and go have
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.400]  you heard nine eleven could be an inside job and i'm like
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.000]  have i heard that you know monkeys eat bananas man
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.800]  i mean i'm telling you folks it's crazy i'm sorry go ahead make your points
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:14.480]  well that that's pretty much my point i just think the credibility in in what
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.680]  we're trying to do in getting the information is when you have something
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.200]  like that people seven years ago say oh that's crazy it'll never happen well
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.680]  now it's happening and it's obvious you know
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:27.760]  and that's after the nsa thing came out you know to the general public
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:31.520]  you know there it is well this isn't new this has been going on
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:34.880]  um this is one other thing that i think you might think is interesting
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:38.320]  uh having to do back way back when with howl turner
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:43.120]  is i work in a plant that howl turner had put out this info about it being
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:48.880]  the next big target and that place went under super high security it's
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:53.920]  you've you've probably flown over going into newark new jersey yeah and uh
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.200]  and man i'll tell you we went to work that morning i'm just a construction
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:00.960]  worker you know we went to work and they had that place

[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.680]  the place is on lockdown and it's never been the same since they used that
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:13.200]  threat which was obviously a fake threat because he was a phony
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:17.920]  and then and totally used it to to hurt us into that place like cattle
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.880]  no no and then and then that's only a beta test but let me shift gears
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:24.400]  just so they can pull it up during the break what was the name was i didn't

[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:12.400]  see we're going to play that clip and more coming up here in just a few
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:16.000]  minutes but let's punch up drugs for folks that are watching on tv i want
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.520]  i want to show them the frozen planetoid there
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.800]  you know there's the reality of the coldest night in 18 years in the u.s
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:28.720]  coldest temp ever recorded on the bottom of the earth that that's the ap by the
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:34.080]  way but probably of el gordo there is a consensus we're warming
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.920]  for a decade at least at least really it's 12 years
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:41.280]  for more than a decade the sun has been cooling putting off
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.840]  less coronal mass ejections as they're called
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.320]  sounds dirty doesn't it coronal mass ejections from the sun the big solar
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:55.680]  flares and they know it's the sun that's
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:58.400]  the main driver of temperature i will assure you folks
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:01.760]  that's the reason the closer you are to the sun in the solar system the hotter
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.320]  your planet is mercury that doesn't spin it orbits the sun but it doesn't it
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.200]  it itself doesn't one size of the sun it's something like you know 700
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:14.640]  degrees or something year-round it's something ridiculous so so the whole
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:19.520]  point is i will assure you it's the sun now the un five years ago voted to say
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:23.680]  that the Copenhagen Vivian the sun has no effect on climate
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.800]  i'm sorry i'm already getting to that now i'm gonna get to that in a minute
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:30.240]  we've got our own article up on info wars.com dealing with this asinine
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:33.680]  behavior but it doesn't matter if obama and
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:39.040]  raul castro of cuba say that the earth is warming and you need to pay the
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:44.240]  globalist carbon taxes then it's true so sit down and shut up and if
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:47.520]  obama says you're not going to lose your health care plan or have the price go
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.880]  up it's true even though it's not and if he says they're not targeting the tea
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:53.120]  party even though their own document show they are
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.760]  then it's true they control reality they're history's actors now to quote
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:04.080]  carl rove they are in control actually they're not and their delusion is now
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:07.120]  wearing very thin like a balloon that's been blown up too much
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.840]  reagan advisor market valuation has lost every anchor
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:15.280]  to real world and it's not just there it's across
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.760]  the entire board and let's play this uh from bloomberg
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:24.880]  and and analyze the rare truth uh aired on the bloomberg tv
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:29.120]  network here it is our wall street and main street just that far apart as we
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.040]  hear stuff going on about the urban life games well i mean i think this is
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:36.640]  meaningless basically it's the kind of speculative
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:42.800]  froth you get at the top of a cycle uh where valuation loses any anchor in the
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.120]  real world and in earnings and in the prospects of the economy
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.360]  take the s and take the russell 2000 that's main street companies small mid
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.080]  camp trading at 85 times trailing reported earnings
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.680]  that makes no so are you saying the equity market's a bubble right of course
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.200]  it is of course it's a bubble it's grossly overvalued on any sustainable
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:08.800]  you would not own stocks right now i think it would be very dangerous to own
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:12.400]  stocks right now or to buy stocks the s and p 500 even
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.360]  as trading at 19 times trailing earnings reported through the third quarter
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:21.280]  in the last two years the s and p is up 45
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:24.640]  earnings reported earnings of the s and p 500
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:29.520]  are up five percent all right then we'll get back multiple expansion driven by
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.720]  the liquidity injections of the fed not by the
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.920]  so who's to blame the fed or wall street wall street is just a player the fed is
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:40.640]  the one who sets the game and they're the ones who have
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:45.360]  accommodated monetary policy has hooked these brothers up i agree it's a
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.840]  question of who has taken whom hostage
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:53.360]  wall street demands that the fed keep dishing out the liquidity keep dishing
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:58.320]  out the monetary heroine as i uh... call it they have a hissy fit
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.400]  if the chairman of the fed even suggests that he might begin to taper
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.760]  four years into a recovery so the question is well
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:09.520]  it's a co-dependency will come in very dangerous yeah it's total
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.960]  fraud and and the big banks that own the majority of the stock market and
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:14.640]  control it they're the shareholders in the private
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:18.320]  fellow reserve so this is like the bank robber being
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:23.040]  the police chief and he says uh i have decided that we're
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:25.920]  going to send in a group to rob the bank and it's okay
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:29.440]  and then he says the police to rob the bank
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:33.360]  and then they do it in front of everyone and then we go hey that's the
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:35.920]  legal and really dangerous they're going to screw everybody over
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:40.160]  shut up crazy to terrorist but you are you playing something violent don't you
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:44.320]  i bet you're gonna blow something up well let's go to msnbc and cnn
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:47.840]  yeah he's behind the boss and bombing and racist
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.200]  the fact that they would even say that with no proof folks shows
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:56.080]  how brazen these criminals are i mean these are scary people
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:59.760]  and i'll tell you right now i've never seen corrupt dictators and people get
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:03.200]  this wild with the country this big and they got nuclear weapons
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.400]  and they think the whole world is just going to follow this fraud
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:09.440]  but then they're not even managing the fraud correctly
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.040]  and it's all going to blow up so the elite are all digging in in bunkers
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.040]  thanks a lot man really thanks a lot and you tell me
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.760]  that you've got to take all my rights away because of al-qaeda which you
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:23.280]  publicly run and then that's now all completely
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:28.880]  public i mean i am living in the twilight zone
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:31.840]  this is the twilight zone my wife thinks we live in the matrix or something
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:35.360]  another thing she's right because i can't believe i'm like one of the most
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.720]  prominent people fighting this and i'm just some guy from texas it's all
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:41.760]  completely clear i don't want to be in this position
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.760]  i wish the elite were not completely megalomaniacal on a narcissistic power
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:49.520]  trips insane i just want this crazy train to stop
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:53.920]  man i want off because there's always going to be problems in corruption in
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.480]  humanity but this is just mental illness man i used to really argue with top
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:02.000]  experts that said look there's a method to control a grid
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.040]  but they're not in complete control and they're really screwed up and it won't
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.920]  turn out like they want they're probably going to blow the planet up and i'm
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.560]  like oh no they wouldn't do that they're so smart
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:13.120]  it's easy to make up all these big plans because they've got control of our
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:16.720]  money and our labor that's why they look so big and powerful
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.080]  and red carpets and the whole illusion that they're unstoppable and
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:23.520]  ten thousand dollar suits and you know all the rest of it and
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:29.120]  ten thousand dollar dresses and perfect dental work and the best schools but
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.440]  they're smoking their own propaganda their own baloney
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:38.480]  they're believing their own garbage and historically this is really what happens
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.280]  with all the big empires except now they've got bio weapons and nukes
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.480]  and it's going to take the elite realizing they're out of control and
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.200]  have their own psychosis and the public of course is pathetic as well
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.160]  but just because the public's pathetic and decadent myself included
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.360]  doesn't mean that you get to blow the planet up
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:00.400]  because you've gotten a position of power social Darwinism
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:03.600]  now let's shift gears ladies and gentlemen to another economic area
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:07.920]  under obama troops forced to rely on welfare holiday charity the washington
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.640]  times reports top 40 paid 106 percent of
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:17.520]  income taxes bottom 40 paid 9.1 got average of 18
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.280]  thousand nine hundred and fifty back in quote government trend wealth transfers
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:24.720]  the government even calls it wealth transfers
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.920]  three hurt in hatchet attack in east texas walmart
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:31.120]  well the answer is ban hatchets that's obviously what did this
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.880]  now let's shift gears to the big fraud here
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.160]  this is a uh produced piece i'm not going to play the whole thing
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.400]  from put out by greenpeace that greenpeace's own founders said
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:46.080]  doesn't care about real environmental problems that are out there
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:49.360]  and the symphony of destruction as dave mustain has properly pointed it out with
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:52.880]  species and things they just use it as a way to push carbon
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:57.440]  taxes and socialism watermelons green on the outside red on the inside
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:03.520]  and now you've got santa in in in this room like a bunker with a flashing
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.800]  light and there's not going to be a christmas and it's a famous actor doing

[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.200]  shexperian actor what's his name and the point is is that i actually
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:16.400]  like that actor how disgusting i almost don't want to know what these people are
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:19.520]  into you know uh because i admire humanity
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:22.800]  for the love of humanity i like people then i found out what they stand for
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:25.520]  and they're just idiots or they're worse they're parasites
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:30.080]  here he is saying there'll be no santa i mean no uh no uh christmas
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:35.440]  and of course it's a hoax character pushing a hoax here it is
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:43.280]  and electricity is off and on dear children
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:51.840]  regrettably i bring bad tidings for some time now
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:56.560]  melting ice here
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:05.120]  the north pole has made our operations and our day-to-day life
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:12.720]  intolerable and impossible and there may be no alternative all right that's enough
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:18.960]  that's uh jim carter a famous actor doing that now listen folks the coldest
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:21.920]  temperature ever recorded they've been able to get temperature
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:25.520]  for what with thermometers for about 300 plus years
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:31.920]  the coldest temperature ever recorded coldest temp ever recorded the ap
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:37.200]  is reporting 135.8 below zero
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:41.360]  soul crushing cold
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:47.520]  coldest temperature in the united states in 18 years
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:54.800]  in chicago ladies and gentlemen and then meanwhile
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:59.200]  they are telling us that there will not be christmas because the north pole has

[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.960]  water folks it freezes a lot lower can swim hundreds of miles in
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.040]  sub zero water it goes out with one arm and

[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:10.960]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:13.760]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family

[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:20.000]  liberty science and news and as soon as his mama lets him you're
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.800]  going to be able to see his face and i want him down here every week doing
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.560]  reports for us he's a lot smarter than i am in many ways and he constantly he
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:29.040]  comes to work with me every few weeks he constantly
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:32.880]  corrects things that i'm saying on air and you know bible verses
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:36.240]  you name it because he's got that young brain like i used to have
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:40.400]  and he told me dad mercury does actually rotate but extremely slowly
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:43.200]  and they only discovered it with high-tech telescopes
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.480]  in 1990 i read that in my and in one of the adult science books or whatever
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.640]  so we looked it up during the break and universe today does report that it
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:58.320]  does rotate but the day is 1,999 times as
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:03.840]  long as a single year so i guess it you know rotates
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:09.920]  every 58,647 days and orbits twice
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:13.040]  during every three rotations so whatever that means
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:16.160]  show but but for all intents and purposes my point was is one side's
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:20.080]  molten and the other side isn't rex but go ahead and correct me on air that's
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.320]  good we need you here as a fact checker thank you dad
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:29.360]  and there's one thing i want to say before i leave studio
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:33.920]  the um i i'm not sure that it was discovered exactly
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:40.720]  in 1990 then this new fact that i told my dad about but
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:47.520]  i do know that it was discovered after he was in school or else the school
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:51.040]  would have taught him that basic information
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:54.800]  so you were guessing that no no no no it does say since the 90s here i think
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:58.000]  i think you remember that correctly okay well that's very interesting tell us
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.160]  tell us a couple other uh planetoid facts all right
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.280]  did you know that a retrograde that but that both venus and mars have a
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:11.600]  retrograde rotation which basically means that even
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:15.920]  though they even though it looks like the planet is
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.840]  orbiting forward it's actually orbiting backwards
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:22.880]  another cool planet let me ask you a question do you think
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.720]  algor's right that the earth is warming even though it's over all getting
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:30.320]  colder and then they also say that uh that the
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:34.400]  that mars has has ice caps that are
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:38.160]  that are melting a decade ago so when the sun was actually heating up
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:42.720]  they say that isn't connected to the earth's heating all right i think that
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:46.480]  algor is a very deep liar he could say
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:50.480]  that the easter bunny poops out chocolate gobules
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:55.360]  of goodness and that the leprechaun has silver teeth
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.280]  that are manufactured well that's actually true of algor says oh yes
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.200]  we must honor the great algor
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:08.080]  this is wrong this is why don't you just why don't you just do what he says
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:11.600]  i don't do what he says so you're not going to submit to world government
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.840]  yet your god i don't want to submit to it and here let me tell you something a
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:20.000]  cool fun fact did you know that
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.640]  that actually in the industrial revolution when there was the most on
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:28.960]  record co2 being released it was actually the world had
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:32.080]  experienced a dramatic and i do mean dramatic
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:37.040]  with capital d drop in temperature that's right because the soot blocked the sun
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:42.640]  exactly it's actually a reverse effect how dare you question the king
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.800]  liberals that are bombing everyone and authoritarian they're liberal
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:51.520]  they're trendy i mean apple has the suicide factories that's liberal
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.480]  get out of here hate monger no get out of the racist
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:00.880]  ladies and gentlemen i want to apologize for that in fact in the name of the
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:03.680]  fairness doctrine we've discovered that actually
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:07.440]  the health care plan is a great deal written to help you not to bankrupt
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:10.560]  your maker dependent it's a wonderful good deal
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:14.400]  i actually discovered it's real this weekend so here's that video audio
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.480]  report for everybody right now

[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.720]  i have actually found proof that obama care is real
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.960]  is free and is a great deal and doesn't raise
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:37.040]  your premiums and wasn't written by foreign insurance companies
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:42.640]  to rob people ladies and gentlemen i have found
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:46.240]  something that proves it's real and not a myth and not a mechanical Santa Claus
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.120]  in a restaurant and gentlemen Santa Claus
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:52.320]  i give you proof because if Santa Claus is real

[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.800]  he's going to bring you free things if he's real and it's a conspiracy theory
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.640]  to say he isn't well then this fake Santa Claus
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:07.440]  masquerading as the real fake Santa Claus
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:11.040]  is real just like obama care hey bring my son back in real quick
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:16.720]  say that that's a lie you are a racist so here's all his old friends

[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:41.520]  attacked us the alex jones show can't let them have a free speech
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:44.960]  for your mind well i think this is america
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:48.880]  i dare them be here demonstrating for free speech at the mayor band
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:52.560]  dallas police won't attack them we will because we came marching out of the
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:57.680]  federal building under federal control that's so bad to peacefully
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:02.000]  demonstrate for the first amendment don't let anybody do that
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.080]  kennedy said those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.440]  revolution inevitable and i'm the most peaceful person
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:14.080]  you can imagine very loving i hate it when i see a little
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:18.160]  lizard get stepped onto my house or don't mind killing cockroaches and stuff
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:21.040]  i actually don't enjoy it though i'll enjoy picking them up if you stomp on
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:24.400]  them but you know what i mean i mean i i love dogs i love animals i love
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:27.040]  justice but i tell you one thing man the shooting
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.840]  starts and this whole deal goes down the patriots this country are going to
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:33.920]  wipe out all the scum and i don't even want to see that happen
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.440]  because so many good people are going to be conscripted into fight
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.200]  there's going to be so many lies and so many dirty tricks and so many horrible
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:45.680]  things if they're able to kick off of a civil war in this country
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:48.240]  they're doing everything they can to punch buttons and we're going to talk
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:51.520]  about it in just a minute with dr james garrow
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:54.960]  phd a lot of folks who requested back on the show
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:57.600]  i think he's a good guy he's done good work over the years
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:01.840]  i just can't confirm what he's putting out i can confirm my end of the missing
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.640]  news because i know who the high level person is talk to them
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.880]  and they haven't talked to us since we're really worried about them we're
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:12.480]  going to have to probably go try to go out to the base they are at the base
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:17.840]  they're at the air force base in west texas
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:21.280]  where the truckloads of missing warheads that weren't even supposed to be there
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.000]  got brought out it was a big freak out drove them out so they were going to
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.760]  georgia next you hear it's going to be nuked i mean this is some crazy stuff
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:33.040]  georgia south carolina he says he has intel on what obama was planning i i
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:36.000]  just i i think because the nukes are missing
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.840]  we can say anything is on the table and needs to be debated
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:44.320]  because even if the intel garrow's gotten is wrong and i'm not saying it is i
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:47.360]  just can't confirm it it's good to debate it so people are aware of it
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:51.120]  like the missing russian nukes
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:54.320]  now let me just stop right there and briefly remind folks we are listeners

[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.360]  and i'm very excited in the quest to be able to fund our independent media
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:11.120]  operation i had the idea to have a made in america
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:16.320]  line and when i call 1776 worldwide and working with tim frugia we developed
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:24.000]  the idea to come up with made in 1776 and so with my graphics crew
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.080]  these designs are a collaborative effort you see the first belt buckle
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:32.400]  there are a thousand of these 500 of the bronze that looks kind of gold
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:35.120]  and you can't really see it there on the camera one's kind of a light goldish
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:38.560]  bronze the other is nickel bronze it's a little bit more
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:42.880]  belt buckles like this usually go for $100 or more these are $50
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:46.640]  and it goes to support the broadcast this is made in america highest quality
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.080]  solid bronze uh with the nickel uh plating uh
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:54.400]  electroplating on one of them and that's just this is my idea of a manly
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:58.080]  serious belt buckle that gets people talking who's that that's george
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:01.520]  washington not as you see him as an old man in paintings but
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:06.080]  as he looked in paintings when he was in command uh against the redcoats
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:10.160]  and he's looking out with a confident gaze ready to take on the tyrants
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:15.520]  with providence the answer to 1984 1776 there's 500 each of these when they're
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:19.840]  gone this design will never be seen again i'm coming out with a whole line i'm
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:23.600]  designing of come and take it it's it's it's amazing
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:28.160]  that will be probably february march you know who knows
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:31.440]  and we've also got a bunch of t-shirts we printed one run of each and each side
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.120]  and that's it we're talking high quality golf shirts we're talking about
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.360]  uh also money clips you're talking about all of it i love one with george
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.000]  washington if you actually click on that white one right there where george
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.600]  washington it is uh on the front that says i'm mad
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:49.760]  as hell i'm not going to take it anymore george washington it says 1776
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:53.920]  people ask you what does that mean you can start up a conversation
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:57.920]  a lot of folks will see it who are uh progressive authoritarians they will
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.280]  run in fear they've been taught that is their enemy that is the devil
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.080]  so we're we're making george washington cool again folks
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:08.080]  if you studied history there's there's nobody cooler i mean if you just even
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:11.520]  you have to admire mandela because he was a leader and tough but just i mean
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:15.520]  nothing compared to george washington i mean this you you go watch movies like
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:19.440]  conan the barbarian and stuff and it seems ridiculous all the exploits george
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:24.000]  washington was in like 20 years of hardcore war i mean just front line
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.880]  battles leading from the front just unbelievable
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:32.080]  and um anyways we're we're we're bringing george washington back ladies and gentlemen
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.680]  because culture is is is been inundated with all these
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:41.040]  gross images of tyranny and shelling shea guvara is a hero and all the rest of it
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:44.000]  and i gotta admire shea guvara he did actually have courage and stuffy but he
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.360]  was also cold blooded killer did a lot of horrible stuff and
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:51.120]  called folks the peasants scum and cockroaches and stuff so he had a
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:54.400]  typical communist view of the general public that was uh disgusting not
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:57.120]  george washington he believed in the common people when they wanted to make
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:00.080]  him king he said no nobody back then turned it down
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.640]  and king george the third instead of george washington when that happened
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.400]  a decade you know after eight years after the war when washington was leaving
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.400]  as president he said he is the greatest man alive in the world
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:17.760]  and put out a proclamation because he could have set up the new dynasty
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:21.280]  everybody back then did that and he said no i believe in these ideals
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:25.440]  i'm going back to my farm that is what i stand for
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:29.520]  that's who i admire thomas jefferson george washington
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:32.720]  and then others that came along and stood up for liberty
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:36.320]  i admire people like malcom x who stood for liberty for people they got more
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:39.200]  sophisticated and figured out it was liberty for everyone then they killed
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.400]  him for it i admire people that have honor folks
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:46.720]  that we might as well put out a malcom x uh belt buckle or something but really
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:50.080]  about the real malcom x and why they killed him not the one that they tried
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:53.920]  to use to promote racism because we need to promote people that stood for human
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:57.760]  liberty all right i'm done ranting i appreciate him joining us on short notice
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:59.680]  i'd have him on longer but he can only come on now
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:02.880]  dr uh james garrow pink pagoda girls dot com
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:05.760]  one of the biggest private groups getting chinese girls out of the country
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.360]  that would be aborted i know about the whole adoption system and know he's for
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:12.800]  real and one of the leaders of that so he's an admirable person on that front
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.360]  uh phd canadian teacher and businessman uh and he found the bethel institute
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:20.480]  68 a language school the people's republic of china
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:23.920]  that's a classic cia cover in fact i privately when we had him on a few years
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:27.600]  ago said that guy is cia and i've ever seen it
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:31.840]  and then publicly he announced that he has been a
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.800]  operational section leader he claims he certainly fits the cut out of it
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:40.480]  but he says obama blew his cover uh he's a canadian
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:46.160]  and he joins us now he claims some big medicine on this nuke front uh show
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:49.120]  dr garrow go ahead and tell us what you think about our
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:53.120]  dais air force base nuke story we saw the nuke commander's fired after that came
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:56.000]  out there's now a purge general boykin and others
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:59.360]  major generals have exposed it lieutenant journals have exposed it
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:02.800]  so there is a bunch of stuff going on i don't think you're a liar but how do we
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.280]  know the info you were given is accurate and then tell us what that info is
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.720]  well let's talk about the facts alex first of all we know
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:17.920]  that on october 7th and 8th that uh a nuclear device went off 560 miles
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:22.160]  southeast of charleston south carolina that was verified by
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.000]  not only the weather services of course that monitor
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.400]  seismic activity for example but also mr putin of russia
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:34.000]  actually came out instead that uh if there's you know any
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.840]  uh news coming out of america that suggests that there was an earthquake
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:42.160]  off the coast of south carolina no it was a nuclear device that was
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:46.240]  exploded that was detonated off their coast so that kind of brings a little
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:49.360]  bit of uh international flair to the whole deal
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:53.600]  i don't think he would uh knowingly lie and the people who have
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:58.080]  contacted me alex i've known these people for years they've trusted me with
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:02.080]  with their lives in essence and for them to come forward and lie to me
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:06.240]  nah not gonna happen so what we have is uh
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:10.560]  the president of the united states ordered that nuclear devices be moved
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.000]  inappropriately uh breaching the protocols that
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.800]  safeguard all of us and you and you know full well the
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.720]  the hazardous materials uh once you get into the radioactive stuff
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:24.320]  and then fissionable materials and then nuclear devices themselves
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.520]  the multiple layers of protections uh the signing off by every single person
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.920]  in the chain of command uh the fact that troops are ready on the ground
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:38.400]  the fact that uh aircraft are ready you know 40 000 feet in the air you get f
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:42.000]  16s up there um keeping watch over this whole
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  movement so that nobody is going to be uh interfering
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  either to mess it up to sabotage it or in fact
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.120]  steal the news this isn't going to happen so
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:57.840]  three officers three general officers two generals and an admiral
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.760]  said to the commander-in-chief no we're not going to do it and there were a
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:05.280]  number of things that were coming to bear here it's not just that these people
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:08.880]  had minimal amounts of information they had tons of it coming in
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:11.840]  they knew full well that other orders had gone out
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:16.080]  to prepare the collars did you know that the nuclear devices
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:19.360]  are attached to the rockets through specific collars
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.120]  and each one of these collars you know they're these are precision made
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:27.600]  um uh fit different nuclear devices and the particular ones that were being
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:31.040]  asked for are not the ones that are the bunker buster
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:36.000]  style these were emp capable and that was the problem as soon as
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:39.440]  these gentlemen saw what was being asked for and saw the
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:44.000]  the orders uh the secondary orders that well they were reportedly from best
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.440]  thing new look like warheads that are used for air
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:50.880]  burst which i know can be retrofitted for emp or they actually
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:54.400]  create an emp but you can jacket them and cause a bigger emp
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:59.600]  they're cbs news uh the night after we uh brought this out that same day he
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.760]  came out and said that nukes in the hands of terrors could result in bombing to
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:07.520]  charleston harbour uh so the thing was as soon as we reported
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:10.080]  this generals are fired they're talking about nukes i mean
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:13.360]  definitely our source is real but absolutely
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:16.800]  but but that's the but they don't know what was going on see
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:20.480]  but you know here we got lindsey graham who who let's face it he fumbled the
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:23.600]  football right away uh he you know he just mangled the
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:27.040]  message i'm not sure who in the world was talking to the guy but he ended up
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:31.680]  looking like an absolute fool um but the basic information about the
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.480]  danger of a nuclear device going off was correct he was correct in that
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:39.600]  but what he wasn't correct in was was eight timing
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:43.680]  and the specifics of the whole thing now let's get into timing here
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:48.320]  um obama knew full well that an event was about to take place that takes place
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:51.760]  every 11 years and you're aware that the sun
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:56.880]  switches its polarity every 11 years 22 years ago new england
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:00.640]  and cobalt the province of cobalt in canada the uh
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:06.400]  the electric grid was absolutely fried it took weeks to recover
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:11.200]  that was an emp a natural emp issuing from the sun
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:14.480]  as a direct result of the switching of the poles
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.720]  now here's the interesting thing that timing looked like
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:22.320]  they were bringing together these nuclear devices in order to create
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:27.360]  the compton effect use the com compton effect when you uh would set off one of
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:32.480]  these devices 800 miles in uh the upper atmosphere you get this
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:37.120]  multiplier effect through the compton effect a scientifically proven
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:43.040]  principle but if you add that to the massive emp coming off the sun at the
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.320]  same time you've got absolute devastation and you
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:49.120]  know we're not talking devastation of actual property
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:52.480]  we're talking about the frying of the computer systems electric sure because
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:55.920]  they're always warning of it notice the last year they keep warning of emp
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:58.880]  where you know iran's going this with an emp emp
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:02.400]  and we've warned them of an emp false flag it does all fit
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:05.360]  the way they pre-hype it so when it happens they say
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.160]  she we told you and it was like a hundred years ago
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:11.520]  they had a big natural emp from the sun and luckily there wasn't a lot of
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:14.800]  electricity yet then but it blew it out all over the world
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:18.480]  uh and really bad up in canada and again because i guess there's atmospheric
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:22.240]  differences it gets magnified closer to the poles
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:25.520]  and if you expand on this just from the scientists have had on they've described
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:30.800]  that that during a natural solar flare hitting that's why you have big storms
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:33.280]  at night when the flare hits over the other side of the earth
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.040]  that ionizes and forms particulate that's why you get big storms out of a
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:40.400]  clear blue sky in the day thunderstorms at night if there's an
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:45.360]  a natural emp that's all on record that if you did detonate a high altitude say
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:50.400]  10 000 feet uh nuke during that it would almost be like a wire
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:53.920]  mesh super charging it into everything and that would be
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.280]  particularly devastating a super emp yes and that's exactly what was going to
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:01.760]  happen now here's the interesting thing and i know
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:05.600]  you're a person of faith and you know i am as well and we're we're christians
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:09.360]  do you know that for the very first time in recorded history or
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:16.160]  in as far as any scientists can track the sun's flip of polarity it happened in
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:22.960]  the north pole and it fizzled in the south pole god intervene
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:26.880]  really do you think wow well i know that they've been studying it for a long
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:30.000]  time and it gets too sophisticated for me to understand
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.240]  all i know is these nukes came up missing the people were freaked out
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.480]  the base won't deny it i know i'm risking my life even reporting this
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:41.360]  and i know you're you know an interesting fella and everything and i don't
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:45.680]  doubt you i'm just i mean you think they were going to go ahead with the emp
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:48.960]  during this event that i know goes for an hour or so
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:52.720]  uh generally i'm told that's it super charges the atmosphere or
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:56.720]  or did did gram thumbling the ball and the general saying no
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:01.120]  stop them from doing it if the story is accurate yes it was in fact the generals
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:05.520]  the two generals and the admiral who said no and stopped it in fact
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:09.920]  we know that the one the one device was detonated off the coast
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:14.160]  but the other two devices are still missing
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:18.480]  okay so it was detonated in the atmosphere off the coast no in deep ocean
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:22.880]  so they didn't get rid of it yes i mean obviously you don't detonate a
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:27.600]  a nuke in the ocean to create an emp event let me ask you this
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:32.400]  if i was obama and the globalist i would use a clandestine group
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:37.440]  launched from a private base a a a plane a drone dressed up to look like a
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:41.360]  private jet or something to carry the uh the nuke
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:44.080]  and then and then no one would know it would just be a regular flight line and
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:47.840]  then this plane that took off uh that was drone controlled would
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:50.640]  detonate why would they go through a chain of command
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:53.840]  uh in something like this that needs total compartmentalization
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.120]  that's why i don't don't really buy it i'm not saying you're wrong i believe
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.400]  you were told this uh is because why would they try to go
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:04.000]  through the chain of command instead of just loading it on a drone passenger
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:07.600]  jet or a drone private jet or a drone sesna
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:11.920]  somebody was in a hurry and when you're in a hurry you make mistakes mr obama
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:15.600]  being the petulant child that he is you know what he he does which
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:20.320]  it's like the you never see it on on television but behind the scenes
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:24.240]  you know about this man yelling and almost screaming at people and stomping
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:27.200]  his feet you know that this is what's going on
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:32.080]  well this was secret service basically tell me he is completely insane
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:35.760]  yeah and dan bungy you know talk to them talk to them in private man because
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:39.840]  you'll well you know didn't tell me any of that i was it was
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:44.000]  i don't even want to get into it i it's just i'm just you know
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  and we came close we came close hillary clinton rolls around and choose the
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:51.440]  carpet like hitler did and of course that fb i agent went public back in the
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:54.560]  90s that they do that and they had like crack pipes and linen and
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:58.400]  stalling now on the christmas tree i mean these are mentally ill people

[02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:10.240]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around

[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:21.200]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:24.960]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic

[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:18.480]  the alternative media never said all this stuff a few months ago came out and
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:21.520]  said that he worked for secret u.s government programs in china and he's
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:25.680]  on record as a well-known guy in china running language schools and
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:30.480]  orphanages which is always a perennial front for clandestine groups just like
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:35.920]  the press is and stuff like that uh but uh now he says obama blew his cover so
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:39.200]  he's going public about all this
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:43.520]  what else did your sources tell you where is all this going what is the state of
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:46.480]  the government now any other points you'd like to add
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:51.200]  mr garrow well we're in uh we're in perilous times alex
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:56.000]  we're uh we're dealing with a a communist a marxist
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:59.840]  i believe a muslim by the way as well and um we're dealing with a
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:02.880]  man who the international community is laughing
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:06.480]  us to scorn uh they know this man they have
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:10.560]  so much information on this guy i've seen some of it
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:14.240]  you know in my dealings with the chinese intelligence services
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:18.560]  i just came off a meeting i was here at only 15 minutes ahead of this
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:23.040]  interview but uh i was having lunch with the the ambassador from china to
[02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:25.840]  canada and we had some very interesting
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:31.200]  conversation also things i was not expecting to come up but um
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:36.720]  you know america is in a uh a free fall at the moment
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:40.400]  in in losing your liberties and your freedom
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:44.880]  losing the very essence of what it was was set up by the founding fathers
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:48.240]  they're being uh trumped on they're being crushed
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:52.880]  and uh that is mr obama but understand the man is an absolute fraud
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:56.880]  he is a fraud from the beginning of his story to the end
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:00.880]  uh you've been duped you've been hoodwinked you've been had
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:05.280]  and you've been conned and to me it's the most unfortunate thing that the
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:10.320]  international community is now looking at america and america that was in
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:14.240]  considered to be a real threat to them they were afraid
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:18.080]  of america when mr bush was there they were afraid of him
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:20.960]  because they knew that he would actually do what he said he was going to do like
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.360]  mr regan um and you know when mr regan uh
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:29.120]  the day he took office do you remember that amazing event
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:33.840]  where uh the iranians let go uh the diplomatic
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:37.520]  folks that were being held hostage remember that yes
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.120]  do you know why do you know why it happened why
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:44.640]  i'll tell you why and i i know exactly why because i'm like i'm the man that
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:47.920]  took the message i flew from toronto to ottawa
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:52.480]  and i met with the charged affair of iran they didn't have an embassy in ottawa
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:55.280]  at that time in canada but they had an office
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:57:59.920]  i took in a message from president reagan uh sorry
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.000]  president elect reagan that indicated that if they did not
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.760]  let go the hostages on the day that he took office
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:12.720]  that he would nuke mecca i'll send it to you my friend

[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:24.080]  and um other things like that from my understanding it was
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:28.240]  it was shenanigans behind the scenes with the cia and iran contra
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:31.120]  and that they'd basically done the transfer and that was part of a deal but
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:35.200]  i know that reagan did actually what was an operation praying man us
[02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:41.680]  actually did attack iran we'll be right back

[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:50.640]  oh i don't think he said anything by not saying
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.760]  tehran in the message he was being very specific to what this was about
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:59.760]  this was a religious jihad back then you didn't hear that word but it was being
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:03.040]  used it was a religious jihad against america the great
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:07.920]  state so it was meant to be over the top
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:13.040]  it was meant to be exactly what it was said he said you don't uh you know you
[03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:17.840]  don't let our people go the day that i'm uh installed in office and uh we'll
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:21.920]  nuke you and look all right they knew he was right
[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:25.680]  he was going to do it they understood the strength of a ronald reagan
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:28.400]  well i remember ronald reagan making the joke that got recorded about we're
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:31.840]  going to launch the nuclear missiles in 10 minutes and all that stops too
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:36.960]  remember that i do i do but you know what we have we've
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:41.920]  transitioned from a powerful nation well respected and feared
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:45.760]  which is the same on the international stage to one where
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:49.440]  we're now a bit of a laughing stock and to me that's the greatest
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:53.840]  threat we have uh people do not take us take us seriously they see
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:57.440]  leadership as being absolutely weak in fact those in the intelligence
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:00.560]  communities know full well who we have as president and
[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:03.680]  it's more than weakness and it's more than a laugh
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:07.600]  it's uh it's just an embarrassment what do you think is going to end up
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.760]  happening as obama's stock plunges is he more dangerous now to stage
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:14.640]  something or are they smart enough to back off now
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:18.640]  no he's more dangerous the man is a child and uh you see
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:22.960]  you see who's running uh the white house you know that when this man is out
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:26.400]  doing his fundraising doing his speaking engagements uh reading his
[03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:28.880]  teleprompter you know who's running the nation
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:34.960]  valerie jaren and who elected that iranian
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:39.360]  well i tell you it's it's it's all getting really weird
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:43.280]  what's happening with china right now in japan is that a diversion or are they
[03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:47.280]  thinking about starting something no it's a diversion there's stuff going on in
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:51.360]  the homeland in china and uh you don't know this but up in the uh
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:56.160]  in the ugr region uh you've got muslims up there and they've been
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:00.720]  getting well this happens in a cycle almost but
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:03.920]  they've been getting out of whack they've murdered some policemen and of
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:06.880]  course the troops came in they've already killed a few hundred
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:11.600]  and uh that's what's going on so china is you know doing this thing with japan
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:15.680]  but you know they meet they actually meet and under the table i know what the
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:20.000]  handshakes are going on uh that was part of the discussion with the chinese
