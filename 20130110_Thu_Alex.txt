[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.560 --> 00:21.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.920 --> 00:34.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this again will be one of the most jam-packed transmissions we've
[00:34.200 --> 00:38.840]  ever engaged in and one of the most important. They are openly announcing at the federal
[00:38.840 --> 00:42.160]  and state level, and we're gonna go through some of the audio clips, they wanna physically
[00:42.160 --> 00:43.440]  ban guns and make you turn them in.
[00:43.440 --> 00:47.400]  We told you that was coming months ago. That's always been their goal. But they're like,
[00:47.400 --> 00:50.960]  hey, you got a second amendment, you got a right to turn them into us. And hey, Obama
[00:50.960 --> 00:57.560]  can use existing statutory interpretations with his executive order. So you're wrong
[00:57.560 --> 01:02.520]  to freak out. That's what they're saying on CNN and MSNBC, that he's going to use executive
[01:02.520 --> 01:05.000]  orders to curtail your second amendment.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.440]  And they're saying, we're just gonna tell the gun manufacturers they can't manufacture
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.760]  these. That's our power under executive orders. And we're just gonna tell gun shops what they
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.440]  can and can't do outside of law. We'll call it rulemaking. That's what they've already
[01:18.440 --> 01:21.080]  been trying the last two years.
[01:21.080 --> 01:25.080]  Now they're politically just gonna try to ram it through. I also have another article
[01:25.080 --> 01:28.480]  here out of CBS News where they're announcing that they're getting together $20 million
[01:28.480 --> 01:34.960]  to begin with from rich megabanks and globalist. Guys, I am that to you, but it may not have
[01:34.960 --> 01:36.640]  come through cuz I didn't see it.
[01:36.640 --> 01:43.440]  It was a CBS News article that had Bill Clinton video in it about a national plan to raise
[01:43.440 --> 01:49.360]  money to pass laws at state level. The point is they're bringing a bunch of money to come
[01:49.360 --> 01:54.420]  after our guns. They're at the White House right now twisting the arm of the NRA president
[01:54.420 --> 01:56.960]  to go along with all this.
[01:56.960 --> 02:05.780]  This is serious, very, very, very, very serious. Now, Doug Hagman is coming up in 30 minutes
[02:05.780 --> 02:13.960]  and I have not talked to him since I got back from New York. He has talked to his DHS source
[02:13.960 --> 02:21.560]  who told him that indeed we were under surveillance and was feds, not Bloomberg detectives.
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.080]  Well, they look like, cuz I've seen Bloomberg's quote detectives like the mafia around him
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.080]  multiple times in New York covering things. They look like New York detectives to me.
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.880]  A lot of times they're under the feds. They all looked exactly like they were brothers
[02:35.880 --> 02:40.920]  or something. I mean, it was just absolute archetype, Goodfellas types, but you could
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.000]  tell they were cops, like something out of a movie.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.900]  And they were in the hotel, they were following us, all this. But I was reading what Doug
[02:48.900 --> 02:54.320]  Hagman put out on his website. He's gonna be joining us 30 minutes about it. And I didn't
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.260]  tell anybody what motel or hotel we were staying in. It was a little boutique hotel scene and
[02:58.260 --> 03:02.120]  put us in. I didn't tell anybody there was a Starbucks catty corner to it.
[03:02.120 --> 03:06.880]  I didn't tell Hagman this. I didn't tell listeners this. Nobody told anybody this. I hadn't gone
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.240]  through all the details. In his article, his federal source described it all and that they
[03:11.240 --> 03:15.280]  were planning to cause a confrontation. That's what my gut told me. I was like, they wanna
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.040]  cause a confrontation, stay away from them.
[03:18.040 --> 03:22.680]  So I would literally just turn and walk the other direction, hail a cab, get out. I'd
[03:22.680 --> 03:26.400]  be walking back, more of them. I mean, they were definitely, and you'd see them, they'd
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.720]  be looking at a cell phone, looking around. And I mean, they weren't even good at it.
[03:30.720 --> 03:34.480]  They'd be talking to their sleeve and I'm not looking at you and then start following
[03:34.480 --> 03:35.480]  you.
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.640]  People were like, well, go confront them. And we did get one of them on video when we
[03:38.640 --> 03:42.320]  were coming out of CNN. Well, two more were coming and I just sent a cab and got out of
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.400]  there because they planned to cause a confrontation. Gotta know when to hold them, know when to
[03:47.400 --> 03:53.040]  fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.840]  You never count your money when you're sitting at the table. They'll be counting enough for
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.340]  counting when the dealing's done. And the money I'm looking for, the treasure I'm looking
[03:59.340 --> 04:04.240]  for is liberty. That was another reason I was real angry when I got in there. I was
[04:04.240 --> 04:07.320]  under the weather, hadn't had a lot of sleep and a bad mood.
[04:07.320 --> 04:13.360]  And I think overall we did a good job getting in their face. I got sent a little text message,
[04:13.360 --> 04:16.520]  I ought to get him on the show about it. Billy Corrigan, listener of the show, friend, he
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.920]  said Alex, you broke people's hypnosis, could have done a better job. John Rapport said
[04:20.920 --> 04:22.320]  the same thing.
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.340]  And people said, man, that was really calculated and good how you made that big scene. It was
[04:25.340 --> 04:30.120]  just I was sick of it. And I was sick of them going, yeah, have him sit out front. Yeah,
[04:30.120 --> 04:31.120]  look what he's wearing.
[04:31.120 --> 04:33.640]  I'm like, you're gonna make me look really fat. I mean, it was just they were a bunch
[04:33.640 --> 04:39.000]  of wolves. I wanted them to know I wasn't gonna sit there and play nice with them. And
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.940]  so that's what happened. But it's just a huge broadcast today, totally jam packed on so
[04:43.940 --> 04:48.320]  many fronts. We're gonna launch officially the transmission on the other side of this
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.320]  quick break.
[04:49.320 --> 05:01.600]  That's Thursday, the 10th day of January 2013.
[05:01.600 --> 05:06.440]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[05:06.440 --> 05:11.020]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[05:11.020 --> 05:15.960]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e foods

[07:08.800 --> 07:14.840]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[07:56.700 --> 08:07.560]  We're getting prepared. Are you infowarshop.com? I was trained in firearms. I carried a concealed
[08:07.560 --> 08:13.600]  weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going
[08:13.600 --> 08:23.000]  to take them with me. If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.800]  for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all
[08:29.800 --> 08:38.880]  in, I would have done it. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex
[08:38.880 --> 08:48.280]  Jones. I'm only a man just like you. And I am a soldier of the Republic. And I'm doing
[08:48.280 --> 08:56.080]  the best I can in French warfare at point blank range against these globalists. For
[08:56.080 --> 09:05.560]  17 years. And all I ask is that you stand beside me. All I ask is that you recognize
[09:05.560 --> 09:10.400]  that we're living in total tyranny. You read the headlines today, it sounds like 1984.
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.120]  I was walking by the bank of televisions we have in there in the newsroom. And I looked
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.000]  at the lower thirds, and it was police to take blood nationwide without warrants at
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.800]  checkpoints. And then I'd walk back by and it would be predator drones to be operated
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.880]  by the UN worldwide. And then I walked back by and it was drones to be armed in the US.
[09:31.880 --> 09:40.700]  And then I walked back by and it said, Alex Jones, revolution coming. It's just totally
[09:40.700 --> 09:47.880]  bizarre. How crazy things have gotten. And I got in here about an hour before showtime
[09:47.880 --> 09:56.000]  this morning and they handed me a email from Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.520]  Network who runs a nationwide famous private investigation outfit that doesn't work for
[10:02.520 --> 10:05.840]  the feds and state and local government.
[10:05.840 --> 10:13.320]  And he described how I was surveilled in New York. And what happened where, things I haven't
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.880]  even talked about. Because even though I've mentioned being tailed and harassed, it's
[10:17.880 --> 10:23.140]  quite frankly kind of embarrassing that I ran. But I did it cuz my gut said, get out
[10:23.140 --> 10:29.020]  of here, they wanna set you up. They can drop something on you, they can stab you, whatever.
[10:29.020 --> 10:33.960]  And it was clear that they were tracking us by our cell phones. Because whenever I come
[10:33.960 --> 10:36.360]  around a corner, they'd be looking at the phone and then look up and then walk into
[10:36.360 --> 10:38.080]  a wall and then start tailing us.
[10:38.080 --> 10:41.460]  They were following us. Just like when your wife knows your number, she can track you
[10:41.460 --> 10:45.680]  exactly down to the foot of where you're at. You're driving down a road trying to find
[10:45.680 --> 10:49.560]  something and your pin is blue, it's moving. Where you're going is the red pin down to
[10:49.560 --> 10:55.760]  feet. Those systems were designed and put into phones by the Telecommunications Act
[10:55.760 --> 11:01.800]  of 96. And not only could I tell they were what I've seen New York detectives look like
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.200]  in videos where they're tailing Luke Rudowski and harassing him.
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.060]  And when I've been covering events and seen Bloomberg surrounded by them, I knew because
[11:10.060 --> 11:15.800]  I'd walk around a corner no matter where I went. And there'd be guys getting out of a
[11:15.800 --> 11:19.840]  car and then going like this and they're looking at their phones. Or I'd walk around a corner,
[11:19.840 --> 11:22.320]  there'd be guys looking at their phones and looking up.
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.780]  And then if you looked at them, they'd say, hey, hi, Alex, big fan. And then it'll give
[11:26.780 --> 11:30.560]  you a dirty look. And then you're walking in, they've got the guys there, you're walking
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.440]  out, you tell security, I don't wanna go out this door. Bloomberg's people are out there.
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.760]  And the guy's like, you're going out this door. I go, but that's a mall entrance. It's
[11:39.760 --> 11:44.280]  right there, I can see out the door. And he goes, I'm not opening that for you. And you
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.960]  could see the glass out into the mall.
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.160]  And I said, I wanna go over there. And he said, I'm not gonna open that door. I said,
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.280]  fine, get your camera rolling. So we started to go out the other door and got one shot
[11:55.280 --> 12:00.520]  of a guy you see talking into his windbreaker. And then he turns as we walk out, and he sees
[12:00.520 --> 12:02.480]  the camera and puts his face in the wall.
[12:02.480 --> 12:05.640]  People say, well, why not confront him? I look down the street and two more of them
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.300]  are coming up going, that's him. And I'm like, whoa, cops aren't this confident unless they're
[12:10.300 --> 12:13.840]  about to set something up. And I just said, please, God, let there be a taxi, cuz taxis
[12:13.840 --> 12:14.840]  never stop.
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.160]  And I went like this and a taxi stopped. We got in and got out of there. And do the review
[12:18.160 --> 12:21.760]  and the tape, I said, try to get some footage. I mean, and again, we get to the hotel, now
[12:21.760 --> 12:25.720]  the street's blocked off, little bitty boutique hotel they put us in. There's a Starbucks
[12:25.720 --> 12:33.160]  right there. And we went, got our bags, went and got a cab, and said, go to New Jersey
[12:33.160 --> 12:34.920]  because that's where our flight was out of anyways.
[12:34.920 --> 12:38.200]  That's where the main direct flights out of Austin go to Newark. Went to a hotel, got
[12:38.200 --> 12:44.440]  out of there. And that happened, and then Doug Hagman, I haven't even told one-tenth
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.980]  story, sends me an email saying, this is what my federal source said. This is what they
[12:48.980 --> 12:54.200]  did to you. Good thing you didn't go to the Starbucks across the street because that's
[12:54.200 --> 12:58.040]  where they were gonna set you up with a woman who's gonna come up and get in your face.
[12:58.040 --> 13:01.800]  And then they only use selective video of me saying get back or whatever to make me
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.560]  look like I'm attacking a woman. And they've tried that before, folks. I mean, this is
[13:05.560 --> 13:13.160]  right out of movies, which is based on the real story in JFK, where the district attorney
[13:13.160 --> 13:17.160]  Garrison goes in the bathroom at the airport.
[13:17.160 --> 13:22.520]  And the guy starts running in the stall trying to have sex with him, and then he runs out.
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.000]  And then the police are like, hey, stop, but by then he's already gone. And see, if you
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.520]  haven't lived this, ladies and gentlemen, you don't know. And you've seen the footage
[13:30.520 --> 13:35.080]  of us tailed, and then they go ahead and pull us over in Canada, and it's cops, or they
[13:35.080 --> 13:41.840]  arrest us, or Bilderberg Group Security is talking to their lapels and following us,
[13:41.840 --> 13:48.320]  getting in the car, speeding after us, Secret Service questioning us, Bohemian Grove.
[13:48.320 --> 13:51.600]  I told you that I went with History Channel and that they got arrested, and I jumped in
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.400]  the river and swam off. And later, six months later, they air the piece. And sure enough,
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.920]  there's the video of it. People are like, well, where's your footage? I'm sorry, I jumped
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.920]  in the river.
[14:00.920 --> 14:08.560]  I mean, I wasn't going to jail with the police. I mean, this is the real life I live, okay?
[14:08.560 --> 14:12.920]  It's real. And I know for those of you that have not been on the front lines as a real
[14:12.920 --> 14:19.560]  journalist, I'm not trying to make it Gonzo journalism, where I'm the story. Believe me,
[14:19.560 --> 14:28.800]  I want nothing more than to not be here and to not have to do this.
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.520]  I want nothing more than to just live in a free country. You know how creepy it is to
[14:32.520 --> 14:38.560]  have multiple people, including an ambassador's daughter on Piers Morgan two nights ago, talking
[14:38.560 --> 14:45.440]  about how great it would be to see me shot and killed and how I need to be popped. And
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.840]  those security people, their little CIA style FBI suits at CNN, I'm telling them, I want
[14:51.840 --> 14:55.040]  to go out the mall entrance, because I've seen that, and I go, I want to go out in the
[14:55.040 --> 14:56.040]  open mall.
[14:56.040 --> 15:00.640]  And they go, no, you're not, you're not, you're not. And I go, no, I want to go, okay, okay,
[15:00.640 --> 15:03.400]  we'll go by there. And I go, okay, there it is. They go, I'm not opening that door, because
[15:03.400 --> 15:09.600]  I have to open it for you. And I went, come on, and the guy just laughed. He goes, no,
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.320]  you're going out there. And he was really excited, you're going out there.
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.560]  And he walks out, and you see, again, some guys turn this way, and this other guy walks
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.440]  in the wall, and I walk out and more are coming. And then he was trying to stop me. We're starting
[15:23.440 --> 15:27.040]  to go to the cabin, he goes, wait, wait. And I go, what? And he goes, give me your badges,
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.120]  or little paper badges that have to be, and I just threw it at him.
[15:30.120 --> 15:35.680]  But the point is, and then he's looking as I drive off like, I mean, it's just trash.
[15:35.680 --> 15:39.820]  They all want to play Mafia. Well, you know what, I got there, I covered it, I got the
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.920]  information out. We're going to analyze and go through the little bit of footage we do
[15:42.920 --> 15:50.680]  have. Do put some of it out. The first night he was back, actually. But this is the type
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.160]  of stuff we deal with.
[15:54.160 --> 16:00.880]  And I have been so busy fighting the globalist. Since I got back, you'll have to bear with
[16:00.880 --> 16:04.720]  me that everybody's got these incredible chest colds right now. And I've had this one for
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.100]  weeks. I thought it was just allergy related, but actually had a fever last night. So I'm
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.100]  not complaining.
[16:10.100 --> 16:12.780]  I just want you to know I am under the weather here. If you hear the wheezing and stuff on
[16:12.780 --> 16:18.760]  air or occasional coughing, it's just too important at times to not be here. John is
[16:18.760 --> 16:25.620]  with the chest colds where you've got to focus just not to go into a coughing fit on air.
[16:25.620 --> 16:34.480]  But Hagman's joining us coming up. I thought I would play first a clip just to remind you
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.040]  that after this happens, they come on the next night and talk about how they want to
[16:38.040 --> 16:39.040]  pop me.
[16:39.040 --> 16:42.600]  How great it would be to see Piers Morgan in a uniform killing me. Because that's their
[16:42.600 --> 16:47.680]  fantasy, the state, the power, the uniform. We're gonna execute you like somebody in a
[16:47.680 --> 16:54.760]  ditch in Nazi Germany. Let's queue up. Buzz Bissinger says, popping, and they agree, clip
[16:54.760 --> 16:55.760]  number three.
[16:55.760 --> 17:00.800]  And then we're gonna go to a compilation of Rob Dew that he aired last night of Doug Hagman
[17:00.800 --> 17:06.700]  from the 27th saying they're getting ready to go after even physically pro gun groups.
[17:06.700 --> 17:10.760]  And then tied into Conan O'Brien attacking me, putting a gun in my hand with a computer
[17:10.760 --> 17:16.120]  animation and all the rest of it. But here is Buzz Bissinger, here it is.
[17:16.120 --> 17:21.080]  But what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for? The only reason I think you need it is
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.440]  Pierce, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got
[17:26.440 --> 17:27.940]  legally and pop him.
[17:27.940 --> 17:31.840]  I'd love to see that, in uniform.
[17:31.840 --> 17:32.840]  I'll borrow my brother's uniform.
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.840]  I don't think guns are worth more than the answer.
[17:34.840 --> 17:37.480]  There you go, I'll borrow my brother's uniform. And then there's the part about, we hope his
[17:37.480 --> 17:42.320]  kids don't get killed one night. We hope his kids don't kill him really, I hope they don't
[17:42.320 --> 17:47.960]  get killed. And on and on and on and on and on.
[17:47.960 --> 17:48.960]  And-
[17:48.960 --> 17:52.900]  I don't want Alex Jones to get the phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning that one of his
[17:52.900 --> 17:59.200]  children have been shot and killed by somebody who shouldn't have a handgun or a rifle or
[17:59.200 --> 18:02.240]  a automatic weapon. I don't want him to get that.
[18:02.240 --> 18:06.000]  Yeah, thank you for talking about my kids in the same episode. I mean, a five year old
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.440]  would understand exactly what all this is about. And then I get this, I mean, Doug Hagman
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.840]  definitely has the sources, he says, cuz the sources I have send me a Homeland Security
[18:16.840 --> 18:20.900]  document or a tip.
[18:20.900 --> 18:27.720]  But I mean, Doug Hagman on the East Coast, I mean, he describes what happened here. I
[18:27.720 --> 18:31.280]  mean, sure, there are a lot of Starbucks in New York and things, but I mean, he described
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.520]  that there was a Starbucks right by the hotel and that's where they were planning to confront
[18:36.520 --> 18:37.520]  me.
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.640]  I mean, imagine we show up and the streets are blocked around our little hotel, a little
[18:41.640 --> 18:48.120]  boutique hotel. And there's more guys out front and I walk in, there's more guys inside.
[18:48.120 --> 18:51.740]  These weren't guys in dark suits that were the bellman or the hotel security. They had
[18:51.740 --> 18:56.760]  eyes for you know who. And it just went on and on. I was like, wow, what are they planning?
[18:56.760 --> 18:57.760]  What were they planning?
[18:57.760 --> 19:03.880]  Well, he says he knows that all his DHS sources, they were gonna get into a confrontation with
[19:03.880 --> 19:10.360]  me. And my gut was don't let them get in a conversation with you. They're gonna set you
[19:10.360 --> 19:16.120]  up somehow. Whether it was drugs or say that crackhead shot me, I don't know. But man,
[19:16.120 --> 19:25.080]  they were so angry and these guys were looking at me like they wanted to kill me.
[19:25.080 --> 19:28.760]  And again, this is what they want to do to all of us. They hate the fact we've got guns
[19:28.760 --> 19:31.840]  and they can't just go around arresting us all. You notice they're all saying gun owners
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.060]  are the new terrorists, conservatives, libertarians, new terrorists. That's all the homeland security.
[19:36.060 --> 19:40.480]  And if gun owners cower to this, if we get into this, it's over. This is a mafia takeover.
[19:40.480 --> 19:45.920]  That's what the new world order is. It's an organized crime syndicate takeover. We've
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.200]  got all the clips where they're announcing, yeah, we're gonna go after your guns.
[19:49.200 --> 19:54.760]  And no, the president can't take your guns with an executive order CNN said this morning.
[19:54.760 --> 20:01.320]  They can use existing rulings with an executive order to take your guns. Just amazing spin.
[20:01.320 --> 20:06.160]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.740]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[20:10.740 --> 20:15.680]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything at e foods

[20:19.920 --> 20:25.360]  by having a supply of food on hand after hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York city wrote, almost
[20:25.360 --> 20:30.200]  all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just in time to
[20:30.200 --> 20:35.000]  be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.040]  one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you heed the warnings and do what Alex

[23:59.840 --> 24:12.880]  We're back live, Alex Jones here. We're going to get into all the attacks, the talk of executive
[24:12.880 --> 24:17.280]  orders, Cuomo, getting all excited, saying we're going to get their guns. Yay! Well,
[24:17.280 --> 24:20.760]  I thought I wasn't supposed to get excited. I thought I wasn't supposed to get in their
[24:20.760 --> 24:26.160]  face. You know, we're told sit down, shut up, be gentlemanly while we are basically
[24:26.160 --> 24:31.160]  gang raped financially and politically by the New World Order.
[24:31.160 --> 24:37.240]  Our forebears went to war over being disarmed. Imagine some of these ninnying mainline conservatives
[24:37.240 --> 24:40.940]  that are like, Alex shouldn't have gotten in his face. Well, our country wouldn't even
[24:40.940 --> 24:47.760]  exist if people hadn't gotten in the red coat's face. We've gotten here by laying down and
[24:47.760 --> 24:50.120]  becoming comfortable with basically anything.
[24:50.120 --> 24:55.620]  Let me tell you, have you noticed no other national TV has wanted me on? Even though
[24:55.620 --> 25:02.160]  Piers Morgan's ratings doubled to a million from 500,000, his highest ratings ever the
[25:02.160 --> 25:09.320]  night after I was on. Next night 800 and something thousand, it's already dropping. You think
[25:09.320 --> 25:11.220]  they'd all want me on?
[25:11.220 --> 25:14.800]  They were crying, they were panicked, they were hyperventilating because they want to
[25:14.800 --> 25:20.960]  keep you in an NPR trance. Smart guy Billy Corrigan sent me a text message, he said,
[25:20.960 --> 25:24.820]  right after it, he said, you just broke the hypnosis best I ever saw. I didn't even intend
[25:24.820 --> 25:25.820]  to do that.
[25:25.820 --> 25:31.280]  But that's what it did, it breaks the comfort zone, it gets us up, it gets us awake. They
[25:31.280 --> 25:37.860]  use the Lord of the Rings analogy like when Wormer Grimewood has got the King of Gondar,
[25:37.860 --> 25:42.920]  or the King of Rohan is in a trance and he's like, I'm old, I can't fight the evil. And
[25:42.920 --> 25:47.240]  Gandalf breaks the spell and says, arise.
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.920]  And then the weakness leaves his eyes. We need to pray to God to break this spell the
[25:51.920 --> 25:57.260]  globalist to put over us, that's what it is. We need a pep rally for liberty. That's why
[25:57.260 --> 26:01.640]  they wanted to intimidate me and set me up because they know they're finally going from
[26:01.640 --> 26:05.360]  he doesn't exist to this guy has a giant audience, tens of millions.
[26:05.360 --> 26:09.080]  We've got to stop him, he's dangerous. Glenn Beck saying the same thing, cuz they all come
[26:09.080 --> 26:17.600]  from the same area wanting to act like there's separation between these groups. They're factions
[26:17.600 --> 26:27.420]  of the same sewage line. And here is a compilation of clips from Doug Hagman on where this is
[26:27.420 --> 26:29.840]  coming up in a minute, from the 27th.
[26:29.840 --> 26:37.320]  And then everything he talked about coming true with Colonel Bryan, 28, putting a gun
[26:37.320 --> 26:41.000]  in my hand on the show like I was shooting him. I mean, this is the type of stuff that
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.380]  he said, that's funny, but it's the image it sells. Here is Hagman talking about what
[26:45.380 --> 26:47.040]  was coming in the future, here it is.
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.160]  My source told me pretty much exactly what their plans are and what their contingency
[26:53.160 --> 27:00.160]  plans are. They've got plan A, B, C, and D, whereas one of my sources calls that a no
[27:00.160 --> 27:05.680]  single point failure. So they're gonna come at us on multiple levels. It's just not gonna
[27:05.680 --> 27:07.640]  be the legislative level.
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.840]  It's going to be through executive orders, through global initiatives, through health
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.200]  initiatives. It's really an insidious situation.
[27:17.200 --> 27:23.040]  If the president is going to act, there are executive orders, executive action that can
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.760]  be taken. We haven't decided what that is yet.
[27:26.760 --> 27:30.200]  And they're not only coming after the guns, Alex, they're coming after the mouthpieces.
[27:30.200 --> 27:36.280]  They're coming after the Alex Joneses of the world and Doug Hagman's and others who speak
[27:36.280 --> 27:37.280]  the truth.
[27:37.280 --> 27:42.460]  But tonight, I'll go head to head with a man who actually wants to deport me for having
[27:42.460 --> 27:43.800]  these very views.
[27:43.800 --> 27:49.800]  They are going to marginalize us before they take us down. They're going to make us look
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.800]  foolish, to make us look like fools on the internet before they pull the plug, obviously.
[27:55.800 --> 28:01.720]  Now the two men debated gun control. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Alex was the one who
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.000]  took the pro-gun position.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.400]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms. We
[28:09.400 --> 28:19.120]  will not relinquish them. Do you understand? Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns.
[28:19.120 --> 28:25.240]  No one's taking away all the guns, according to my source, the very first people to be
[28:25.240 --> 28:26.240]  rounded up.
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.720]  The very first targets, if you will, on the radar of this regime are the people that are
[28:31.720 --> 28:38.280]  speaking the truth about what's taking place. Alex Jones, Doug Hagman and others like us
[28:38.280 --> 28:43.640]  who are getting to the heart of the matter, we are the targets for not only the censorship,
[28:43.640 --> 28:45.240]  but for what's coming after that.
[28:45.240 --> 28:53.040]  What's coming after that is the actual, the physical part of it to take us out of the
[28:53.040 --> 28:55.720]  fight before it really begins.
[28:55.720 --> 29:01.000]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  and pop them.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.760]  I'd love to see that, in uniform.
[29:05.760 --> 29:09.680]  There you go, and if you're a radio listener, we were putting articles up during that Fox
[29:09.680 --> 29:14.520]  News YouTube gun enthusiast shooting death spurs hunt for suspect. He owned a gun making
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.920]  factory, FPS Russian, he was the guy behind it all, tied down in a chair, shot in the
[29:19.920 --> 29:21.520]  back of the head.
[29:21.520 --> 29:26.960]  Some evidence is coming out, tortured, no guns or money taken. Another top manufacturer
[29:26.960 --> 29:31.520]  of firearms who was going public, exposing government, drugging of the kids being behind
[29:31.520 --> 29:35.760]  it, he is dead now. And it looks like some more deaths are developing. We're going to
[29:35.760 --> 29:40.520]  be breaking all this down, ladies and gentlemen. If this continues, it's not just a pattern,
[29:40.520 --> 29:41.520]  we know what's going on.

[33:37.000 --> 33:43.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide. And we're gonna go
[33:43.240 --> 33:49.920]  through some clips here. We've got Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network on the
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.960]  line with us. And I got an email from him today and it's up on his website right now.
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.000]  Kurt Nemo is gonna be posting it at infowars.com and getting it out to folks. And we're also
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.760]  gonna give you his website so you can go look it up for yourself, but it's homelandsecurityus.com.
[34:06.760 --> 34:13.160]  And that night when I went on Piers Morgan, the first two or three times somebody pops
[34:13.160 --> 34:16.920]  out of a doorway and says, hey, I'm a big fan. You're just walking down a random street
[34:16.920 --> 34:22.040]  and they look just like a undercover cop. And one time you see the gun on their side.
[34:22.040 --> 34:25.920]  You're like, okay, but then when you start seeing guys in your hotel looking at you like
[34:25.920 --> 34:31.080]  they wanna kill you and they're obviously off duty police or detective types. And then
[34:31.080 --> 34:33.920]  when you notice you're being followed or you notice they're out front CNN and when you
[34:33.920 --> 34:37.720]  come out, they're out there. We even have some footage of one of these guys.
[34:37.720 --> 34:42.380]  It gets really crazy. And my gut was, and my dad never calls me, not when I snuck in
[34:42.380 --> 34:46.040]  Bohemian Grove. He knew I was about to do it, not when I'm at Bilderberg. My dad called
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.320]  me and said, you know what, I think you oughta watch your back and get out of New York as
[34:50.320 --> 34:53.360]  quick as you can. I said, well, it's funny, we're flying out of New Jersey in the morning.
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.360]  I'm gonna go ahead and just go to another hotel there. I'm leaving now. So that went
[34:57.360 --> 34:58.360]  on.
[34:58.360 --> 35:03.160]  Then the next night, and I've played this clip at Nauseam. We'll play it again coming
[35:03.160 --> 35:16.320]  up here in a few minutes. I am simply watching the next episode of Piers Morgan. And one
[35:16.320 --> 35:20.160]  guy says, man, gee, I hope his kids don't get killed some night. And I'm thinking, that's
[35:20.160 --> 35:21.160]  not a veiled threat.
[35:21.160 --> 35:23.880]  Well, that was creepy the way they said that. And then they go to the next guest, they go,
[35:23.880 --> 35:27.680]  yeah, you oughta get a gun and pop him, shoot him. And then the other guest goes, yeah,
[35:27.680 --> 35:30.680]  and you can wear a uniform. And Piers like, I'll get my brother's uniform. I guess he's
[35:30.680 --> 35:33.980]  in the military or something. And it's just all bizarre.
[35:33.980 --> 35:37.520]  And then these tweets, people say they wanna kill me and all this stuff. The point is,
[35:37.520 --> 35:42.360]  is this really went on. I've been all over the place. I've gone in Bullhorned Buckingham
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.920]  Palace in the Parliament. I've gone and been there when there's mass arrest at the DNC
[35:46.920 --> 35:53.280]  in New York. I've gone and been covering the DNC in Denver.
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.660]  And guys run up and start screaming, kill Michelle Malkin with video shooting from in
[35:57.660 --> 36:01.120]  front with a guy right behind me. I'm like, why is he behind me screaming, kill Michelle
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.860]  Malkin? Well, it was so they could put it out instantly on the wires. The news just
[36:04.860 --> 36:05.860]  went with it.
[36:05.860 --> 36:10.640]  It was a setup saying I said, kill her. So I've learned about dirty tricks. And thank
[36:10.640 --> 36:14.240]  God we had our own footage later, put it out showing I wasn't saying that it was guys behind
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.820]  me by the grace of God. They tried to destroy me with that. It was like the headlines were.
[36:17.820 --> 36:23.440]  The end of Alex Jones, he says, kill woman. Now we were in a boutique hotel CNN put us
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.160]  in. And I'm checking into this thing at like four o'clock in the afternoon Monday, and
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.320]  I'm looking around me.
[36:31.320 --> 36:40.260]  I'm looking around me. And I see, I mean, have you been to enough events to cover stuff,
[36:40.260 --> 36:43.520]  you know what detectives look like. And you know what they look like in New York City.
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.180]  And you know what they look like when they're undercover. They stick out like sore thumbs
[36:46.180 --> 36:50.200]  with windbreakers or sports jackets and they're looking at you.
[36:50.200 --> 36:53.280]  You can tell they're accustomed to authority and doing whatever they want, especially in
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.220]  New York. And if you say something to them, they're like, hey, how you doing? I mean,
[36:58.220 --> 37:02.200]  it's ridiculous. Or you walk out the door and they see you and start talking in their
[37:02.200 --> 37:04.440]  sleeve and then turn and then walk into a wall.
[37:04.440 --> 37:08.640]  I mean, yeah, absolutely. In fact, if you're a TV watcher, he's gonna roll some of the
[37:08.640 --> 37:12.680]  video on one of the guys. As we leave CNN Center, I'm like, hey, start rolling. I see
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.880]  one of them. Dude turns the camera on instantly. And the guy talking into his sleeve, he then
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.320]  goes back. I don't know if dude got it, but he starts walking into the wall.
[37:22.320 --> 37:28.200]  As soon as he sees the camera, he turns and walks into the wall to get away from the camera.
[37:28.200 --> 37:31.680]  And then there are two more guys coming up. So I hail a taxi. You can even see it. See
[37:31.680 --> 37:35.840]  the taxi? That taxi's pulling up with the grace of God. I hail it and get in as more
[37:35.840 --> 37:37.600]  guys dressed just like him.
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.520]  I imagine you're walking around town and these guys come out of doorways and go, hey, Alex,
[37:42.520 --> 37:46.840]  how you doing? Obviously, always looking down at their cell phones. You say, well, some
[37:46.840 --> 37:51.760]  of them could have been listers. Yeah, maybe one out of the seven or whatever. And then
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.880]  it's not on tape, but he turns, his dude starts going over to him for a second and walking
[37:55.880 --> 37:56.880]  into the wall.
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.680]  And I said, dude, I remember doing that. I said, dude, come on. I'm like taxi. And see,
[38:02.680 --> 38:06.080]  I'm looking back right there at two more guys coming up the street dressed just like him
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.340]  so they can all recognize each other. Okay, and then I look down the street and I see
[38:11.340 --> 38:17.720]  the taxi. I hail it, it stops, I get out of there. Unbelievable, and you see me right
[38:17.720 --> 38:18.720]  there looking back.
[38:18.720 --> 38:23.000]  And dude was gonna confront him and my instinct was, get out of here. Normally, I'll confront
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.760]  him. I'm like, wait a minute, they're turf right outside. Why are they doing this? Boom,
[38:28.760 --> 38:35.400]  it happens. Okay, that said, Doug, I'm gonna give you the floor to roll. I want you to
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.800]  go through the entire write up that your source gave you, what this signifies, and I'm gonna
[38:39.800 --> 38:43.920]  play some of the clips here, okay?
[38:43.920 --> 38:50.720]  I wanna play some of the clips here, but I'm gonna give you the floor till we go to break
[38:50.720 --> 38:55.120]  in about ten minutes. Because if I ever start interrupting, I'll just interrupt. I want
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.840]  you to go through your story because here's what happened. Sure, there are 100 Starbucks
[38:58.840 --> 38:59.840]  in New York or more.
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.800]  I was in a little boutique about ten blocks away from there, no Starbucks around, right
[39:03.800 --> 39:08.040]  on the corner. We come back, the road is blocked around the hotel suddenly. There's more of
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.280]  these guys out there. I see people looking at me out the Starbucks, and I said, this
[39:12.280 --> 39:13.280]  is a setup.
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.400]  And dude's like, yeah, let's get out of here. I don't know what they were planning. But
[39:18.400 --> 39:24.720]  your guy, from everything he said, now I know you're 100% for real. Because there's stuff
[39:24.720 --> 39:29.480]  in here I didn't tell anybody. But because, quite frankly, it sounds crazy, but I knew
[39:29.480 --> 39:33.320]  I had to get out of there, so I shot the video before I left the hotel, picked my bags up
[39:33.320 --> 39:34.520]  and left.
[39:34.520 --> 39:41.280]  So Northeast Intelligence Network, law enforcement, certified, 30 years, private investigator,
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.440]  working with the feds, the state, you name it. Doug Hagman, you were here with us a week
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.320]  and a half ago, on the 27th and 28th. You said they're gonna start targeting us with
[39:49.320 --> 39:50.840]  dirty tricks, but also physically.
[39:50.840 --> 39:54.040]  Now there's been prominent deaths with the number one gun show in the world that was
[39:54.040 --> 39:58.580]  pro Second Amendment, the guy that runs it, killed execution style, others being killed.
[39:58.580 --> 40:00.640]  What is happening, Doug Hagman, you have the floor.
[40:00.640 --> 40:06.320]  All right, Alex, well, thank you for having me. And I gotta tell you, I was quite surprised.
[40:06.320 --> 40:13.240]  I did catch your appearance on Piers Morgan. I had no idea where you were staying. I had
[40:13.240 --> 40:16.240]  no idea what your itinerary was, who you're with, or whatever.
[40:16.240 --> 40:19.480]  We have not talked until now. Exactly, exactly.
[40:19.480 --> 40:21.720]  I couldn't get a hold of you yesterday, go ahead.
[40:21.720 --> 40:30.120]  Yeah, I was away yesterday. And when I had contacted my DHS source, the individual who
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.640]  had given me the information, I appeared on your show with last time. And he said, I wanna
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.880]  tell you something that I found out is very disturbing. And if you could relay this to
[40:39.880 --> 40:43.640]  Mr. Jones and the gentleman that he was traveling with.
[40:43.640 --> 40:49.720]  Now, apparently, you were traveling with another individual. I don't know. My information,
[40:49.720 --> 40:58.160]  direct information from you is zero. And in terms of the situation is kind of spotty anyway.
[40:58.160 --> 41:05.080]  So I'm not exactly certain other than what he told me. He said, look, here's the deal.
[41:05.080 --> 41:12.640]  He said, your itinerary, Alex, your itinerary, as soon as the wheels were down in New York,
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.940]  you were under active surveillance by at least two federal agencies.
[41:17.940 --> 41:24.500]  One of the two being the Department of Homeland Security. Three men teams of surveillance.
[41:24.500 --> 41:29.560]  We don't know how many, I was not told how many total agents were involved in this, but
[41:29.560 --> 41:36.000]  you were under active surveillance. But not only just covert surveillance, because that's
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.740]  normal surveillance. This was a bumper lock type surveillance. And I wrote a textbook
[41:40.740 --> 41:48.160]  on surveillance that's used for law enforcement training as well as college courses for Homeland
[41:48.160 --> 41:49.160]  Security.
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.240]  So I understand the different types of surveillance we're talking about. But bumper lock surveillance
[41:53.240 --> 42:00.320]  is where you make your presence known to the subject you're following. And the words from
[42:00.320 --> 42:06.560]  my source were this. The instructions to the teams were bumper lock him, make it obvious.
[42:06.560 --> 42:13.880]  Do whatever you can, just make sure he knows. Handle him as a hostile. Which tells me that
[42:13.880 --> 42:20.000]  they wanted you to know that you were being followed, at least during part of the operation.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.120]  Now from what I sense and what I had deducted from my conversation with my source, there
[42:25.120 --> 42:29.440]  were a couple of different operations going on here. The first of all was the attempt
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.180]  to psychologically intimidate you. Now from what I understand, and again, I don't know
[42:34.180 --> 42:39.980]  if you recorded it, I don't know what time, if it was live or whatever, but some of this
[42:39.980 --> 42:44.540]  happened before the surveillance happened, obviously before the interview as well as
[42:44.540 --> 42:46.520]  after the interview.
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.160]  But the bumper lock type of surveillance, the physical intimidation, was especially
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.240]  before the interview. And I suspect that would be to destabilize you, to kind of keep you
[42:55.240 --> 43:02.900]  off guard. And that's what that was. But you had three-man teams actually, three-man teams
[43:02.900 --> 43:08.520]  of operatives following you around. Now the other part of this, the other side of this
[43:08.520 --> 43:14.840]  story, and this is something that didn't shock me, didn't really surprise me, but alerted
[43:14.840 --> 43:21.160]  me, and I alluded to this in our interview the last time we spoke, was you were going
[43:21.160 --> 43:27.200]  to be set up, Alex, and that's the long and short of it, you were going to be set up.
[43:27.200 --> 43:34.840]  It's important that you were to know that there was a woman by a Starbucks. And again,
[43:34.840 --> 43:40.160]  I don't know where you were, I don't know if you passed a Starbucks or if you were in
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.280]  New York City. But apparently, you were to be accosted by or have some sort of physical
[43:45.280 --> 43:52.760]  altercation with a female in front of or near a Starbucks. Now I know that they're prolific
[43:52.760 --> 43:58.280]  in New York City. I guess it wouldn't be a stretch, but nonetheless, if one was close
[43:58.280 --> 44:03.560]  to the studio or your hotel or whatever, I would imagine, or however, if you pass by
[44:03.560 --> 44:04.740]  one.
[44:04.740 --> 44:10.480]  With the intent, Alex, to make you look to embarrass you, in other words, and there was
[44:10.480 --> 44:17.180]  a video surveillance too, let me just reinforce that. In addition to the obvious overt bumper
[44:17.180 --> 44:23.720]  lock surveillance, there was a video surveillance. So the intent of this female was to accost
[44:23.720 --> 44:31.360]  you in a way that you would have to push her off or do something to get her away from you.
[44:31.360 --> 44:39.560]  That would then be on videotape or on disc, on security camera, covert surveillance, footage
[44:39.560 --> 44:44.160]  taken covertly, and then used against you to marginalize you, to show that you were
[44:44.160 --> 44:50.760]  a violent man, to show that you're out of control. And the fact that it would be a woman
[44:50.760 --> 44:53.960]  makes it even more hideous.
[44:53.960 --> 45:01.260]  And then that's what my source told me. That's with respect to your presence in New York
[45:01.260 --> 45:06.700]  City. That's also my understanding. And I don't know this for a fact that this also
[45:06.700 --> 45:13.880]  was interstate, or yes, interstate, and also may have involved another state, New Jersey,
[45:13.880 --> 45:17.760]  where they crossed the state lines into New Jersey as well. But the fact of the matter
[45:17.760 --> 45:25.680]  is the orders for surveillance came from the higher levels of DHS. This was a DHS sanctioned
[45:25.680 --> 45:26.680]  operation.
[45:26.680 --> 45:31.600]  This is not an NYPD thing. Now, it's possible that the NYPD-
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.720]  Okay, I mean, they just look like NYPD detectives I'd seen. They didn't look like feds. I mean,
[45:36.720 --> 45:38.240]  they look like scary guys.
[45:38.240 --> 45:44.960]  Oh, I'm sure they did. And it's also possible too. I did not get a lot of details. The contact
[45:44.960 --> 45:50.340]  I had with my source was pretty short, pretty narrow in terms of information, pretty abrupt.
[45:50.340 --> 45:56.120]  But that's the bottom line, that this was a DHS headed operation involving at least
[45:56.120 --> 46:01.360]  one other federal agency. And by the way, there was coordination. And I don't know,
[46:01.360 --> 46:08.000]  I'm not familiar with CNN or their security staff, but there was coordination there with
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.320]  building security as well.
[46:09.320 --> 46:15.280]  Oh, no, the guy was laughing at me. I said, listen, I want to go out. I saw a mall entrance
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.600]  because it's built onto a giant mall. I said, I want to go out there. And they said, no,
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.760]  you're going out there and really enjoyed shoving me out on the street with one guy
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.760]  that turned and walked into the wall looking right at us. Two more guys, by the grace of
[46:26.760 --> 46:31.320]  God, I got that cab. My instinct said, get in the cab, get out of here.
[46:31.320 --> 46:36.800]  You did well. I mean, follow that little voice, but you did well because had you fallen into
[46:36.800 --> 46:42.720]  any one of these traps that they had set up for you, things could have turned dramatically
[46:42.720 --> 46:48.880]  different for you. And this is one thing too, that the high profile people, the gun owners,
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.880]  the people that speak out, the proponents of the second amendment, the proponents of
[46:52.880 --> 46:57.920]  the constitution, we are in trouble. We are targets for this kind of thing. And people
[46:57.920 --> 47:02.840]  think, oh, this doesn't happen. No, it happens all the time. Well, not all the time. It happens
[47:02.840 --> 47:10.960]  more than you think. And it's sanctioned activity because what better way, what better way can
[47:10.960 --> 47:19.360]  they take us out of the fight by marginalizing us by push a woman or you're caught doing
[47:19.360 --> 47:23.080]  something. They take the video and edit it so it looks
[47:23.080 --> 47:28.760]  a little bit different. And what I have seen are clips from the late night show that you'd
[47:28.760 --> 47:35.120]  shown where you had a gun in your hand. Shooting people in there.
[47:35.120 --> 47:42.440]  Yeah, it's ridiculous. So you know the capabilities obviously of what they're capable of.
[47:42.440 --> 47:46.280]  Why do you think the next night they came on and make cryptic statements about my children
[47:46.280 --> 47:50.680]  being killed at night and then cryptic statements about how they all want to shoot me and kill
[47:50.680 --> 47:55.120]  me and how much fun it would be? I don't have any direct information on that.
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.820]  So what I would say would be speculation. But once again, there's a destabilization
[48:00.820 --> 48:10.880]  factor to keep you off focus, off target. And we see this happen to others a lot. When
[48:10.880 --> 48:18.080]  you're fixated on a target, the most vulnerable thing, the most vulnerable you can be is when
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.920]  they start talking about your wife, your children, your parents, if they're elderly, they do
[48:22.920 --> 48:28.960]  this and they do it intentionally and maliciously with the intent to get you focused on something
[48:28.960 --> 48:33.140]  else and to even perhaps intimidate you into silence.
[48:33.140 --> 48:40.440]  This is not by accident. Those comments, for as many people, and it's funny because you
[48:40.440 --> 48:45.680]  could have someone in a studio, and I've seen this happen before in other situations, you
[48:45.680 --> 48:51.720]  can have somebody in a studio that they're told to say something about, oh, just go ahead
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.900]  and make a joke about, we know he's got kids or make a joke, we know he's got a family.
[48:56.900 --> 49:01.800]  Go ahead and make a joke with the family, if you can fit it in there. It's done by design
[49:01.800 --> 49:02.960]  and it's done to intimidate.
[49:02.960 --> 49:08.280]  No, that's exactly what they do. And so why does your DHS source reach out to you on this
[49:08.280 --> 49:10.600]  because they were concerned?
[49:10.600 --> 49:17.680]  Absolutely. My source is a God-fearing Christian man. He knows what's going on. He doesn't
[49:17.680 --> 49:23.260]  like it. He understands that there is a need for security for the United States, but there's
[49:23.260 --> 49:33.000]  not a need for this out-of-control, tyrannical, gun-grabbing police state that we are involved
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  in.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.320]  What do you make of SPS Russian, the head guy behind it being killed execution style,
[49:39.320 --> 49:43.160]  tied down in a chair, shot in the back of the head, nothing stolen from his factory?
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.560]  I gotta tell you, Alex, the first time I heard about it was yesterday. In fact, when I heard
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.440]  part of your program, I gotta tell you, I'm very concerned about this. I do think as we
[49:54.440 --> 49:58.960]  talked earlier about the purge, I think that there is a purge taking place.
[49:58.960 --> 50:04.880]  And as some of the more high profile people, they will set examples. They will take people
[50:04.880 --> 50:05.880]  out.
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.760]  And they canceled three gun shows that were top shows on Discovery. Another top manufacturer
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.600]  died very mysteriously. I've got that article out of Military Times. I mean, this is starting
[50:14.600 --> 50:18.480]  to get a little crazy. If we see a couple more of these, we know it's like a Clinton
[50:18.480 --> 50:20.960]  deathless type deal against gun owners.
[50:20.960 --> 50:24.560]  This is a globalist mafia we're dealing with. And if they can't get it legislatively, or
[50:24.560 --> 50:27.600]  if we won't go along with an executive order, I guess they think they're just gonna start
[50:27.600 --> 50:30.360]  going after us.
[50:30.360 --> 50:34.280]  And they think that they can get away with it. The hubris behind these people is something
[50:34.280 --> 50:39.940]  to be reckoned with and to be recognized. But that's also indicative of their weakness
[50:39.940 --> 50:44.480]  as well. We have to understand that these people are psychopaths. I mean, really, they're
[50:44.480 --> 50:53.760]  real psychopaths. The way they think, and people might think I'm crazy, but the Luciferian
[50:53.760 --> 50:57.520]  satanic agenda, that mindset, folks, that's real.
[50:57.520 --> 51:01.240]  It is. Stay there, investigative reporter and investigator.
[51:01.240 --> 51:05.300]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[51:05.300 --> 51:10.000]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.960]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[51:13.960 --> 51:17.480]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could
[51:17.480 --> 51:22.040]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[51:22.040 --> 51:28.480]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[51:28.480 --> 51:32.780]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[51:32.780 --> 51:36.920]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[51:36.920 --> 51:43.680]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[51:43.680 --> 51:55.400]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[51:55.400 --> 52:01.040]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[52:01.040 --> 52:06.040]  We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment. Hi, I'm
[52:06.040 --> 52:11.560]  Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA
[52:11.560 --> 52:17.880]  drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.640]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other
[52:22.640 --> 52:26.880]  tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like
[52:26.880 --> 52:32.560]  I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed
[52:32.560 --> 52:38.080]  to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA

[53:55.720 --> 54:15.160]  ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com. They don't want to see us tonight. All they want us to do
[54:15.160 --> 54:25.760]  is keep on pushing us higher. They don't want to see us live together. All they want us
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.280]  to do is keep on killing one another. All they want us to do is... Here's another song.
[54:30.280 --> 54:37.120]  I saw Sheriff John Brown coming down the street with a gun in his hand. You know that song?
[54:37.120 --> 54:44.360]  I shot the sheriff. What was I to do? He drew on me. See, we're supposed to just bend over
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.960]  to all this. And the American people aren't going to do that. And I'll say this on air.
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.400]  I probably in hindsight, I watched Larry Pratt last night destroy Piers Morgan. And at the
[54:53.400 --> 54:57.000]  end, he said, you're not my friend to him because he knew he'd been beaten. I wish I
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.440]  could do that more. And sometimes I've gone on shows and been very calm.
[55:00.440 --> 55:04.280]  But when you're got a chest cold, when you're angry, when you've just been messed with on
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.840]  the street, by detective after detective or whatever they were popping out of the dark,
[55:08.840 --> 55:14.200]  and you see all this, just the disgustingness of it, you get angry. And you know what, when
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.600]  we need to get out of our coma, I know a lot of limbing Americans sit there and they see
[55:18.600 --> 55:21.060]  somebody like me getting angry and they go, that's scary.
[55:21.060 --> 55:26.000]  You know what's scary is the drones in our skies and the NSA spying on us. And people
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.040]  don't even think I snuck into Bohemian Grove because they can't believe anything real was
[55:29.040 --> 55:32.960]  done. They can't believe I made films that have been seen, some of them 40, 50 million
[55:32.960 --> 55:43.280]  times online. I mean, I'm real. You're real. We can beat these globalists. But be honest,
[55:43.280 --> 55:51.000]  Doug Hagman, about, as you said, my performance on air, I think overall, like Billy Corgan
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.800]  said, it shocks people out of their hypnosis.
[55:56.800 --> 56:00.940]  I think overall it's gonna be positive, cuz folks can say, hey, makes gun owners look
[56:00.940 --> 56:05.360]  like aggressive people. Folks, our founders tarred and feathered people before the revolution.
[56:05.360 --> 56:08.920]  Our founders killed people that tried to take their rights. I'm not calling for that. What
[56:08.920 --> 56:13.520]  would they think of our founders today? I mean, I simply was there saying, look, I'm
[56:13.520 --> 56:14.880]  off the script.
[56:14.880 --> 56:21.040]  I know you want our guns to enslave us. Knock it off. And plus a foreigner here lecturing
[56:21.040 --> 56:26.440]  us and putting out tweets about how Americans are stupid scum and how he's conquering us.
[56:26.440 --> 56:30.880]  I mean, I'm angry at him. I'm angry I gotta risk my life up against these people. I'm
[56:30.880 --> 56:34.400]  angry they act like they care about us all day when they're a bunch of authoritarians.
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.720]  Doug, your take on this.
[56:37.720 --> 56:44.840]  One thing I have to say, Alex, I can guarantee you this. I do a radio show with my son every
[56:44.840 --> 56:52.320]  night and we were talking and one of the things that came up was this. When you said Piers
[56:52.320 --> 56:57.320]  Morgan, the hatchet man for the new world order, I can guarantee you that phrase will
[56:57.320 --> 57:01.840]  be remembered and remembered throughout television history.
[57:01.840 --> 57:07.340]  I can guarantee you that numerous things that you said will be remembered. But how many
[57:07.340 --> 57:12.400]  people for the next guest, I believe it was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, how many people remember
[57:12.400 --> 57:18.440]  what he said? Not too many, but how many people remembered what you said? All the viewers.
[57:18.440 --> 57:21.520]  So was mission accomplished in that respect? I believe it was.
[57:21.520 --> 57:27.240]  Exactly. They were crying, fuming, melting down. He looked like he'd had his blood drained
[57:27.240 --> 57:32.560]  and none of the national TVs invited me on. I mean, if I'm so discrediting, why not have
[57:32.560 --> 57:33.560]  me on?
[57:33.560 --> 57:40.200]  Sure. And you know, the anger issue, at what point? What's it going to take for Americans
[57:40.200 --> 57:44.820]  to get angry? I mean, we're seeing our mothers, our daughters, our aunts, our grandmothers
[57:44.820 --> 57:51.400]  being fondled at the airports. We're being treated like slaves. We're being physically
[57:51.400 --> 57:57.240]  molested. We have women, our wives. I mean, we're the men in this country. Where is the
[57:57.240 --> 58:03.300]  anger? It's easy to sit behind a keyboard to develop beer mussels, virtual beer mussels
[58:03.300 --> 58:07.720]  behind a keyboard, Alex. It's simple for somebody to do that. Sit back here and second guess
[58:07.720 --> 58:12.280]  anybody, second guess you, second guess me and say, well, you know, whatever. But the
[58:12.280 --> 58:18.200]  bottom line is this. We need to be angry. We need to show that anger. And the anger
[58:18.200 --> 58:19.440]  is a righteous anger.
[58:19.440 --> 58:22.480]  Well, it's more than that. We're getting to the end of the line here.
[58:22.480 --> 58:23.480]  Yes.
[58:23.480 --> 58:27.140]  Okay. I mean, there's two lights in the tunnel. One's a trend that's going to run us over.
[58:27.140 --> 58:30.800]  The other's a juncture. And we got to get, I mean, I know my life's on the line. I know
[58:30.800 --> 58:34.800]  this stuff's real. I know those detectives are real. I know the death threats are real
[58:34.800 --> 58:43.800]  and I'm angry. I know Piers Morgan works for the new world order. I don't like it.

[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:34.160]  All right, we got five more minutes with Doug Hagman joining us. You don't understand, ladies
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.000]  and gentlemen, you know, Rob Dozle. I think we're being followed by those guys. Those
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.360]  guys are cops. And I'm like, yeah, they've been at the hotel since the time we got here.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.000]  You know, you're in a hotel checking in, you're tired, you don't feel good. You wanna go lay
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.600]  down for an hour. And then there's guys, obviously police, looking at you.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.440]  You're just like, hopefully they're just in here for some reason. Then you notice they're
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.360]  talking into their sleeves cuz they all get into secret. Just a note, people ever wanna
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.040]  be quote spies? The really good ones are like old ladies and stuff and aren't sitting there
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.480]  talking into their sports jackets. I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.560]  They all get into these movies. They think they're 007 or something. That's not how the
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.440]  real world works. I'm an agent of the Republic. I'm a vestigial left over of Americana, just
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:23.080]  there desperately in my own ham-fisted way trying to fight these people. And look, man,
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.080]  I don't do the best job a lot of days, I told you that.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.720]  You can analyze it, either say it was a great victory or a great defeat. All I know is I'm
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:35.480]  stumbling into the arena, man, after a lot of hard battles already exhausted. I'm like
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.760]  a quarterback that's been in 12 games in a row and has got both shoulders blown and my
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]  knees blown.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.760]  And I'm there getting run over. And people are like, look at him down on the field stumbling
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.760]  around. Hey, man, there's a war going on. That's all I can tell you. And I think the
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.240]  course is to get upset and get in their face. And that's what scares the system so much.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.560]  They'll try to spin getting upset is bad. And it is bad to some people out there that
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:06.760]  have been limingized. But Doug Hagman, Northeast Intelligence Network, any other points you'd
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.680]  like to add about what happened and what is happening?
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.440]  Do you think talking about this will stop them from trying to set me up?
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.840]  Well, it can't hurt any Alex. I mean, their agenda is what their agenda is. They're out
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.300]  to marginalize anyone who is speaking out proponents of the Second Amendment, the First
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:31.100]  Amendment, speaking out against tyranny, speaking out against the truth, what they're doing
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:35.220]  in the shadows. We need to keep doing it. You need to keep doing it. We need to pray
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.980]  for you, Alex, because you're at the tip of the spear. And I think we all need to play
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.780]  our zones or particular positions.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:47.560]  But you know, you can only last so long out there at the tip of the spear by yourself.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.940]  We need reinforcements. We need to back you up. We need to back each other up. We have
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:57.400]  to realize that we're all in this together. I don't want to be trite, but you know how
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.800]  they say if we don't-
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.600]  Hang together, we hang separate.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:09.920]  Exactly. And that's what it is. These people can be intimidated back into submission. They're
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.600]  trying desperately to fulfill their objective.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.000]  They're trying to bully us. We have got to righteously get them back in line.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.880]  That's right. And I think too, Alex, just in my personal opinion, we're fighting a spiritual
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.460]  battle as well in addition to the earthly battle. And I think we have to recognize that
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:36.940]  this is pure evil what's going on out there. And it's just we need to not only fight on
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:42.040]  a practical level, but we need to pray on a spiritual level. Certainly our prayers are
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.040]  with you.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.040]  Well, my gut told me just get away from those, because I'm usually the type that just confronts,
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.080]  but I thought, well, they could set me up with something. I mean, what do you think
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.280]  they might have been trying to do? Just drop something on me or what?
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.760]  I really think the issue with the Starbucks, again, I don't know the geography where you
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.280]  were if there was one around you.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.960]  There was a Starbucks right on the corner and they blocked the streets off around the
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.220]  hotel and there were guys watching when we even came up.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.640]  That bothers me the most, because I think that whatever they had planned involved getting
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.640]  you on videotape, perhaps shoving, like I said, shoving a woman or bear, or it would
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.560]  have appeared that you were bullying a woman. And that bothers me because if they can set
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.000]  you up in that fashion, they can set anyone up.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.200]  They did that with Michelle Malkin. Yes. Well, yes. They had guys because I wasn't as sophisticated
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.280]  even five years ago at the DNC. Like why are these guys standing behind me screaming? And
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.880]  they were, we caught them on, we got the tape going, kill Michelle Malkin and then they
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.240]  left with her.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.760]  We need to be aware of our surroundings all the time. You need to be extra special.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.800]  No, I'm going to have to get, I'm going to have to go to the security route now. That's
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.540]  it. I mean, it's obvious. I got it. Doug, thank you so much. Gerald Cilente coming up.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.200]  Thank you, Doug. We'll check in with you more soon.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.200]  All right, sir.

[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:46.480]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:35.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:42.080]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, now into the second hour. It is the 10th day here of
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:50.100]  January 2013. And the national media said how horrible that I pointed my finger at the
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:55.320]  Brit over here in America telling us to get rid of our Second Amendment and told him 1776
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]  would commence.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.680]  Well, Ron Paul was on yesterday. We're gonna play it later in the hour for Gerald Salente.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.920]  He agreed. He said, I've always said it's the line in the sand. It'll cause a civil
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.520]  war. I'm not calling for a civil war every day you've heard me. I want to stop this from
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.640]  happening. They want to persecute us. They want to come after our guns because the guns
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.280]  go, it all goes.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.520]  They're already saying they wanna raise taxes again now. They're already saying they wanna
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.680]  cut benefits again. We're going into austerity, the same blueprint they've used in Europe
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.760]  that Gerald Salente has warned about for so many years. Here's the McClatchy newspaper
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.160]  headline as new fiscal cliff nears, Democrats seek more tax increases.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.160]  Before we go to Gerald though, I wanna just say this. Yes, watching Larry Pratt last night,
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:43.700]  we're gonna play this in the next hour, skillfully, calmfully destroy Piers Morgan was powerful.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:50.520]  And that is how I would have rather have done it. But I get angry sometimes and we will
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.120]  make a lot of lemonade out of the lemons, but I don't even think it was lemons to begin
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120]  with.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.800]  That's how they try to spin it. Notice they're not inviting me on other shows, national TV
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.320]  shows. They were freaked out because they knew that was gonna make big news and get
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.360]  people out of their coma. As a lot of top media people I've talked to on record, off
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.160]  record, they said no, that was history making because it shocked Americans out of their
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.160]  days.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.440]  At first, it's uncomfortable to somebody under hypnosis though, to be shocked out of it.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.320]  And that's what we got. A lot of people were negative up front, but now it's getting more
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:27.720]  and more positive. That said, I'm always the person to second guess myself. It is what
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:34.080]  it is. But I could have gotten to more points. I probably went too far yelling at him into
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.240]  the second segment, should have done less of that.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.920]  But it doesn't matter. They're going to misrepresent no matter what. The point is, we're in a coma.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.980]  When are we gonna get angry? That's why I love when Gerald Cilente comes on. He gets
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:50.840]  angry sometimes. Cuomo's all angry in this new speech we're gonna play. We gotta get
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.240]  these guns, they're hurting the kids, get them.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:58.600]  I was like, yeah, or they're like, don't raise your voice. That's so animalistic. They want
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:04.640]  us to sit down and shut up. I think we've been way too meek. Did I go too far? Maybe.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:10.120]  But the point is, they're demonizing gun owners one way or the other. I wanna play this clip
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.420]  of them talking about how I need to be shot. And then the other guest and the host talk
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.520]  about dressing up in a uniform to do it like it's okay when the state does it.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520]  Here's that clip.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:26.240]  What do you need a semi-automatic weapon for? The only reason I think you need it is, Pierce,
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.120]  challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match. Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]  and pop him.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.920]  I'd love to see that. In uniform.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.160]  I'll borrow my brother's uniform.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.400]  There you go. And he says he'll borrow his brother's uniform. Pierce agrees. Again, if
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.920]  I or Gerald Cilente or Ron Paul said anything remotely close to let's kill somebody with
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.760]  a rifle, it would be like it was the end of the world.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.240]  And then with other people, I mean, folks get arrested all the time for joking around
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.280]  about bars. Hey, I wanna shoot that guy, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, Bob, let's do it. I'll help
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.560]  you, I'll get the bullets. Conspiracy to commit murder, boom. People are like, we were just
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.240]  joking, doesn't matter, grand jury just indicted you.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.400]  These people are on TV knowing nuts are out there. They know when they hype up these school
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.340]  shootings where they victim disarm, it advertises that's the place to go. And so I got into
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.200]  all of that probably overcompensating as I was under the weather.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.520]  Never had, I thought it was an allergy, but it's actually a fever last night so that a
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:30.920]  chest cold. But the point is, is that it was so disgusting I blew up. Now Gerald wants
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.560]  to get into a bunch of economics today and a bunch of other big issues that are happening.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.000]  But I wanna get his take on this. And of course, the news website that you've absolutely got
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.600]  to visit over there is trendsresearch.com.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.760]  Gerald Cilente is an American trends forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.240]  consultant and author. He's made a lot of incredibly accurate predictions, not just
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.160]  about events, but major trends. He's been on every major television news show you can
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.080]  imagine in the world, trendsresearch.com, subscribe today.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:08.360]  Okay, Gerald, break down your take if you want on the overall open assault on the Second
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.780]  Amendment and how it ties into everything else. And your take on what happened with
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780]  Piers Morgan.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:23.080]  Well, first of all, I wanna say and I wanna make this 100% clear. I am 100% behind Alex
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:34.680]  Jones on his stand against the government, imposing any more legislation, rules or regulations
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:41.760]  to take our guns away from us. I am totally opposed to what they are doing and I totally
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:49.480]  support your belief in what you're doing to protect our rights. So I wanna make that really
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.120]  clear.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:58.400]  And as I look at this issue and as it evolves and devolves, the politicians are doing nothing
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:05.740]  more than using this for political capital. These are a bunch of inepts and incompetence
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:11.760]  that have failed at everything that they do. Now, all of a sudden, the fiscal cliff is
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:18.840]  out of the news and the official jerks who have been officially incapable of doing anything
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:24.880]  to solve the major problems are now grabbing on this gun control issue.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.500]  And as you pointed out, they're all shooting off their fat mouths coming up with their
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:38.720]  solutions on how to solve the problem. As I look at the problem, this is what I see.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:49.280]  300 million guns out there. What are you gonna control? It'll be as ineffective as prohibition.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:59.720]  It will be as ineffective as the war on drugs and it will be costly to everyone and in the
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:09.900]  not only financially, but raping us more of our rights from us, which they love to do.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:18.760]  They are the DC gang, the greatest rapists of human rights in the history of the United
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:25.160]  States. They love to rape us. So they're going to be totally ineffective.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:35.360]  Number two, as you well know, and I know that you have the facts down on guns and who uses
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:41.920]  them and where they come from better than virtually anybody out there. And as you well
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:49.720]  know, Alex, most of the crimes that are committed using guns are committed by the criminals,
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.680]  the gang bangers, and the other slime out there in society.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:02.240]  And what are, where did those guns come from? No, no, no. They didn't come from mommy or
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:08.640]  daddy's closet where they weren't locked up. Those are unregistered guns. Those are black
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:15.560]  market guns. Hey, maybe they're even the guns from Fast and Furious. Who knows? So then
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:28.240]  the other issue becomes there is a no argument for them to be imposing more rules that are
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:37.480]  not going to work. So I support your strong stand on we, the people should be able to
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:44.280]  protect ourselves. And as you pointed out and you show those little weenies, I love
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.440]  that guy Dershowitz on there.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:54.000]  You know, if I was around Alex Jones and I would be afraid that he would come after me
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.600]  with a gun. Hey, take it easy, Alan boy. If Alex Jones came after you with a feather duster,
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.480]  that will knock you over. So these little guys, these little boys out there that are
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.560]  telling us what we should do to protect ourselves their way on.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.120]  Absolutely. I want to get your next take on that. We've got breaking news, Gerald. And
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.920]  this continues. There's a lot of evidence this could be provocative. Shooting outside
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:25.600]  Bakersfield, California, where we have a 50,000 watt affiliate. California school shooting
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.800]  two reportedly shot at Taft Union High School near Bakersfield.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.680]  At least two people were shot. That's how Sandy Hook started was two at Taft Union High
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.880]  School in Kent County, California. This morning, as the suspected shooter has been taken into
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.720]  custody, according to local media reports, let's pray to God nobody dies. Let's pray
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.760]  to God. It's time to arm these schools now, folks. They're advertising a minute.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.400]  ABC News in Bakersfield said the incident happened at 9 AM. That's just minutes ago,
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.240]  their time. This is incredible. Gerald Cilente, what's your take on that?
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.240]  Well, my take again is what are the other issues that you keep talking about? What kind
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:06.560]  of psychotropic drugs are these people on? What kind of society, a cruel nature of society,
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.320]  a culture of cruelty that we had? Who are these people that are committing the crimes?
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.240]  What drugs are they on that they wouldn't answer you when you brought it up? That each
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.800]  one of these, there's records of them showing how many people on psychotropic drugs are
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.800]  killing this.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:32.660]  How about the new guy Obama just nominated for the CIA, who, as I understand, is so much
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:39.280]  in favor of, quote, enhanced interrogation techniques. How about torture?
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.840]  Well, that's like Dershowitz. Dershowitz wrote a paper saying torture should be normalized
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.780]  and they should just torture us whenever they want.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.480]  So that's what I'm saying. It's not about-
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.320]  I mean, he's the one that's creepy. I mean, we've been out to dinner and stuff. We're
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.280]  just normal, nice, calm guys. These are the weird, creepy monsters that think torture's
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280]  good.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:06.080]  Exactly, so what I'm saying is, whatever happened just now is another American tragedy, but
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:13.560]  it has to do with the entire culture of cruelty. No, you watch all those violent video games.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.440]  No, no, it's not gonna affect-
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.960]  Cruelty to animals, people are into that now, that's like chic.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.140]  Exactly, so what I'm saying is, no, they're not gonna affect everybody violent, but people
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:31.280]  on the edge that become over consumed with them. Again, the drugs, no one is talking
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:39.720]  about the psychotropic drugs. This is not a gun control issue, it's a mind control issue.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.280]  And the minds of Americans, pick up the paper today. Go look at the last study that just
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.000]  came out. It has nothing to do with this, but everything to do with it.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.640]  Gerald Salente, Gerald Salente, we gotta go to break. We'll come back and talk more about
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.360]  this in the economy, trendsresearch.com, and you can get their quarterly magazine that
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.560]  is an absolute must read for everybody right there at Trends Research.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.520]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.100]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:16.040]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:35.240]  in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.320]  growth slide into recession or at worst depression? Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.600]  all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.080]  is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven. But what
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.260]  do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:29.040]  are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.560]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:38.600]  costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights and measures. The book

[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:06.420]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:12.520]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.800]  device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:21.880]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.700]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:31.420]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:37.520]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.200]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.400]  exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.640]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:24:02.520]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:12.880]  Yeah, magically, these school shootings just started right as Obama isn't facing reelection
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:19.080]  or honestly says he'll use executive orders. And if you look at the shootings out in Aurora,
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.880]  definitely had government involvement. The guy was paid under a DARPA program that was
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.440]  in mind control, and that's back of the paper.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.240]  I mean, you can't make this up. I mean, Operation Northwoods, US government called for staging
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.320]  shootings in movie theaters and on the streets to blame their political enemies. Operation
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.320]  Gladio declassified, our government did it all over Europe. We know about it cuz the
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.860]  Italian government declassified. They worked with NATO and the US government shooting up
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.060]  schools and things to blame political groups they didn't like.
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:50.200]  It happened in every major European country. They're running Gladio, in my historical researched
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.040]  opinion. And now if this isn't gang related in Bakersfield, and my God, they could start
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.960]  announcing dozens of dead just like last time when they said it was one or two and then
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.720]  it was two shot right now.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:07.440]  I pray to God this isn't, but either way, they're hyping it, they're advertising, school
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.920]  shooting, school shooting, school shooting, school shooting. They know with copycats that
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.800]  when they do TV shows about young girls cutting themselves, suddenly more girls cut themselves
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.560]  and then more cut themselves and then more. When they did death education in public schools
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.120]  starting in 1990, suicide increased.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.800]  Teaching 10 and 11 and 12 year olds how to commit suicide, they never even thought of
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:32.280]  that. It's like an option. You see, when they started advertising death by cop, people started
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.960]  going out and pulling more guns on cops to get killed. It's called advertising. If people
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.920]  ran $1 million of advertising on a local TV station saying it's fun to go to the corner
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.680]  of Washington and Liberty and beat yourself in the head with a hammer.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.560]  There would be people that went to that corner and beat themselves in the head with a hammer.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.680]  There are some people that's suggestible. Most of us aren't like that. When somebody
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.320]  jumps off a major building, the police always station people there for the next three days
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.960]  because somebody always shows up. And the police in the old days would call up the media
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.480]  and say, please stop reporting on this.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.840]  When we had real terrorism in the 60s and 70s, they had policies where they did not
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.880]  report on it at one time. Because when you report on it, it causes more of it. Gerald,
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.440]  I know I'm ranting and I've got you on here to talk. And we're gonna play some clips coming
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.640]  up with Ron Paul and moving to other issues that are very important.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:31.020]  But I mean, the way they're hyping school shootings as an epidemic, it's going to cause
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.560]  copycats to go in there and do this. They know exactly what they're doing. I mean, I
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:39.000]  went and took a few courses in media theory at a community college and they talked about
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.320]  this. I mean, certainly the masters running the media know what they're doing.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:51.080]  But I agree with you 100%. It's advertising. And if this was buried on the back pages of
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.560]  the New York Times, these incidents, rather than promoting them, they would have a very
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:03.160]  different impact. For example, they just killed, quote, 10 militants over there in Pakistan.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.720]  That's not a front page story. It's a tiny little thing. It was a front page story. Obama
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:13.800]  sends more drones to kill people that had been tried, never had went to court, never
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:20.400]  would charge with anything, against the Geneva Conventions and kept doing it over and over
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.960]  again. It would become news. So I agree with you.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.720]  As we were going out of the break, and I'm talking about what's happening to the country
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.920]  on a broader level and the breakdown of the culture and all these people on psychotropic
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:38.960]  drugs, new study just came out. America, USA, USA, we're number one. We're number one. Guess
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.400]  what? New study just came out. We're in infant mortality. Yeah, we're near number one.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:53.640]  And narcissism. Narcissism, yeah, but the other one was, out of the top 17 nations,
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:28:03.720]  we rank last in longevity, and we're ranking last in as far as people being healthy of
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:13.720]  mind and body. And by the way, I was just thinking, any legislation that is being passed
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:21.720]  now, what they say to stop this crisis from continuing, I want to see studies being done
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:28.240]  on it. I want to see studies being done that what they're proposing is in fact going to
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:35.040]  work rather than them stealing my money, hiring a bunch of their flunky friends to make money
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.520]  on these new programs. Hey, remember that one they used to have in front of all the
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:45.440]  schools? Dare, dare. Yeah, that'll keep kids away with drugs. Who are the people making
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:52.080]  money behind that? So what I'm saying, Alex, before any new legislation is passed, there
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:57.260]  should be cost benefit analyses done as to if this is going to work, how it's going to
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.360]  work and what it's going to cost.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:06.040]  And your point that you keep making, do not stop making it. They are advertising this.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:13.040]  They are promoting it. It's what prestitudes do. They're standing out there and they're
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:22.220]  hawking it like any good prestitute would do. So they are creating the culture.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:26.240]  Long segment coming up with Gerald Salente. The Drudge Report had this up yesterday, but
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.440]  I'm going to cover it after Gerald leaves. This is the most powerful article I've ever
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:36.180]  read on the Second Amendment. Americans never give up your guns from Pravda, from Russia.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:40.280]  And it is powerful, ladies and gentlemen. It's still actually up at DrudgeReport.com,
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.480]  the middle column. We've reposted it at Infowars.com. And here's the bad news. Biden has just announced
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:50.720]  they're going to confiscate all guns that aren't registered. So that's coming up.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:30:01.500]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:06.360]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:10.920]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.880]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:25.600]  We are all in the arena doing the best job we can to fight the globalist. Depending on
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.840]  how you look at it, I probably could have done a better job on Piers Morgan. I'll say
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.440]  this, if they ever let me back on there, I will try to show the opposite side and be
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.480]  very, very calm. Let me take five or six Valiums beforehand. I'm joking, I've never even taken
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.240]  Valium and I'm told that's what people take to calm down.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.600]  But I was just angry. I'm sick of the lies. I know they're opportunistically trying to
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.200]  disarm us. They could care less about a million dead Iraqis in the Lancet Journal estimate.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.320]  They could care less about hundreds of dead kids a year. When they kill innocent people,
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.240]  they just call it collateral damage. They could care less about fast and furious thousands
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.040]  of dead people that this White House shipped guns into Mexico. Their own memos came out
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.180]  to blame the Second Amendment, and it makes me mad.
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:11.240]  And I'm just sick of everyone kissing their butts. And Larry Pratt went on there and destroyed
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.160]  him last night. We'll play it last hour, but he won't make the news anywhere. Listen, they're
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:22.400]  not having me back on other shows because they know it's breaking people out of their
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.720]  spell. Sure, they're gonna spin it and say, look, this guy just credits gun owners because
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.000]  that's one angle, and with some people it will.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.560]  But the overall thing, it scares them for the sleeping giant to awaken. Trendsresearch.com
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.280]  is Gerald's excellent site. We'll go to that and talk about some of the new trends coming
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.440]  out after we finish up with guns here in a moment with Gerald Cilente. But first, I wanted
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.960]  to get his take on Ron Paul.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:49.400]  I brought up my quote of you're gonna trigger a new 1776, which I don't want physically.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:54.520]  Gerald and I have talked about a velvet cultural revolution of liberty versus their cultural
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.320]  revolution of tyranny, a culture of Americana, quality. We're gonna talk some about that.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.800]  I'm clear, I don't want violence. Believe me, I'm one of the first they're gonna go
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:08.640]  after. But that's why I'm like, don't come for the guns, it will cause it.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.320]  And Piers is like, and like after the show, they're like, he wants some violent revolution.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:18.160]  You idiots don't get it. You're going to trigger it. You're going to draw first blood. You're
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:24.060]  going to push it and push it and push it and push it and push it.
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:28.060]  And I brought this up and Ron Paul said, well, I haven't used those words, but I say this
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:32.320]  is the line in the sand. This could cause a revolution. Here's Ron Paul. So you think
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.880]  I was right then telling Piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns, it will start
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:36.880]  1776 part two.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.920]  Well, I don't know whether I'd put them in the same words, but I think I said something
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.960]  very similar to what you're saying.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.000]  Well, God bless you, sir. I hope we can get you back again in a month.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Bye, guys. Very good.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.800]  What are any other websites that are important to plug? Just campaignforliberty.org.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.960]  Do that. And then we'll be listing some new things there because we're making some other
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.640]  web page. I'm going to have a a home page. Unfortunately, I didn't have Ron Paul dot
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.640]  com.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.280]  So I'm going to have to have Ron Ron Paul's home page dot com. That'll be coming up, but
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.280]  it's not ready yet.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.920]  All right. Big announcements coming soon. We'll talk to you and say hi to the family.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:13.680]  God bless you, sir. Thank you. Right to talk to that man during this dark time. I told
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.280]  you executive. They're getting us ready to see if we'll take it. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.000]  this could be it.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:29.520]  All right. There is that clip with the audio off, but it doesn't matter for radio listeners.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.640]  I have the news here. Bakersfieldnow.com. Bakersfield school officials take part in
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:40.200]  shooting survival training. This is January 9th. They just had a drill at the school.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.840]  Now, whether that copycat did the shooting now there or whether that's used as a cover,
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:50.000]  we know in North was other documents they use. They use drills as the cover for the
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.960]  real shooters.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.300]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, they're so confident. I believe they're staging
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:59.680]  and provocateuring these and you're going to see a bunch more shootings. That's why
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.560]  they're so confident and why he's told fundraisers Biden will get the guns by the end of January
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.680]  and they're training local police federally for forced gun confiscation.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.920]  And Biden hints at outlawing unregulated private guns and saying that you can't have guns that
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.040]  aren't registered. Well, that's what Dianne Feinstein's bill says. Gerald, let me ask
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:25.920]  you the question here, because it's very, very important. Again, I don't want a violent
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920]  revolution.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.480]  But I'm not going to a FEMA camp either. So defensively, we have a right to protect ourselves
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:35.800]  in the duty. What do you think is going to happen if they physically start trying to
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.320]  confiscate all the semi-autos as Feinstein's bill says? And if they go out and start SWAT
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.200]  teaming people and calling them terrorists who don't turn them in, what do you think
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:50.160]  as a trans forecaster who's been so accurate, what do you think's going to come out of that?
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.640]  You'll see the same kind of thing that happened during the prohibition. And it'll be another
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:01.000]  industry that the government creates. It'll accomplish nothing and it'll be a failure.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.480]  When you just read that statement by Biden, were you reading that out of a comic book?
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.640]  They're going to confiscate all unregistered guns? I mean, come on. Where are you going
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:18.320]  to find them? In the unregistered gun dump? I mean, it's an oxymoron. How are you going
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:25.840]  to confiscate unregistered guns? They're losers. Everything they turn, they do. They turn to
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:31.880]  failure. And going back for a moment, by the way, on two things. One on the Piers Morgan
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:40.540]  show about the revolution. I believe there's going to be a revolution, but I've come up
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:45.360]  with something very different. And we're going to be announcing it within a few days and
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:52.000]  I want to be on your show to talk about it more. Gerald Cilenti's Four Rules of Peace.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:59.840]  That's right. Am I in favor of guns? You bet. Do I own them? You bet I do. If I'm going
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:05.080]  to have some crazy person blowing through my place like that woman did who was protecting
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:10.660]  her children in the attic, what was it, in Georgia, and shot the intruder as the intruder
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:15.800]  was going to shoot her, I want to have the will, I want to have the wherewithal to protect
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:22.640]  myself. If I see society breaking down, let's say what happens, a nuclear power plant goes
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:31.000]  berserk, and people turn into animals, and they try behaving like deranged, rabid animals,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.480]  I want to have a weapon to protect myself. No kidding, exactly, as portions of the population
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.920]  degenerate because they don't know how to work, everything's always been given to them,
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:44.360]  first by their parents, then by the culture, plus the jobs are shipped overseas. As all
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:50.960]  of this is happening, we have a right, a duty, a responsibility. Of course. And the other
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:59.320]  thing, Alex, when they made, after you went off the air, and they sandbagged you there,
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:05.560]  with that guy Dershowitz, they would talk about, oh, he's making this New World Order.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:13.220]  I want to make this clear to everybody. The New World Order is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:21.040]  It's a fact, and I could prove it. The New World Order is the banking order. That's right.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:28.520]  They are the ones responsible for so much of what's going on in society today. I could
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:34.000]  pick up a piece, and we'll take it in the break, I'll get my assistant to get it, from
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:42.800]  the CEO of UBS, saying how arrogant they were, and how they shouldn't have been so greedy,
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.560]  in nice white shoe boy language. You look what's going on over in Europe. Instead of
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.360]  them reporting on all of the prostitute news that they do, they're not talking about the
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:01.320]  horrors that people are living through in Portugal, in Spain, in Greece. The people
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:08.160]  are taking to the streets. You say, Alex, that can this be a tipping point? I don't
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:14.280]  know what the tipping point is, because the tipping point, they never see it. They will
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:24.500]  continue to rape us until their sickest desires have not been fulfilled in one area, as when
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:30.920]  raping us of our constitutional rights, and then they'll do something else. They never
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:39.640]  learn. Look, have they learned from Vietnam? Did they learn from Iraq? Have they learned
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:49.400]  from Afghanistan? No, I got it. Let's open up 35 new bases in Africa. Yeah, we'll come
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:55.480]  up with a name for it. They never learn.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:00.120]  You're right, and they know though, they have learned something from history that people
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:04.840]  will resist them later. So they're buying 1.6 billion bullets. They're digging in, they're
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:10.000]  militarizing, they're surveilling, they're calling peaceful protests, terrorism. Publicly,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.640]  they're demonizing the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution. Meanwhile, they are erecting
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:17.640]  all these new taxes.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:20.760]  Now, you originally were gonna come back on this week, and we appreciate you doing that
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.720]  because I know you're a busy guy, to get into the big trends coming up that we didn't have
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.560]  time to get to last week. Let's shift gears out of the guns now, and this Bakersfield
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.560]  thing looks bad.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:35.280]  Another shooting at a school, a government training center, and they had a drill there
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.240]  two days ago of a mass shooting at the school, practicing taking the kids to the sports stadium.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:45.560]  And they've actually done that now. This, again, just absolutely programs the youngsters
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.880]  to think about this, and that this is an option.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.680]  They lose their girlfriend, they put them on Prozac, and they don't know what their
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.360]  name is. Well, get a gun, I mean, this is unbelievable. But Gerald, shifting out of
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:01.800]  the guns now, because you offered, you said I can come back and finish cuz we're out of
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:06.600]  time. All the big trends that are coming up other than the disarmament, I mean, that's
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.600]  one of them.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.240]  Why are they pushing so hard to disarm us right now? Because they know, I was reading
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:17.280]  with the Chinese government starting to hoard food and weapons for itself against the population.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.520]  Governments everywhere are digging in, how does this tie into it?
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:27.320]  That's exactly it. And that's exactly what we're writing about. There's an economic collapse
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:33.840]  going on worldwide. They know, you pick up today's New York Times, or yesterday's, one
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:41.480]  of the days, one of the members of the Federal Reserve Board from Virginia saying that all
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:48.840]  of this quantitative easing is not going to solve anything. They know that the game is
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:55.220]  going to end. And you know my say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.360]  they lose it.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:03.800]  And I firmly believe that with the National Defense Authorization Act, with the wiretapping,
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.160]  with all of the surveillance going on, as you pointed out what they did with the Occupy
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:17.000]  movements, with the FBI, the CIA, the NIA, all of them watching everything that we do,
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.600]  and I'm not a conspiracy crazy. I'm seeing it as I'm watching the world collapse around
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:29.160]  us and I'm saying they're preparing for the collapse here. And so they want to have it
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:36.180]  so that they can control us. Again, just like they infiltrated the Occupy movement and every
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:42.780]  other movement. They're going to do it again because we're going through an economic collapse
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:50.080]  here. In fact, Switzerland, I used to call them the money cockroaches of the world. They
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:57.840]  are now printing more money and a leverage of GDP to printing money higher than any of
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:05.040]  the other countries. The new guy they got in there in Japan, Abe, the new prime minister,
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.440]  first thing he did, they're printing more money through the Bank of Japan. You look
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:16.640]  what's going on over in Europe with Mario Draghi, former vice chairman of the Goldman
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:24.040]  Sachs gang. What is he doing? OMT, ongoing monetary transactions, in white shoe boy language,
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:30.640]  in real language, keep printing money. Oh, gold, by the way, Alex, pop up $20 today.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:35.800]  Why? Because they're depressing it and if anybody doesn't think the game is rigged,
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.720]  then you're a moron to think that they don't rig things because after all, didn't they
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:47.160]  rig the interest rates with LIBOR? Aren't we finding out all these inside deals that
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.780]  are going on? I'm making the point because it all ties together. There's an economic
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:58.120]  collapse. The only way they're keeping it going is by printing this cheap money and
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:07.600]  in the meantime, devaluing our currency. If anybody travels out of the United States and
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:17.440]  goes to an affluent nation, your dollar isn't worth a dime, ladies and gentlemen. What's
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:23.760]  going on is that this is part of the greater collapse and then you start putting the other
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:30.640]  pieces together. Hey, drought conditions going on. Can't bring barges down the Mississippi.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:37.600]  Food prices going up. Oh, shortages. Hey, over there in Brazil, big problem. Can't get
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:44.640]  any hydroelectricity. Why not? Things are drying up. Don't have the water. So you keep
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:54.240]  putting this all together. The government, the nation is too big to operate from a central
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:02.520]  location. What I would like to see as part of the next revolution is secession. I don't
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:11.400]  want a gang of 535 telling 315 million people what to do. I don't want a guy like Biden
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:18.600]  or boner. I don't want a person like Reid or McConnell. I don't want these losers who
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:27.120]  have created nothing but misery and hardship for all of us except their friends to keep
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:31.800]  destroying the nation. And when you look at the Bill of Rights and when you listen to
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.840]  our founding fathers, this is the time for me for one of the big trends that we're writing
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:44.320]  about the secession progression. You notice how they push that out of the news. You notice
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:50.560]  how over a million people signed up for it and no one's talking about it, but it's going
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:56.960]  on in Spain. It's going on in Italy. It's going on in Scotland. It's going on over 200
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:05.480]  countries around the world. The nation is too broken to fix and it's too big to be operated
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:12.540]  by a mafia, a Republican and Democratic crime family.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:19.440]  You can't reform criminals. No, you don't reform the mafia. We need a new system and
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.360]  that's what I'm going for.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.480]  By the way, last week they had kicked him out. They had indicted some of them. I remember
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.080]  three, four years ago we were told Iceland's bankrupt. The 400,000 people of the country
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.960]  who are some of the wealthiest capital in the world, they now are all bankrupted. And
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:44.500]  then it was reported by Reuters and others, just amazing information last week that they
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:45.800]  actually arrested them.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.880]  Now at first we were told all the debt was the Icelandic peoples. It was something like
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:54.680]  $50 billion. Then they said, okay, it's only 10 million, please pay it. Turned out 90 plus
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:58.640]  percent was not even their own national debt. It wasn't even their own socialism, which
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:04.120]  it wasn't. It was foreign British bank debt that their criminal government had signed
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  them on to.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:12.320]  They protested and refused the system and sabotaged it any way they could. And went
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:19.600]  on strikes for a year until they took the government over, they stormed the banks. And
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.760]  then now they've arrested the people and they're going to prison. And the bankers are trying
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.320]  to do dirty tricks to them now.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:28.900]  But the point is, at first England said, we're not gonna let flights out of Iceland come
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:33.480]  here saying you're illegal. We're gonna seize your citizens' bank accounts, cuz a lot of
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:38.360]  Icelanders use British banks. So they just counter-suit them. The mafia of the British
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:43.200]  cartel, the biggest in the world, tried to say, our debt is your debt.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:48.400]  And the Icelanders said, you can literally go to Hades. These nice well-mannered folks
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.900]  actually reverted back to being Vikings. Can't we follow the Icelandic model? Isn't it the
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:57.040]  way out? Isn't that the key?
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:03.060]  Absolutely, again, you're going to be receiving the Trends Journal next week. Another great
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:09.460]  trend we have is the Great Awakening. It was a great awakening in this country prior to
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:13.960]  the revolution. You read it in the works of Thomas Paine.
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:19.680]  Part of the Great Awakening, first it began as a religious revival. And people realized
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:25.000]  that their salvation was in their own hands. It wasn't from a hierarchy of a Church of
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.660]  England or anybody else. That you're responsible creating your own destiny, and you leave this
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:37.720]  life in the way that you choose to leave it by the deeds that you do on Earth. That was
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:44.940]  the awakening. It then became a second part of it, just as no longer genuflecting to the
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:45.940]  head of the Church of England.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:48.920]  Hold on, this is key. We're gonna come back and get into this. That's right. And that's
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:52.280]  why they're setting up all this tyranny worldwide, as Brzezinski wrote in his new book. They
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.860]  know the Global Awakening is happening. Gerald Salente predicted it six years ago. Brzezinski
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:01.620]  confirmed it this year. We'll be back.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:06.260]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:10.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:19.960]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.620]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:30.260]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:34.600]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.260]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:43.460]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:47.520]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:54.300]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:52:05.560]  doesn't own the sun. So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:11.480]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year. Burdlers call it smash
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:19.060]  and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:25.440]  device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:30.160]  the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:36.640]  watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only $34.95, Fake TV
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.280]  costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plants. And it's perfect if you're traveling
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:53.560]  or away from home. Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:58.240]  or faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:11.480]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:15.760]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.240]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:25.680]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:31.520]  this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:36.360]  cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.520]  chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that

[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:02.480]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:08.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:23.040]  a war on for your mind.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:26.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the issue. We've got Gerald for two more segments. Really appreciate
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:33.280]  him joining us. They came out and announced we're going to have an executive order, which
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.680]  they'd said quietly before, where we can just ban semi-autos. And people said, no way, that's
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.880]  unconstitutional. So then CNN, I was watching them today before the show started back there
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:46.000]  in the coffee area, was going, it's just an executive order to use existing laws, but
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.200]  it's how we implement them.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.260]  This isn't unconstitutional. Don't be paranoid. They played a clip of Limbaugh saying this
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:57.000]  is a tyrannical takeover. And I saw another newscast criticizing Drudge for putting Hitler
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.920]  and Stalin up there. Well, they used executive action to take guns. That's what this is.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:06.440]  See, they're always, don't be radical, don't be radical. They're the ones that are radical.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:14.160]  And we've got to rise to their radicalness with our base rock common sense and say no.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:18.660]  Now Gerald Salente is covering something here of the utmost importance. And it is so important
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.880]  for you to support Infowars.com, to buy the books, the videos, the magazines, the propure
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:27.920]  water filters that blow the competition away, fluoride filters, all of it, Infowarshop.com.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.920]  I haven't even plugged that today. To go there, the Buy the Pro Gun t-shirts, the Infowars
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:36.480]  t-shirts to meet like-minded people. To go to trendsresearch.com and subscribe there
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.480]  as well.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:43.560]  Because even if you think you know all this, this is the type of magazine, the color magazine
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.520]  with great graphics and everything that you wanna give people, executives, teachers, preachers,
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:53.280]  the police chiefs that can really wake them up. You can also sign up for the free trends
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:58.720]  alerts there at trendsresearch.com. But now is the time to support those of us.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.640]  And that's why I wish Glenn Beck wasn't attacking me and folks because I want to work with everybody,
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:08.760]  okay, who wants basic liberty, left, right, center, libertarian. If you want basic bill
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.800]  of rights and constitution, and if you realize we've been hijacked by foreign mega banks,
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:19.440]  I'm your friend. I wanna work with everybody. None of us are perfect. All of us can be arm
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.160]  share quarterbacks, but we better financially support Infowars.com.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:28.600]  We better support Gerald Cilente and his trends research. You better spread the word about
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:34.000]  these broadcasting local AM and FMs because they won't always be here if you don't support.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.920]  Now is the time. Gerald, get back into your great awakening.
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.880]  Yes. And then after the religious part that people understood that their salvation was
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:48.280]  in their own hands and their own mind and spirit, then it became as well, we're not
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:57.000]  going to genuflect to the crown either. These people do not have a royal bloodline. They
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:04.280]  have not been ordained by God to rule us. And that's the works of the Thomas Pains and
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:13.720]  others that people revolted against the tyranny of the nobility. Well, guess what, Alex? It's
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:21.360]  the great awakening 2.0. They don't ride around in their coaches and knock everybody over
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:29.240]  like they used to when the royalty arrived. Now they have their SUVs, their motorcades.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:37.040]  They closed down the airspace, closed down the highways. Every one of these creeps. Now
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:44.960]  they have their jumbo jets. That's their new coaches. And they salute to the surfs down
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:53.960]  below they wave. It's a new royalty. It's the royalty that Mark Twain so despised. It's
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:58:02.160]  the royalty that Jefferson wrote in his letters, how disgusting and how deranged and immoral
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:12.760]  they were when he was over in Europe. We have a new royalty. They are our senators. They
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:20.600]  are our congressmen. And our kings and queens have become the presidents and prime ministers
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:29.520]  who, by royal, eat it. Our executive order will tell the rest of us surfs what to do
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:36.520]  and how we should obey them. Because if we don't, they have the goon squads to make sure
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:51.880]  that they do. Unbelievable. Stay there. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:57.600]  Check out our new low prices and like us on Facebook. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:12.640]  on the GCN radio network. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers?
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.480]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:29.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:39.440]  Up on screen of your TV viewer, I have an image of Thomas Jefferson next to Nancy Pelosi,
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:47.200]  Harry Reid and some of the other little globalist minions there. And imagine 235 plus years
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  later, these tyrants are trying to destroy what Thomas Jefferson helped get into place
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.840]  and he was the main architect for those that don't know.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:59.520]  They are literally still trying to get rid of something that our forebears fought with
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.880]  blood, sweat and tears and a lot of work to put into place. And that's why they spend
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.720]  all day demonizing it. And I was just thinking about Gerald Salinas. I'm at the old royalty
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:14.780]  that discussed to Jefferson and others. And then here is the new royalty saying by executive
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:19.400]  decree, we'll do whatever we want. We'll spy on you. We'll kill you. We'll disappear you.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:24.400]  We'll have the goons come after you. We are right back in that same position. And it's
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:25.400]  just amazing.
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:29.640]  Absolutely amazing. Gerald Salinas, we got four minutes left. You got the floor.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:36.880]  And again, you are a voice of the great awakening. I mean, if anybody doubts it, you know, they
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:44.640]  haven't been tuning in so much. And as I am and others, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Ron Paul,
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:51.920]  nothing has changed. There is a new royalty. I'm not making this up. Do you ever see these
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:59.720]  people? Everywhere they go, there's red carpets and a bunch of flunkies either saluting, depending
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.720]  on the country you're in, or dressed up in some moronic uniform.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:10.000]  And I'm saying to myself, who's paying for this? And then Obama bows to royalty. But
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.520]  who's paying for this garbage? Who's paying for all of these flunkies to get dressed up
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:21.840]  in this uniform? I have a business. Get to work. What are you doing over here to salute
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:28.680]  me when I walk in the door? Do they salute anybody? Here he comes. Roll out the red carpet.
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:35.000]  Nothing has changed. Look how they talk down to us. Look how they tell us what we must
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:43.120]  believe, why we should believe it, and how we should behave. There's a new Great Awakening.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:53.600]  The Great Awakening 2.0 is going to precede the Second American Revolution. And again,
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:03:00.960]  not one of guns and armies, but one of the mind and the spirit, the heart and the soul,
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:10.800]  the dignity and the respect of the individual, not what we should be saying and taking orders
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.480]  from our masters.
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.480]  I agree with you. When you talk about royalty, the red carpet was for royalty. They even
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:25.640]  have the guards around them holding up standards. They're telling us we are the emperors, we
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.600]  are your owners, and they act just like old royal dictatorships. And they say they're
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.080]  above the law, they're immune, you're a slave, they twist it all. And then they take old
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:42.440]  ladies' houses, you see it in the news all the time, for some unpaid tax they can't pay
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.440]  so that these guys could have $15 billion in the bank.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:52.600]  Exactly, the new royalty. Here's a quote from Thomas Paine. To the evil of monarchy, we
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:59.480]  have added that of hereditary succession. Yeah, one Bush, another Bush, another Bush,
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:07.680]  a Clinton, a Clinton, a Kennedy, a Kennedy. And as the first is the degradation and lessening
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:18.000]  of ourselves. So the second claimed as a matter of right is an insult and imposition on posterity.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:25.320]  For all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to set up his
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:32.840]  own family in perpetual preference to all others forever. And that's what they have
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:42.760]  done. It's their seat of power. They have become the royalty. They are in charge. They
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:45.000]  know what's best for us.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.480]  Amazing. Gerald Zalenta, I hope to speak to you soon, trendsresearch.com. I'm Alex Jones,
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:54.000]  one of the followers.com. We'll be right back with the main radio transmission, 11 AM to

[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:11.220]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:16.160]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e Foods

[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.680]  wrote almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:35.360]  in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:12.280]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:17.440]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:13.640]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:36.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here today on this Thursday worldwide
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:43.560]  transmission and I want to go through the different laundry list of clips that we have
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:49.640]  here today. In fact, guys, I had my list. Here it is. I want to first give out the number.
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:54.760]  If you heard Doug Hagman on earlier from Northeast Intelligence Network or you just heard Gerald
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:59.000]  Salente on the broadcast or you want to give your take on them saying they want to use
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.340]  executive orders to take our firearms.
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:05.400]  That's the issues we're mainly talking about. Or the Democrats are proposing even more tax
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:09.520]  increases now that they just got the other tax increases through. And this is how it
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.680]  works. Once they get you to the cliff, they start raising taxes once a year, then it's
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:16.520]  three times a year, then it's ten times a year.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:23.440]  And then you're paying 80% to 90% is the IMF World Bank model of everything you do in different
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:28.400]  taxes and the streets aren't fixed, sewage is everywhere, but almost all your money goes
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.560]  to the government. They're like, yeah, but their tax receipts go down when they do that.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:35.880]  They don't care. In fact, they want to make you poor.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:41.560]  And so McClatchy newspapers reporting that. There's a really creepy article. Could Alex
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:46.880]  Jones revolution actually happen out of Yahoo News? And it goes on to admit the government's
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:51.080]  arming against us and building up and that it's creepy. And if they try to take the guns,
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.000]  there may be a revolution.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.920]  But it also tries to discredit me. Look, it's not Alex Jones' revolution. I know a few months
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:02.640]  ago I said, get ready, this is it, they're coming after us. They're saying they're gonna
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:07.200]  use executive orders to take all our liberties. I can tell by their bearing and the propaganda
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:14.000]  and all these new shows coming out on ABC, NBC, CBS, that the fix was in for Obama.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:21.280]  And that they are gonna demonize gun owners. I mean, they don't have four new shows on
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:29.000]  broadcast TV. And then a couple I know of on cable that are now out or coming out where
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.520]  gun owners are terrorists and the US Army hunts them down and infiltrates them. And
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.720]  it puts them in situations where the gun owners are always bad guys.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:40.920]  It follows total Homeland Security scripting where they say gun owners, veterans, returning
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:45.760]  vets, libertarians, conservatives are the enemy. And then their training, the real trainings
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:51.240]  for this war going on for a decade, even before Obama got in. And now they're just going,
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:58.840]  public with it. And so I mean, you'd be a fool if you didn't know they're not spending,
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:03.620]  let's be conservative, 50, 60 billion a year for this domestic takeover.
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:08.160]  And buying 1.6 billion bullets and deploying armored vehicles in every area and creating
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:13.320]  dissonant list because they're not gonna come after us. They're gonna hammer down. I mean,
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:21.320]  it's horrible. I wish this wasn't the case. And they mean to break this country. They
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.920]  mean to bring this country completely down.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.440]  And I just pray to God to open the eyes of this country. I pray to God to open the eyes
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.360]  of police and military, which is starting to happen. But they select goons out of these
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:35.080]  forces and put them in these special thug units. And I've looked in their eyes. They
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:40.400]  really can't wait to hunt us down. And good luck. I mean, you may get the first few of
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:46.680]  us, people like me. But man, all you're doing is just really setting up for something bad.
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:52.160]  And not just on this plane. Going after people that really do love liberty and are good guys
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:12:00.400]  is bad mojo. Reap what you sow, karma, whatever you wanna call it. And this is really bad.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:06.560]  This is the worst scenario I could imagine. And it's not a game. It's not about entertainment.
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.280]  It's time to get freaked out. Glenn Beck said, I'm spooky, I'm scary.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:16.120]  I'm dangerous. No, I'm covering the spookiness and the dangerousness that's already there,
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.960]  bud. The time of wearing designer sweaters and being a cutesy and being into being a
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:27.340]  rich guy, it's over. Look, you either leave the United States and try to run to where
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:29.360]  rich people live if you're rich.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:33.360]  And just hope they don't get you later or you stand and you get the word out now. Okay,
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:38.800]  cuz if we wait till they blow up some federal buildings and blame us, we're in deep trouble.
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:42.920]  And I can tell you, I see all the signs. That's like I told you back days after Obama got
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:49.600]  elected. I call for the second American Revolution, a restoration. There are a lot of revolutions.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:57.580]  Most of them aren't physical. I said before they, before the establishment, gets physical.
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:03.060]  We have got to just absolutely overwhelm them and let them know we're on the watch and that
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:07.600]  this isn't gonna work. And that means not letting those of us on the tip of the spear
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:09.480]  be intimidated.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:15.680]  All of you that have a platform have got to turbocharge. I gotta give credit again, DrudgeReport.com
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:21.900]  yesterday showed Hitler and Stalin and said Obama is trying to become a dictator with
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:25.480]  executive orders. And look, if you have an executive order, I wanna play the Ron Paul
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:29.520]  clip here in a moment, the HD one we now have, talking about the martial law is the first
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:32.600]  clip we're gonna play or the line in the sand.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:36.640]  Ron Paul's like, well, it is dictatorial and it's going a dictatorial direction. But Obama
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:42.200]  was elected, yeah, through fraud. It doesn't matter, Hitler was elected. I actually disagreed
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.760]  with Ron Paul only slightly. He said, well, we're going in the direction of a dictatorship.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:50.720]  No, we're not. And I know he understands, he's real smart. He knows the public doesn't
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:51.720]  get that.
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:55.340]  They think as long as you're elected, you're not a dictator. If you got elected and overthrew
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:14:00.440]  your office and did things outside of the office, like saying the UN's over our military
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:06.200]  and I can sign executive orders and take your guns, that is dictator. Hitler was elected.
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.800]  A lot of dictators, Hugo Chavez was elected. And there was pure fraud. The guy has not
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:20.080]  been reelected. Fidel Castro was popular at first. This guy's still a dictator. The
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:22.160]  point is Hitler was elected.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:27.480]  And Ron Paul said, well, we're going in the direction of a dictatorship. No, the office
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:31.800]  of the President is becoming dictatorial, that is true. And it is going into dictator
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:36.760]  territory and then it goes the rest of the way very, very quickly. But Ron Paul said
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:40.840]  when I said, is 1776 not about to happen again?
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:44.440]  Won't that be the line in the sand out of 100 plus million gun owners? Won't there be
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:48.240]  1% that stands up or more? That's a million people fighting back. And he goes, yes, I've
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:52.520]  always said that's the line in the sand. That's what's gonna kick this off. I mean, I'm not
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:57.080]  saying, hey, Piers Morgan, there's gonna be 1776, we're coming to get you.
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:02.400]  I'm saying do not hit the red button, buddy. Just like Larry Pratt told him last night,
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.400]  we're gonna play that clip. He said, listen, I would tell Obama don't make the mistake
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:11.800]  King George III made, don't come for the guns, it will happen. And Larry Pratt said, so you're
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:13.640]  for revolution.
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.440]  Or Piers Morgan said that to Larry Pratt. Larry Pratt said, listen, I'm telling you
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:25.160]  what's going to happen. It's like don't run out on I-35 with 80 mile an hour, 18 wheelers,
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.600]  back to back going down. Don't just stand there when one drives by and jump out in front
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:30.200]  of it and think you're not gonna get run over.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:35.320]  What, are you gonna run me over? What, are you threatening me? No, idiot. Listen, don't
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:48.080]  do this. Don't do this. Don't do it. Don't do it. 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And it's
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.680]  not that we're, people are like, well, Alex, I know bad times are coming.
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.760]  We're just gonna have to turn the guns in. We know it's tyranny, we'll have to bide our
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:59.760]  time. Look, Biden, our time's over. They're getting ready to raise taxes again and again
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:04.160]  and again. You're like, well, that'll bankrupt things. That's the plan, Jack. There's gotta
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:06.400]  be a time, people are like, well, this is scary.
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:11.940]  I'm not the one making it scary, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. I'm not the one making
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:18.200]  it scary. They did, they did it. Okay, I'm following the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:22.820]  The globalists call us counter revolutionaries. They're involved in the revolutionary change.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:30.960]  They're the ones coming in doing this. They're the ones bringing in globalism. And excuse
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:38.720]  me, I am an honorable person trying to do the best job I can, pouring out my very substance
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:43.080]  to really historically try to do the right thing and back these people off.
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.860]  Because again, I'll be honest with you, if they were just a corrupt group that wanted
[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:50.840]  to run stuff, I'd still be criticizing them and fighting them. Everybody has this feeling
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:54.120]  of unease. Everybody says, yeah, we agreed things and we knew that we get bad and now
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:57.360]  it's happening because God's warning you, folks.
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:05.520]  These are nasty mass takeover FEMA camp, reeducator, total takeover types, and it's all on record.
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:09.240]  But the mainline conservative talk show hosts all attack me and say that isn't true when
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:15.400]  it's all on record. The army manuals, the FEMA camps, the emergency centers establishment
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:22.620]  attacks. I'm giving you names of things that are public.
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:27.680]  Let's go to the Ron Paul clip. Here it is, 800-25. So you think I was right then telling
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:29.960]  Piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns it will stop.
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:33.000]  Just stop it. I'll go to the clip here in a moment. I just want to give the number out.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:39.400]  It's 800-259-9231. Sorry guys, I said go to it and sort of give the number out. Let's
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:43.320]  go back to the clip now. Here it is. So you think I was right then telling Piers Morgan
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:46.560]  if they try to confiscate the guns, it will start 1776 part two.
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:50.520]  Well, I don't know whether I put them in the same words, but I think I said something very
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:54.600]  similar to what you're saying. Well, God bless you, sir. I hope we can get you back again
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:56.160]  in a month. Very good.
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.320]  What are any other websites that are important to plug? Just campaignforliberty.org. That's
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:04.800]  the short clip. And there's a full clip right before that that we should probably hear on
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:09.680]  the nightly news tonight. The full clip's up on info-words.com where he talked about
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:15.120]  the line in the sand being the gun. So there's a full part. Okay, so we're gonna play that
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:17.880]  later once we find that because it's so important.
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:22.560]  Sure, we'll go ahead and play it now. Go ahead. Will you turn in your semi-autos?
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:30.680]  Well, I might not even have anything to turn in for that purpose, but I don't think the
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:36.840]  American people will. I've always assumed that the line in the sand may well be drawn.
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:42.080]  If the federal agent marches in unannounced and they say, well, give me your gun and give
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:50.740]  me your gold, I don't think we'll do that calmly. I think the American people will highly
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:52.800]  resent it and resist.
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:19:00.260]  Yeah, I mean, this isn't a game. We've got radical Marxist hired by foreign banks. By
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:04.320]  the way, it is the most incredible article I've ever read, and I will read this after
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  I take some calls. This Pravda article that we've posted in full, and probably used to
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:14.720]  be the total Soviet mouthpiece, now it's the opposite, probably used to be known as a joke
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.160]  of lying media.
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:21.560]  And it comes out and says, the banks that have hijacked your country put Stalin first
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:26.380]  Lenin in here and took our guns. We were just like you, we all had rifles and shotguns.
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:31.280]  And we fought back, we were the White Russians and they killed us. And Pravda says, the same
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:35.920]  banks. I actually got tears in my eyes reading it this morning. I saw it yesterday and didn't
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:41.960]  read it. And I know the history is true and here are the Russians, the Russians saying
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:45.760]  you're run by big banks, they're gonna take your guns, they're gonna kill you.
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:50.700]  Your banks did this to us in 1917, America, watch out, they're gonna put you in camps,
[02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:57.240]  they're gonna kill you. I mean, it is incredible information. I'm gonna read this on air, it
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:01.840]  is so incredible.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:08.240]  Hello I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:14.480]  your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:20.120]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:21.120]  your help.
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:26.360]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:32.920]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:38.520]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:42.080]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:49.540]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:58.560]  and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:01.600]  the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:05.440]  My name is Stephen Heuer. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:10.160]  most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:14.260]  whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more serious matters
[02:21:14.260 --> 02:21:18.660]  like inability to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's
[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:23.680]  brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:27.200]  one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:32.200]  My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:37.640]  him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone. He has become friendlier.
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:42.000]  He can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made his first friend. He's
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.520]  doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. He could offer him
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:50.440]  a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.
[02:21:50.440 --> 02:22:01.440]  Go to oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhey.com or call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:07.560]  hempusa.org has a newly designed website and a new and improved detoxification product.

[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.120]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:44.680]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:51.240]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:57.080]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:04.040]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237. Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:08.540]  tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free
[02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:14.680]  video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:19.480]  agencies for what they really are. Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:25.520]  and fear to keep your power bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:30.240]  Others have called it a cover up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:36.840]  goes. My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.400]  them and how you can beat them too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:46.720]  other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go to 123coverup.com and
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:52.080]  discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home. Go watch my video
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:59.520]  now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:09.040]  I want to say something to everybody. I want to thank those of you that have prayed for
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:12.640]  us. I want to thank those of you that have supported us. I want to thank all of you that
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:16.120]  have put up with me over the years because you know, in your discernment, I'm just doing
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:20.720]  the best job I can. And I don't think I always have the answers. In fact, I know I don't.
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:27.560]  I make a lot of mistakes and I'm just fighting as hard as I can. And that's all I can do.
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:34.360]  That's all I can do. And I get very angry at the globalist because I know who they are.
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:39.120]  And I, at a selfish level, I'm very mad that it's in my blood and that I can't help but
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:44.960]  resist them. I mean, I've tried to think about before backing off and I just, it just feels
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:50.400]  so horrible that I just can't do it. And then I realized things are just going to get worse
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:55.520]  and then I get really angry because I'm not backing off. My ancestors didn't back down.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:00.120]  I'm not backing down. And the only reason we've had wealth and liberty and freedom and
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:08.520]  lived the longest and had the most money was because our ancestors were meaner than rattlesnakes.
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:14.780]  And a grizzly bear. And acting like a bunch of sheep, you're going to have wolves come.
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:19.200]  And that's all I can say. I mean, we act like a bunch of cowards and bow down to government
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:27.040]  like it's royalty. We're going to get treated like slaves. And that's why I'm so angry.
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:32.400]  Is because I realized I've been around about all this and then some and it really is upsetting.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:35.760]  I know why people want to think things aren't as bad as I say, because then you'd have to
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:39.720]  do something about it, wouldn't you? And I know there's a lot of you out there doing
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:44.040]  a lot and you can't get through to me and you try to call and I whatever and you get
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:46.400]  mad at me because you've got an idea that would fix everything.
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:54.280]  Look, I'm totally overwhelmed. Okay, I can't do it all. And I try to take time off. I try
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:58.920]  to rest. I try to not get angry. And I did probably need to take a vacation. I'll be
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:02.960]  honest with people because I never take off. Any race car has got to pull over and get
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.720]  its oil changed and get new tires on it and stuff. I'm only a human.
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:12.240]  But I do appreciate all the prayers and things. But I told you, I feel this quickening coming
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:16.860]  and see it building the last few months and now you see it all happening. My gut now it's
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:25.080]  ten times what it was a week ago. It's just man, we're in trouble. And I just want to
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:26.080]  turn things around.
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:31.560]  I just don't want us to be taken over by pure authoritarians. Jacobson just gave me an article
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:36.980]  about searches the examiner reports as liberals proposed gun control, Google searches on Hitler
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:42.360]  gun control spike. One of the top searches yesterday because Drudge told it like it was.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:46.960]  When I saw this yesterday, I said that's the spirit. Putting Stalin and Hitler up there
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.040]  where Obama was talking about using executive orders to take our guns.
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:56.280]  Why is that so powerful? Because you've got to be radical in the face of their radicalism.
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:02.040]  You've got to tell them where this is leading. Because they are radicals and they tell us,
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.960]  don't be radical. Don't be radical that discredits you. No, you're the radicals and extremists
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:12.160]  in defense of liberty is no vice, as Barry Goldwater said.
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:18.840]  Laying down to charity is not golden, it's yellow. Silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:23.480]  Like somebody pee in their pants. That's what cowards do and they get real scared. They
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.720]  fall down. Don't hurt me and pee on themselves. I'm not gonna do that, man. I don't know how
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:38.240]  to do that. Let's go to phone calls. I'll come back in the break, take more. Let's talk
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.080]  to Glenn in Michigan. Glenn, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.080]  Hey buddy.
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:47.120]  Alex, it's a privilege to be on the phone with you. You can count on our prayers up
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:55.280]  here in Michigan. And I just want to tell you, I want to encourage you, what you're
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.160]  going through and what's happened reminds me so much of what happened, the situation
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:07.520]  with a family member of mine who was Thanksgiving. I'm a little nervous, sorry Alex. But I'm
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:13.920]  a reluctantly confrontational person. I've had to confront a member of my family that
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:25.040]  I love so much, an alcoholic. And I prayed about what to say. And to be honest with you,
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:33.600]  God gave me words to say to him, but it came out very brutal. And really wrecked our Thanksgiving,
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:44.800]  if you want to say that. The family was mad at me, but that guy has given his life to
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.560]  Christ and he has got a drink, so.
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:51.640]  Absolutely, you did an intervention. Instead of watching your brother or whoever it was
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:56.240]  drink themselves to death. It was like an intervention with Piers Morgan. They were
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:00.920]  crying, none of the national TVs invited me on. They're totally freaked out, because they
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:05.320]  all know it's about enslavement. And I'm like, look, you don't care about these kids, you
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:06.320]  want tyranny.
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.680]  Watch it, you're on notice. And that scared a lot of mainline conservatives, cuz they
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:15.840]  all deep down know where this is headed. Hey folks, only admitting how real it is, is gonna
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:23.440]  save us. I hope everybody gets that. My pastor has told me for years when you speak the truth
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:29.760]  to somebody and confront them, it's like holding up a mirror to them and showing them what
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:30.760]  they're like.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:35.400]  And it shocks them. And I agree with you, God bless you, brother. I gotta jump, we got
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:38.000]  more calls coming up, but you're right. No, I mean, that's a lot of people say that it's
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.160]  like an intervention. It was shocking. A lot of people didn't like it, because they are
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:47.720]  in trances. Folks, you need to get angry. That's the beginning, like Howard Beale says
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:54.880]  in network. First you've got to get mad. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:30:01.960]  Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:23.320]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:28.760]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program

[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:07.920]  I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's
[02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:14.240]  out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are
[02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:19.040]  going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:24.120]  and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it. We know
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:29.840]  the air is unfit to breathe. Our food is unfit to eat. We sit watching our TVs while some
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:35.400]  local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:40.520]  the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad, worse than bad. They're crazy. It's
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:44.320]  like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.480]  house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:53.340]  at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel
[02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:57.200]  belt and radios and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone. Well I'm not going to
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:02.560]  leave you alone. I want you to get mad. I don't want you to protest. I don't want you
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:05.400]  to riot. I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:08.920]  tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.080]  the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:22.360]  mad. You've got to say I'm a human being. My life has value. I want you to get up now.
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:28.040]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:35.200]  window, open it and stick your head out and yell I'm as bad as hell and I'm not going
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:42.160]  to take this anymore. I want you to get up right now. Get up, go to your windows, open
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:49.680]  them and stick your head out and yell. I'm as bad as hell and I'm not going to take this
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:55.920]  anymore. That's right. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We'll get to your calls. I want you
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.720]  to do this prompt article. We have some more clips that I want to play right now, but that's
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:04.780]  why they're so scared and that's why they're trying to say, oh, that's a losing tactic
[02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:08.320]  to get angry because I'm not here to make you love me.
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:15.540]  I'm here to get you to realize you're being usurped. I mean, they are cold bloodedly hammering
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:22.940]  these dead kids deaths to get our guns to enslave us. They're going to come and take
[02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:26.760]  our guns. They're going to raise our taxes again and again. They're going to reduce us
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:30.920]  to absolute despotism. They're going to eat out our substance, the power to tax and the
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:32.040]  power to destroy.
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:36.400]  I'm angry about that. I don't want to have to flee the United States. There's nowhere
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:43.300]  to run. I know who these people are. And we're never going to get out of this if we don't
[02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:47.320]  get angry about it. And all of you that have decided to serve the system, I mean, come
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:55.840]  on. You think you've picked the winning side and oh, so what, we're going to have tyranny.
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:01.160]  You're idiots. Do you know what real evil is? Because you've signed on to it.
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:05.040]  And I think if you really knew what's going on and what's at the head of this thing, you
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:10.640]  would not want to be under its wings. I mean, I'll tell you right now. And I know a lot
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:14.680]  of you are dumbered in dirt out there that support the system or you're childlike and
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:20.040]  you like to have fantasy that Obama's your friend and the government's your friend. No,
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:27.200]  it's not. The only reason this tyranny hadn't taken over quicker is there's good people
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:29.200]  outside and inside the system.
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:35.080]  Let me read to you this Pravda article or at least part of it because I saw this yesterday,
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:38.000]  didn't have time to read it, read it this morning and it just blew me away. Because
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:41.640]  I know everything in this article in the first five or six paragraphs is absolutely true
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:49.560]  and documented. These days, this is written by Stanislav Mission, who by the way, boys,
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:54.580]  you want bonuses, get me Stanislav on with an interpreter, whatever it takes.
[02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:58.640]  Might speak English, a lot of Russians do. These days, there are few things to admire
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:05.960]  about the socialist, bankrupt and culturally degenerating USA. But at least so far, one
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:10.040]  thing remains, the right to keep and bear arms and use deadly force to defend oneself
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  and possessions.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:15.160]  Yeah, it's the only beachhead of liberty really left right now. And people are clinging to
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:18.900]  it and it's actually growing the movement and awakening. And they hate the statistics
[02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:22.940]  that areas that have guns have lower crime rates. They hate that. If they don't kill
[02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:27.360]  our gun movement, it's over, okay? I don't need their supercomputers to look into the
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:31.520]  future. I can historically, culturally, and with the brain God gave me, look for it.
[02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:37.360]  And of course, they even say now what I've said, that they've got a nippus in the bud.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:41.960]  You don't get, you've already lost globalist. This is not gonna be like Russia. This will
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:49.160]  not be like China. This will not be like other areas. By the way, the Russians did give one
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.800]  hell of a fight. And if you don't know the history of that, the White Russians, nothing
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:58.640]  new with white people, folks. They were all white. Some of them are Asian on the East
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:37:59.640]  side.
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.280]  The point is, they were the pro-Zarists. And you can say what you wanted about the Zars.
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:08.800]  It was medieval, and it was a dictatorship of royalty. But people had private property
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.880]  and the poorest people could feed themselves, and they could have guns, and they were treated
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:19.200]  with respect. They starved to death, more than 50 million of them shot, killed, worked
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:24.920]  them to death in just the first few decades, and they killed another 15 million after that.
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:28.640]  And if you look at the globalist takeover model, as this article points out, it's designed
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:34.440]  just off this Stalinist, Leninist takeover. See, that's what I tried to say earlier, folks.
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:38.280]  If this was just good old boy corruption, I wouldn't be risking my life to fight them.
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:42.120]  I'd just be saying it's wrong and exposing it. And I'm here desperately trying to get
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:47.800]  you to realize that even if they wipe me out, God forbid, or bad things come in the future.
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:52.000]  Listen, knowing this information could stop them down the road from really bad stuff.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  They wanna cut all the food and water off, that's what they're setting up. They wanna
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.920]  kill millions of us. And I mean, I've got the FBI's own testimony where they were in
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:04.520]  there with Obama's handlers. And they were in there saying, we're gonna put 50 million
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:07.320]  in forced labor camps, we're gonna kill 25 million of them.
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:11.560]  I mean, this is their plan, now they've set those up. They'll collapse things and advertise
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:17.280]  it as good though, you have to understand. And there's all these sickos and wannabe sadists
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:23.560]  who wanna run these things. And I mean, I'm sorry, I am not gonna go in there, okay? You're
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:34.000]  gonna have to pay for it. And America knows you're coming. They didn't sell 10 million
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.640]  guns last month, and now it's gonna be on track even more this month cuz people don't
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:38.640]  know.
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:44.520]  They know who you are, their gut knows who that you are. I'm gonna shut up, let me get
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:50.260]  back to this. These days, there are a few things to admire about the socialist bankrupt
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:55.560]  and culturally degenerating USA. But at least so far, one thing remains, the right to bear
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:40:01.160]  arms and use deadly force to defend oneself and possessions.
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:07.880]  This probably comes as a total shock to most of my Western readers. But at one point, Russia
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:12.260]  was one of the most heavily armed societies on Earth. This was, of course, when we were
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:17.900]  free under the czar. Weapons from swords to spears and pistols and rifles and shotguns
[02:40:17.900 --> 02:40:18.900]  were everywhere.
[02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:23.100]  Yeah, in fact, you weren't a man unless you carried a pistol. Common items, people carried
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:27.260]  them concealed, they carried them holstered. Fighting knives were the prominent part of
[02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:34.380]  many traditional attires and those little tubes, Chris's, crossing on the costumes of
[02:40:34.380 --> 02:40:43.060]  Cossacks in various caucus and peoples. Well, those bullets were for rifles, that's why
[02:40:43.060 --> 02:40:44.060]  it's part of their dress.
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:50.000]  You always see them with the bullets on them. Various armies such as the Poles during the
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:55.920]  times of troubles, or Napoleon, or the Germans, even as the czar estate collapsed on the way
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.480]  to World War I and Wall Street money. Found that holding Russian lands was much, much
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:08.220]  harder than taking them. And that it was no easy walk in the park, but a bloodbath on
[02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:09.220]  its own.
[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:12.860]  That's right, that's why when the West tried to collapse Russia at the end of World War
[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:16.460]  I, they couldn't do it cuz they had guns. And Napoleon couldn't do it, he'd beaten everybody,
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:21.820]  but he couldn't beat the Russians, because their citizens would sit there and snipe you.
[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:28.680]  So Western banks on record declassified congressional hearings in the 70s, sent 25 million in gold
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:36.120]  in with more than 10,000 New Yorkers trained with rifles with Lenin to take over. And they
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:41.420]  took over Moscow, and then our media said, Uncle Lenin has taken over, he's a great man.
[02:41:41.420 --> 02:41:47.980]  And then they went in and just killed everybody. Because it was the government, they got the
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:50.460]  central government under control, it wasn't an open outsider.
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:55.420]  See, if you can't realize that, you can't beat these people. Various armies such as
[02:41:55.420 --> 02:42:00.000]  the Poles during the times of trouble, or Napoleon, or the Germans, even as the czar
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:06.140]  estate collapsed with the weight of World War I, and Wall Street money. Found that holding
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:10.780]  Russian lands was much harder, let me see a document cam shot of this, I'm gonna show
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:12.400]  folks this article.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:19.700]  Was much harder than taking them, and taking was no easy walk in the park, but a bloodbath
[02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:28.700]  all its own. In holding one faced an extremely well armed and aggressive population hell
[02:42:28.700 --> 02:42:35.780]  bent on exterminating or driving out the aggressor. This well armed population was what allowed
[02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:42.100]  the various white factions to rise up, no matter how disorganized politically or militarily
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:43.900]  they were in 1918.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:47.940]  And waged a savage civil war against the reds that went on for more than 15 years off and
[02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:53.380]  on. And that's why finally when Stalin had wiped them all out, then he killed 50 million
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:59.300]  people. Once he'd gotten full control, it took him decades to kill everybody. And they've
[02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:01.140]  got the same plan under agenda 21.
[02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:05.660]  That's why you can't have a garden in your front yard or backyard. This is all a Russian
[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:12.700]  takeover because it was a banker takeover. American money did that to the Russians. It
[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:17.300]  should be noted that many of these armies were armed peasants, villagers, farmers and
[02:43:17.300 --> 02:43:24.300]  merchants protecting their own. It had not been for Washington's clandestine support
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:28.060]  of the reds, history would have gone quite differently.
[02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:32.820]  Just like our government funded just now in 49, that's not declassified. He killed over
[02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:37.860]  80 million people, depending on which number you look at, 60 to 80. Moscow fell, for example,
[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:44.780]  not from lack of weapons to defend it, but from lying guile the reds. 10,000 reds took
[02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:52.180]  Moscow and were opposed only by some few hundred officer cadets and their instructors.
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:56.580]  Even then the battle was fierce and losses high. However, in the city alone at the time
[02:43:56.580 --> 02:44:03.860]  lived 30,000 military officers, both active and retired, all with their own issued weapons
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:07.620]  and ammunition. Plus tens of thousands of other citizens were armed. The Soviets promised
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:11.660]  to leave them all alone if they did not intervene.
[02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:16.920]  They did not and for what we were asked afterwards to come register themselves and their weapons
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:23.340]  where they were promptly shot. And the Russians go on to explain to them they are murdering
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:27.060]  liars, they are about to do to you what it does. That's right, you study the Russian
[02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:32.780]  Revolution and then you look at the Trotskyites who finally Stalin double crossed the Lenin
[02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:36.020]  Trotskyites and sent them over here to Mexico and the US.
[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:41.900]  They took over and became the neo cons. Go look it up, the founder of it, Crystal's dad
[02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:49.420]  was a top commie general. And they said, okay, we got kicked out over here, we're gonna come
[02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:55.580]  over here, we're in so much trouble. They're gonna follow an exact Soviet blueprint. And
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:57.140]  it really is just hard to deal with.
[02:44:57.140 --> 02:45:02.540]  I understand why a lot of you can't believe this is happening because it's so horrible.
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:08.320]  Folks, they wanna break us forever. Okay, the Russians were just as armed as the Americans.
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:15.700]  They beat Napoleon and they beat the Reds at first until our government sent a bunch
[02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:20.300]  of armed US citizens over there that knew how to shoot.
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:24.420]  Army veterans and people, it's just so evil. As you know, American citizens helped take
[02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:29.340]  Moscow. And see, as soon as McCarthy, it's now been declassified by the Russian file,
[02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:34.260]  said, our army runs the Soviets. My gosh, he was destroyed but in one day. When he was
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:37.900]  being used to just persecute liberals and people and set up a police state, see, they
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:42.500]  used the threat they created to take our rights over here as well.
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:47.160]  Just like in episode three, the emperor becomes the emperor by staging attacks against his
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.840]  own bases. See, that's a child's movie, explain to you how false flag works. Now, the globalists
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.600]  this time are gonna use Muslim extremists as the pretext to have the cover of the takeover.
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:02.220]  But then the real manuals, which are now public, are all about gun owners. The whole thing
[02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:06.700]  is about checkpoints, grid points, locking down the food, coming and getting our guns.
[02:46:06.700 --> 02:46:11.440]  I mean, they plan it. And they're gonna call him Lincoln, they're not gonna call him Lenin.
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:15.620]  Obama will be, you better remember the day you heard all this, cuz if we don't beat him
[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:21.060]  politically, this is what's gonna happen. They're gonna call this Lenin-esque takeover
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:26.180]  Obama, he's their man. They plan on making him a full dictator, there's no doubt now.
[02:46:26.180 --> 02:46:31.820]  They plan on making him the new Lenin, that'll be what he's called privately. They're gonna
[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:35.940]  call him Abraham Lincoln. And I knew this was coming because of the build up and all
[02:46:35.940 --> 02:46:41.160]  the other points whenever they were advertising him as the new Lincoln and all these movies
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:42.160]  and TV shows.
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:45.600]  And I said, they're going to say that he's gonna crush the states and the right wingers.
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:50.020]  And now that's in daily costs and others, they go, you bet he's Lincoln, we're coming
[02:46:50.020 --> 02:46:54.020]  for your guns, get ready. And they're talking about federal militias that are gonna round
[02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:59.200]  us up. You see, they want our guns cuz they fantasize like Piers Morgan agreed. He said,
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:02.400]  I'm gonna get in a uniform and I'm gonna blow Alex Jones' brains out.
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:08.280]  And the media is like, you bet, kill Alex Jones. But there was nobody outside harassing
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:13.000]  me, no, no, no. They just said they wanna kill me on TV and talked about my kids, hope
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:21.440]  they don't get killed. And I'm not even, listen, I'm not worried about myself or even my family
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:25.120]  cuz they have no future if we don't beat them.
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:28.920]  My flesh says just leave the country. I've warned you, I've done my part, I've been on
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:32.240]  the front line, bye, I'm out of here, I'll broadcast from Switzerland or some other place.
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:36.760]  Not that they're perfect, but get out of here. I'm not doing that, I'm staying, I'm going
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:41.320]  all the way up against these people and I pray that God reprieve us.
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:45.080]  But you know what, the White Russians weren't aborting 50 plus million babies. The Russians
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:49.640]  were pretty moral people, folks, about as moral as you could get, culturally. They went
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:54.640]  to church like 15 hours on Sundays and two hours a night every other night of the week
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:55.640]  and everything else.
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:00.000]  I mean, hard working people. And they were turned over by our filthy government and foreign
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:07.800]  banks to be murdered and butchered. And now they wanna do that here to us. And it's just
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:15.360]  so horrible. It's so horrible, they're gonna do this. They're gonna call us terrorists
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:17.660]  and they're gonna set up a Soviet takeover of America.
[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:21.160]  The Red Terror is gonna come to America. That's what Homeland Security is, is the Red Terror
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:25.680]  force. Mike and Mash here on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:32.720]  Yeah, Alex, I got an article for you to pull up titled Linsky, L-I-N-S-K-Y, Linsky taking
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:38.120]  new slant on gun control. Here in Massachusetts, a state rep, David Paul Linsky, he wants to
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:43.240]  introduce legislation that calls for liability insurance for gun owners, storage of assault
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:46.000]  weapons at only gun clubs, can't have them in your home.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.080]  No, no, that's the plan. It's British style. That's what the commission's gonna say. Biden's
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:53.680]  already saying it. Everyone must re-register, quote, as a new background check. You can't
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.280]  give your son a gun. Any guns given to you by anybody else will be retroactively illegal
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:01.400]  and they're gonna make you go get, quote, insurance on them. Yes, that's the plan.
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.800]  Yeah, and you know what? I just got off the phone with the staffer for the state rep and
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:11.760]  she confirmed it's not, the bill isn't written up yet, but they're working it out. But she
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:16.280]  confirmed that they want insurance. They want storage of assault weapons in gun clubs and
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:20.200]  they want full mental disclosure that you have to sign a waiver before you apply for
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:24.640]  your license so that the issuing officer can get any mental health screening.
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:29.520]  And that just reminds me of Brandon Robb. It's a total gun purge, you know?
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:33.600]  No, listen, they're coming. What did I say two months ago? Drums, drums in the deep,
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:37.120]  they are coming. I mean, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I can hear the drums. I can see
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:44.040]  all the signs. Now they're at the door. We're now here, okay? And they're not just gonna
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:45.040]  shoot up schools.
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:48.880]  They're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us. I mean, folks, this is it. And listen,
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:51.760]  a lot of you are just gonna go along with it, listen to Glenn Beck and sit there and
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:56.040]  they're just gonna talk, be nice and not say the government's bad. They're going to take
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:04.400]  everything. This is a Soviet 1970 takeover. I've studied their battle plan. It is a Soviet
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:09.960]  takeover. The Rothschild Rockefeller banks wrote the Russian takeover plan.
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:14.280]  This is their plan refined. Look at the plan in Libya. Look at the plan in Syria. Look
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:18.280]  at the plan in Iraq. They're doing it here. They went to all, I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.280]  Yeah, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to give out the phone number for people to call in
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:23.280]  on this guy.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.080]  Well, listen, listen, I believe in your voice sounds good, but I've always got to check
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:29.600]  numbers before we give them out on air. People can call in with the wrong number to some
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:33.240]  old lady and then we're in deep trouble. Email me the number, we'll look at doing that. We're
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:37.840]  trying. And again, by the end of the show, I've got this chest cold or whatever it is.
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:42.880]  So it's hard for me not to have packing attacks. I'm not as eloquent as I normally am. The
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:49.320]  Russians and the previously Russian run government run Pravda is saying, do not turn your guns
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:50.320]  in.
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:53.640]  They're planning a red tear that your own banks financed. We've seen this before. Don't
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:56.260]  turn them in. And by the way, they're going to tell the police and military to turn their
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:51:00.400]  guns in. That's in the 7277 State Department plan. After our guns are taken, yours are
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:01.400]  taken.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:06.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:11.160]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:14.800]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:18.160]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:22.720]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:29.140]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:33.480]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:37.600]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:44.960]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:15.240]  By the way, you know what? You just heard me break down. I need to do more eloquently
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:20.440]  in some special reports, but you've heard me say this many times. It's the Soviet style
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:29.540]  1917 Red Terror takeover. And sure, the Soviet Union didn't come till later. You know, technically
[02:54:29.540 --> 02:54:36.020]  it's just a Red's takeover. Red Terror would be the proper term. And again, you're saying,
[02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:40.660]  well, are they communists? What are they? It's mega banks. It's the same very banks
[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:45.440]  that did this, that always wanted to take down Russia because it wasn't controlled by
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:50.500]  their system. And then Russia kind of got away from them for a while under Stalin. He
[02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:56.780]  double-crossed them. And then Gorbachev was a globalist agent. And then now they're trying
[02:54:56.780 --> 02:55:01.540]  to merge the EU with Russia. It's just a horrible situation all around. Let's take some more
[02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:07.260]  calls. I appreciate you holding. Let's talk to a Heretic from Washington and
[02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:14.980]  then we'll go to Chris and others. We'll do some overdrive. Go ahead, Heretic. Okay, he's
[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:17.980]  gone. Let's talk to Chris in Oklahoma. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:20.980]  Hey, Alex. How's it going? Good, buddy.
[02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:25.820]  I just wanted to call in and give people kind of a mindset into somebody who is actually
[02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:30.620]  a conflict schedule weapons. I was with the 45th Infantry Brigade and Delta Company, first
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:35.660]  the 279 during Hurricane Katrina. We were really the first boots on the ground. And
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:42.220]  keep in mind, we were an infantry brigade and we were called there for security. Saving
[02:55:42.220 --> 02:55:47.460]  lives would have been nice or whatever, but that's just not what we do. And when we come
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:52.540]  up to your house, it's just a hell of a scene. It's just like something out of a movie. It's
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:58.260]  five trucks. Everyone departs. They stack right on the outside of the frame of the door
[02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:03.060]  and then they come through. Well, every now and then we would knock and yell, does anyone
[02:56:03.060 --> 02:56:06.060]  need any assistance? But that's how I'm booting in the door.
[02:56:06.060 --> 02:56:10.840]  Well, that's the psych warfare thing. We're here to assist you. I mean, that's all. This
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:15.940]  is not an attack. And this happened on record. Again, this is the training. This is the test.
[02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:18.940]  I think you called a few years ago and told the whole story, didn't you?
[02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:23.940]  Yeah, it was a couple of months ago. I called in and I was talking to Rob, the health ranger
[02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:27.140]  it was. Okay, so finish your story. I mean, describe
[02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:31.260]  to people, yeah. And then ABC News said if someone resisted, you killed them.
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:38.180]  Yes, sir. What happened, I was called up in the middle of the night and literally at 2
[02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:42.500]  a.m. I reported to the unit at 4 a.m. We were told immediately that there's news reports
[02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:47.980]  and reports on the ground that people are firing at rescue helicopters. The city is
[02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:52.900]  descended into total chaos and we're gonna come in there and put our boot up some butt.
[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:55.460]  Yeah, exactly. Notice the cover story with you at society.
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:57:00.460]  Now we're gonna go find and shoot in helicopters later made up. We're just gonna go take everybody's
[02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:04.220]  guns at their houses. Yeah, we're going to secure the city at any
[02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:10.180]  and all costs. We'll meet aggression with aggression. And that's how it was to be done.
[02:57:10.180 --> 02:57:13.660]  And we're like this, right wing terrorists just nuked the major city. All of them are
[02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:17.220]  to be killed on sight. They don't turn the guns in. We're gonna round up the troll makers
[02:57:17.220 --> 02:57:22.740]  as well. You're the willows and you're dead. Hail Obama, King of Earth. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:27.380]  Oh, sorry. They used that whole situation. I figured this out later. I'm not in the military
[02:57:27.380 --> 02:57:31.700]  anymore. And this plagues me every day that I went around and actually did this. It didn't
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.420]  occur to me till later what I was what I was doing. I know it sounds like an ignorant cop
[02:57:35.420 --> 02:57:39.140]  out, but no, no, no, no, no. You just walk up and suddenly you're being
[02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:43.180]  groped by TSA. You just walk up one day and they say, take your shoes off. You walk up
[02:57:43.180 --> 02:57:46.300]  one day and they say, go get in the ditch and they shoot you in the back of the head.
[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:50.660]  But I mean, look, they are planning this and then they're going to call gun owners terrorist.
[02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:55.260]  And then I hope people understand they plan a red style takeover. If people submit to
[02:57:55.260 --> 02:57:58.660]  this, it's over. If you could imagine what this, you know,
[02:57:58.660 --> 02:58:03.500]  the geoengineering and things that go on, whatever you could say about Katrina, it happened.
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:08.700]  And it's just that emergency situation where everybody's hyped up. You know, my whole unit
[02:58:08.700 --> 02:58:13.900]  is is on fire to do this mission. And me as a young soldier who had had some disciplinary
[02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:18.020]  problems, I'm eager to prove myself. You know what I mean? I'm eager to show that I'm combat
[02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:23.060]  ready and I'm ready to go. You know, I just did it. I didn't. I wasn't there to exactly.
[02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:26.820]  I mean, I think we should all just turn our guns into Obama and have one hundred percent
[02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:30.980]  tax and all live in forced collectives like Mao did. And I think 80 million of us should
[02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:35.940]  be killed by Mao. And I think Mao is God there. Now I can be on Piers Morgan and I can be
[02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:40.940]  popular. We have a guy claiming he was a Piers Morgan audience member. Stay with us.

[03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:23.660]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right,
[03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:29.900]  folks, we're now into overdrive here. We've got a fellow who says he was a previous audience
[03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:34.140]  member. They didn't have a studio audience when I was there, but they do sometimes. Derek
[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:40.340]  in New Jersey. That was a scary last phone call. Then we got James. We'll try to cram
[03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:46.420]  in. But real fast, Derek, what's your story? Hey, Alex, how you doing? Good. Hey, I was
[03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:52.740]  an audience member back in September when Jesse Ventura was the guest. I was actually
[03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:56.100]  one of the audience members. I got to ask him a question. That was the first audience
[03:00:56.100 --> 03:01:05.300]  member. Getting a little nervous. My experience on that show was that they filled the audience.
[03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:08.580]  You can't really see it from the angles that they shot it at, but they filled the audience
[03:01:08.580 --> 03:01:13.140]  with people, interns, people from other floors. They were pulling people out of the street.
[03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:19.340]  They couldn't fill the entire audience, all the seats. There were a bunch of empty seats.
[03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:24.280]  The guy next to me who asked the second question about the Navy seal book, they pulled him
[03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:28.740]  off the street. I swear this happened. They pulled him off the street because we were
[03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:33.180]  talking to my brother and I. My brother even pointed it out to one of the producer people
[03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:36.100]  who comes over. He said, oh, you're pulling people off the street. She gave him a snide
[03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:41.780]  remark and the guy, they said, here's your question. They handed him the car. They said,
[03:01:41.780 --> 03:01:44.380]  they went through it. They practiced it. I was right next to the guy and they said, here
[03:01:44.380 --> 03:01:46.980]  you go. Here's what you're going to ask him. And he asked him the question. They didn't
[03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:51.740]  even get to the other audience members that were picked to ask questions.
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:57.020]  Sir, they had people on a rooftop in Atlanta with a green screen saying they were under
[03:01:57.020 --> 03:02:01.900]  nerve gas attack. I mean, have you, no, I mean it's CIA and they're not even, did you
[03:02:01.900 --> 03:02:06.580]  notice that how, how the place looks shabby and was rotting. It was disgusting. I actually
[03:02:06.580 --> 03:02:12.300]  used that bathroom. It was, I couldn't believe it. Wow. So you, you, you saw the poop on
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:16.500]  the walls. It was terrible. They, they, yeah, before, before the show went, they said, if
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:20.020]  anyone needs to use the bathroom, come with us. My brother went to, it was, I couldn't
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:23.820]  believe it. You sound credible. We can go to the last Ventura interview and see if it
[03:02:23.820 --> 03:02:29.100]  matches your voice and people will do that later when this goes online.
[03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:32.740]  Describe the layout of the Piers Morgan set. When you come in out of the hallway, how was
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:33.740]  it laid out?
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:38.020]  Well, the way he had it set up there was kind of like a round table. So everyone was sitting
[03:02:38.020 --> 03:02:40.980]  in the middle. Before you go in the studio, what's, what's right outside the door. They
[03:02:40.980 --> 03:02:41.980]  brought you in.
[03:02:41.980 --> 03:02:47.900]  Yeah, it was like a cruddy white walls or the ceiling was caved in. It was terrible
[03:02:47.900 --> 03:02:52.180]  lighting. There was, I mean, it looked like you were in a, I mean, it looked like they
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:57.420]  bring the trash through there every day, but what was the layout? What was the layout of
[03:02:57.420 --> 03:03:02.780]  the, of the green room? And then the, what was beside it?
[03:03:02.780 --> 03:03:07.220]  Well, we just, I just went to the restroom. It was through the, through the doors and
[03:03:07.220 --> 03:03:09.340]  I didn't quite go past through the green rooms.
[03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:12.140]  It was white walls. By the way, that's not the common restroom. I'm talking about the
[03:03:12.140 --> 03:03:16.140]  green room restroom was dirty too. I appreciate your call, sir. Good to hear from you. Let's
[03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:20.380]  talk to James in Minnesota with vital info and XM listener. Go ahead.
[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:25.900]  Hey Alex, this is James. Thank you so much for taking my call. A long time listener.
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:33.300]  First time caller. I just want to say that I do hereby solemnly swear and affirm that
[03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:38.260]  I am prepared to die for the public. I am prepared to die for Liberty. I'm a us infantry
[03:03:38.260 --> 03:03:43.320]  army show army soldier. I am prepared to die in the defense of this Republic. And I stand
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:44.320]  on that.
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:48.940]  What do you think about the Russians saying, don't turn in your guns. Like our military
[03:03:48.940 --> 03:03:51.980]  did, you know, under the state department memorandum after they get our guns, they have
[03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:54.780]  the general army stand down and turn their guns in.
[03:03:54.780 --> 03:04:00.740]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's, that's what they've done in every, every communist revolution
[03:04:00.740 --> 03:04:04.740]  is always a purge of the military after they're done being useful idiots after they're done
[03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:09.700]  using us to enact their agenda, they murder us. And I'm telling you right now, everyone
[03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:13.700]  listening to this, everyone who can hear my voice right now, you are in the military.
[03:04:13.700 --> 03:04:19.220]  If you do not stand against this, you will die. They will murder you. You are their enemy.
[03:04:19.220 --> 03:04:25.420]  They hate you. Now look, I have, I have a message of tragedy and hope. I, I have seen
[03:04:25.420 --> 03:04:28.980]  the enemy and I have looked into his eyes and I know who he is, but I know how to defeat
[03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:29.980]  him.
[03:04:29.980 --> 03:04:35.740]  And I'm going to share that with you right now. Are you prepared? All right. Last night
[03:04:35.740 --> 03:04:43.180]  I spoke with tier one special operations officer. He looked me square in the eyes. We're going
[03:04:43.180 --> 03:04:47.060]  into extra overdrive. This is too important. We'll go to more calls as well. Don't hang
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:53.260]  up. Don't hang up. James folks, I've studied history. I know this attack pattern. That's
[03:04:53.260 --> 03:04:57.540]  why I keep telling you what's coming next. I guess I just got chills. This is a red Soviet
[03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:15.220]  style takeover by mega banks, not the Russians.

[03:08:00.020 --> 03:08:09.780]  today from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:15.620]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network so they announced yesterday they were going to use
[03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:20.260]  executive orders to ban semi-autos other things and because it was a huge backlash they came out
[03:08:20.260 --> 03:08:26.820]  today i saw on msnbc and cnn both globalist channels collaborator channels saying nobody's
[03:08:26.820 --> 03:08:32.100]  going to take your guns through executive orders the executive order only activates interpretations
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:38.500]  of existing laws so the new thing is yes a dictator would use executive orders to take guns
[03:08:39.060 --> 03:08:44.740]  our executive orders only interpret laws that already exist that's what we've said they could
[03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:49.620]  use some street sweeper legislation to expand to all semi-autos and then claim under rulemaking
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:53.540]  you got to turn them in that's what larry pratt said a month ago on the show they can also harass
[03:08:53.540 --> 03:08:57.540]  with rule making the gun shops and make it impossible and make them you know well under
[03:08:57.540 --> 03:09:02.580]  atf rules you got to have 50 million in insurance they in fact they said they're going to target
[03:09:02.580 --> 03:09:08.100]  manufacturers with rules so and again they're just getting you ready where they have the moral
[03:09:08.100 --> 03:09:12.500]  high ground where every time there's a mass shooting that they advertise and and and hype
[03:09:12.500 --> 03:09:19.140]  up with copycats that it's your fault you collectively have the guilt you did it like
[03:09:19.140 --> 03:09:23.140]  you told larry pratt yesterday he said don't you feel anything for what's happened don't you feel
[03:09:23.140 --> 03:09:28.820]  any empathy like he's done it and i would have said i wouldn't have been so mad of course he
[03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:33.540]  didn't bring that up to me because i knew he'd say something like that i plan to say you mean
[03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:37.380]  you're the ones that made them victim disarmament zones and advertise it's the place to go kill
[03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:43.060]  people i did get that part out you're the ones you're the ones using 20 dead which is terrible
[03:09:43.060 --> 03:09:47.940]  but statistically very low probability why don't you use all the other horrible stories out there
[03:09:47.940 --> 03:09:51.860]  because you've got an agenda now i want to shut up go back to your calls james in minnesota says
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:57.700]  he's an army infantryman and he wanted to get into talking to some people last night in the
[03:09:57.700 --> 03:10:04.100]  military and what he was hearing he's listening on xm james go ahead hey alex thanks for uh going
[03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:09.460]  back to me hey you better recap what you said recap what you said and then cover it all right
[03:10:09.460 --> 03:10:15.460]  last night i was uh speaking to a friend of mine this guy is tier one alex this is u.s army special
[03:10:15.460 --> 03:10:21.460]  operations this guy's been in he's seen it from every angle and i just asked him straight up i
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:29.140]  said hey um if it comes to it are you seriously willing to look me in the eye and kill me and he
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:34.260]  said this to me he saw you right to my face and the face of my wife he said yes i would i would
[03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:40.500]  come to your house i would kick in your door and i would kill you to take your gun and the moment
[03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:47.380]  he said that to me the you know god just revealed this to me in a glorious flash light this is how
[03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:51.940]  we are going to defeat these people alex we're going to call their bluff we're going to turn
[03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:58.180]  their threats back on them i haven't i had this idea for a campaign we're going to call it we are
[03:10:58.180 --> 03:11:03.860]  the dead we're going to have a massive facebook campaign we're going to get people who are willing
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:07.940]  to stand with the public with republic we're willing to stand with democracy we're going to
[03:11:07.940 --> 03:11:13.300]  get them to delete their facebook pages in mass if they want to treat us like unpersons but they
[03:11:13.300 --> 03:11:17.780]  want to dehumanize us we're going to pull out from their system we're going to reject them
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:24.260]  i want to get a massive advertising campaign going i want t-shirts i want bumper stickers we are the
[03:11:24.260 --> 03:11:32.420]  dead we are the 1.5 million if one percent resisted 1.5 million who would die if these
[03:11:32.420 --> 03:11:38.740]  laws are enacted we're going to call their bluff and i want 1.5 million patriots to march on
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:45.540]  washington dc in mass and we're going to stand there in a silent protest and at the stroke of 12
[03:11:45.540 --> 03:11:49.620]  we're all going to light candles and we're going to blow them out one by one and we're just going
[03:11:49.620 --> 03:11:54.820]  to stand there well that's powerful you should shoot a youtube video describing your idea no i
[03:11:54.820 --> 03:12:00.180]  mean that's what i've done on air is i've i've said okay i'm not going along with this and that's
[03:12:00.180 --> 03:12:05.540]  why i got morgan's face is because i've had to go across that line i'm public they've now made me
[03:12:05.540 --> 03:12:09.540]  the poster boy to take down when they blow up stuff you better believe they're going to blame me
[03:12:10.580 --> 03:12:14.180]  and they're going to try to get all the other cowards out there who are libertarians or whatever
[03:12:14.180 --> 03:12:19.060]  to then come criticize me and and when they do that they're benedict arnolds
[03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:23.860]  okay our forebears went through this you know don't be so angry at the new world order don't
[03:12:23.860 --> 03:12:28.900]  get in their face don't you know go along don't don't say you know that's what this is coming down
[03:12:28.900 --> 03:12:34.500]  to and listen i've had the calls i've talked to a lot of military folks where they said their
[03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:38.820]  commanders are like yes we will kill americans they don't turn their guns in so now it's gone
[03:12:38.820 --> 03:12:44.180]  from it'll never happen to we're going to kill the americans i mean it's total treason and oh
[03:12:44.180 --> 03:12:48.500]  by the way it won't be sob stories for us that are dead and i just want the military and police to
[03:12:48.500 --> 03:12:56.740]  know once this starts i i mean it they just have no idea and usually militaries throughout history
[03:12:56.740 --> 03:13:01.700]  usually do this and then they're called out as well i mean i i don't know what it would be like
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:06.020]  if this guy looked at you and said i'll come kill your family i mean he's been psychologically
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:11.140]  profiled and chosen for this so he i mean i guess there's no order he wouldn't follow just anything
[03:13:11.140 --> 03:13:16.500]  he'll do it and alex this is why we have to call their bluff look i'm telling you man well what
[03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:22.580]  did you say to him when he said this i i just i just said well you know what if if a faceless
[03:13:22.580 --> 03:13:28.580]  corporate fascist regime means more to you than the lives of of human beings then the lord bless
[03:13:28.580 --> 03:13:32.900]  you and keep you that's all i could say to him that's all that's honestly all i could say to him
[03:13:32.900 --> 03:13:40.660]  because yeah these guys think being evil is manly and and it's the opposite i mean i mean alex look
[03:13:40.660 --> 03:13:46.500]  i'm telling you we're not the best but we're all that's left i want to work for you man i want to
[03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:51.940]  come to austin i want to make this a reality i want one point five well well here's the issue
[03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:55.620]  if you try to have people march on washington they put provocateurs and it would never even
[03:13:55.620 --> 03:14:01.780]  the point is we need a million marches in every town and city every day with banner hangs and
[03:14:01.780 --> 03:14:06.980]  people doing youtube videos and other ideas and people saying i'm not turning my guns in this is
[03:14:06.980 --> 03:14:11.300]  about despotism and you know drudge putting up the fact that hitler wanted the guns and stalin
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:16.100]  one of the guns we need to call them what they are authoritarians using dead kids for their agenda
[03:14:16.100 --> 03:14:21.940]  i appreciate your call i mean i think most of the military i talk to aren't going to go along with
[03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:29.620]  this but uh the ones that they're going to put in command are and i've analyzed it it is a vicious
[03:14:29.620 --> 03:14:35.220]  takeover plan and a lot of people say man you're scary i guess you're just cowards then because
[03:14:35.220 --> 03:14:42.420]  you know i'm telling you what i really think it is so we can face it and i i i mean my instinct
[03:14:42.420 --> 03:14:48.180]  my gut my intellect everything points towards resist this get back in its face or it wins
[03:14:48.180 --> 03:14:53.940]  my fear is letting them take over so i'm running around like a chicken with my head cut off
[03:14:55.780 --> 03:15:01.540]  trying to warn people and as radical as this show sounds we're getting new affiliates in fact
[03:15:01.540 --> 03:15:10.260]  here's a couple of them every week khnc 1360 am the lion port collins colorada 10 000 water
[03:15:10.260 --> 03:15:17.780]  and that's one we're featuring that's been an affiliate uh and wjnl 12 10 am
[03:15:19.460 --> 03:15:25.700]  traver city michigan 50 000 watts thanks to pd and gm and the great stations and i think those
[03:15:25.700 --> 03:15:30.340]  are two stations we already had so this is this is a station in focus this is not the new affiliates
[03:15:30.340 --> 03:15:34.900]  that that list is somewhere else but i need to have the affiliates in focus thing once a week as
[03:15:34.900 --> 03:15:40.340]  well uh but but it's it's all very very exciting i just came in and said hey here's some new
[03:15:40.340 --> 03:15:46.100]  affiliates and that's actually the new stations in focus deal um but we have gained several new
[03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:51.220]  affiliates this week as well the point is the broadcast is steadily steadily growing here
[03:15:51.220 --> 03:15:58.900]  let's talk to chris in california uh wants to talk he's listening on xm chris what's your take on all
[03:15:58.900 --> 03:16:05.860]  this and man i think that this is all something that you predicted from the beginning i'm a one
[03:16:05.860 --> 03:16:11.300]  year listener first time caller and that piece of garbage going back is always preaching about
[03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:15.540]  doing your homework and doing your research and last night i did my research and went on youtube
[03:16:15.540 --> 03:16:22.820]  now you've been talking about this since july 25th 2001 i mean you called 9 11 on the spot
[03:16:22.820 --> 03:16:27.860]  you know you you know we got i i appreciate everything you're doing alex and and uh i'm
[03:16:27.860 --> 03:16:32.180]  getting my mother my brothers my friends everybody's getting into the show i'm trying to
[03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:37.540]  get them on info wars this is all you know i'm ready man i never thought anything like this could
[03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:42.180]  be possible my last time i was hoping it wouldn't but well no i mean it's a foreign banking takeover
[03:16:42.180 --> 03:16:46.660]  to label all gun owners as terrorists and then and then the gun grabbers is sweet people that love
[03:16:46.660 --> 03:16:52.020]  children and they're sending men in black uniforms to get our guns it's their excuse to start a civil
[03:16:52.020 --> 03:17:00.020]  war so they can then like the regs uh take over i mean that's their plan and and listen i i just
[03:17:00.020 --> 03:17:04.180]  really quick i think that it's going to be quite as simple as i don't think obama knows that he
[03:17:04.180 --> 03:17:09.700]  can't take our guns yet but this is all a setup and i think what did what python was saying yesterday
[03:17:09.700 --> 03:17:13.940]  i think the setup is they're just going to make it more difficult for people like you and i
[03:17:13.940 --> 03:17:19.300]  to take to carry our guns around you know more gun no gun zones and that so when that happens
[03:17:19.300 --> 03:17:22.420]  that's when they're going to be able to confiscate the guns because all of these
[03:17:22.420 --> 03:17:26.740]  movies are going to start shooting people and blowing people up and blaming on people like us
[03:17:26.740 --> 03:17:31.220]  who you know just wanted to they're going to make it more difficult for us to defend ourselves well
[03:17:31.220 --> 03:17:37.700]  god bless you let's go to eric uh in canada real quick go ahead hey alex first time call i've been
[03:17:37.700 --> 03:17:43.700]  following you since 2004 and you're awesome um i gotta tell you since all of this stuff has been
[03:17:43.700 --> 03:17:48.660]  going on and after watching what happened on pierce morgan the other night um me and my wife
[03:17:48.660 --> 03:17:52.500]  are going out to start buying guns and i don't know if you know what canada is about but we
[03:17:52.500 --> 03:17:58.980]  we don't have a very big gun population up here but as much as this stuff is going on state side
[03:17:58.980 --> 03:18:05.060]  this stuff is going on canada side to uh the idol no more movement which is being held by the natives
[03:18:05.060 --> 03:18:10.500]  so on and so forth you know alex i gotta tell you my friend you know we will stand there we
[03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:15.620]  will stand in front of you we will not allow these guys to take you down and from your brothers from
[03:18:15.620 --> 03:18:22.180]  the north i swear to god we're here for you guys well that touches my heart and again i'm certainly
[03:18:22.180 --> 03:18:26.420]  an imperfect vessel to be right up at the tip of the spear we're all up there together i'm trying
[03:18:26.420 --> 03:18:31.620]  my best thank you for the support uh they're going to demonize us they're going to use all of this
[03:18:31.620 --> 03:18:37.700]  weird cultural revolution uh you know emotion stuff they're going to say we killed the children
[03:18:37.700 --> 03:18:43.860]  we blew up the federal buildings we nuked the city we assassinate you know i mean i've told
[03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:47.860]  you everybody they're going to do horrible things and then say it's our fault and they've said gun
[03:18:47.860 --> 03:18:53.620]  owners are nazis gun owners are clan gun owners we collectively killed those kids no you did you're
[03:18:53.620 --> 03:18:59.220]  a bunch of scum trying to scapegoat us to disarm us because they can't have us armed when they
[03:18:59.220 --> 03:19:04.420]  fully implode the economy so they're racing to get our guns god bless you sir and i appreciate
[03:19:04.420 --> 03:19:14.340]  you're from canada all right well i tell you we've got wmqm listeners in tennessee we've got
[03:19:14.340 --> 03:19:17.460]  all sorts of folks calling in but i'm going to go into retransmission now because i've already
[03:19:17.460 --> 03:19:22.500]  gone 20 minutes into overdrive and again i'm under the weather so it's hard for me to talk
[03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:27.140]  with this chest cold but i thought was just allergies so i'm gonna go work on some things
[03:19:27.140 --> 03:19:32.260]  for the nightly news coming up tonight seven o'clock info wars.com prison planet.com a lot
[03:19:32.260 --> 03:19:39.700]  of key info the dean of the doug hagglund interview is coming up with the homeland
[03:19:39.700 --> 03:19:45.300]  security confirming source that they are stalking me and again they do this to make me sound crazy
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:49.860]  when i talk about it and then also try to intimidate me because they know the general
[03:19:49.860 --> 03:19:53.540]  public just does not understand the stuff you see in movies so much stuff i've seen in movies
[03:19:53.540 --> 03:19:57.220]  that's based on real stuff that goes on so please pray for us
[03:19:57.220 --> 03:20:02.580]  all right that's the doug hagglund things coming up stay with us
