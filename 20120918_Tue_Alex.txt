[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:38.120]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is
[00:38.120 --> 00:48.240]  already Tuesday the 18th day of September 2012 and we're going to be here for the next three
[00:48.240 --> 00:54.680]  hours and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us to break down all the different preparations
[00:54.680 --> 01:01.760]  not just in the United States but also in Europe for what you would call martial law basically
[01:01.760 --> 01:10.480]  so we're going to be going over all of that today we are also going to be looking at the
[01:10.480 --> 01:14.280]  ongoing carnage the Middle East and what's happening with the announcement of unlimited QE
[01:14.280 --> 01:21.080]  and how all that ties together I also want to analyze the campaign propaganda going on by
[01:21.080 --> 01:28.720]  the Obama system and the Romney system but I tell you you've seen Obama come out and say you
[01:28.720 --> 01:35.320]  didn't build that to all the small business people and entrepreneurs out there that go
[01:35.320 --> 01:43.920]  through living hell the regulations and bureaucracy and fluoride population to try to actually build
[01:43.920 --> 01:52.040]  companies and operations and I'm not a defender of Mitt Romney but when Mitt Romney is being attacked
[01:52.040 --> 01:59.240]  for showing some semblance of what this Republic was built on you have to defend the ideas that
[01:59.240 --> 02:05.160]  are under attack and so I will be defending the so-called mother Jones secret video of him
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.040]  and a fundraiser now it wasn't Obama in San Francisco saying don't worry we'll get these
[02:09.040 --> 02:14.120]  bitter clingers that cling to their Bibles and their guns with the stain he was saying look
[02:14.120 --> 02:21.960]  47% of the population is on government dole of one way or another and he said they're going
[02:21.960 --> 02:27.240]  to vote for bigger government and there's nothing you can do about that he said I'm here to
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.880]  represent those of you that actually produce which isn't really true he he represents the
[02:31.880 --> 02:37.120]  big global monopoly banks that also use government and all the corporate welfare to expand their
[02:37.120 --> 02:42.920]  empire but his rhetoric is true trying to get votes so the fact that that rhetoric is under
[02:42.920 --> 02:48.200]  attack the rhetoric must be defended because it's very accurate the globalists know that once
[02:48.200 --> 02:54.920]  they get 50 55% of the population dependent on government they will vote to turn their guns in
[02:54.920 --> 02:59.720]  they will vote to turn your guns in they will vote to take your property they will vote to
[02:59.720 --> 03:04.280]  put you in a slave camp that happens in every communist society to produce things for them
[03:05.080 --> 03:11.080]  and the system will let its welfare recipients corporate and low level sick there and get fat
[03:11.800 --> 03:15.880]  doing nothing or working in a bureaucrat job wearing a uniform of some type
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.760]  ordering you around so this is the model we're going into it's a hellish society
[03:20.760 --> 03:26.120]  it's a terrible society that's where we're going and so this is basically the establishment
[03:26.120 --> 03:33.160]  striking back against you didn't build that comments of barack obama so when we come back
[03:33.160 --> 03:39.160]  from break we'll get into that and also a lot of the other top news that is being reported on right
[03:39.160 --> 03:46.280]  now us embassy in bay root destroys classified documents prepares for protest cia sponsored
[03:46.280 --> 03:52.920]  taliban attack camp bastion with orders to kidnap or kill prince harry yeah let's not forget

[08:39.880 --> 08:48.360]  so much for joining us today we're going to get into the giant ongoing conflagration that has
[08:48.360 --> 08:55.480]  been set off in the middle east by al qaeda that our criminal government publicly created in 1979
[08:55.480 --> 09:01.640]  and is publicly injecting into every major country in the middle east with their little
[09:01.640 --> 09:10.200]  henchmen the saudi arabians all of that is going on and taking place this is the political
[09:10.200 --> 09:21.000]  distraction for the banking takeover that is unfolding we're going to be going over what's
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.480]  happening in the economy today and paul joseph watson will join us in the next hour info wars
[09:27.480 --> 09:32.680]  dot com press upon a dot com reporter and of course one of the anchors for info wars not only news
[09:33.640 --> 09:39.960]  looking at domestic preparations for collapse you see we've had threats of iranian war before
[09:39.960 --> 09:46.600]  we've had threats of hyperinflation before we've had all these threats before as the world slides
[09:46.600 --> 09:52.920]  into this global depression that's been engineered to consolidate wealth but now we've got all the
[09:52.920 --> 10:01.160]  intel of government running around batting down the hatches digging in buying 1.4 billion plus
[10:01.160 --> 10:07.080]  rounds of ammo watson's got an article coming out in the next 30 minutes with even more ammo they're
[10:07.080 --> 10:16.200]  buying we're going to be breaking that report so all of this tied together really shows a perfect
[10:16.200 --> 10:22.120]  storm of biblical proportions because if there is a wider middle east war and the russians
[10:22.120 --> 10:30.520]  or chinese are brought in over deals they have with iran and syria katie bar the door now again
[10:30.520 --> 10:36.680]  we can move back from the precipice just like during the cuban missile crisis of 1961 or other
[10:36.680 --> 10:45.160]  events that have taken place but regardless the world is in a very very serious position right
[10:45.160 --> 10:59.320]  now now that said i want to get into domestic politics first year because when you get down to it
[10:59.880 --> 11:07.400]  obama and romney are funded by the very same megabanks institutions crony capitalist monopoly men
[11:07.400 --> 11:16.600]  insiders but romney is is on the surface enough different that conservatives and libertarians
[11:16.600 --> 11:23.560]  are supposed to see him as the lesser of two evils and we've had obviously endless discussions and
[11:23.560 --> 11:34.280]  debates about this fact but romney must be defended in one major respect because he is
[11:34.280 --> 11:44.440]  the synthetic false standard bearer for the constitution the bill of rights the declaration
[11:44.440 --> 11:51.400]  of independence free market rugged individualism that's what the republican party supposedly
[11:51.400 --> 11:57.080]  represents and then it misrepresents it to give all of those great things a bad name the media
[11:57.080 --> 12:03.400]  blames the crony insider garbage the tens of trillions and banker bailouts they blame that on
[12:03.400 --> 12:09.800]  capitalism when it was government teamed up with select corporations and banks that created the
[12:09.800 --> 12:17.000]  mess we're in right now out of their greed and hubris so what i'm getting at here is that when
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.040]  obama comes out and says if you got a small business you didn't build that government basically did
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.280]  social engineers created the system that allowed you to have this business
[12:30.280 --> 12:37.400]  which at one level is is is partially true but that's the collective wealth and work
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.880]  and intelligence of the society in concert and then a limited government working as the system
[12:43.880 --> 12:47.720]  to direct it and i'm not saying that's the only way we could go but that's been the system we've
[12:47.720 --> 12:53.240]  had for thousands of years big governments destroy things and bring things into stagnation
[12:53.240 --> 13:02.520]  that's well known maximum of history but it is the human initiative and spark and drive and energy
[13:02.520 --> 13:12.040]  and competitiveness that animates the socioeconomic system it is the taste of the public that will
[13:12.040 --> 13:20.360]  reflect its mind into the architecture into the art into the literature into the style
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.200]  into the manner into the culture of the people
[13:28.120 --> 13:34.760]  so the the statement by obama before i get into the big mitt romney controversy the statement
[13:39.160 --> 13:46.920]  by obama that you didn't build that we've played the clip at nauseam no need to replay it here you
[13:46.920 --> 13:52.040]  can look it up watch the whole speech he explains government organized it government did it and
[13:52.040 --> 14:00.760]  collectively we built this yes but we were collectively led by the good the bad and the
[14:00.760 --> 14:07.960]  ugly there's always different forces in society and no one can deny that big government out of
[14:07.960 --> 14:14.200]  control government has been created and fostered and supported by selective big corporate interests
[14:14.200 --> 14:20.280]  that don't want freedom and don't want competition and who want to shut down the family itself
[14:20.280 --> 14:28.520]  because any sovereignty any allegiance not owed to the corporate borg state gets in the way of them
[14:28.520 --> 14:34.600]  being able to politically rewrite us like a computer desk whenever they want they want you
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.520]  mindless in doing whatever they say a fad driven empty creature a biological android
[14:40.520 --> 14:49.000]  but let me just put this in simple terms okay and state it clearly when obama comes out and says
[14:49.000 --> 14:58.040]  you didn't build that that is the social engineers assaulting the mind of humanity and assaulting
[14:58.040 --> 15:04.360]  the mind of the individual and waging war against the greatest elements of our species
[15:04.360 --> 15:15.240]  its competitiveness art enjoying the fruits of your own labor that is a full frontal assault
[15:15.240 --> 15:22.920]  on that by the ruling class that craves the technocratic class that craves controlling your
[15:22.920 --> 15:37.000]  mind that craves controlling art that craves dominating studying eastern germany under the
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.480]  communist rush under the communist china under the communist and other authoritarians the nazis as well
[15:43.480 --> 15:50.360]  they all craved controlling art and the theater and the literature and they would make all the
[15:50.360 --> 15:56.760]  famous artists come to them and beg them to allow their books to be published they would make them
[15:56.760 --> 16:02.120]  change things they would make them make films you know hitler constantly made every star
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.280]  especially every female star come visit him and kiss his butt if they were going to be allowed to
[16:08.280 --> 16:14.760]  be in the theater that's what government's about is these nobody thugs these greasy scumbags of
[16:14.760 --> 16:20.440]  government and and the corporate interests that control them getting together and dominating
[16:20.440 --> 16:28.920]  society reveling in the domination reveling in the control i mean that is such a on fire
[16:28.920 --> 16:37.640]  authoritarian statement by obama to come out and say you didn't build that and then have all the
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.320]  democrats and and and and all the collectivists and all of these people who feel power through the
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.280]  system mid-level bureaucrats and high-level ones i've met them i've talked to them they
[16:48.280 --> 16:52.840]  revel in the power and they'll tell you the state is behind me you will be defeated you
[16:52.840 --> 16:59.560]  will be absorbed you know we are the board resistance is futile they are empty pathetic
[16:59.560 --> 17:05.320]  people who are gang members they're in a gang saying we didn't build it you know when i paint a
[17:05.320 --> 17:12.840]  painting i did build it when my wife and i got together and had children we did build it she
[17:12.840 --> 17:23.240]  built it in her womb when i set up in full wars 15 years ago i did build it i did build it i did
[17:23.240 --> 17:30.440]  put the initiative in i did communicate it was my drive my impetus reaching out with others that
[17:30.440 --> 17:35.160]  have like minds interfacing together that built what we've got here to resist the globalist
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.680]  and so the statement by the collectivists that have now gotten about half the population on the
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.960]  dole and dependent not to empower them but to enslave them they're now saying you didn't build
[17:45.960 --> 17:51.240]  that because they're getting their armies ready intellectually their bureaucrats their controllers
[17:51.240 --> 17:57.000]  to come out and take everything we've got in controlled class warfare to wipe out the ultra
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.920]  richest elite the middle class and new vorice we're now at the precipice
[18:03.240 --> 18:09.160]  now all of that said we come back we'll play the mitt romney clip and again i'm not defending
[18:09.160 --> 18:16.440]  mitt romney himself his voting record is clear he's a globalist but if they can attack mitt romney
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.160]  and say how dare him say 47 or dependent and they don't care what the government does they're
[18:21.160 --> 18:26.360]  going to support big government they're going to support obama that's truth and of course romney
[18:26.360 --> 18:33.400]  only says the truth with a group of upper middle class and rich donors and that scares the system
[18:33.400 --> 18:39.640]  and by the way romney's done the right thing he's owned it romney sticks by victims comment but calls
[18:39.640 --> 18:46.760]  them off the cuff this whole liberal system isn't liberal it's about disempowering you
[18:47.640 --> 18:53.160]  it's about scaring you about what's outside the matrix what's outside the dome city you don't want
[18:53.160 --> 19:00.600]  to go up there you want to stay down here it's about play does cave it's about keeping you
[19:00.600 --> 19:09.160]  on the reservation it's about controlling you and so now we must defend romney because this
[19:09.160 --> 19:18.520]  is a fight between forces of total collectivism and slavery and centralization and those of us
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.960]  that understand this long train of domestication that people like governor romney helped create
[19:23.960 --> 19:31.720]  it we know romney's a globalist but he's he's he's taking the place he's standing in the position
[19:33.560 --> 19:40.520]  of liberty and freedom so they can have controlled opposition but obama and romney
[19:40.520 --> 19:45.400]  are fighting over the levers of power right now so we have to come out and say no what mit romney
[19:45.400 --> 19:53.800]  said is correct what mit romney said is right regardless of who's behind mit romney we cannot
[19:53.800 --> 20:02.520]  allow them to demonize the entrepreneurs of this country digestive health is the key to

[24:10.280 --> 24:35.240]  the problem we have in this society is that people don't know the real definitions of things
[24:35.240 --> 24:42.040]  they think there's republican and democrat and the average republican is caught all corporations
[24:42.040 --> 24:48.360]  are good all mega banks are good walmart is good every big organization is as pure as a driven
[24:48.360 --> 24:53.320]  snow gmo is good for you no matter if it's five different species mixed together with a live
[24:53.320 --> 24:58.360]  pesticide that the plant grows that kills bugs that eat it but you're supposed to be okay eating it
[24:58.360 --> 25:05.640]  the main line republicans think everything non-government's good everything government's
[25:05.640 --> 25:12.040]  bad democrats think everything government is good and that collectivism and basically socialism is
[25:12.040 --> 25:16.920]  the way to go they tell you oh england is so great we're going to have health care like they have
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.880]  and you're like it's absolutely hellish do you know anything about it i mean i mean two year
[25:21.880 --> 25:27.880]  year and a half waiting lines for basic surgeries people dying in mass i mean i can show you see
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.600]  span their own parliament admitting it they're like no no you're a liar you're a right winger
[25:34.520 --> 25:41.080]  so overall the democrats on average are very naive childlike weirdos
[25:43.080 --> 25:50.040]  so i generally intellectually would find myself more of what they call right wing the problem is
[25:50.040 --> 25:57.160]  the right wing are a bunch of naive fools as well because they don't understand that the big six
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.960]  megabanks on record are the ones financing the nature conservancy and seara club to take over
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.360]  private property they're the ones financing the carbon taxes that wrote up the plan they're the
[26:06.360 --> 26:11.960]  ones that want a corporate hostile takeover and they're using government to do it
[26:14.120 --> 26:18.440]  they're using government force through the e you and the national security state in the united
[26:18.440 --> 26:24.520]  states in england to set up a planetary corporate government that openly says your family and your
[26:24.520 --> 26:36.520]  future is surf them if you're lucky so if people don't get smart and get wise to how the real world
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.800]  works we don't have a future ladies and gentlemen and it's so frustrating to now be at the point
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.720]  where these corporates who said over a hundred years ago in national banking association
[26:47.720 --> 26:52.360]  publications you name we've read them on air you know we've got to take over education we've
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.840]  got to dumb people down we've got to reduce the vocabulary americans are too smart they're too
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.720]  savvy they don't trust the system uh this is the robber barons over a hundred years ago
[27:02.440 --> 27:08.520]  saying we want to take over completely and they were being defeated at that time people were waking
[27:08.520 --> 27:16.520]  up to them and so they developed all the different programs you see today to domesticate you they take
[27:16.520 --> 27:22.440]  the middle class's money give it to the poor people domesticate them grow the number of poor
[27:22.440 --> 27:29.880]  people dumb them down and then use them to become the bureaucratic force to then take the rest of
[27:29.880 --> 27:35.640]  the wealth of what's left while the globalist exempt themselves from all the taxes and all the
[27:35.640 --> 27:44.120]  regulations they think the public is so stupid that they go on the news cnn abc you name it and
[27:44.120 --> 27:50.280]  say warren buffett doesn't pay many taxes hey his secretary pays a higher percentage which is all
[27:50.280 --> 27:56.920]  true because warren buffett helped write the laws in the 80s and 90s to do it bill clinton got rid
[27:56.920 --> 28:02.520]  of glass stegel to allow all this to take place and then bush continued it and then obama continued
[28:02.520 --> 28:10.760]  it this has all been charted out and and and you sit here and you talk to adults and they have no
[28:10.760 --> 28:17.880]  idea how the world really works it's so frightening i don't get some uppity feeling whenever i talk to
[28:17.880 --> 28:26.760]  executives and people and they're ignorant it scares me because if i if a little alex jones
[28:26.760 --> 28:32.680]  knows more than most people even people worth billions of dollars i've had a chance to me
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.040]  my god we're in trouble that's all i can tell you because the way the world works is right there
[28:38.040 --> 28:43.480]  ladies and gentlemen you got special interest running big government to domesticate society
[28:43.480 --> 28:49.080]  and shut down their competition period and if republicans don't get that through their brains
[28:49.080 --> 28:54.440]  there goes all the prosperity and there goes the freedom people ask who do i work for who am i with
[28:55.560 --> 29:01.240]  what do i stand for i i talked to so many bureaucrats so many spies so many agents
[29:01.240 --> 29:05.480]  so many corporate people and they say who do you really work for you couldn't have done this on
[29:05.480 --> 29:11.080]  your own where did you come from and i always tell them don't you understand there's some people in
[29:11.080 --> 29:16.120]  this world who don't have to go work through some system to become successful they become
[29:16.120 --> 29:21.320]  successful because they have ideas that are popular and ideas that make sense when i come back i'm
[29:21.320 --> 29:27.000]  going to get into mint romney and this so-called scandal and i'm not bragging about my shelf here
[29:28.200 --> 29:33.080]  when you're in a lie that's all you see when you've got your head in a bag all you see is the bag
[29:33.080 --> 29:38.520]  pull the bag off take the blinders off get out of the box come out of the cave come out of the

[33:37.960 --> 33:45.000]  who themselves uh capitalized jp morgan especially off of running the national food
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.840]  stamp program and who promote and and lobby in government for more dependency he told the truth
[33:52.840 --> 33:59.160]  privately you know i i wish mit romney would say stuff like this publicly that you got 47
[33:59.160 --> 34:04.520]  percent of people dependent on the government and they've shipped our jobs to china they put
[34:04.520 --> 34:09.640]  regulations on us to shut things down to make it harder and there are a lot of people with
[34:09.640 --> 34:15.320]  disabilities and problems and multi-generational welfare where i understand you're dependent
[34:15.320 --> 34:21.080]  now i'm not even saying you're a bad person but the truth is you've been made to be domesticated
[34:21.800 --> 34:26.600]  just like a domesticated you know dog if you throw it out with coyotes they're going to kill it needed
[34:26.600 --> 34:32.040]  it and
[34:35.080 --> 34:42.680]  now we are here to the point as a society where it's bad to say hey we don't want everybody
[34:42.680 --> 34:48.520]  dependent and that's a dangerous thing when upwards of 50 become dependent they will vote
[34:48.520 --> 34:55.160]  in a democracy to take everything the other people have that's why uh benjamin franklin said
[34:55.160 --> 35:00.520]  that democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner a republic is completely
[35:00.520 --> 35:06.600]  different you have absolute right to life liberty pursuit of happiness to your family to your private
[35:06.600 --> 35:15.640]  property to your body and just because somebody else if 51 vote to make you go work sundays in
[35:15.640 --> 35:22.680]  work brigades digging ditches you know you're serving mint julips to the elite uh at their
[35:22.680 --> 35:32.280]  plantation you don't have to do that if 51 votes that uh you've got to join their religion whether
[35:32.280 --> 35:42.600]  it be catholicism you know mainline Protestantism Jewish religion islam animism whatever the case is
[35:42.600 --> 35:49.160]  or or atheism 51 say we're an atheist country now we're going to put you in prison the other 49
[35:49.160 --> 35:55.800]  percent if you don't serve us in a republic you have a bill of rights a constitution that are the
[35:55.800 --> 36:03.640]  rules of the road that you cannot violate now they're saying hey you didn't build that you didn't
[36:03.640 --> 36:20.680]  build that business you didn't set that up and so it's such a fundamental attack on society at every
[36:20.680 --> 36:25.960]  level to now they've got everybody on the defensive if you want to have your own business or keep any
[36:25.960 --> 36:33.320]  of your money and we will go the way of France where they've got over 85 taxes on the population
[36:33.320 --> 36:39.400]  totally controlled a giant government bureaucrats everywhere looking at every fast year life but the
[36:39.400 --> 36:45.400]  ultra rich are basically exempt from all their own laws just like general electric and google pay
[36:45.400 --> 36:53.800]  zero most years some years two three four percent taxes while general electric lobbies for higher
[36:53.800 --> 36:59.000]  income taxes through the federal reserve on the general public because they get the money in corporate
[36:59.000 --> 37:05.000]  welfare and government jobs the government shuts down the other coal plants that g e doesn't own
[37:05.960 --> 37:10.440]  and the list goes on and on so that's where we stand i know the general audience out there
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.920]  understands this but we have to get this information out to everybody
[37:18.040 --> 37:19.240]  now continuing here
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.280]  Romney sticks by victims comments but calls them off the cuff meant Romney is sticking by his
[37:26.280 --> 37:31.000]  comments captured in the video at a fundraiser earlier this year in which he told donors that
[37:31.000 --> 37:38.120]  president Obama and his supporters are reliant on government don't pay taxes and believe they
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.760]  are victims yeah what government workers i've seen numbers are two to one going to vote for Obama
[37:44.040 --> 37:50.840]  the welfare class it's over 90 percent going to vote for Obama and it's basically game over at
[37:50.840 --> 37:55.400]  that point you see that's why they want the 30 million illegal aliens legalized and while Obama
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.840]  has just legalized most of them by fiat no law he just did it was because the illegals get here
[38:01.720 --> 38:05.960]  and they go and work but they also get fake identities that the IRS provides them that's on
[38:05.960 --> 38:12.120]  record and then go get three four five six seven eight nine ten in some cases per home hundreds
[38:12.120 --> 38:16.760]  of identities and hundreds of checks that's why illegal aliens are driving around in the brand
[38:16.760 --> 38:24.120]  new trucks living in five six seven eight ten bedroom houses totally rich you know from from
[38:24.120 --> 38:30.280]  poor people standards because they say what they say my name's whatever you want it to be cop go
[38:30.280 --> 38:36.600]  ahead and arrest me the judge will let me out for 10 bucks that's on record police are told don't
[38:36.600 --> 38:42.680]  arrest illegals if they arrest illegals in phoenix the feds come and start an investigation
[38:44.520 --> 38:46.600]  that's happened there in the county maricopa county
[38:48.440 --> 38:52.920]  again it's not that we couldn't have immigrants here but the immigrants that came to this country
[38:52.920 --> 38:59.640]  and made it what it is busted their butts whether they were immigrants from china who've been coming
[38:59.640 --> 39:05.400]  here for 200 years never heard about them whether they were from germany or italy or ireland or
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.680]  england or romania or there were african immigrants that didn't just come here as slaves
[39:10.680 --> 39:13.880]  and believe me the immigrants that were slaves that were brought here they certainly worked hard
[39:13.880 --> 39:23.160]  that's what built this country not 100 plus million people on out and out welfare and food
[39:23.160 --> 39:28.520]  stamps you count welfare and food stamps it's over 100 million you count everybody who is dependent
[39:28.520 --> 39:34.520]  on government one way or another it's over 200 million basically that's why it's game over you
[39:34.520 --> 39:40.360]  got 150 plus million who who are who are who are dependent one way or the other but over 200 million
[39:40.360 --> 39:48.440]  that are somewhat dependent romney's right 47 plus are totally 100 dependent
[39:50.920 --> 39:56.600]  you can look at the numbers different ways but some numbers are over 50 but over 200 million over
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.880]  two-thirds are somewhat dependent but right at half are totally dependent
[40:05.480 --> 40:10.120]  and it's come out with the irs whistleblowers it's all come out that right here in austin they issue
[40:10.120 --> 40:16.200]  millions of fake tax ID numbers that the banks just accept if you're an illegal alien
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.280]  it's totally discriminatory you walk in bank of america wells fargo anywhere you're an illegal

[40:34.600 --> 40:40.520]  even uh business accounts that don't charge you because the money's crud the banks have got all
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.640]  of our money they want unlimited they just use money as a way to manipulate society they have
[40:45.640 --> 40:53.080]  unlimited and they have pretty much gotten their major beachhead end of dumbing the population down
[40:53.080 --> 41:00.280]  and getting 47 on the dole and you've got even mainline republicans coming out against romney
[41:00.280 --> 41:04.840]  because now it's time with him playing the part i'm not saying even consciously for him to be the

[42:45.160 --> 42:48.440]  that that's you know young people have an instinct for and he's been hunting before
[42:48.440 --> 42:52.680]  we're going out to our old east texas ranch we've had since 1830
[42:55.320 --> 43:01.000]  and uh i i just know no matter how deep in the woods i get when i come out there's going to be
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.400]  game wardens and it doesn't matter how many times they come harass us how many times i've talked to

[43:21.320 --> 43:27.320]  and it's just not a free country it's not a free country it's a joke okay and i love this country
[43:27.320 --> 43:30.920]  we're not going to get it back unless we admit we become an authoritarian joke
[43:30.920 --> 43:34.520]  as you hear max keiser yesterday and it's true we showed the news articles here on air
[43:36.120 --> 43:41.800]  corrections corporations of america and others there's three big companies a few dozen smaller ones
[43:41.800 --> 43:48.920]  are lobbying state legislatures to throw nonviolent offenders away but release violent offenders
[43:50.280 --> 43:55.400]  they're building new prisons everywhere they've got a guarantee to keep them at 90 percent occupancy
[43:56.760 --> 44:02.600]  and they've got factories built on to them repairing electronics doing customer service
[44:02.600 --> 44:06.520]  it's not just furniture and wisest plates and it's what's shutting all the towns down around
[44:06.520 --> 44:12.360]  them you think walmart shuts your businesses down what about a prison remember tulia texas i
[44:12.360 --> 44:17.320]  interviewed the award-winning journalist uh from texas monthly uh who broke it all down
[44:19.320 --> 44:22.840]  he went and infiltrated it you know talked all people involved and it came out that
[44:22.840 --> 44:28.040]  they built a prison in west texas and they just rounded up all the poor people planted drugs on
[44:28.040 --> 44:33.960]  them because the local town fathers actually had the contract for the prison and the hotel
[44:33.960 --> 44:39.320]  for visitors to the prison so they just started they just started arresting all the poor people
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.080]  in the town and putting hundreds of them in there tulia texas you can look it up and then even
[44:43.080 --> 44:47.960]  pulling over families that drove through the town and throwing drugs in their car to put them in
[44:47.960 --> 44:53.560]  jail i mean that's all this is is the government or a bunch of spiders that run out and grab us and
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.920]  drag us off in the dark and i for want them done with it and we've got a bunch of dependents not
[44:58.920 --> 45:05.240]  no scum that serve these foreign banks at every level from the welfare to the corporate welfare
[45:05.240 --> 45:11.000]  to the defense contractors to the police to the bureaucrats to all of you who see us as the enemy
[45:13.640 --> 45:23.320]  and i'm just so tired of it i'm just so tired of being around it i'm so tired of seeing it
[45:23.320 --> 45:28.760]  i'm so tired of stupid people i'm so tired of dumb down people i'm so tired of no bodies
[45:28.760 --> 45:34.200]  in their bureaucrat outfits with their with their clipboards or their uniforms that that want you
[45:34.200 --> 45:39.720]  to know they got power they want you to know your trash that want you to know you're their food
[45:41.400 --> 45:44.280]  and i'm not your chew toy i'm not your food
[45:47.720 --> 45:52.120]  i believe in 1776 i know what our forebears went through and you can tell you something
[45:52.120 --> 45:54.920]  we're going through something a lot worse right now and it's going to get a lot worse
[45:54.920 --> 45:58.280]  and i want to tell all the bureaucrats to serve at something your masters are going to implode
[45:58.280 --> 46:01.960]  everything they're going to take your pension funds your good times are going to end but you
[46:01.960 --> 46:05.800]  won't care because all you care about your petty power i understand that and your masters know
[46:05.800 --> 46:09.880]  that too because your cowards you're going to go along with everything that happens in this country
[46:10.440 --> 46:16.040]  the reeducation camps everything you're going to love it because you are scum of the earth
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.440]  now i know there are a lot of good people that work for the system and the bureaucracy and the
[46:24.440 --> 46:29.720]  corporate system and all the rest of it but i'm talking to those out there that enjoy it and are
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.360]  proud of it it's one thing if you work in the system and you know it's broke and you know it's
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.840]  dangerous and you know it's bad but if you think it's all cute and funny and you're dumb down to
[46:38.840 --> 46:44.680]  the point or we're hired as a bureaucrat because you got a 85 IQ and you just enjoy having power
[46:44.680 --> 46:51.720]  over people listen moron this isn't what america or freedom was built on let's go to the romney clip
[46:51.720 --> 46:57.880]  here's romney mother jones jimmy carter's grandson reportedly filmed this and got it out
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.360]  going in to pay the thousands of dollars to be in the mitt romney meeting to say what those business
[47:04.360 --> 47:11.000]  owners those car dealership and restaurant owners and local bank chairman and and and and
[47:11.000 --> 47:18.120]  authors and inventors that that's who goes engineers that's who goes and pays 5 10 15
[47:18.120 --> 47:21.800]  20 thousand dollars to sit there at different meetings with mint romney and then when mint
[47:21.800 --> 47:26.920]  romney gets in there and they say no filming it's so they can close the door at the fancy hotel
[47:26.920 --> 47:32.440]  and mint romney can say i know you're concerned about the fact that you understand that when 50
[47:32.440 --> 47:36.600]  plus percent of people are on the dole they're going to take over society and and you're going
[47:36.600 --> 47:42.440]  to be robbed and and don't worry i want to represent you well even if he wanted to represent you
[47:42.440 --> 47:49.000]  he's not going to be allowed to represent you because the mega banks he works for want to get
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.880]  rid of you and middle class you better get that you're not going to save america and prosperity
[47:55.880 --> 48:01.320]  and freedom and and what we've built that's made all these lazy people be able to sit there on
[48:01.320 --> 48:07.480]  their hind ends all day we're not going to be able to continue any of this if you don't get
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.760]  religion and by get religion if you don't figure out just how much trouble we're in but the fact
[48:12.760 --> 48:18.360]  that the media is trying to go after mint romney for saying 47 percent are dependent so they're
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.400]  going to vote for the for the dependency party that's saying it's wrong to tell the truth here's
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.600]  the clip there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president all right there are
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.800]  47 percent who are with him who are dependent on government who believe that they're victims who
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.960]  believe the government has a responsibility to care for them who believe that they're entitled
[48:38.680 --> 48:44.120]  to health care to food to housing to you name it but that's it's an entitlement and government should
[48:44.120 --> 48:49.480]  hear it and they will vote for this president no matter what and i mean the president starts off
[48:49.480 --> 48:56.440]  with 48 49 40 30 he starts off with a huge number of these are people who pay no income tax 47 percent
[48:56.440 --> 49:02.040]  of americans pay no income tax so our message of low taxes doesn't connect and you'll be out there
[49:02.040 --> 49:07.480]  talking about tax cuts for the rich i mean that's what they celebrate every four years and and so my
[49:07.480 --> 49:13.160]  job is not to worry about those people everything they said they should take person responsibility
[49:13.160 --> 49:17.240]  and care for their lives what i have to do is convince the fives and 10 percent in the center
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.640]  that are independent that are thoughtful to look at voting one way or the other dependent on
[49:23.640 --> 49:31.240]  in some cases emotion whether they like the guy or not and uh mother jones first put that video
[49:31.240 --> 49:38.840]  out and they're very very proud of themselves now again when you're looking at what mitt romney said
[49:38.840 --> 49:46.280]  it's not entirely true people that either don't make enough to pay income tax they're you're still
[49:46.280 --> 49:51.880]  paying 10 percent or so for fica you're never going to get that social security and the other
[49:51.880 --> 49:57.480]  little fees and things your employer is having to match that so that's money you would have gotten
[49:57.480 --> 50:03.080]  so so whatever your employer is paying you you're actually paid a higher rate it's just
[50:03.080 --> 50:09.720]  extra money goes to the government also the income taxes on business state income taxes
[50:09.720 --> 50:14.680]  all the rest of it that gets passed on on the cost of products so all of you out there that think
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.680]  oh you're getting a free ride you're not really getting a free ride and by the way once they have
[50:20.680 --> 50:27.800]  you vote liberty and freedom out of the country once they get enough people domesticated they always
[50:27.800 --> 50:35.640]  implode things after let the giant horde basically be involved in the takeover of society and then
[50:35.640 --> 50:41.880]  you all get shut down and put in work camps so you know the welfare state is going to be coming
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.480]  to an end very very soon uh because the bankers are just in the process of destroying this country
[50:47.480 --> 50:53.560]  then they'll just move on that's what the globalists do because it's about power it's about domination
[50:53.560 --> 50:58.440]  it's about control give you some geopolitical news and economic news on the other side stay with us

[54:37.000 --> 54:44.120]  they've done it in europe eastern europe and what is latin america today they've done it everywhere
[54:45.480 --> 54:52.200]  they come and they loan fiat money paper money to countries they pay off the dictator or the
[54:52.200 --> 54:58.440]  oligarchs or oligarchy to not pay the money back and the contract is signed to hand over the natural
[54:58.440 --> 55:03.400]  resources and then when they don't pay it back they don't care they're getting real resources
[55:03.400 --> 55:08.440]  it's all fiat money to begin with that's written off but that's not good enough you go back to
[55:08.440 --> 55:16.120]  the home country england or the us the empire germany dutch spanish portuguese the different
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.960]  empires french and you say oh it's really more than 150 but this is really intensified the last
[55:21.960 --> 55:29.000]  150 200 oh this is all mainline history we just read it it's all out there oh um we um
[55:30.760 --> 55:35.400]  we loaned to help get our colony going uh you know in paraguay or wherever it is
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.760]  we load you know we loaned them a million of this or that or in today's numbers you know a
[55:40.760 --> 55:45.960]  billion of this or that and they didn't pay it back our system is going to go bankrupt and these
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.840]  banks that signed on to underwrite it are if you don't bail us out these bailouts have been going
[55:50.840 --> 55:57.000]  on for hundreds of years they're not even bailouts how many times is our government bailed out mexico
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.280]  after they hyperinflate their currency and all it is is another wealth transfer i mean
[56:03.000 --> 56:08.680]  they they play on the ignorance they play on it there's more than one way to rob a bank
[56:09.560 --> 56:14.680]  idiots go rob banks smart people go to harvard they get degrees they go work for big hedge funds and
[56:14.680 --> 56:21.160]  big banks and they sell fraudulent derivatives or they pay off the government to shut down
[56:21.880 --> 56:27.240]  factories that they don't own or coal plants they don't own that's that's hundreds of billions
[56:27.240 --> 56:31.080]  a year they're already making just the last three years hundreds of billions look it up
[56:31.960 --> 56:37.480]  hundreds it's over 200 billion last time i checked that that that the the select coal companies
[56:37.480 --> 56:42.840]  that are insiders have made since hundreds of plants have been shut down that weren't owned by them
[56:42.840 --> 56:49.880]  i mean the power prices everywhere are going off the chart they're literally a foreign army
[56:49.880 --> 56:56.920]  bombing us couldn't cut off our power like this we're being destroyed by design and that's not
[56:56.920 --> 57:03.160]  just rhetoric it's happening we're going into a tyranny everybody should be upset about this what
[57:03.160 --> 57:10.440]  about our children what about being under strong men what about being under thugs what about living
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.880]  in something like that you should all be very upset not scared you should be scared that they're
[57:15.880 --> 57:22.760]  going to take over and win not scared so you shut up and let them win look at these economic

[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:09.240]  tens of trillions in about a year as you can see there on the chart so the dollar was going down
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:14.440]  over the last couple years now they're starting it again it's going back down it's seesawing
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.600]  but if you look at a tenure graph whether it goes up or down overall it's going down same
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.640]  thing with every other major currency this is all part of this insider run market
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:32.280]  and just amazing headline also from cnbc feds qe infinity will push gold up to two thousand four

[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.080]  him on about a big article in fact it may have already gone up i think it was supposed to go up
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:25.000]  by the time he was uh on with us at info wars dot com uh dealing with bullets
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:34.360]  and the fact that the uh government has is purchased even more bullets on top of the 1.4
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:41.000]  billion and how that ties into all the other preparations for collapse see they're always
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.920]  talking about attacking iran and they've been attacking iran through proxy grips and terrorist
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:53.000]  grips and destabilization grips and uh stocks net worms and you know cyber type attacks but now
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.240]  it's all the domestic preparations it's the economic meltdown uh accelerating that's what adds in
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:09.640]  to this larger constellation of information and that's that's why i feel a disturbance in the force
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:17.560]  or the spidey sense to use popular culture no nomenclature watcher six big daddy uh is what i'm
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:25.560]  saying to everybody out here because uh we're we're getting a lot of flak um those of us that
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.600]  promote liberty and freedom we're seeing big pushes for cyber security that even cbs news
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.240]  cnet reports will curtail freedom and tax the internet i mean it's just authoritarianism in
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:43.960]  general is rolling forward real fast and it's not going to be good for anybody including the elite
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.440]  long term but they're they're so competitive they're so paranoid they're so dominant that they
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.360]  they you know they want it all because they don't really have a total world government yet they're
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.480]  kind of jockeying for it and as the world government gets built there's different factions that never
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:02.280]  tear down the world government because they all see themselves at the top of the pyramid as the
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.320]  pyramid has the pyramids being built by us the slaves as we're building our own prison the controllers
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:14.120]  the engineers the architects who are building different parts of it and it's not perfectly
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.840]  built either it's been built over time by corruption and greed and deception and think tanks and the
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:24.040]  science of control as they prepare to complete it they're now fighting more than ever over who's
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:30.360]  going to get to be at the top the top the top perch like a bunch of cockatoos and a tree quacking
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:41.800]  squeaking and squawking and crowing and yelling you watch all those republicans in that mother

[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:22.200]  so
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.040]  ladies and gentlemen coming up in about 40 minutes i'm going to break down cmbc
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:37.880]  feds qe infinity that's a term i coined will push gold up to two thousand four hundred dollars an
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:45.640]  ounce says top pro an investment strategist at bank of america merrill lynch and of course
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.400]  you saw months ago george soros and a lot of the other top guys doubling their gold in a single day
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:58.200]  and soros's case we're going to be looking at all of that coming up also fedex is reporting
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.240]  that they're seeing the economy really full their businesses imploding again this has been engineered
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:10.040]  but they want to continue to basically con everybody so that they feel like and think
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:16.760]  that all things will get better no it's designed to consolidate dollar index headed for rapid collapse
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:22.920]  the chart cnbc poll are americans too dependent on government we're going to be going over some
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:29.160]  of that again fedex says economy is worsening cuts outlook that is just some of what we're
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:36.120]  going to be going over here is the poll out of gallup that actually proves what mit romney
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:43.000]  is being attacked for saying and again folks know that i'm not some big fan of mit romney
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:51.080]  but when he stands up for basic issues of truth we have to defend it because if we just let his
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:57.560]  personality that's unpopular with some you know be tied to free market liberty private property
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.840]  the american system that it's game over but here's the gallup poll majority in us still
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:12.920]  say government doing too much okay so people agree with that but we have 60 plus percent
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:18.600]  of democrats saying they want it to do more we'll be going over some of those numbers again
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:26.920]  in the second or third third of this second hour here today we're going to be breaking
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.880]  all of that down i mean all mit romney said we played the clip last hour this is the big news
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.880]  today not that obama and his controllers put al qaeda in control of libya and syria and turned
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:46.040]  it over control of egypt to al qaeda light and then now want us to give our rights up on our
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:52.840]  guns up because the al qaeda threat that they have basically put in charge no no no no the big issue
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:11:00.520]  is mit romney mit romney said hey they're trying to get the public dependent so that they'll vote
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.080]  for big government oh really that's what a democratic strategist have said for 80 years
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.960]  i mean that's not debatable they want us dependent and so do the republicans they go along with all
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:18.520]  this look at bush and his no child you know left behind federalization of education his prescription
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.400]  drug program a giveaway to the big insurance companies a big pharma look at romney writing
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.000]  the health care plan that obama adopted because the insurance companies told him what to put together
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.880]  which forces us to buy their products so he wants to get elected claiming he's going to battle this
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:41.800]  collectivist takeover my point is is that it shows how far we've gone that he's being attacked for
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:47.720]  pointing out what's true but notice that romney said this in private to big donors he didn't say
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.400]  on that on the campaign trail he would win hands down if he went out and talked like that right now
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.320]  he would win hands down and if he would go out and publicly speak and pledge to do that
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.960]  well then maybe we'd have a snowball's chance at hell but
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.960]  i'm being sarcastic ladies and gentlemen it's a snowball's chance in hell that he would ever
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.680]  actually even do any of this the point is though that you're then forced to defending because
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:21.720]  now it's un-american to not want half the public dependent on government and again once they pass
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:28.200]  that magic number of over 50 percent and they tell us we're a democracy 51 percent can take
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.000]  everything the rest of us have that's why in a republic you can't do that if the town votes 51
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.440]  percent to take your farm with no compensation they can't do it because that's robbery because
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.720]  you have private property rights but we don't anymore under this global system and it isn't a
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:50.200]  bunch of welfare moms organizing this takeover it's mega banks who are exempt from the collectivism
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:56.760]  they push on us it's a corporate takeover we're facing against all the good corporations
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.680]  and private businesses and families and companies and institutions that want a level playing field
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.880]  and really want to compete and kick butt ladies and gentlemen all over the country
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:16.200]  we are put on am and fm stations and end up defeating whoever we're up against it's happened in
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:23.560]  just the last year five cities with acu instant ratings the people meters
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:31.640]  the computers instead of it being an arbitron which is owned by the dutch same group that controls
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.000]  nielson has been proven to be a fraud well now they have these acu meters that have been really
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.240]  proving more accurate they've got different companies doing it but the point is you know we
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:49.000]  will destroy rush limbaugh they'll they'll put us on a station say orlando 810 there
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.440]  and they put us on the weekend got really popular so they put us on at night it's really popular
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:04.520]  they put us on for one year a little over a year in the day 12 noon to 3 p.m. eastern rush limbaugh
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.000]  slot i never got that slot to go up against fresh limbaugh that's where jenesis put me
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.680]  i thought nine to midnight was the better slot but they said this is the slot we want you in
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.280]  then later they wanted me to the nighttime slot to i did that for a while and i've been offered
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.600]  all sorts of syndication things if i would do the nighttime nine to midnight i just can't do two
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:27.640]  shows a day but the point is maybe i should i'm gonna go to paul watson the point is that
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:35.800]  we beat him i mean i'm talking about in just six months they went from number six or number seven
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:42.680]  depending on the demographic to number one but it didn't matter because the local the
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.400]  the biggest establishment sponsors didn't come through and so they went back to a music format
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.560]  because that's what the elderly wanted in the area
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:59.560]  number one in orlando and it just switched formats went there spoke to 1200 people they
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:05.560]  turned away probably 500 i'd go anywhere and speak to thousands much bigger than glenn back when it
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.160]  comes to actual crowds of people right now i can do that but see we're real in this world it isn't
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.520]  just about getting the top ratings it isn't about winning the race it's it's rigged to a great extent
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.640]  but the internet has begun to change all of that and create more of a level playing field
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:26.840]  and so the establishment is coming in trying to censor and control the web now because the system
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:33.400]  can't stand the fact that real intellect and real understanding can trump all of their big money and
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:41.160]  propaganda just an example the show's exploding we're getting new affiliates every week it's just
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.320]  that you still always lose some by attrition as they sell or change formats we're going to cover
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:52.120]  that more at the end of the hour let's go right now to paul joseph watson joining us you can watch

[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:25.960]  realm what you've been researching your take on the buildup for war al qaeda attacking embassies
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:32.200]  that our own government put in what you think the grand strategy means from your research but first
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.400]  after you're on today the article will come out dealing with more bullet purchases and the whole
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.760]  domestic buildup see it's the police state buildup coupled with everything else that tells us we're
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:48.200]  in a very dangerous time give us your take on that paul joseph watson hi i think it's good to be back
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.360]  yeah basically as many of the listeners will know over the past six months mainly the department of
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:01.880]  homeland security but also other federal agencies have basically purchased bullets rounds of ammunition
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:09.720]  in huge numbers before this recent purchase which i'll talk about they were up to 1.2 billion rounds
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.840]  of ammo purchased just in the last six months alone and that's only the department of homeland
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:23.000]  security so now we've got a new story coming out shortly where the dhs has purchased a further 200
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.960]  million rounds of ammunition and an interesting detail of this story is the fact that a portion of
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:36.040]  it is blank ammunition and in it they state that it's going to be used to train new snipers that's
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.280]  why they're using blank ammunition because they want to train them up for target practice so
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.480]  whoa whoa whoa they've been blacking out a lot of these documents this is on the federal purchase
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:51.560]  sites your well the headline should be homeland security training army of snipers the fact that
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.720]  they're getting counting last year that's over 1.6 billion now that they're purchasing an additional
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:04.520]  200 mil this year alone in eight months or nine months you're talking this is a staggering 1.2
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:12.200]  bill and you're saying they're purchasing ammo for snipers now my god Watson well yeah it's blank
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.320]  ammunition for sniper training so that's that's what they say it's for but yeah as you said they
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:23.160]  start to black out some of the numbers in some of the ammunition purchases on the fed bizops
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.440]  website which anyone can go on and see what the federal government's buying um and then of course
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:35.480]  we had well that people ask the dhs why you're buying all these bullets they refuse to answer why
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:41.960]  so then the social security administration purchased i believe it was 174 000 rounds of ammunition
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.040]  and then the associated press the numerous other establishment media outlets came out
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.960]  and basically did a whitewash and said this is you know the social security administration has
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.920]  armed officers that go out and perform these duties it's a relatively small amount of bullets for the
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:02.360]  whole country why is everybody getting in such a froth about it there go the paranoid conspiracy
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.200]  theories again but in that article in that associated press article they failed completely
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:15.240]  to mention that simultaneously the dhs was purchasing as he said now it's a 1.4 billion
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.920]  rounds of ammo so they completely ignored that in order to pass it off as a wild paranoid conspiracy
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:26.440]  theory well that's going to be coming up what uh by the middle of the next hour yeah i'll be getting
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:30.120]  that article up on info wars dot com all right well this is huge news we're going to go to break
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:35.320]  and come back into the geopolitical but i'm begging our listeners and our media friends out there
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.640]  in talk radio you name it to get this article paul's putting out and get it out because the
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:47.560]  media responded with thousands of articles the last month saying we basically made all this up
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:54.280]  we have all the proof and straw manning it down to 174 000 rounds we need to force this story back
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:02.440]  out and say no now it's sniper rounds this is incredible Aaron full in here as the food police
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.880]  shut down food co-ops the amish and small farmers americans are losing access not just a raw milk and

[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.160]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.160]  but frankly i'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been

[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.320]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant americans can now discover the secrets to making

[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:34.440]  as a pretext to bring in order and let me tell you it's creepy to have 500 news articles in one day
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.760]  over that really you can go to google and see when it happened i mean for weeks on it has been
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:46.440]  going on for almost a month saying that the you know there's no bullets or it's only 174
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:52.280]  thousand always focusing in on that and saying we're making a big deal out of 174 thousand we're
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:58.680]  making a big deal out of 1.4 billion since last november till now that's 10 11 months and now
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:05.320]  watson's done them the the math just this year with an additional 200 million a bunch of them for
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:14.840]  snipers just the magnitude of that 1.6 billion bub bub bub bub billion they are digging in like
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:20.280]  it's the end of the world now i'm not saying it's the end of the world but something's going on
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.040]  watson i'm going to shut up because we only got you to 45 after that i got to go to the financial
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:29.400]  news but continuing with all the stuff going on in the world i wanted to get you on a few days
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.200]  ago but you were busy so now you're here with us about all these articles about al-qaeda and the
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:40.040]  jihadis and burning down american flags go over the news but give me your gut because i've learned
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.600]  over the years knowing you 11 years you've worked with this you're a smart cookie one of the smartest
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.120]  people i know especially for your age what are you not even 30 yet watson what do you make of
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:56.200]  all this i mean what do you think's getting ready to happen well i think it's abundantly clear if
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:01.400]  we want to take it from what happened last week that the attack on the consulate in bangas in the
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:09.080]  killing of the ambassador had nothing whatsoever to do with this idiotic 13 minute youtube video
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:15.800]  released by a convicted felon who was a former informant for the federal government and it's
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.800]  not even a film nobody's actually seen the full film it's a stupid 13 minute youtube video and i
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:28.760]  mean it's it's so bad you'd think it was supposed to be a comedy i compared it to a situation where
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.080]  you know if the muslims are rioting over this then christians should riot over
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:40.600]  montipython's the life of brian i mean that's how pathetic and ridiculous this video is and actually
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:47.080]  it's funny that you can get away with portraying jesus as you know a pedophile a rapist whatever
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.080]  you like in the west people have made entire stage shows in london about it um and nobody
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:59.000]  bat as an eyelid but a badly made 13 minute youtube clip supposedly insulting towards the
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.760]  prophet mohammed when in fact all the insults were dubbed in afterwards you can clearly see that
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:10.600]  and the whole middle east is in uproar but the embassy the embassy attack we know was planned
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.640]  way in advance u.s had prior knowledge of course because they armed and funded the very same people
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:22.280]  in libya who carried it out and it's the same people who flew al-qaeda flags over courthouses in
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:28.520]  banghazi the same people who are flying those same flags now even as cnn says it's not the al-qaeda
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:34.360]  flag they actually put out a report claiming that the black flag with white lettering isn't the al-qaeda
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.240]  flag when everybody recognizes that that it is so they're trying to show well known in the middle
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:44.920]  east it's like saying the texas flag is the texas flag and of course don't forget your other report
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.040]  where the new york times and and cnn were saying that they were parading the ambassadors of the
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:55.880]  streets trying to rescue him and i heard that again on tv last night they're they're still pushing it
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:02.440]  now that you've got a bunch of guys sticking a camera in his face shouting alu akbar giving
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.240]  each of the high fives fist pumping and the new york times came out and said look they were trying
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:11.640]  to rescue him so they're trying to cover up the fact that these terrorists that the obama
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:17.480]  administration put into power in libya are now attacking our well your embassies united states
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:23.640]  embassies but that's not to say on the flip side that a huge number of these protests we now see
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:30.200]  around the muslim world are not being driven by this stupid mohammed film because it's taken on a
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:36.440]  legend of its own the media exactly by the media saying it was the cause it's like a green light
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:42.440]  to go crazy yeah because a lot of these muslim clerics are telling everyone to riot over it
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.560]  you had the hezbollah leader just yesterday saying everybody should go out and riot now they're
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:53.000]  talking about uh destroying classified documents that the u.s. embassy in beirut they're expecting
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.320]  that to be stormed in the coming couple of days um so it's it's partly contrived but it's partly
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:05.080]  the fact that these muslim leaders are telling their followers to riot because and that's stupid
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.360]  because if they see how ridiculous and stupid this video is you know they wouldn't be fussed about it
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:16.120]  at all so and you know it's been released by a federal informant a convicted criminal that's
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:21.080]  worked with the u.s. government in the past so i just find it interesting that these muslims will
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:27.080]  attack embassies and riot over some soft morrick youtube video but largely space island you know
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:32.680]  when a million plus irakis get killed or when you know the united states is helping to execute
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:38.600]  heads of states in places like libya well it's it's like americans get upset about football games
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.880]  i mean we've been trained to only get upset when the mainstream media tells us to we'll be back
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.320]  to break more of this down with paul watson and get into the iran situation is world war three looming

[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:32.920]  a week and that's not even counting a bunch of other in fact i'm being conservative it's way
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.200]  more than 10 million uh it is a great honor it is a great responsibility we certainly don't have all
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:44.120]  the answers and i'm not perfect but i'm trying the best i can i got a pure heart i love god i love

[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:15.080]  and when people lose track of that in a civilization or when people just say oh that's
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.400]  the way it's always been just let things be corrupt when you give into corruption it's over
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.920]  that said we are so busy knocking it out of the park every day
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:31.240]  day with just incredible interviews and reports and information and analysis that we don't tend
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:40.120]  to hype the real magnitude of what we're about to present in the last two weeks we've been doing
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:46.440]  a big agenda 21 investigation that's involved three of my reporters and myself actually four
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:52.600]  of my reporters and myself and tomorrow night on the nightly news we're going to air the findings
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:35:01.000]  of that that includes the police being called on us you name it it's pretty wild um and the police
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.880]  showing up but but that's a side issue compared to the university of texas interview that we were
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.720]  going to get last friday with a professor but we couldn't get it because the the campus was evacuated
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:24.120]  with the bomb threat they got the interview yesterday and it is sensational we got it with
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.280]  the professor that teaches sustainable development is in a 21 at ut the professor and i mean the
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:38.680]  nuclear family is bad well it's in his words and i'm trying to figure out with erin who went to all
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:44.360]  these local towns to show them taking over it's takeover i'm trying to figure out how to combine
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:50.520]  melissa melton's piece with this it'll be on the nightly news tomorrow and then it'll be on the radio
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:57.800]  thursday thursday is going to be an original show but it's going to be compilations of these new
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.440]  reports because i've got so many reports i can't even put them all in the nightly news and then
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:08.600]  the nightly news reaches millions every week but each report maybe only 200 300 000 people total
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.200]  so more and more you're going to hear some of these reports here on the radio
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:20.680]  but i mean i got a laundry list of new reports that we're going to be airing thursday here
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.280]  tomorrow night i'm going to record the intros to all these so it'll be a special report thursday
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:31.400]  all right let me go to paul watson back to paul watson paul you know we saw churches blown up and
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:40.440]  burned synagogues blown up and burned by al-qaeda put in via nato out of turkey and uh jordan
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:47.320]  and then the media has it in the news but it's in the back of the paper and then we're unpatriotic
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:53.080]  if we don't support al-qaeda blowing up churches desecrating crosses dressing up in orthodox
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:37:00.360]  priest outfits you know what free reign has been given to attack christians and and here's the deal
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.560]  i don't sit there and attack muslims in general this clash of civilizations is being orchestrated
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.560]  but the muslims do take some of the blame and need to understand that running off wildly
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:20.120]  to decry christians all day and and desecrate crosses and all this is offensive and uh i think
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:25.640]  that's where you were starting to go where is the media when you did the reports showing al-qaeda's
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.800]  own videos blowing up churches and desecrating crosses again it's not just the radical muslims
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:37.000]  it's the scum that runs our country they're anti christian and they're giving the muslim extremists
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.560]  free reign to walk all over us paul well i mean that's the point these extremists are a very tiny
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.480]  minority of muslims most muslims actually like christianity they want to get along with people
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.280]  i mean the popes visit in the middle east this week and there's pictures everywhere of muslims
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.080]  posing with the pope posing with photographs of the pope but you don't see that in in the
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.040]  media it's not it's not up there because they're pushing this clash of civilizations but as you
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.840]  said a lot of the muslims actually have to harbor some of the blame because they're going out and
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:13.720]  doing this rioting they're being told to do it by their leaders and most of them haven't even seen
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.920]  a stupid video that's causing it all but how it ties into iran which is what you're getting into
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:25.880]  before the break um you remember i think it was last year we had the story where basically the
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:32.840]  neocons came out through a number of different publications and offered obama a deal they basically
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:38.360]  told him if you throw america's weight behind the israeli attack on iran we will support you
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:43.960]  that's what they said now in the last few weeks as it appears that you know obama's starting to get
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:50.680]  cold feet refuses to meet with netanyahu on this scheduled iran attack as all the big armadas
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:57.800]  and ships sail towards there it seems that this contrived phony outrage in the middle east is
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:04.200]  being pushed for that exact purpose to crucify obama on his failed foreign policy as a last
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:10.040]  you know desperate push for the neocons to get their man in so it is a kind of jockeying for
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:16.440]  position amongst the two-party gang system as uh webster topley said on your show a couple of days
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.720]  ago and i had that thought last week that it appears as though they're trying to make obama
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.320]  appear like jimmy carter because he's starting to get cold feet on the iran attack um and it's a
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:33.720]  last gasp effort effort by the neocons because if you look at the actual betting not the polls
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:39.640]  the polls in america show obama has been in front with the lead of about three points that's
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.600]  probably narrowed in the past couple of weeks but if you look at the actual betting websites and it's
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.440]  it's illegal to bet on the u.s presidential election in the united states but the uk bookies
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.920]  rarely get it wrong and they're saying that obama has a 70 chance of winning the election
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:03.000]  and ronnie's down at 30 so if you look at the actual betting figures it seems clear that
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.200]  obama's the favorite and this contrived outrage was an attempt by the neocons to sacrifice him
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.960]  on his foreign policy turning him into a figure of ridicule jimmy carter style figure and that's
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.920]  where it's going and again they're using the radical muslims to do it well look i'm not obviously
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:26.840]  in the lesser of two evils or pick your poison you know cherry flavored cyanide or grape flavored
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:33.880]  cyanide but you've still got to look at these two guys and the power structure behind them and obama
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:41.240]  it's a bunch of chicago globalist anti-gun anti-family socialist you know agenda 21 in hyper warp which
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.360]  i absolutely hate and just loathe so it's like asking me do i want to jump in a wood chipper
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:54.280]  or do i want to uh you know jump into a giant vat of piranhas and and and and either one looks
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.320]  equally horrible and then you've got romney over there who at least has some good rhetoric on issues
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:05.160]  but we know is bad news and he's got the neocons all behind him who were absolutely torture
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:13.240]  secret arrest warrantless fight wars false flags and then you know there's electronic voting fraud
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:21.080]  i mean romney just a week or two ago was starting to beat obama in polls now because the media running
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:28.440]  these faux pas hoaxes you know he's falling behind and at a cynical level for talk radio gun sales
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:34.520]  what you know we do if i was just a business guy i'd say oh i want obama back in but i morally
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.320]  because people go to sleep once romney gets in but then i kind of fantasize and think oh maybe
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:45.000]  romney isn't too bad maybe he'll get in and be better so i think well i want romney overall
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.760]  i want romney at a at a subconscious level if i consciously think about it paul because it you
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.400]  know there's this idea of bush was bad maybe obama will be better even though i knew obama was
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.920]  going to be horrible and i didn't support him over mccain i still hoped maybe you know he would end
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:07.000]  the wars and not torture everybody but then he expanded this as chris edges said uh pulled surprise
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.120]  when we're suing over nda and we have some news on that and so you know now you just kind of hope
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:17.480]  well maybe romney maybe we'll change you know rearrange deck chairs on the titanic but i i think
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.800]  that answers my questions it's all rearranging deck chairs i want your take on that ball but
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:28.920]  here is this really serious news obama wins right to indefinitely detain americans under ndaa this
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.880]  is out of rt it's getting almost no news it happened late last night a loan appeals judge
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:38.920]  bowed down to the obama administration late monday and reauthorized the white house's ability to
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.160]  definitely detain american citizens without charge or due process but notice this is nowhere on the
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.920]  quote liberal press because they don't want to point out he's not a liberal last week a federal
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.480]  judge ruled the temporary injunction on section one zero two one of the national defense authorization
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.760]  act for fiscal year 2012 must be made permanent essentially barring the white house from ever
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:02.440]  enforcing a clause the ndaa that can let them put any u.s citizens behind bars and definitely
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:06.920]  over mere allegations of terrorist associations on monday the u.s. judge department asked for an
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.160]  emergency stay on the order an hours later the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:17.560]  court of richmond uh raymond lawyer agreed to intervene and place a hold but it's only a hold
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:24.840]  but that's still terrible terrible news i mean this is so clearly absolute pure taking away to the
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:34.120]  dungeon uh imperious tyranny i mean this is their this is their this is this is the criminals
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:42.600]  confessing to their to their criminal intent to their tyranny paul well it's amazing isn't it that
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:48.600]  obama signed this into law on new year's eve while everyone was out partying drunk he put in a
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:53.080]  meaningless signing statement saying i'm not going to use this against american citizens
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.880]  he then repeated that about a week ago in that interview with ben swan he said whenever going
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:03.640]  to use it against americans and now they appealed it got struck down by a federal judge in new york
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:08.840]  that you can't indefinitely detain american citizens the obama administration within hours
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:13.240]  immediately appealed it and now as you just said they've got it over turning it so it's all about
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:19.720]  hiding behind this smoke and mirrors of trendy you know feel good liberalness and uh they're the
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:25.320]  ones all along pushing it in fact when it was passed levin in the uh congress said that it was
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:30.840]  the obama administration that specifically demanded the indefinite detention provisions
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.200]  pertain to american citizens they tried to take out the language the obama administration said no
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.160]  so they've been pushing it all along and it's no surprise that they've you know bitten back against
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:49.720]  this new york judge's ruling well said paul thank you for coming on and reporting here on the radio
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.800]  for us i know you'll be doing the nightly news uh later this week and we appreciate all the fine
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.760]  reported you and your brother as the dynamic duo are engaged in over there at prismplanet.com and
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:06.920]  info wars.net one of the auxiliary sites any other uh tidbits you'd like to add and again what's the
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:15.800]  eta on your 200 million bullet uh story eta is probably about an hour from now just wanted to
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:22.760]  throw in the last thing about syria because it all ties in um basically we had the article the other
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:29.880]  day syrian rebels burn us flag um and again it illustrated the fact that these rebels are glee
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:36.120]  fully accepting their role as you know nato and us pawns on this grand chess board um because the
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:42.520]  situation in syria boils down to the fact that as uh dr jack beres of doctors without borders
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:48.120]  reported about a week ago and this is an independent organization he was actually in a lepo treating the
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:54.920]  opposition fighters the opposition militants and he said that 60 percent of them 60 percent were not
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:01.720]  syrian they were foreign fighters so you know imagine for a moment that china sends in pa la
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:08.840]  troops to radicalize an arm occupy wall street protesters in america or tea party insurgents
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:14.680]  whichever you like and suddenly you've got 40 percent of americans backed up by 60 percent
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:20.600]  chinese pa la troops attacking government buildings you know carrying out bombings assassinations
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.920]  would that be a genuine organic grassroots american revolution well no it would be a
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.200]  hostile takeover by a foreign nation um and whether you support them or not the u.s. government
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:37.320]  would be within their rights to repel that with all the force and yet the establishment media
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:43.800]  tells us that these syrian rebels most of whom in some cities not all aren't even syrian that it's
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:50.280]  an organic grassroots rebel revolution of protesters and demonstrators who have you know just by
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.160]  accident i suppose commandeered tanks and fighter jets and are attacking the the government imagine
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:01.160]  if that happened in america what the reaction would be and again you've had the you've had the
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:06.440]  guardian reporting that al-qaeda meets with them trains them how to make bombs trains them how to
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:12.520]  carry out terror attacks you've had other british reporters who say most of the accents these rebels
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:18.040]  had were not foreign some of them were english they've got muslims from birmingham who are actually
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:24.600]  fighting on on the side of the rebels so how that can even be called you know called an organic
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:30.200]  uprising from within the country when it's purely a it's purely a proxy invasion great job paul
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.680]  watson again about an hour from now your big report will be an info wars dot com and prison
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.880]  body dot com i don't know the headline to go with let's not give it out on air yet but uh you know
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:48.280]  uh dhs now buying 200 million rounds sniper rounds uh or dhs has now purchased 1.2 billion
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:57.400]  in in just the last year or dhs is purchasing an additional 200 million rounds now up to 1.6 billion
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:05.640]  uh in in in the last year i mean or it's all just incredible thank you paul thanks alex just
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:11.720]  absolutely amazing okay i want to get into some economic news here but i first want to show this
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:18.840]  graph that bright bar dot com is reporting on here and this is why mainstream media is supporting
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:24.920]  web shutdowns free speech shutdowns because they can't compete and i want to show you a graph here
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:33.960]  this is newspaper advertising revenue adjusted for inflation 1950 to 2012 and you can see here
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.720]  web advertising uh in the centerline if you're watching on prison planet dot tv is only a little
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:48.520]  bit above print collapse there is a close to total collapse of newspaper revenue both online and in
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:54.680]  print though in alternative media even though we're in a depression advertising revenue is up
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:03.080]  and why is that it's because no one trusts you or no one believes you and that's unfortunate
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.320]  because most news in the newspaper is pretty accurate there was this much rain today there was
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:13.080]  we need local newspapers we need local boots on the ground we need the professionalism of the
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:19.400]  old journalistic system but i mean old 100 years ago 50 years ago what we have today politically
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:27.160]  what's giving the rest of news a bad name is the politicos at the press club at the press briefings
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:34.200]  that regurgitate what they're told and that repeat what they're told that's what's destroying it so
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.160]  it's not just the economy that's causing this okay let's continue here getting into the economy
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:43.800]  we're going to skip this break because this is so important this network break feds qe
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:53.560]  infinity will push gold up to 2400 that's cnbc and they're saying that the quantitative infinity
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:50:00.840]  they believe the next year will raise the price of gold to 2400 that's francisco blanche very
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:05.720]  respected global investment strategist with the bank of america merrill lynch in a note to clients
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:13.160]  now again given the new open ended nature of qe3 the upward pressure on gold prices should
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:17.480]  continue until employment is strong enough to require a change in policy which isn't happening
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:30.120]  let's shift gears here now to other economic news that's here in my stacks i have the report here
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:38.680]  this is also out of cnbc dollar index headed for rapid collapse here's the chart and it shows the
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:51.480]  dollar plunging massively in just the last few weeks you can see that there on the chart
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:58.600]  dollar index headed for rapid collapse quantitative easing is really another word for currency wars
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:05.080]  a weak u.s currency puts continued pressure on the japanese yen the chinese yawn the south korean
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.320]  won the australian dollar and other currencies cheap money also fuels speculation this money
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:15.240]  quickly drifts into commodity markets absolutely driving up prices even more so this is economic
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:20.440]  warfare not just against foreign governments but against the people of every country including ours
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.800]  and that's cnbc saying what webster tarpley said on the show yesterday what max keiser said this is
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:31.640]  global bankers waging war on everyone it's full spectrum war they go fund the al qaeda and libya
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:36.440]  and syria but not just there in afghanistan iraq because if you want to be there to have a war
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:41.240]  i was talking to some military guys just yesterday they were saying yeah you're absolutely right
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.440]  when we went into bagdad we were ordered to drive right past the armament depots so
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:53.320]  resistance could get it so we'd have an excuse to stay there for no bid contracts yeah the global
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:59.000]  let's go start wars and create these groups so they have an excuse to go in they run both sides
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.560]  this has gone off for hundreds of years but now it's scientifically done that's why they
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:09.560]  caught british israeli and us mercenaries including british special forces not just mercenaries that
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:16.520]  was london guardian dressed up as sunnis killing shiites and shooting at us troops because you've
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:21.400]  got to have a war to have 15 million dollar blue tarps that really cost a hundred dollars
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:31.240]  it's criminal looting these wars are like a bank robber going and setting fire the local
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:40.200]  church so that the police are all at the church fire while they rob the bank they go create the
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:44.920]  al qaeda so they can go in and take over these countries and then they think you're so stupid
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:51.560]  they move the al qaeda to the next country then they use the al qaeda to kill the ambassador
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:59.400]  i mean they think you're so stupid uh continuing here fedex says economy is worsening cuts outlook
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:04.120]  well again people ask well how's why'd you buy gold at 260 dollars an ounce
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.080]  why did i do it because i knew that they were beginning a policy of devouring the currency
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:17.960]  11 years ago and now here we are the dollar in just 11 years has lost massive amounts of its value
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:25.160]  depending on the chart it varies everybody knows that's happened now it's accelerating that loss
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:30.760]  and other currencies are and commodities because of the speculation of all our tax money that's given
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:36.040]  to foreign banks they go we'll fix the economy give us tens of trillions more to their operatives who
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:40.360]  they've put in the governments not just ours but every government this is global government
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:47.640]  it's mega banks robbing you and giving tiny amounts of chicken feed to the welfare crowd
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:52.680]  so they think the government's their friend so they can have them vote to take the rest of our money
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.040]  fedex says economy is worsening and says that yeah their shipping is going way down and that's a
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.280]  great gauge of the economy even going into the christmas season and so they're you know they're
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:11.800]  cutting their outlook i want to bring chet anderson up because he's been talking about this forever
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.880]  you know when gold went up to almost 2000 i didn't sell it when silver went up to 50 i didn't
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:20.760]  sell it even though i bought most that silver at five dollars and what have i been doing when
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.320]  gold was driven down to 1500 i was buying it and silver a little bit here a little bit there
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.200]  you see because i knew the laws of economics and so yeah george thorough started buying
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.720]  a month ago i said watch it go up gold's up again today gold's up with two hundred dollars the last
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:44.360]  few weeks because the dollars being driven down and all commodities are going up this is an economic
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:49.640]  war of a wealth transfer happening how do you protect yourself well i believe you do it by
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.920]  getting gold and silver let's bring ted anderson up here for a report on this ted i know we don't
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.080]  have a lot of time here in the next hour it's coming up i promise to have open phones and cover
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.240]  all this but with what's happening in the middle east was with with what's happening the dollar
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:09.240]  when cnbc and maryl Lynch sound like alex jones and ted anderson uh i mean the writing's on the
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:14.200]  wall when the big wigs are saying don't buy gold well they're quietly buying it not wanting us to know
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.240]  because it exposes what they're doing i mean i believe now is the time to buy gold and silver
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:24.360]  what's your take on this and give us today's uh specials it might as resources while you're
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:30.120]  exactly right you're talking about a currency war and and james rickards has a great book out on that
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:35.080]  you should read it but yeah that's what's going on right now the united states is trying to lure
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:40.200]  the value of the dollar export our inflation overseas it's coming right back in the form of
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:47.400]  commodities and gold is taking the hit right now because it's up right now at four up four dollars
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:55.160]  and ninety cents been as high as 1774 70 today currently right now trading at 1768 40 and and
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:02.120]  like you said i mean that when you when you have uh msnbc or cc sorry uh reporting that maryl Lynch
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:06.600]  is saying that we're going to have 2400 dollar gold because they don't see i mean this quantitative
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:11.400]  easing thing that they're looking at now rather than ending at a certain point in time they're
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.480]  just going to say when we see the numbers turn right then we're going to change this well they're
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.360]  saying that you know the unemployment figures aren't going to come back not like they're you know
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:26.920]  not any time soon they're talking about 2014 that they're looking for 2400 dollar gold 2000
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:32.120]  before the end of this year so yeah there's a lot of stuff that's going on alex that uh that book
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  and silver dollar deal that we put together with the obama deception the american dream and the uh
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:44.200]  dishonest money book uh that that particular offer i had to raise it to 72 dollars still way
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.720]  way below way way below what you'd buy silver dollars for and when you add in the the books
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:55.560]  and the videos i mean it's just a monster well let's explain yet let's explain two silver dollars
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:01.080]  you're going to be hard pressed to find two silver dollars for 72 dollars two one ounce silver coins
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:06.920]  of this quality or any quality for that matter and a free obama deception and an american dream
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:12.040]  exposing the federal reserve incredible film and the dishonest money book i mean that books 20 bucks
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:20.120]  right there three free gifts and silver at cost or below as a loss leader i mean this is the definition
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  of loss leader it was 63 last week it's 72 now take advantage and when you call ask for the alex
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:33.160]  jones radio specials there's a whole spectrum of the day special of gold and silver at prices
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:39.240]  that are even lower than ted has on the internet okay i mean the alex jones specials are the lowest
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:46.680]  800 686 2237 and even if you've already bought the silver dollars you just want more at that price
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:51.560]  give the books give the videos to others even if you already ordered one if i was well how many
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:56.360]  can people buy can they buy one or two or how many of this deal can they buy we we don't we just we

[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:34.920]  with a lot of the us news world news and health news and economics we haven't gotten to yet we've
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:39.240]  discovered all over the united states we already knew this but we've got all the documents the
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:45.000]  agenda 21 groups taking over the cities and towns are really the toll road companies so they've
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.080]  learned they've got to just take over the governments if they're going to make you pay them to drive
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.160]  down roads that are already paid for what we're discovering is even worse than we thought it's
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:57.160]  i was just talking to erin during that one minute break it blew me away ted anderson we were just
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.480]  talking about gold and silver and also pitching it at people incredible deals i want to get into
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.280]  the writing on the wall i mean when maryl lynch and bank of america are saying yeah
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:11.000]  for the next few years things are just going to get worse while the media says everything's fine
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.680]  we're going into a depression uh gold and silver are only going to go up if they continue to hyper
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:23.400]  in flight i mean what does qe unlimited mean you know 85 billion dollars a month just giving it to
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:28.440]  the bankers what do you expect that to do well one of the things one of the very first things
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:35.000]  that are occurring right now is iggen jones a uh a rating service just downgraded the us currency
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.680]  or the downgraded us bonds they used to be double a rating of course they were triple a rating before
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:45.720]  obama got into office now they're double a well they just dropped them down to double a minus
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:51.880]  which means that it's becoming a riskier investment to be investing in us government securities
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:56.280]  if you're sitting in long-term bonds of course if you have inflation the value of the bond is
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:02.520]  going to go down when the interest rates rise uh the the very ability for the united states to
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:09.560]  be able to pay back these bonds in valuable currency is becoming a problem and that's why
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:13.800]  they're downgrading it's going to take savings away from the people that have worked very hard
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:20.760]  anybody that's sitting on a pension plan or a 401k plan an ira it's going to drive that value down
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:25.560]  and you know it makes it very difficult for people that have worked their years for kids
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.080]  my goodness they're going to be working and paying taxes to service the interest on this
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:34.840]  debt it's just it's bad all around the united states currency falling apart like this is going to
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:41.400]  create something very similar to the argentina brazil uh mexico perhaps even the weimar republic
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.360]  in germany back in world war one time this is what we're looking forward to here in the united
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.400]  states it's decreasing the value of the money i mean people that have worked and saved are going
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:57.640]  to be hurting so that it really alex it's it's it's destruction and and it's it's taxation
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:02.520]  without representation and it's it's very difficult for people to get along unemployment
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:08.360]  numbers will not drop because of this it'll go up it creates instability in the marketplace
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:14.200]  malinvestment bubbles in various different places of the economy and those bubbles burst and it
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:20.600]  just it just creates you know it's it's stimulus on steroids i mean the reason why we got the fed
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:25.880]  in the first place at least the reason why they say they exist is so they can stimulate the economy
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.840]  when the economy needs stimulation and slow down the economy when it's growing too fast
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:35.320]  but what's been going on is they've created the business cycle and put it on steroids it's like
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:40.920]  it's our crack now it they're creating they're they're creating way too much volatility in the
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:47.160]  marketplace and and there's no stability how in the world in anybody if can anybody in any business
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:52.840]  predictably run their business and expand in this type of a market they can't by the way
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:58.520]  Ted that is not hype what you're saying we're looking at argentina weimar republic maybe even
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:05.160]  zimbabwean situation on this road and the more they commit to it the more they can't pull out
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:12.440]  now very serious inflation is already here probably hyper uh what are the elites doing
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.760]  they're getting into gold and silver they're physically holding it who's got the best deal

[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:59.000]  me covering in the last two our government publicly putting al-qaeda in charge all over
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.960]  the middle east allowing them to blow up buildings churches attack embassies shoot innocent people
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:13.000]  cut christians heads off throw them off buildings it's not even a news issue it's like oh we better
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.240]  give our rights up look at the muslims when our government is the criminal group helping them
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:23.480]  just like obama shipping guns into mexico to blame the second amendment you've got the media
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:29.000]  saying mit romney's evil for saying 47 of the country is totally dependent and so we'll vote
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.280]  for more government well yeah if you allow the public to vote themselves out of the treasury
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:40.200]  they will vote themselves everyone's wealth and destroy the mechanisms of production that's what
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:46.920]  america was founded on stopping and if you don't like that you don't like america and again i'm not
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.720]  even defending mit romney but we have to defend him when he tells the truth in a private meeting
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:57.240]  and they attack him for it this is secret information mother jones calls it because romney
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:03.480]  won't say this in public he needs to go so oh it's secret he had to say it in secret now
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:09.240]  with a bunch of top donors of what anybody with half a brain already knows you want to give us
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:21.160]  your take on that the toll free number to join us 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 1 800 2 5 9 9 2 3 1 the fellow
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:27.960]  reserve is out there hyper monetizing things now monetizing debt and you've got bank of america
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:35.080]  and maryl lynch and others saying 1200 and 40 gold the next year and a half you've got all this news
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:41.320]  coming in and ted anderson if you missed it in the last segment broke down i said where's this
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:47.400]  going ted 30 years in golden silver and he said it's going zimbabwe it's going argentina it's going
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:52.760]  mexico it's going weimar republic and now that they've announced qe unlimited that's pretty much the
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:59.320]  only place it can go that's why you see commodities running back up uh so briefly ted recap what you
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.520]  were saying and then i'm going to go to calls again on on on why it's important when they say
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:08.920]  they're stimulating the economy and they give trillions of dollars to foreign banks
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:14.440]  what that really signifies well what that what that means is they're printing the dollars that we
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:20.040]  use and trade for products and goods and services if they make a whole bunch of additional dollars
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:25.000]  to compete with what we're trying to buy the price of goods and services are going to go up it means
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.880]  that you'll be paying ten dollars a gallon for gasoline rather than four dollars a gallon for
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:36.200]  gasoline it could be 20 you know the more they step on that accelerator the faster the more they're
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:40.840]  trying to push money into the system but one of the things that you got to remember alex is that
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:47.240]  the banking system is trying to get the money into the economy by lending it to us or having these
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:54.360]  bailouts go on right now we're not a very credit worthy nation because we have had this economic
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:12:01.560]  crisis a lot of houses went back were foreclosed on a lot of bad debt had to be had to be forgiven
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:06.680]  and bankruptcies and so on and so forth so there's not a lot of credit worthy borrowers out there
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:11.800]  but the fed is trying to get the money into the system and it's not reaching the people because
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:17.480]  well first of all the banks don't want to take the risk at at three percent interest you know
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.480]  why would you do that when you just go over and turn and buy a treasury and not have to take on the
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:27.000]  risk of of somebody defaulting on you so that the money is not making it actually to the people
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:32.600]  it's making it into the elite's hands the banks and and yes indeed they're able to make all these
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:38.120]  you know huge margins of profit just off of us treasuries it's coming on to the backs of the
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:43.320]  people and at the same time they're shipping our money overseas to bail out the european banks
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:48.040]  and all this stuff is driving commodity prices up we're having a currency war with all these other
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:52.840]  countries watching the united states put on the the accelerator on our printing press they have to
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:59.720]  do the same so now you have this war going on economically and the whole thing spells out disaster
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:04.520]  for anybody that spends saving money you're going to watch the value of the currency fall
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:10.360]  as long as we have this quantitative easing that's why our forefathers wanted us to have
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:17.080]  gold as money so we wouldn't do this this is absolutely crazy to think that you can put
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:21.880]  a politician a banker in the same room as a printing press and expect good things to come
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:26.360]  out of it it's just not happening that way nothing good ever comes out of it long term
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:32.200]  and now we're long term we're now what since the 70s they got off the gold standard we're now almost
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:38.600]  40 years into this normally countries don't even last that long i'm surprised the us went this long
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:44.360]  i mean usually if you let them have printing presses in africa in asia and latin america
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:51.160]  they usually do this stuff within what about 20 years well we the people alex the people
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.960]  that are listening to this show the people of this nation should be insisting upon constitutional
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:01.560]  money get that printing press out of the hands of the politician and what's worse get it out of
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:07.720]  the hands of a of a business arrangement between bankers and politicians which is the federal reserve
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:13.000]  system get that product get that whole system and move it away move it out here that's why
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.440]  ron paul was talking about ending the fed this is the kind of chicanery that happens when you
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:23.800]  have this type of situation so expect that the politicians now they're even saying it
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:28.600]  that the federal reserve is saying that we're going to be quantitative easing until unemployment
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:33.240]  numbers start to go down you know what it's not going to happen that way as long as they
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:39.000]  quantitative ease they're going to create more malinvestment more economic uncertainty whatever
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:45.160]  tiny amount of money gets back to the public is eaten up in inflation especially in the commodities
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:51.320]  but again they know that this is a consolidation of wealth this is a plan this is agenda 21 now
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:59.960]  ted next year can you believe 2013 is almost here uh the one the 100 year charter is up
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:07.720]  we need to start a movement to have congress take back control the purse and to kick the
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.360]  federal reserve out of this country it's not federal it's not a reserve what's your take on that
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:18.440]  well alex obviously that would be something that i would support and i'd be very much uh
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:25.320]  you know i'll do just about anything for that but we only have about 10 percent to 20 percent of
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:31.240]  the people that even understand why this is this idea is important so we have to get on the ground
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:35.880]  and we have to teach and we have to train and that's one of the reasons why this silver dollar
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:41.080]  offer that i have has the dishonest money book in it because it explains that to people and then you
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.680]  have the video uh the american dream which also brings you right there then your obama deception
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:51.880]  it it pulls it all together so people can get an idea a picture of what this is about that's right
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:54.920]  i didn't ever i didn't really have you on the pitch this but it is important if folks go to
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:16:00.760]  mitusresources.com or follow through at info wars.com or call you can get two silver dollars for 72
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:07.000]  dollars i mean that's the lowest price anywhere and then get two free films and a book 800 686
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:14.520]  2237 800 686 237 Ted i want to go to calls here in a moment and i'll let you go i know you're
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:21.640]  busy but briefly as a business person as a free market constitutionalist ron paul type supporter
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:25.960]  you know i mean i met you 16 years ago and you're the same patriot today you were then just more
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:32.600]  informed watching this all come true now what is it like to hear obama say you didn't build mitus
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:39.160]  resources or the genesis communications radio network with now over 700 affiliates you can argue
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:45.640]  the second or third largest radio network in the us i mean you didn't build that government did
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:52.760]  but then expanding on that ted now they're attacking romney for saying 47 of the public
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:58.760]  are on government handouts and that's a dangerous thing i mean i'm living in the twilight zone if
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:04.680]  that's a bad thing to say well obviously it's not a bad thing to say and the more people that get
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:10.200]  in the way again that there's going to be less people pulling it economically what that means is
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:14.600]  that people are going to be voting for their benefits coming from the government and as more
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:19.320]  people get in you'll have more people voting for it there could be reaching a tipping point of no
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:23.880]  return uh you know once people are voting for government benefits they're going to look for
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:29.240]  somebody like brock obama to re put into the office who's going to promote this type of activity
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:33.560]  eventually the people that are out there working their tailbone off trying to
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:39.240]  make a living pay for their families needs and pay taxes at the same time we're going to give up
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:44.120]  and you know that's when the country implodes it's really a bad deal the end that's not what the
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:51.080]  american experiment is about we get out there we work for ourselves we make things happen
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:55.080]  you know we cover our own health care we don't need to have somebody else on our back
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:18:00.040]  really what we really want here in the united states at least in my mind is we want the government
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:06.680]  to get out of the way and uh well ted ted there's no doubt that that tyranny is galloping on every
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:14.680]  front that we've abandoned what made america great and now uh it's like the boat has been untied
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:21.400]  from the dock tyranny is just racing away now and everything is being removed and government

[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:46.440]  they're going to have half the public on the dole and that the public with the government
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:51.080]  is going to come rob the rest of us and they're getting ready for a civil war i mean this is a

[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:34.040]  constitutional india and some of the quotes by the lawyers exposing it i mean what this does
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:39.240]  it allows them to just disappear you into a black hole anybody and they're training police and feds
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.440]  for snatch and grabs they're trying to tell us and then these messages and the cop shows the
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:48.760]  tortures good they admit the government's paying for that they're also paying to promote government
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:55.160]  run health care and tv shows your tax money pays tv networks to put propaganda in the shows
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.360]  and then you tell the average yuppie that they're like no that's not going on that's a conspiracy
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:06.040]  theory we live in that type of propaganda state in fact guys the new american has an article
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:11.080]  about it today on info wars dot com i never covered it uh the last two days actually came out sunday
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:17.320]  about paying the networks with taxpayer money to put product placement in the tv shows you print
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:22.760]  that for me because it dovetails with this torture stuff i mean again we have a government
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:27.960]  that pays for them to promote secret arrest and torture like at school and pays to tell you that
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:33.160]  government run health care is good i mean that that's like a soviet union or something i mean
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:41.400]  that we're bays we're based in evil i'm gonna shut up go to your calls uh tony richie zero uh dalton

[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:59.240]  mind today uh the question i have for you is just found out my wife is pregnant um very dense
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:04.760]  abortion but with the grown police state world war three and the price of the dollar your phone's
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:09.240]  a little muffled can you can you back away from it or talk right into it or something yeah in the
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.520]  country here we go now yeah try talking right into the receiver yeah all right i said my wife
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:21.960]  we just found she's pregnant um we're against abortion but with the grown police state uh the
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:27.240]  price of the dollar the world war three we're afraid to bring another child into this world
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.640]  well whatever you do brother listen some of the best children ever are brought into war zones
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.920]  don't ever have an abortion have that child uh and it'll it'll be a special child
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:42.600]  about the yeah sir you're not you're not thinking about having an abortion are you
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:47.960]  actually i am not i'm totally against it my wife totally against it but it's been time we take
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:52.200]  it again no i think the answer in these bad times is to have more children i have three
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:58.200]  three we've been quite frankly trying to have more um but there's so much between all in everything
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:04.120]  out there uh and so there you go i mean it's time to have more kids in the face of evil
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:09.880]  we shouldn't be afraid of this we should double down bet on life fully commit i think all patriots
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.000]  should have more children we need we need to commit to this we're going to defeat the tyranny

[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:57.720]  people i'm i consider myself a nobody but uh i would just like to say you know uh jesus spared my
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:04.040]  life eight and a half years ago i don't deserve to be alive and i'm thankful that he had mercy on me
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:11.320]  and uh he changed me uh and i would just like to quickly say that um you know i believe our problem
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:17.160]  one verse in the bottle that sticks out is second best longians two that says because you reject the
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:24.040]  love of the truth god says i will send strong delusion that you might believe lies and be damned
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:29.080]  uh because you did not receive the love of the truth and if you look there in second best longians
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:35.400]  two i believe that's where america is we're taking god out of everything uh we want to commit adultery
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:43.160]  we want our sin we want to we want abortion we want pornography uh so i think a lot of the problem
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:48.680]  is is our own fault it's my sin and i'm not being uh hypocritical acting like it's everybody else
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:54.920]  but it's my sin it's our sin that has created this situation uh but on the other hand trying to be
[02:28:54.920 --> 02:29:03.240]  proactive i met with uh jay neal uh one of our representatives last week and just took a ride
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:11.000]  with him he's a a great man a godly man makes me believe in government and um he pleads the cause of

[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:05.160]  me and hear what they say and do and look in their eyes and say hey what's your favorite show and
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:10.040]  they'll start telling you how they watch seven hours of tv a day three hours of video games a day
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:15.640]  and i'm not judging you if you do that and it's another thing entirely you've got a bunch of tv
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:20.440]  sets on you're a media person you're monitoring things you're in a conscious mode but everybody's
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:25.400]  seeing their husband their wife their children watching television where they have that zombie
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:30.520]  look and you're like hey hey we got to go and they're and they're just they're in a trance
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:39.160]  medically the general public is very close to a daydream state into the edge of sleep
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:48.040]  and it's everywhere people are not conscious they're spectators from birth being set in front
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:53.960]  of television sets that are tuned with the flicker rate to put you into a highly suggestible state
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:59.880]  and i and i look at people in different degrees myself included
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:06.840]  who are in these different states of awareness and and it's incredible and for the global crime
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:11.880]  syndicate operators basically it's like we're going in slow motion they can run 100 miles an
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:17.480]  hour they're the flash they know how things work they understand the tricks they know how to manipulate
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:21.960]  us and it's funny to them and they've dumbed us down and put poison in the water in the food
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:28.920]  to make us even more malleable so they could take over and they have i talked about that court
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:35.640]  ruling last week abc news reported it you can type in the the search engine court rules uh that uh
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:45.000]  you know police can bar high iqs nationwide they won't hire a cop with over 100 iq they're
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  quite frankly looking for about an 85 iq 85 folks is stupid very stupid 70s mentally retarded
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:59.720]  so i mean it's a fact ladies and gentlemen we're we are to be ruled by a bunch of idiots
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:08.600]  by a bunch of scientific technocrats up there with 180 iqs and uh humanity i don't claim to be the
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:13.480]  smartest person around but i've got instincts and i don't like being a slave and i figured out how
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:19.720]  these people work and i'm sitting here watching them with their playbook cheat everybody and and
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:23.560]  basically stick their leg out when you're walking by and trip you over and over again
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:28.440]  and laugh about it and the public's been dumbed down to the point that
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:34.600]  the globalist trip them and they don't even know why they got tripped even though the leg's
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:39.400]  sticking out and i'm just tired of it i've had enough and i'm not here saying the cops are all
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:44.200]  a bunch of idiots either the old days they tried to hire people that were smart this is in the last
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:52.920]  20 years they want stupid police and they said well they'll follow orders that's right i mean i've
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:58.360]  run into it man i tell you with these game wardens the last three times i was trying to camp out or
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:04.200]  even go have a fire on my own property in east texas where i've been going since i was born
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:10.520]  had ever had this happen and every time game wardens jump out of the bushes and you'll be
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:14.600]  sitting there drinking a cup of coffee you're not even hunting and they're in your face and
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:19.880]  wanting to see a bunch of stuff and i'm like it's i told the story and i'm gonna go to your calls of
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:27.080]  my great uncle uncle Leonard who you know when i was like five years old i fly out and see in
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:34.920]  houston and stuff really great god my grandfather's a little brother and he had pancreatic cancer and
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:40.040]  they said he had a few months to live and he did die and he even had trouble walking at that point
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:46.840]  but he wanted to go deer hunting again just to do that and the driving into town to process the deer
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:55.880]  because he didn't want to gut it and stuff they've got the deer feet sticking out the back of the
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:01.160]  i mean you know the bed's open there's a deer there it's got a tag on its antler everything
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:05.480]  and the state police pull them over oh that's a deer you must be bad you have a deer and so
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.080]  guy runs over and says whose deer is this and my uncle's not there because he's too sick to go
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:19.400]  and and and and my great uncle and my uncle says along with my dad oh it's uh it's our uncles
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:24.360]  we're taking it to get it processed right here it turned into you know stakes and stuff and the
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:31.000]  state police guy is shaking and and starts getting his gun out and as you stay here and more police
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.880]  get there and everything and he goes i'm taking you to jail you're not allowed to to to transfer
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:40.760]  somebody else's deer and of course he's an idiot he probably got an 80 IQ and they say uh no
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:47.800]  texas law the landowner can process the deer and more police showed up more like oh oh you're the
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:53.080]  jones is oh like you know one of the oldest families in that area oh we're sorry no no he's right
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:58.760]  they're allowed to transfer the deer but if they weren't you know connected to good old boys of old
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:03.480]  he still took him to jail probably pistol wept him the way he was acting and the jury probably
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:07.160]  put him in prison doesn't matter if there's a law i see folks called you all the time there's not
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:12.200]  even a law these judges are so demonic they'll turn a lot of the jury and just make something up

[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.880]  the next thing i got a question for you i gotta throw this out there i've noticed all the stuff
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:58.360]  the middle east and iran and yada yada my thought is that the globalists are looking to start
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:03.400]  stuff over there and then a race for here if you want if you listen no that's what they're doing
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:10.520]  yeah exactly no that's exactly what they're trying i have pulled my family we're pretty much off the
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:16.920]  grid now we we grow our own food we raise our animals and i'm trying to get us farther away
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:27.800]  from any population you know and why why do they do this you know the globalists love direct stuff
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:33.080]  they love to bring down societies while they sit back offshore watching our funeral pyre
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:38.760]  and they roll back in as the saviors they wreck every country libya was building up all of africa
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:44.440]  so they went and bombed the whole thing and put al-qaeda in the globalists are anti industry
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:50.920]  anti freedom anti wealth they don't just want the wealth they don't want you to have it
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:56.280]  they want you starving and dumb down so they can fly over you they call it flyover country
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:43:03.640]  what do you think of uh them demonizing the fact that that mit romney said that you know
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:10.360]  it's dangerous to have half the public on on on the government payroll all right that's absolutely
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:16.440]  ridiculous i mean anybody in their right mind can see right they can see the fruit that's what
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:22.840]  they want they want us to have to depend on them you know i refuse no matter how hard times have
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.680]  been i refuse to get any handouts from any government because i don't want it there are all sorts of
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:35.560]  tinkers uh it's almost always and i appreciate your call god bless you you know and by the way
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:40.680]  the system harasses me legal aliens are above the law left alone get out of jail free card but
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:47.800]  if you had to typecast these people uh they're they're they're generally most of them are white
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:53.000]  some are black some are Hispanic but they have to typecast them it's an old if you have to assess
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.840]  them it's about about 60 year old white vietnam veteran in a broke down half broke down work van
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:12.040]  who lives in their van and doesn't smoke doesn't drink goes to church three nights a week who drives
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:19.320]  around fixing people's hot water heaters and fences and and and and tinkers and the cops everywhere
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:24.680]  all over the country harass them and arrest them and give them tickets and won't let them park their
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:29.640]  van and sleep and chase them around until they're homeless and i've talked to so many of these
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:34.520]  homeless i'll go you're not on drugs you're not uh you know you don't look like you're schizophrenic
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.960]  what's your story well i'm from you know vietnam veteran and then i had a truck but it kept breaking
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:45.560]  down they kept arresting me so so now i work over here when i can get jobs this place takes me on
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:52.280]  mowing yards and i'll live back there in a tent but the drug hobos keep robbing me uh it's always
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:57.800]  the same story i mean it's just so pathetic what they've done to this country and there are there
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:03.160]  are hundreds of thousands of these people conservatively who literally are working homeless
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:10.280]  and and the system knows who they are and the police i've seen them just come in at a boy some
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:15.560]  old man in a van your life's over punk you're not gonna you're not gonna live in that van you scum
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:21.400]  we're driving you to the woods we're driving you in there we're gonna get you we're gonna get you
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:27.000]  american scum if it's the last thing we ever do and they are it's their country now let's go ahead
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  and talk to dalton in alabama you're on the air go ahead hey elix thanks for taking my call
[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:40.280]  um i was really hoping to actually get ted enderson's take on the question that i have but
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:43.960]  i'll ask it anyway i tell you what uh you're dead still around there get him in the studio
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:49.080]  john harman try to find him go ahead and ask your question well i was just wondering you know i i
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:54.440]  understand and i realized that buying gold and silver is the the best ways to to you know have
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:46:00.280]  protection against the coming economic collapse but what about us who are working you know these
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:06.440]  low wage and minimum wage jobs who are living paycheck to paycheck you know we barely have
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:13.800]  20 dollars in our pocket at any given time how what what would your advice be for us what can we do
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:19.560]  to you know be ready for the economic collapse i would have water filtration and i would have
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:24.440]  friends the most valuable thing more than gold or anything it's friends that know what's going on
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:29.080]  who who will support each other uh you know the government will call it a terrorist militia even
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:36.680]  though it's federal law to have militias but i would just form mutual aid societies and uh
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:42.520]  i mean the system doesn't want us to be able to stand together we have a ut professor saying
[02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:46.920]  families should be gotten rid of i mean that's in the textbooks too but i mean folks they don't
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:52.040]  want us having any without anybody they just want us to grow old they want to euthanize us
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:56.200]  they want to be able to kill babies even after they're born i mean it is just hell on earth
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:00.280]  with these people these people are evil man but of course they're evil they never made anything
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:05.880]  they never did anything they just sit on top of us sucking off of us and and out of all the bureaucrats
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:09.800]  i say the police are the best because at least they have to live in the real world and actually
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:14.200]  engage in some services the real bad ones are these professors and these bureaucrats and these
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:19.240]  government workers and these and these corporate mercenaries and all of them they think it's so
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:27.720]  funny they think they're on the winning team uh but um you know i mean silver look i bought most
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:31.800]  the silver i've got i don't have that much quite frankly my wife's always like why i told you you
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.320]  you were right you need to follow your own rules get more golden silver and i'm like well i need
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:40.200]  to cash we've gotten the bank to run this operation if everything shuts down i'm gonna spend all that
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:45.160]  money running this place then i'm gonna sell my house running this place i've got it all planned
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:49.800]  out because it'll probably get so bad that people won't be able to support us anymore i'll try to
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:56.520]  stay on air as long as possible but um silver is probably the best investment it's just hard to store
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:01.640]  i don't even have that much but like four big bags is really hard to deal with uh and i bought
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.200]  most of it at five dollars you know i didn't sell it when i went to fifty and i haven't sold it now
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:11.000]  that it's you know all going towards 40 again it's my emergency backup and i bought a lot of
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.640]  bit of gold you know not that much but quite a bit for me at the time back when it was like
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:23.560]  260 300 400 500 and you know uh it just it just it just really worked because it's not even an
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:29.800]  investment for me it's to beat their inflation and it's an emergency backup uh but i think just
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:34.120]  your health is the most valuable thing well your soul's important so get right with god
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:40.600]  then your health then friends and people if it can count on each other uh that's why they want
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:44.760]  us all watching television all day so we have synthetic friends you know with the people on
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:51.960]  the sitcoms we watch on shows like friends they don't want us having real friends uh so um
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.400]  it's very important to not be reclusive because freedom lovers a lot of times end up kind of
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:02.760]  being reclusive and i've always been somewhat not in modern times more i mean more recent times
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:07.560]  i've been a little bit reclusive so i've been trying to be more social with friends and people
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:14.360]  that's important to do uh and it's just important to be human to get back to what it is to be human

[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:36.680]  with plastic badges a tsa all of it is the opposite of freedom our country's dying our world's dying
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:41.560]  we're being overrun by spoiled brat criminals that have joined forces with the kleptocratic
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:48.600]  parasite class and i i for one am done hope that caller like ted running back to the microphone
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:53.400]  to give you his take but it's basically the same thing i was telling you it's not fun to work three
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:57.960]  jobs but if you've got to to get in a position to be able to protect yourself in hard times
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:03.480]  you'll be better off than others i certainly would not be sitting on my laurels right now
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:07.640]  and i know it's rough i know it's tough citizens are going to probably have to start doing what
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:13.240]  illegal aliens do and that is even though the system knows we're to be hin pecked as citizens
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:20.280]  and that we're trash um it's going to have to get to the point where we just stop complying
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:27.640]  just out of necessity and a lot of people are stopping paying taxes across the board a lot of
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:31.880]  people are stopping to buy all the stuff a lot of people are just refusing to go along with it
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:37.320]  but i mean here's fox news ice agents obama won't let us arrest the legals i've had sheriffs on
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:41.560]  with their s e legals with weapons with drugs they're told me you know to release them that
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:46.280]  was during bush again it's a two tiered system they've only got the illegals here to drive down
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:54.280]  the wages um again it's lawless but then the cops are so like attack dogs on us and the
[02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:59.800]  because we're known as the milk cow we're known as the joke we're known as the food and and
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:05.960]  and message the government i eat your food message the government i'm not scared of you message
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:12.040]  the government i'm not going along with you anymore matt north carolina you're on the air welcome sir
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:18.680]  hey what's going on buddy worldwide broadcast what's on your mind bud um look you're wrong
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:24.200]  about the federal reserve charter alex it um it's open ended now they changed it at some point
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:30.840]  so the only way that we can get rid of the federal reserve legally is if congress abolishes it
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:35.640]  or or if they commit an illegal act now you're right but i know that ron paul's pointed out
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:41.800]  that the hundredth anniversary of the charter is a good time to point out that it's charters
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:46.760]  up so it's it's really apples and oranges or i mean it's debating my point is if we've had
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:50.840]  it a hundred years yes we can get rid of it anytime congress should take back its power
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:56.360]  that's what i was saying absolutely but now the the risk alex the only way we're going to get rid
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:02.440]  of the federal reserve is if the people move out of the fiat currency by themselves and that means
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:07.720]  start you know bartering and gold and silver and that's why they're going after the farms they they
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:12.600]  hate these co-ops where people get together especially it scares them that yuppies are now
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:16.840]  learning how good organic food is and co-ops that's why they're coming after it you're right
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:22.040]  they're scared of us bartering they're scared of us acting like real humans so they don't want you
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:31.080]  to be independent that's what the country's all about is being independent exactly exactly the
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:35.400]  country is about being independent if you want to be taken care of so much they put you in a forced
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:42.360]  labor camp go to north korea i mean i mean what's your message to all these people that think we
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:48.120]  should be slaves of the government well once they try it they won't want it anymore
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:52.760]  you know once you become a slave you won't like it so much
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:58.520]  that's that what's your view on the state of the world right now
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:07.880]  we're in bad shape both we're in real bad shape these these people they don't they think they deserve
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:15.800]  this they think they deserve the world you know why because because they can't because nobody out
[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:21.080]  there is doing anything if you're gonna sit on your laurels you're gonna get taken over that's
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:25.720]  just how the world works that's right you know you're absolutely right i've got the point now
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:30.040]  when yuppies shoot their mouth off to me or try to boss me around i get right back in their face
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:34.760]  not because i even want it but because it's the right thing to do i had some guy bulked me the
