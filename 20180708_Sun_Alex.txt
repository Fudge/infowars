[00:00.000 --> 00:16.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:16.920 --> 00:36.200]  History is unfolding in front of all of us it is Sunday the 8th day of July 2018
[00:36.200 --> 00:43.080]  as we are every Sunday live from 4 to 6 p.m. we are here and I am your host and
[00:43.080 --> 00:46.000]  I'm very honored to be here I tend to try to open the phones up for at least an
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.760]  hour and a half of the two-hour broadcast today because we're overwhelmed
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.400]  with news and and I don't know where to start but I want to get your take on it
[00:54.400 --> 01:04.360]  you know I'm so captivated by the mind situation down that cave in Thailand
[01:04.360 --> 01:08.640]  where they've got the divers going down trying to save the young people there
[01:08.640 --> 01:14.240]  with their coach they've gotten now four out now it's nine out well that just
[01:14.240 --> 01:17.920]  broke minutes ago and look at a few more to get out including their their
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.400]  football coach so that's certainly certainly a very very positive thing but
[01:24.400 --> 01:32.880]  just the way it illustrates if a little girl or little boy is stuck down a well
[01:32.880 --> 01:39.840]  or miners are stuck in a mine collapse or if people are captured underground
[01:39.840 --> 01:45.360]  hemmed in by rising water from floods our humanity comes out and we root for
[01:45.360 --> 01:51.480]  them and we project on to them that they are us but it's little babies getting
[01:51.480 --> 01:56.800]  aborted or it's euthanizing old people or its cancer rates going up because a
[01:56.800 --> 02:00.920]  glyphosate is like so what about humanity you know it gets the highway
[02:00.920 --> 02:07.840]  moving there's too many people but this whole situation with the mine cave-ins
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.440]  we've seen and the gas explosions we've seen and little girls little boys
[02:12.440 --> 02:17.520]  falling down wells and now the situation the cave this illustrates to
[02:17.520 --> 02:23.640]  everybody the value of human life and that we're all in this together and so
[02:23.640 --> 02:28.840]  they've already had one diver die they've got other divers going down two at a
[02:28.840 --> 02:36.400]  time trying to get each child out who's got to then swim out in scuba gear in a
[02:36.400 --> 02:43.280]  cave full of mud and everything else out the surface and I was just reading
[02:43.280 --> 02:45.840]  about it today I mean I've been watching it the last four or five days but I
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.800]  was actually really doing a deep dive no pun intended into what was now
[02:51.800 --> 02:57.040]  currently happening and it just made my head spin because they are way way way
[02:57.040 --> 03:02.360]  way down there and experienced military divers are having big problems ones
[03:02.360 --> 03:05.800]  already died and so that's why they tried to abandon that process when one
[03:05.800 --> 03:08.920]  diver died trying to get down to him and said well let's just wait but they can't
[03:08.920 --> 03:13.400]  because the another monsoon's hit another big rain as they call the Pacific
[03:13.400 --> 03:18.880]  a monsoon turd floaters what we call in Texas so you have this huge storm
[03:18.880 --> 03:22.120]  happening and the water is going back up and so they're having to send people
[03:22.120 --> 03:28.640]  down into this cave reportedly almost a mile in to then try to get these people
[03:28.640 --> 03:32.640]  out it is just crazy and they're inside a big cavern up on the top of a pinnacle
[03:32.640 --> 03:38.120]  of a rock you've been inside in the big caverns around the US mammoth cave or
[03:38.120 --> 03:44.320]  Earl's bad caverns or others there's a huge amphitheater style 10-story tall
[03:44.320 --> 03:50.960]  huge caverns and you can see those big pinnacles those big rocks up at the top
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.720]  they are perched up there with the water rising beyond some Hollywood movie so you
[03:56.720 --> 04:01.880]  see what all that's happening it makes you think about our own planet and where
[04:01.880 --> 04:10.320]  we are and the fact that humanity is all in this together and that valuing human
[04:10.320 --> 04:13.680]  life is certainly where it's all at so we're gonna be looking at all that today
[04:13.680 --> 04:19.360]  the mainstream media has had a big heyday they have come out and said
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.600]  Jones said it was the end of the world on Wednesday but it didn't end because I
[04:23.600 --> 04:26.280]  said the Democrats were calling for civil war they've been escalating their
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.920]  soft civil war and I see that as a demarcation line of when they plan
[04:30.920 --> 04:34.880]  throughout the summer to ramp things up that's what I said was very clear but
[04:34.880 --> 04:38.720]  they use the fact that I said March July 4th is when they're gonna attempt to
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.960]  launch this and then when the hoax that they pushed didn't didn't appear they
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.360]  say I'm discredited it's it's it's simply amazing even though attacks against
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.480]  conservatives libertarians and Christians went into overdrive as you
[04:52.480 --> 05:01.000]  know the last four days will chronicle all of that straight ahead nourish a

[06:59.480 --> 07:08.440]  move bitch get out the way we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the
[07:08.440 --> 07:13.000]  American flag info wars helped to know the rumor that President Obama is an
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.880]  ISIS supporter it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning I will
[07:17.880 --> 07:23.080]  not let you down you'll be very very impressed I hope and I think we'll be
[07:23.080 --> 07:30.680]  speaking a lot this means the Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the
[07:30.680 --> 07:37.280]  United States waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones well Hillary is looking
[07:37.280 --> 07:41.360]  to run again in 2020 we're gonna be looking at that Trump is set to
[07:41.360 --> 07:45.160]  announce a Supreme Court pick very very quickly ahead of the midterms we've got
[07:45.160 --> 07:49.400]  the cave in and the whole situation with the floods in Thailand and what's
[07:49.400 --> 07:52.840]  unfolding there and China's saying they're basically already at war with the
[07:52.840 --> 07:59.480]  US it's all coming up but first Trump's gotten Mueller in his sights for covering
[07:59.480 --> 08:23.080]  up 9-11 here's a breakdown of it all
[08:23.080 --> 08:45.560]  in the case of the FBI's involvement immediately post 9-11 there were these
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.240]  charter flights by Saudi Royals and members of the bin Laden family that
[08:50.240 --> 08:55.280]  left places like Las Vegas where they were holed up in some of their hotels
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.040]  waiting for the dust to settle there are these a playing load literally of
[09:01.040 --> 09:05.840]  Saudis and other folks associated with the bin Laden family that left on this
[09:05.840 --> 09:12.280]  charter flight well as someone who's actually done legal travel or debriefings
[09:12.280 --> 09:19.040]  and even talking to folks who have been refugees or emigres from other
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.920]  countries those Saudis are precisely the sort of people who should have been
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.400]  debriefed at length by the FBI and frankly other intelligence services as
[09:29.400 --> 09:33.840]  well to build that network and to outline who knew who and what the
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.320]  associations were absolutely critical immediately fire following 9-11 and so
[09:39.320 --> 09:45.320]  was that done the answer is no and so this kid glove treatment was given and
[09:45.320 --> 09:53.720]  I hang that directly around the neck of mr. Mueller that's a really a disgraceful
[09:53.720 --> 09:59.640]  failure immediately after 9-11 because we know that these people had contacts
[09:59.640 --> 10:03.040]  and friends or friends and those sorts of things it all should have been exploited
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.640]  and it wasn't the government wants to be in charge I mean when Reagan said we're
[10:07.640 --> 10:10.600]  a country with a government I think we're now a government with a country and
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.600]  that's when all of the things that are happening are only tightening that
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.320]  control on the people they're gonna manipulate them and and keep as long as
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.000]  they can keep them uninformed and nobody realizes what's going on or they
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.320]  don't see the threat if they say you have nothing if you've done nothing wrong
[10:27.320 --> 10:30.800]  you have nothing to hide first of all that's a great quote from Joseph
[10:30.800 --> 10:35.720]  Gerbils and secondly that's totally irrelevant if we had had this program in
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.240]  place at the time we would have been able to identify that particular telephone
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.560]  number in San Diego I'm almost out of time I understand but I ask indulgence
[10:44.560 --> 10:48.240]  just to finish because it's a critical point as to why we have this program and
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.560]  how important it is all right if we had the telephone number from Yemen we
[10:53.560 --> 10:56.520]  would have matched it up to that telephone number in San Diego got
[10:56.520 --> 11:02.920]  further legal process identified Al Mithar one last point the 9-11
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.960]  Commission itself indicated that investigations or interrogations of
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.600]  Al Mithar once he was identified could have yielded event evidence of
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.320]  connections to other participants participants in 9-11 plot the
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.800]  simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan in any case the
[11:19.800 --> 11:25.120]  opportunity was not there well if we had had this program that opportunity would
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.520]  have been there who is special counsel Robert Mueller is he the
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.240]  upstanding career law enforcement officers the establishment would lead you
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.160]  to believe or is Robert Mueller a dirty fix it man for the corrupt
[11:36.160 --> 11:41.520]  authoritarians lurking behind the DC power structure after well over a year
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.440]  now of enduring the tainting of the executive office with a DNC funded
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.880]  bogus investigation President Trump is revisiting concerns he made about 9-11
[11:51.880 --> 11:58.680]  during his candidacy obviously the war in Iraq was a big fat mistake all right
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.600]  now you can take it anywhere you want and it took jet it took Jeb Bush if you
[12:03.600 --> 12:06.200]  remember at the beginning of his announcement when he announced the
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.280]  president took him five days he went back it was the mistake it wasn't a
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.680]  mistake took him five days before his people told him what to say and he
[12:14.680 --> 12:19.640]  ultimately said it was a mistake all to go world trade center came down the
[12:19.640 --> 12:28.800]  brother brother my mother that's not keeping a lottery when I was born 63
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.440]  years ago looked up and I saw my mom mom my mom is the strongest woman I know
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.280]  she's just a lot of Trump wants a deep state to know that the gloves are off
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.040]  he's going to war he was always gonna release this later on the anyways
[12:40.040 --> 12:47.680]  Bush's Clintons criminal elements the CIA all of you this is just the beginning
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.920]  with Mueller's cover-up this is the piece of string on the sweater that pulls
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.160]  the whole sweater apart it's beginning it was Mueller that signed off on
[12:56.160 --> 13:01.120]  hindering the investigations launched by the families of victims of 9-11 huge
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.800]  body of evidence that Saudi government officials prepared for the hijackers
[13:06.800 --> 13:13.200]  arrival helped them got them money English lessons right you know I helped
[13:13.200 --> 13:18.880]  them and provided the aid they need more surveillance they protected impossible
[13:18.880 --> 13:24.320]  according to the FBI agents were working the case for the terrorists to
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.240]  succeed and president Bush and director Mueller instead of my life from looking at
[13:31.240 --> 13:36.280]  letting the FBI go public the whole story yeah quashed it interrogations were
[13:36.280 --> 13:42.560]  shut down duty documents have been kept secret and the reason we are here and
[13:42.560 --> 13:49.000]  our plea mother and we split in Epstein as a black male over the Trump is to
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.600]  declassify the documents people need to know more about mr. Mueller he is not
[13:55.600 --> 14:00.600]  the white knight that Lindsey Graham and others in the mainstream media have a
[14:00.600 --> 14:08.760]  portrait his role during and after the 9-11 matter needs to be examined it was
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.320]  Mueller that acted as a counter crime boss during the Whitey Bulger court
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.360]  drama and Mueller just like Whitey Bulger could kill whoever he wanted killed
[14:17.360 --> 14:23.320]  reportedly over 100 people run mafia operations in Boston assassinate members
[14:23.320 --> 14:29.120]  of other mafias the FBI wanted taken out the FBI was operating as a gang in
[14:29.120 --> 14:33.680]  Boston Robert Fitzpatrick is seen here leaving federal court this afternoon
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.200]  after changing his plea to guilty on a 12 count indictment for perjury and
[14:38.200 --> 14:42.160]  obstruction of justice the former assistant special agent in charge of the
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.960]  FBI's Boston office who was in charge of the organized crime program testified
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.000]  for the defense three years ago in the trial of James Whitey Bulger at the
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.640]  time Fitzpatrick made at least six false claims on the witness stand it was
[14:55.640 --> 15:00.200]  Mueller that allowed Pito Jeffrey Epstein to serve minimum sentencing for
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.400]  overseeing a sex exploitation ring of underage females that should have
[15:04.400 --> 15:09.680]  easily implicated several high-profile individuals instead the FBI worked to
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.720]  deal with Epstein as an informant and then buried the investigation and wouldn't
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.600]  it be interesting if it's none other than Mueller now conjuring up dirt on one

[21:10.760 --> 21:18.840]  Republicans until Dems return to sanity and honesty the whole hashtag just walk
[21:18.840 --> 21:24.760]  away movement gained steam and I believe it's a real movement because I see it on
[21:24.760 --> 21:30.000]  the ground where Democrats come up to me black white Hispanic old young Asian you
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.640]  name it and they say I used to be a Democrat but I can see the corruption I
[21:34.640 --> 21:38.400]  could see the anti-Americanism I can see the anti-free speech these people are
[21:38.400 --> 21:43.800]  crazy I'm a Republican now well I was ever a Republican or Democrat but we've
[21:43.800 --> 21:47.280]  taken over the Republican Party at least partially kick the blue bloods out
[21:47.280 --> 21:52.200]  but the Democrats you got something even worse so yes we're trying to make
[21:52.200 --> 21:59.000]  America great again right now and it's very very very exciting now that said we
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.360]  just tuned in I played a compilation of the news reports about the incredible
[22:04.360 --> 22:11.720]  corruption of the special counsel appointed by the president mr. Rosenstein
[22:11.720 --> 22:16.320]  the president doesn't matter we elected the real president's Rosenstein and then
[22:16.320 --> 22:23.880]  his puppet that follows his orders Jeff Sessions and so they're coming out
[22:23.880 --> 22:27.760]  saying all this dirt's coming out all this proof of Russia gay all this
[22:27.760 --> 22:30.880]  corruption blah blah blah of course none of it's ever there meanwhile we have
[22:30.880 --> 22:34.000]  them all caught red-handed in their own texts their own messages their own
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.680]  payments Hillary giving McCabe's wife a half million wives of husbands at the
[22:39.680 --> 22:46.160]  FBI craig the fake piss gate dossier getting millions it is incredible and
[22:46.160 --> 22:50.520]  you've got Giuliani and others coming out saying that Mueller is leading the most
[22:50.520 --> 22:54.280]  corrupt investigation he's ever seen well there might have been corrupt
[22:54.280 --> 22:59.800]  investigations before but this is the most transparent the most out the open
[22:59.800 --> 23:04.240]  corruption because what do they think's gonna happen anybody who can rub two
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.200]  brain cells together knows this is political and knows it's a fraud and
[23:08.200 --> 23:12.640]  knows that Trump's not in bed with the Russians and his pro-america so where
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.840]  do they go after this we'll talk about it but first here's a clip the reality is
[23:17.840 --> 23:22.920]  that there are biases that have to be explored surrounding Mueller how you how
[23:22.920 --> 23:27.360]  you could end up hiring a group of people that are as as prejudiced and
[23:27.360 --> 23:31.760]  biased as this group in their record at least is extraordinary and then how you
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.360]  can expect us to just walk up our kind of like a lamb going to the slaughter
[23:36.360 --> 23:41.160]  we wouldn't be lawyers if we were doing he was he George he wants to testify he
[23:41.160 --> 23:44.680]  believes like to believe that anymore miss mayor well it is hard to believe
[23:44.680 --> 23:47.920]  given all the things that have been shown about how tainted this investigation
[23:47.920 --> 23:51.480]  is this is the most corrupt investigation I have ever seen that the
[23:51.480 --> 23:54.680]  just problem is allowing to go forward I've never seen an investigation with
[23:54.680 --> 24:00.480]  texts from FBI agents now seven of them that have such extraordinary bias against
[24:00.480 --> 24:04.240]  the person's predated Robert Mueller well that's but that's the investigation he
[24:04.240 --> 24:07.360]  inherited with a lot of the testimony that he inherited and then he went ahead
[24:07.360 --> 24:11.160]  and didn't do anything to purge himself of that he fired him he fired him after
[24:11.160 --> 24:15.360]  somebody else found out well how about looking at the text of all of his people
[24:15.360 --> 24:20.040]  does his number two guys number three guys number four guy have similar texts
[24:20.040 --> 24:24.080]  in which they're talking about much they hate Trump I don't know and you've got
[24:24.080 --> 24:29.080]  Stefanophilus the operative of the Clintons sitting there acting like he's
[24:29.080 --> 24:35.280]  all impartial Robert Mueller and that whole operation continued on what the
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.920]  Justice Department had set up and they were continuing what had been set up to
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.400]  stop Trump during the campaign to cover their ass because now their job was two
[24:46.400 --> 24:50.200]  fold not just try to keep Trump from getting an office or keep from getting
[24:50.200 --> 24:56.040]  elected before that or kick Trump out of office later it was cover up spy gate
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.280]  and make spy gate Russia gate that they had thought that Hillary would win and
[25:01.280 --> 25:08.680]  that they could then try to cover that up by a new investigation used as a
[25:08.680 --> 25:14.040]  smoke screen so here's Rudy Giuliani the president's lawyer breaking that down
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.680]  saying Mueller needs to provide factual basis to interview the president I've
[25:19.680 --> 25:23.640]  told you for over a year he shouldn't talk to Mueller he shouldn't talk to any
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.000]  of these crooks they're jokes he could fire all of them it's the executive
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.920]  branch but they created this idea in the media they oh you don't follow Mueller
[25:30.920 --> 25:36.360]  he's our president we elected him and the president's probably intelligently
[25:36.360 --> 25:41.200]  just left him there letting him rot but they get more and more and more desperate
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.720]  so here's the president's lawyer well you had said that the 4th of July was
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.720]  basically a deadline of sorts for you to determine whether or not you would
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.320]  recommend President Trump sit down with Robert Mueller it is now past the 4th
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.080]  of July where do we stand well I think we're pretty much decided where we are
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.440]  and we await the decision of the independent counsel we we would not
[26:06.440 --> 26:10.200]  recommend an interview for the president unless they can satisfy us that
[26:10.200 --> 26:16.440]  there's some some a basis for this investigation it's our it's our firm
[26:16.440 --> 26:21.320]  beliefs and we think nothing contradicts this the president did nothing wrong and
[26:21.320 --> 26:26.400]  all the leaking that's gone on there's been no leak of any fact that says the
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.960]  president conspired with anybody in Russia I know from having been on the
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.520]  campaign that there was no contact with Russians no discussion with Russians so
[26:35.520 --> 26:39.200]  we've got to see something I mean something started this investigation I
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.480]  don't just investigate my next-door neighbor because I think he may be
[26:42.480 --> 26:45.800]  committing the crime I've got it in order to get an investigation going I've
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.760]  got to give the police of the FBI some kind of probable cause and there isn't
[26:50.760 --> 26:55.840]  any and when we've asked him for it going back to John Dowd yeah they've
[26:55.840 --> 27:00.080]  given us nothing and I think you can see John's opinion now is very much like
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.440]  ours that the president shouldn't be interviewed because John is unfortunately
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.640]  come to the conclusion what that this is a witch hunt and an attempt to trap him
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.000]  in perjury we just had to I just when I previewed our introduced our segment we
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.040]  had the the Senate Intelligence Committee they've already they come out
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.000]  with their first conclusion they've got more to come when it comes to collusion
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.520]  they haven't made a determine on on the collusion aspect of things but it's a
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.880]  fact in their minds that Russia interfered and attempted to help the
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.320]  president how is that not a compelling enough reason for mr. Mueller to want
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.480]  to question the president well because there's no evidence that links the
[27:36.480 --> 27:40.960]  president to that that's I mean that's a heck of a thing to people can have all
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.440]  kinds of stuff right there you've got a hundred and seventy plus countries during
[27:46.440 --> 27:49.560]  any big campaign there's all sorts of companies and bots and internet companies
[27:49.560 --> 27:52.560]  you can hire do stuff per not any percent of the bots out of Russia or for
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.080]  Hillary so again that's a red herring too but you've got Chuck Todd the
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.800]  Democratic Party operative the butt boy of Obama up there going well Mueller says
[28:03.800 --> 28:09.280]  this well Mueller said that they don't like the election of Trump these people
[28:09.280 --> 28:14.360]  sold us out to Russia with uranium one and communist China Trump's America first
[28:14.360 --> 28:17.600]  and you can see the country coming back and that's the big problem they've got
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.160]  is the country's coming back people know the truth and that's why they're so
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.280]  angry that's why they're so upset that's why they don't know what to do because
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.760]  these are the anti-americans they're the guys on tape saying flyover country we
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.560]  hate gun owners we hate Christians all this crap and all these Democratic
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.720]  party people they got running for office then like are running against white
[28:37.720 --> 28:43.720]  people that it's the opposite of Martin Luther King it's incredible so wow okay
[28:43.720 --> 28:49.080]  when we come back China you know a billion quarter million people they say
[28:49.080 --> 28:53.160]  they're already at war with the US and they love Hillary they love Chuck Todd
[28:53.160 --> 29:02.640]  and they hate you this 4th of July is special everybody can see it they can
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.280]  feel it the globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their
[29:07.280 --> 29:11.600]  tyranny and America yet again is at the heart of the resistance the globalist
[29:11.600 --> 29:15.840]  that's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think
[29:15.840 --> 29:18.960]  about info wars now more than ever and what would the world be like if info
[29:18.960 --> 29:22.800]  wars wasn't there resisting the globalist what would have happened if you
[29:22.800 --> 29:26.360]  hadn't supported info wars we would not be having the victories we have today so
[29:26.360 --> 29:29.760]  yes a lot of good things are happening but the enemy is striking back so please

[32:13.400 --> 32:18.480]  passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[32:18.480 --> 32:22.440]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[32:22.440 --> 32:27.120]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[32:27.120 --> 32:31.360]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the
[32:31.360 --> 32:35.840]  fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[32:35.840 --> 32:40.920]  seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[32:40.920 --> 32:45.000]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[32:45.000 --> 32:49.480]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and

[33:58.680 --> 34:01.480]  We are controlled by the media.
[34:01.480 --> 34:03.320]  Today it all changes.
[34:03.320 --> 34:06.040]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[34:06.040 --> 34:07.120]  It is a choice.
[34:07.120 --> 34:09.080]  Just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[34:09.080 --> 34:11.280]  Einstein says the depth of insanity
[34:11.280 --> 34:13.920]  is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[34:13.920 --> 34:15.560]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you,

[34:31.560 --> 34:33.040]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[34:33.040 --> 34:34.720]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[34:34.720 --> 34:35.760]  They say Trump's crazy.

[34:36.800 --> 34:39.160]  But I'm here to show love.
[34:39.160 --> 34:40.280]  It's a bigger plan.
[34:40.280 --> 34:42.960]  And I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.400]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[34:48.400 --> 34:51.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[34:51.960 --> 34:56.960]  For me, it's totally insane that Hillary Clinton
[35:02.600 --> 35:05.960]  is still sending out emails to her constituents,
[35:05.960 --> 35:08.400]  to her zombie-like supporters,
[35:08.400 --> 35:11.200]  implying that she's the leader of the Democratic Party
[35:11.200 --> 35:16.200]  and that she might even run coming up in about the next year
[35:16.200 --> 35:18.240]  because that's when the campaign starts.
[35:18.240 --> 35:21.680]  It's about two years out, year and a half out,
[35:21.680 --> 35:25.360]  that she might even run for president against Trump again.
[35:27.160 --> 35:29.520]  But then I pull back and I go, wait a minute,
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.400]  she ran before when she'd had a brain tumor,
[35:35.400 --> 35:37.520]  when she'd been in the hospital for a year,
[35:37.520 --> 35:40.280]  when she was having convulsions all the time.
[35:40.280 --> 35:43.400]  You were told by the Secret Service at the RNC,
[35:43.400 --> 35:44.240]  just follow her.
[35:44.240 --> 35:45.840]  She's got a black ambulance.
[35:45.840 --> 35:48.800]  She's having convulsions every 45 minutes
[35:48.800 --> 35:50.440]  when she's not under drugs.
[35:50.440 --> 35:53.240]  They gotta take her off the drugs so she can even talk.
[35:55.440 --> 35:58.400]  But then because she's off the drugs
[35:58.400 --> 36:00.240]  that suppress your neurons,
[36:00.240 --> 36:03.960]  that suppress brain activity, she then has the convulsions.
[36:05.280 --> 36:06.680]  And she either take a bunch of pills
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.400]  or drink a bottle of whiskey and not have convulsions,
[36:08.400 --> 36:09.600]  but then she's not on.
[36:09.600 --> 36:13.040]  So to be on, she's got a get sober.
[36:13.040 --> 36:14.120]  Imagine the hell of that.
[36:14.120 --> 36:17.240]  She gets sober a few hours a day.
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.520]  They roll her out.
[36:20.840 --> 36:23.480]  They've got to have emergency tents all around her.
[36:23.480 --> 36:25.120]  We caught her, Millie Weaver caught her,
[36:25.120 --> 36:28.600]  getting rushed into a emergency tent two weeks before
[36:28.600 --> 36:29.880]  she collapsed in New York.
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.360]  And you look at her emails, the New York Post reports on it.
[36:36.360 --> 36:37.480]  She's telling her constituent,
[36:37.480 --> 36:39.960]  she's the leader of the Democratic Party.
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.080]  I guess a close second, it's Maxine Waters and
[36:46.680 --> 36:49.560]  that lunatic Nancy Pelosi and nothing against women.
[36:49.560 --> 36:50.720]  I'd love to have a woman president,
[36:50.720 --> 36:53.480]  but she's got to be pro-America, pro-free market,
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.280]  not these crazy, entitled, never had a free market job,
[36:58.280 --> 37:02.200]  run around, try to create culture war, sex war, race war.
[37:02.200 --> 37:04.120]  Good God.
[37:04.120 --> 37:05.960]  It just boggles the mind.
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.160]  But you say, well, that's crazy.
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.480]  She'd never run.
[37:12.480 --> 37:13.320]  Everybody hates her.
[37:13.320 --> 37:14.320]  She's been rejected.
[37:16.360 --> 37:18.760]  She was co-governor in Arkansas.
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.960]  She was co-president with Bill Clinton for eight years.
[37:22.960 --> 37:24.880]  Under Obama, they admitted that she was basically
[37:24.880 --> 37:26.920]  co-president, running the State Department.
[37:26.920 --> 37:28.960]  That's just as important as the presidency itself,
[37:28.960 --> 37:30.560]  if the president isn't involved.
[37:30.560 --> 37:35.160]  So, she was in four terms.
[37:35.160 --> 37:41.360]  You ever heard of anybody, not even Roosevelt.
[37:41.360 --> 37:44.360]  Well, he died at the beginning of his fourth term.
[37:44.360 --> 37:47.760]  Or was it the end of his third, I forget.
[37:47.760 --> 37:48.760]  Can we look that up?
[37:48.760 --> 37:50.960]  How many terms did Roosevelt serve?
[37:50.960 --> 37:52.960]  I think he died at the end of the third,
[37:52.960 --> 37:54.160]  but he'd won a fourth.
[37:54.160 --> 38:02.360]  So, Hillary has served more terms as deputy president
[38:02.360 --> 38:09.760]  or co-presidents, the word, even Washington Post admits it.
[38:09.760 --> 38:11.160]  Look at that.
[38:11.160 --> 38:15.560]  So, it just never ends.
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.560]  And you said to yourself, this crazy woman,
[38:19.560 --> 38:22.760]  this corrupt person that her own party doesn't like,
[38:22.760 --> 38:24.960]  it doesn't matter, she still runs it.
[38:24.960 --> 38:27.760]  She's got that foundation with the billions of dollars
[38:27.760 --> 38:28.760]  she's milked.
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.360]  There it is, seeing and reporting another run.
[38:32.360 --> 38:33.960]  Hillary Clinton tries again.
[38:33.960 --> 38:38.760]  God, we are going to take back the country.
[38:38.760 --> 38:40.560]  We love Hillary Clinton.
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.560]  This woman in tapes that have been linked,
[38:43.560 --> 38:47.160]  that have been leaked out, hates America.
[38:47.160 --> 38:51.160]  She got to ask herself, where is the end of this?
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.160]  I'm going to open the phones up to talk about this
[38:55.160 --> 38:57.160]  and other big issues.
[38:57.160 --> 39:00.160]  The toll-free number to join us on any issue you want to discuss,
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.160]  but I just want you to be first-time callers.
[39:02.160 --> 39:05.160]  Please be honest about that and have a good telephone.
[39:05.160 --> 39:06.160]  I want to talk to you.
[39:06.160 --> 39:12.160]  I really love you to call 877-789-ALLAX, 877-789-2539.
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.160]  877-789-2539.
[39:16.160 --> 39:17.160]  And we'll talk about that.
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.160]  We'll talk about the Democrats announcing Civil War
[39:20.160 --> 39:27.160]  and then Rob Reiner, Michael Moore, Bill Maher,
[39:27.160 --> 39:29.160]  all of them, and then I go,
[39:29.160 --> 39:31.160]  oh, look, they say we're in a Civil War.
[39:31.160 --> 39:32.160]  You crazy person.
[39:32.160 --> 39:33.160]  There's no Civil War.
[39:33.160 --> 39:35.160]  You crazy right-wing son of a bastard.
[39:39.160 --> 39:42.160]  Okay, we're going to discuss that.
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.160]  We're going to discuss all of it at 877-789-2539.
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.160]  But I know we're taking control of our government again.
[39:51.160 --> 39:55.160]  I know we're taking control of our republic again.
[39:55.160 --> 39:57.160]  And that's what's exciting to me.
[39:57.160 --> 40:00.160]  Now, this subject is really big.
[40:00.160 --> 40:02.160]  And I don't say this to be dramatic
[40:02.160 --> 40:05.160]  because I know the White House and the president
[40:05.160 --> 40:07.160]  are quietly trying to fix this
[40:07.160 --> 40:09.160]  because they don't want to rattle confidence
[40:09.160 --> 40:11.160]  and they don't want to sound too extreme
[40:11.160 --> 40:14.160]  because reality is so extreme.
[40:14.160 --> 40:17.160]  But in my own concern,
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.160]  I've reached out to some folks and said,
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.160]  should I say all this because it's what I really think,
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.160]  but I don't want to, like, rattle the confidence in the country
[40:26.160 --> 40:28.160]  and I don't hold back on stuff
[40:28.160 --> 40:30.160]  and I don't want to really go with my hardcore info.
[40:30.160 --> 40:32.160]  And I've been told by a lot of folks, they go,
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.160]  no, you're dead on.
[40:33.160 --> 40:35.160]  Fire at will.
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.160]  And people say, oh, my God, you're this government shill.
[40:38.160 --> 40:39.160]  You've always been against the government
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.160]  because our government was run by foreign banks.
[40:41.160 --> 40:44.160]  We see a beachhead, our government partially controlled
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.160]  by American patriots now.
[40:46.160 --> 40:50.160]  So I'm proud to say that I'm reaching out to smart people
[40:50.160 --> 40:52.160]  and trying to coordinate somehow.
[40:52.160 --> 40:55.160]  Hell, you know, the Democrats are coordinating.
[40:58.160 --> 41:00.160]  And I've said, listen, I can see the office
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.160]  of personal management hack, our entire government database.
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.160]  All our operatives overseas domestically, their families,
[41:07.160 --> 41:09.160]  our codes, our shields, everything.
[41:09.160 --> 41:10.160]  Yeah, you're right, it was done on purpose.
[41:10.160 --> 41:12.160]  I see the industrial cell and everything,
[41:12.160 --> 41:13.160]  which they admit some purpose.
[41:13.160 --> 41:14.160]  Yeah, you're right.
[41:14.160 --> 41:16.160]  I see it all.
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.160]  What do we do to turn this around?
[41:19.160 --> 41:22.160]  And the answer I get back is, well, what do you think we do?
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.160]  I mean, I think we have to admit how far we've slid.
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.160]  And I think it's really the Achilles heel of the globalist
[41:32.160 --> 41:35.160]  that if we just detail how we got infiltrated
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.160]  and what happened and turn it around,
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.160]  people will listen and take action.
[41:41.160 --> 41:42.160]  Because it's the truth.
[41:42.160 --> 41:44.160]  And, you know, I'm not Machiavelli.
[41:44.160 --> 41:47.160]  Man, I can see in the Machiavelli systems,
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.160]  but I'm a straight shooter.
[41:49.160 --> 41:51.160]  I've always found that's what feels good in my gut.
[41:51.160 --> 41:52.160]  It's what works.
[41:52.160 --> 41:53.160]  It's just who I am.
[41:53.160 --> 41:56.160]  You know, they think I'm a schmuck because I'm a straight shooter.
[41:56.160 --> 41:58.160]  You know what?
[41:59.160 --> 42:02.160]  Straight shooting is the fourth, fifth dimensional chess.
[42:02.160 --> 42:03.160]  Everybody talks about it.
[42:03.160 --> 42:06.160]  Everybody just keeps thinking being a BSer works.
[42:06.160 --> 42:08.160]  Only when you've got an honorable society
[42:08.160 --> 42:11.160]  that trusts a few traders and doesn't know they're against them.
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.160]  Just because cancer spreads through the body doesn't mean it's dominant.
[42:15.160 --> 42:17.160]  Just because you guys cheat doesn't mean like,
[42:17.160 --> 42:18.160]  oh, we must all do that.
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.160]  That's the, no, that's how you collapse a civilization.
[42:21.160 --> 42:23.160]  It's how you collapse the planet.
[42:23.160 --> 42:26.160]  So when we come back,
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.160]  I'm gonna just, I mean, I'm gonna lay out the facts here.
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.160]  It's as best as I can tell you about what we face,
[42:31.160 --> 42:33.160]  who our enemies are and what we're up against.
[42:33.160 --> 42:34.160]  And it's bad.
[42:34.160 --> 42:36.160]  I mean, we are like way behind, actually.
[42:36.160 --> 42:39.160]  The fact that you think Trump's in there and everything.
[42:39.160 --> 42:42.160]  And the way everybody's against Trump.
[42:42.160 --> 42:44.160]  Who are these followers?
[42:44.160 --> 42:46.160]  God, they ought to be praying Trump succeeds.
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.160]  They're just such pathetic followers, though.
[42:49.160 --> 42:52.160]  And it's not the followers fault that they did this.
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.160]  It's our fault as leaders that we didn't see the problem in face.
[42:55.160 --> 43:05.160]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[43:26.160 --> 43:28.160]  What we learned was that there was, in fact,
[43:28.160 --> 43:32.160]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.160]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[43:36.160 --> 43:39.160]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[43:39.160 --> 43:43.160]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[43:48.160 --> 43:52.160]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[43:52.160 --> 43:54.160]  can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.160]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.160 --> 44:01.160]  I want to plow into all of this.
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.160]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,
[44:04.160 --> 44:09.160]  just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.160]  or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material

[47:26.160 --> 47:42.160]  Well, Hillary Clinton is sending out feelers to her supporters
[47:42.160 --> 47:44.160]  via email, the New York Post is reporting it,
[47:44.160 --> 47:46.160]  considering and testing a 2020 run.
[47:46.160 --> 47:48.160]  Well, of course she is.
[47:48.160 --> 47:52.160]  Even if she doesn't run, she wants to keep getting those campaign contributions,
[47:52.160 --> 47:58.160]  including money into her corrupt money laundering operation known as her foundation.
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.160]  So it's totally sick and just shows how delusional
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.160]  and disconnected from reality the establishment is.
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.160]  But if we buy into their hoax, well, then it's our fault, isn't it?
[48:10.160 --> 48:12.160]  We're going to start the next hour hearing about ten minutes
[48:12.160 --> 48:14.160]  and go to already loaded phone lines.
[48:14.160 --> 48:16.160]  I may even get to some during this segment,
[48:16.160 --> 48:20.160]  but if you just joined us,
[48:20.160 --> 48:22.160]  we're back under the Clintons,
[48:22.160 --> 48:24.160]  how they were selling out our missile secrets
[48:24.160 --> 48:28.160]  for our intercontinental ballistic missiles to communist China.
[48:28.160 --> 48:36.160]  And I remember myself and Washington Times writers and others,
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.160]  Drudge, you name it, were reporting on the Clintons with communist
[48:40.160 --> 48:42.160]  Chinese generals in the White House and all of it,
[48:42.160 --> 48:48.160]  and the sellout by Laurel Hughes to them with Merve technology.
[48:48.160 --> 48:50.160]  That's the reentry device.
[48:50.160 --> 48:52.160]  It's one thing to put a missile up into orbit.
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.160]  Another thing to get it going is trajectory over from China over the North Pole to the U.S.
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.160]  But it's another thing to get it to come back into the atmosphere
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.160]  and have the nose cone pop open and have a dozen dummy warheads
[49:04.160 --> 49:06.160]  and maybe a dozen other real warheads
[49:06.160 --> 49:09.160]  so that when they try to shoot those down, they don't get them all.
[49:09.160 --> 49:12.160]  That's multiple reentry device, Merve technology.
[49:12.160 --> 49:15.160]  So from the boost, the first stage boost,
[49:15.160 --> 49:20.160]  second stage boost, reentry to Merve technology,
[49:20.160 --> 49:23.160]  the Clintonistas gave them everything,
[49:23.160 --> 49:26.160]  like they gave them our jobs, our businesses, our industry,
[49:26.160 --> 49:31.160]  our security codes, the Panama Canal, all the major deepwater ports.
[49:31.160 --> 49:36.160]  Hillary is a globalist operative put in there to do that.
[49:36.160 --> 49:38.160]  And then the media spun it.
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.160]  Are attacks on China anti-Asian?
[49:42.160 --> 49:47.160]  No, it's China under Mao that killed 84 million of their own people,
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.160]  according to the Chinese Communist CIA says 65 million.
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.160]  It's their own system that sells political dissidents organs.
[49:55.160 --> 50:01.160]  So when you talk about a billion, 500 million people,
[50:01.160 --> 50:06.160]  genetically the same but oppressed by the communist elite,
[50:06.160 --> 50:08.160]  there's not the racism there.
[50:08.160 --> 50:11.160]  There's the classism of the party where there is no class.
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.160]  That's unintended under communism.
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.160]  And so they're doing all this and the Communist Chinese come out in Bloomberg
[50:19.160 --> 50:22.160]  and the Sunday Express, and I've got the articles right here.
[50:22.160 --> 50:30.160]  Let's do a camera shot of that saying we're already at war with the United States.
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.160]  We're already economically, you read the leaked memos that the PLA put out on purpose.
[50:35.160 --> 50:37.160]  And they say we've already got their industry.
[50:37.160 --> 50:40.160]  We've already got the rare earth minerals, 98%.
[50:40.160 --> 50:44.160]  We already got our military under these companies as front people in all these nations.
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.160]  We're ready to cut the U.S. off economically.
[50:46.160 --> 50:51.160]  We're ready to foment economic warfare and cultural warfare in South America.
[50:51.160 --> 50:53.160]  We're ready to bring the U.S. down.
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.160]  And man, it's in the news that China now controls Hollywood.
[50:57.160 --> 51:02.160]  China has a $900 billion trade deficit with us.
[51:02.160 --> 51:06.160]  And Trump says a year ago, give us 50 billion.
[51:06.160 --> 51:08.160]  Did you show you have some sign?
[51:08.160 --> 51:11.160]  China, you're investing $24 billion a year in us.
[51:11.160 --> 51:14.160]  We invest $900 billion in you.
[51:14.160 --> 51:17.160]  I want to see some Chinese factories in the U.S. show me something.
[51:17.160 --> 51:20.160]  Over a year ago, he met with them in Marlago.
[51:20.160 --> 51:23.160]  And the Communist Chinese dictator, he's a dictator.
[51:23.160 --> 51:26.160]  He wasn't elected by the people.
[51:26.160 --> 51:29.160]  He said, we're going to war with you.
[51:29.160 --> 51:34.160]  And we've built all these artificial islands that will invade the South China Sea
[51:34.160 --> 51:41.160]  and we'll take over all these different areas, right where the Japanese did.
[51:41.160 --> 51:42.160]  Philippines, you name it.
[51:42.160 --> 51:45.160]  I mean, this is crazy.
[51:45.160 --> 51:53.160]  And if you study geopolitical systems, everything done to America since the 70s
[51:53.160 --> 51:56.160]  by the policy wonks, presidents for mainly puppets until Trump came along,
[51:56.160 --> 52:03.160]  has been 100% strategically to shell the United States out.
[52:03.160 --> 52:06.160]  Yeah, there's the Guardian, dictator for life.
[52:06.160 --> 52:08.160]  They have debates about, well, there's a dictator.
[52:08.160 --> 52:11.160]  The Politburo and the Central Committee vote a couple hundred people
[52:11.160 --> 52:14.160]  that are all billionaire communists and then they put the asshole in there.
[52:14.160 --> 52:16.160]  Excuse me, delete that.
[52:16.160 --> 52:17.160]  Delete that.
[52:17.160 --> 52:20.160]  I mean, he's beyond the name I just called him.
[52:20.160 --> 52:22.160]  He's a mass murderer.
[52:22.160 --> 52:26.160]  And he's taking China back to where Mao had it.
[52:26.160 --> 52:31.160]  So you read this, U.S. and China have bigger problems than trade war, Bloomberg,
[52:31.160 --> 52:33.160]  and it gets into the military war.
[52:33.160 --> 52:39.160]  China's military reforms to win a war, but you actually read the memo I read last Friday
[52:39.160 --> 52:41.160]  and it says we're already winning.
[52:41.160 --> 52:42.160]  We've already encircled them.
[52:42.160 --> 52:43.160]  We're already controlling their people.
[52:43.160 --> 52:44.160]  They're all divided.
[52:44.160 --> 52:45.160]  Americans are weak.
[52:45.160 --> 52:49.160]  So when you sit there and you see a Democrat or you see a leftist that hates
[52:49.160 --> 52:52.160]  flyover country or hates Christians or hates Trump,
[52:52.160 --> 53:01.160]  Trump could be criticized for only asking China.
[53:01.160 --> 53:04.160]  I hate to use a vulgar analogy, but when they work, you've got to use them.
[53:04.160 --> 53:09.160]  You know, full metal jacket and you've got Sergeant Hartman talking to him.
[53:09.160 --> 53:12.160]  And he says, you're the type of guy that'll do something to the other guy,
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.160]  not even give him a reach around.
[53:14.160 --> 53:19.160]  I mean, all Trump did was asked for a reach around.
[53:19.160 --> 53:24.160]  And China said, no man, you're going to give us everything dirtbag Americans
[53:24.160 --> 53:27.160]  and you're going to get nothing back.
[53:27.160 --> 53:37.160]  That's Trump's like, okay, there's a 290% tariff on all dairy to Canada
[53:37.160 --> 53:40.160]  for 30 something years, hundreds of billions.
[53:40.160 --> 53:41.160]  No.
[53:41.160 --> 53:45.160]  And Canada so used to us being on our back or on our knees.
[53:45.160 --> 53:48.160]  They start flipping out going, we got trannies.
[53:48.160 --> 53:49.160]  We're for gaze.
[53:49.160 --> 53:52.160]  And Trump goes, okay, great, I understand that.
[53:52.160 --> 53:57.160]  What about the 200% tariff on dairy?
[53:57.160 --> 54:01.160]  And then our own media gangs up like Trump's bad.
[54:01.160 --> 54:03.160]  So let me explain.
[54:03.160 --> 54:08.160]  I go into a business deal and you tell me, you get everything,
[54:08.160 --> 54:14.160]  I get nothing, even though I hold all the cards.
[54:14.160 --> 54:16.160]  And that's the thing about Trump.
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.160]  He's just not anti-American, psychotically anti-American.
[54:20.160 --> 54:22.160]  How did we ever get an elite that did this?
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.160]  Because America had 55% of the wealth in 1952.
[54:28.160 --> 54:30.160]  Look it up.
[54:30.160 --> 54:34.160]  And these elites went, my God, we can parlay this in total control,
[54:34.160 --> 54:36.160]  but to get people to go along with it,
[54:36.160 --> 54:38.160]  we've got to create an anti-American ideology.
[54:38.160 --> 54:42.160]  We've got to get people to signal their traders and be anti-Americans.
[54:42.160 --> 54:43.160]  We can trust them to do this.
[54:43.160 --> 54:47.160]  Because you've got to really be a scumbag to want to bankrupt
[54:47.160 --> 54:49.160]  your granddaddy that's a farmer.
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.160]  Or to want to hurt steel workers in Cleveland.
[54:53.160 --> 55:00.160]  Or to just have a raging, you know what, to screw America.
[55:00.160 --> 55:04.160]  But that's what the colleges and the schools,
[55:04.160 --> 55:10.160]  and it's just all like, wow, we were so close.
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.160]  And we're probably like a patient that kind of rallies in surgery,
[55:14.160 --> 55:15.160]  but still dies.
[55:15.160 --> 55:18.160]  I've had family, I've been there when they rally in a surgery,
[55:18.160 --> 55:20.160]  and actually they come back for a day and then die right after.
[55:20.160 --> 55:24.160]  They rally, and then they die.
[55:24.160 --> 55:26.160]  And I don't want to be a negative person here,
[55:26.160 --> 55:28.160]  but I'm not a cult member, like Oprah Winfrey,
[55:28.160 --> 55:30.160]  that's like the secret, just be positive.
[55:30.160 --> 55:33.160]  I think America's rallying before it's death.
[55:33.160 --> 55:35.160]  I'm just going to be honest, I think we're going to die.
[55:35.160 --> 55:37.160]  I think we're going to implode me totally poor,
[55:37.160 --> 55:38.160]  and I think it's all going to be over.
[55:38.160 --> 55:41.160]  I think we're evil, we've aborted 50 million babies,
[55:41.160 --> 55:43.160]  and the average person doesn't want it,
[55:43.160 --> 55:45.160]  and just God is all about justice.
[55:45.160 --> 55:48.160]  And I don't think we deserve Trump.
[55:48.160 --> 55:50.160]  I don't think we deserve to turn the country around.
[55:50.160 --> 55:52.160]  I don't think we, because there's a thing,
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.160]  those of us that are self-sufficient will be okay in a total collapse.
[55:56.160 --> 55:59.160]  It'll be rough, but we'll make it, most of us.
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.160]  But what about all the scum and all the backstabbers
[56:02.160 --> 56:04.160]  and all the pedophiles and all the,
[56:04.160 --> 56:07.160]  no, they are going to kill each other.
[56:07.160 --> 56:10.160]  So, I'm hoping we fix things.
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.160]  I'm working for it, but I'm not worried one bit.
[56:13.160 --> 56:17.160]  Because the type of people that want to suck on Hillary Clinton's
[56:17.160 --> 56:21.160]  work-covered feet, culturally, and want to do all this,
[56:21.160 --> 56:23.160]  if you guys don't want this, when we try to fix it,
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.160]  then have at it, man, have what you want.
[56:27.160 --> 56:31.160]  Because the Communist Chinese already basically run the universities,
[56:31.160 --> 56:34.160]  it's in the news, they run Hollywood, we're overrun.
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.160]  And in the 11th hour, 58th minute, we have some chance to turn it around,
[56:38.160 --> 56:41.160]  and the average American doesn't rally to do that,
[56:41.160 --> 56:43.160]  shame on you.
[56:43.160 --> 56:46.160]  Because that's what we're facing.
[56:46.160 --> 56:49.160]  I just know this, the Chi Coms won't make it out of this,
[56:49.160 --> 56:52.160]  and neither will the EU or the Vatican, you're all going to go down.
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.160]  Oh, that's the little, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I forgot the best part.
[56:56.160 --> 57:03.160]  I metaphysically know that America is going to go down just like you are.
[57:03.160 --> 57:06.160]  And so we're going to pull all of you with us,
[57:06.160 --> 57:09.160]  and they're going to be overthrows of the Communist Chinese,
[57:09.160 --> 57:11.160]  and maybe that'll be a free country after this.
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.160]  But I know that when America goes down like the Alamo,
[57:14.160 --> 57:18.160]  it signifies the defeat of the Chi Coms, and the EU,
[57:18.160 --> 57:21.160]  and the globalists, and everyone else.
[57:21.160 --> 57:25.160]  So don't celebrate your victory too long.
[57:25.160 --> 57:28.160]  Don't celebrate your victory.
[57:28.160 --> 57:32.160]  Because from hell's gay, I spit at you with my last breath.
[57:32.160 --> 57:35.160]  I want you to go down, you pedophile devil-worshiping trash
[57:35.160 --> 57:37.160]  that want to control our will.
[57:37.160 --> 57:39.160]  Now there's still a chance for humanity to awaken.
[57:39.160 --> 57:41.160]  Turn this around, but if we're not serious,
[57:41.160 --> 57:44.160]  I can see where we're going.
[57:44.160 --> 57:47.160]  Trump will fail, America will fall,
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.160]  and we'll have global war.
[57:49.160 --> 57:51.160]  This 4th of July is special.
[57:51.160 --> 57:53.160]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.160]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening
[57:57.160 --> 57:59.160]  of their tyranny, and America, yet again,
[57:59.160 --> 58:02.160]  is at the heart of the resistance, the globalists.
[58:02.160 --> 58:05.160]  That's why this 4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters
[58:05.160 --> 58:07.160]  to think about Info Wars now more than ever,
[58:07.160 --> 58:09.160]  and what would the world be like if Info Wars
[58:09.160 --> 58:12.160]  wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[58:12.160 --> 58:14.160]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported Info Wars?
[58:14.160 --> 58:16.160]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.160]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening,
[58:18.160 --> 58:20.160]  but the enemy is striking back, so please,
[58:20.160 --> 58:23.160]  think about Info Wars and funding our operation
[58:23.160 --> 58:25.160]  while you get great products at the same time

[58:55.160 --> 58:57.160]  Sometimes supplements don't work fast enough,

[59:44.160 --> 59:47.160]  only available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[59:47.160 --> 59:52.160]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.160]  I was told what happened with Trump
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.160]  two years before he ran for office.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.160]  When Patriots of the Pentagon were seriously considering
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.160]  a coup against Obama,
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.160]  because he gave all our codes to Communist China,
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.160]  all our personnel to Communist China,
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.160]  and the Office of Personnel Management Act.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.160]  And I was told all this and didn't know if it was true or not.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.160]  And years later, even Politico halfway reported what had happened.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:48.160]  Here's what I have to say.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.160]  Trump is on a suicide mission.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.160]  Now, a suicide mission doesn't mean you die every time.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.160]  But you die about 30, 40% of the time.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.160]  Like you only go on a couple suicide missions.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.160]  And that's what it is to be on a suicide squad.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.160]  But you go on a suicide squad because you realize
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.160]  you're going to lose everything anyways if you don't make it.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.160]  Just like the divers in Thailand with the flooded cave
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.160]  who've already gotten nine of the children out,
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160]  and the divers died and others,
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.160]  they got to go through almost a mile of flooded cave.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.160]  And they got to take kids 10, 11, 12 years old in scuba
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.160]  who aren't certified and take them through that hell.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.160]  Think about that.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.160]  That's the same thing.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.160]  Trump is a suicide squad leader.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.160]  That's why he's so confident.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.160]  That's why he's so committed.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160]  Our code's gone.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.160]  Our secrets all sold out.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.160]  Our country deindustrialized.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.160]  And then finally, they were going to ban free speech
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.160]  and start arresting people and enough folks in the government
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160]  and in private sector.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.160]  And then the general citizenry said, we're not doing this.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.160]  We're not almighty. We were to America.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.160]  We didn't believe the John Burt society and Ron Paul and Alex Jones
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160]  and Barry Goldwater and everybody else.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160]  We didn't believe them.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.160]  It sounded so crazy, but we're being given orders to prepare
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.160]  for gun confiscation and for war against Christians
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160]  and war against constitutionalists.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.160]  A, we don't want to do that.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160]  B, they're armed to the damn teeth.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.160]  These are millions of veterans.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.160]  That's a death sentence.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.160]  Those are our brothers and sisters, people we know,
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.160]  we've lost it, volunteer and give blood.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.160]  The people that are at the homeless shelters,
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.160]  but we're being trained to have war with them.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.160]  So a group of generals came to Trump as I first told you
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.160]  three years ago, two and a half years ago,
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.160]  and now it's been confirmed and said, this is what we're laying out.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]  We don't know what to do.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.160]  What do you think?
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.160]  You're popular.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160]  We know your background.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160]  We know about your dad.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160]  We know about all you fighting the John Burt society behind the scenes.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.160]  What do you think we should do?
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.160]  He said, let me talk to my wife.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:08.160]  He went and spent three months in Scotland
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.160]  and decided not to do it.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.160]  And then Melania came to him on the last day and she said,
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160]  she'd seen what they were doing on the news to people.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160]  She said, you have to do it.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160]  He said, I don't want to put the family through this,
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.160]  but he said, she said, you have to.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160]  And he understood the challenge.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:30.160]  He said, yeah, I really, I can't not do this.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.160]  And we can't not do this.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.160]  It's the same thing I deal with every day.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.160]  But communist China, ally with the big banks,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.160]  has totally sold the country out.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160]  And they engage in every crime you can imagine
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.160]  and they're trying to sabotage the economy.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.160]  And the biggest frustration is looking at the average person
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.160]  that goes along with this anti-Americanism
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160]  and they don't realize they're opening the gates up
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:04:00.160]  to their sure and absolute destruction.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.160]  When you look at how communist China has abused their own people,
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160]  and you just ask yourself,
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160]  is this the way it needs to be?
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.160]  And I'm telling you, even though we think we're winning
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.160]  and we see good things coming back to the US,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  there's such institutional powers behind this
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.160]  and such an evil commitment to stop human development.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.160]  And human potential that I cannot lie to anybody.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.160]  It's not my job.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.160]  There's a lot of you.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160]  I think we're neck and neck.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:37.160]  I think it's up in the air whether America and the world makes it.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160]  And you need to understand that.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.160]  But to all of you out there that serve evil,
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  I have no idea how you could be so blind
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.160]  and so committed to darkness.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.160]  I just cannot even begin to understand it.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.160]  You're just such traitors to your own family,
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.160]  your own free will, but you love your father the devil.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.160]  So that's why you do it.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.160]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.160]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack

[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:32.160]  Well, Trump is set to announce his new Supreme Court pick
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.160]  on the next few days.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.160]  We'll be covering it.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:37.160]  China's military admits they're already in a war with the US.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.160]  They've got the media and everybody basically.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.160]  It's China.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.160]  China's the main engine.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]  It was the plan.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.160]  The CFR said it was the Chinese century.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.160]  Well, it's not the Chinese century.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.160]  It's the globalist communist century feeding off the poor Chinese
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.160]  to empower their whole operation.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.160]  Because Americans, on average, are intuitive and smart and hardworking.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.160]  But the Chinese are intuitive, smart and hardworking as well,
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160]  but they're enslaved.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.160]  So it is definitely a power slave scenario.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.160]  I want to go to Antoine Robert Dennis, Robert Patrick George,
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.160]  Alexander Craig, Tony, Brandon, Eric, and others.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.160]  Eric in Michigan.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.160]  Eric in the great state of Michigan.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.160]  You are back on the air calling in on the show.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.160]  Welcome. Go ahead.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160]  You're on the air.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.160]  Brainwashed zombies.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.160]  Go ahead and start over.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.160]  They didn't get to you right away.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160]  I went to the end of the call, so they missed it.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.160]  Let's just start over.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160]  Go ahead.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.160]  Alex, I just wanted to kind of touch base on when you brought up,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160]  you know, to call in as a first time caller,
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.160]  you were going on about Hillary and how she's going to try to possibly run
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:51.160]  for 2020 and sending out emails and to her supporters and followers.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.160]  And I think it's absolutely ludicrous.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160]  I mean, we all know she's crooked as, you know,
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.160]  she's more crooked than anybody's front tooth I've ever seen.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.160]  She's crooked and the dog's back leg.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.160]  You know, but anyway, you know, so we'll see.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.160]  You'll see, you know, we'll see how that plays out.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.160]  I mean, if she does, it's going to be a failure.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.160]  Well, the thing is, she's definitely raising money for it.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:17.160]  She says she's telling her constituents get ready that they shows the arrogance,
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:23.160]  though, like it just shows how disconnected from history they are.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:28.160]  And the crazy thing is she hasn't given a damn about the people or any excuse,
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.160]  my French or anything, you know, that has to do with America or the constituents
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.160]  that live in this country or even the people that vote for her.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:38.160]  I mean, at the end of the day, they're just thrown to the wolves, you know,
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160]  she's in office.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.160]  So, you know, I'm thankful to be in Trump's America.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.160]  I'm glad we were able to pull it off.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.160]  And, you know, I agree with you, but I've got an article here out of the Oregon live.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.160]  Organizers of pro-gun rallies, lament low turnout.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160]  And that's what's happening.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:00.160]  A lot of patriots, conservative Christians, pro-gunners think we're winning.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160]  Yes, we're in a war.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.160]  We won some battles.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.160]  I don't want to use the north versus south analogy,
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.160]  but it's kind of like the south winning battles early on.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.160]  Let me tell you something.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  The globalists are coming down like a ton of bricks, brother.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.160]  And so I was telling people that we woke up the enemy.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.160]  And I think we will win.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.160]  But if people don't get that, we're in the fight of our lives.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.160]  Getting Trump elected was like landing at Normandy.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:33.160]  When we landed at Normandy, you know, in 1943, did that mean we'd beat Hitler?
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:39.160]  No, no, lots of gun sheds still at that point, but, you know, it's an uphill battle, you know,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.160]  and I'm going to fight it every step of the way.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.160]  I think we really need to come together.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160]  No, I agree with you.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.160]  What do you think of the 133 attacks last week or so and all these attacks on conservatives?
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.160]  I mean, physical attacks, trying to kill people.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.160]  I mean, the left is clearly launching an intimidation campaign.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160]  I think it's going to backfire.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160]  It's totally going to backfire.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.160]  I can't recall her name, but the lady that was part of Trump's cabinet,
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.160]  there was at that restaurant up in Virginia that got kicked out the other week, you know.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.160]  Huckabee Sanders.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160]  Right.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.160]  And Maxine Waters is totally stirring the pot, you know, on that side of the stick,
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.160]  you know, telling them, oh, shut them out of restaurants, out of gas stations, this, that, the other, you know.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.160]  How do they think that makes somebody give up on their political views?
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.160]  Most people are just busy.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:31.160]  But if you like, try to kick me out of a restaurant that everybody I know, that makes them get angry, right?
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]  Right.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.160]  And I don't care if it's my favorite Philly cheesesteak restaurant on the planet.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.160]  If they're going to kick me out for my, you know, right of opinion, I'm not going to support them anymore.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.160]  So chances are they're going to go out of business.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.160]  Well, that's the point, Eric, is it doesn't make you give up your political views.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160]  It doesn't make you back down.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160]  It emboldens you.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.160]  So they think we're like them a bunch of peer pressure wimps.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160]  God bless you.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.160]  Okay, I went to the bottom of the calls that may have confused the folks.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.160]  Click on the calls because I could punch my own butts, but I have them doing it in there.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.160]  So we're going to go to another call.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.160]  Who should we go to here?
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.160]  Who should we go to next?
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.160]  Let's talk to Brandon in Texas.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.160]  He says he wants to talk about my predictions and in game.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.160]  Brandon, you're on the year.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.160]  Thanks for holding.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.160]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.160]  Yeah, I'm a long, long time listener, a first time caller.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160]  Welcome.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.160]  And can you hear me okay?
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160]  I can hear you really good.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.160]  Okay, great.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.160]  Well, I went to Crockett High School in the early nineties, man.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:42.160]  I just, I want everybody that's listening to you to know that you have been calling it out, calling it out since day one.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.160]  Your motives have never shifted.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.160]  You're like a pop, you're like Ron Paul, you're like a rock, right?
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.160]  Now that's integrity.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.160]  You're a real man.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.160]  And that's not a cool thing these days.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.160]  I get that.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:58.160]  But, you know, you red-pilled me way back with Endgame, a blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.160]  And when I say red-pilled, I mean, Pregnalone, brother, you put me down for like seven days.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.160]  That was almost straight up depressed, right?
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.160]  But I researched all the history in that movie.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.160]  You're on point.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.160]  Everything that's unfolded in this day to day bullshit.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:25.160]  I'm not a political person, but I have become a political person because these things are unfolding day by day, just like you said they would.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160]  And now they're to the surface like a big fucking hit.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160]  Oh, whoops.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]  I didn't mean to say that.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160]  We're going to let you go, but I appreciate your call.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.160]  We can't have cussing because we got to lay it once.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.160]  You cuss again.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.160]  We got to let you go.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.160]  But that's the thing is I'm not that smart.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  The globalists have all written their battle plans.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.160]  They're carrying them out.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.160]  They're anti-human.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:48.160]  We need to be aware of it and then you need to make a decision which side you're on.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.160]  Let's go to a caller in Illinois.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  Let's go to Antoine in Illinois.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]  Antoine, thanks for calling.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  Go ahead.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]  Hello, Alex.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]  How are you?
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]  This is Antoine in Illinois.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160]  How are you, brother?
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]  How are you doing?
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]  I'm good, man.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]  Good talk to you.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.160]  It is such a pleasure to finally connect with you, my friend.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:13.160]  I just want to start off by telling you I am so proud of what you and your organization have done.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.160]  Years ago, when I was a college student at Northern Illinois University, some colleagues of mine,
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.160]  we did the same thing you did in the college level in the late 80s and the early 90s.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:29.160]  And I wanted to know if you were familiar with the mentor of mine by the name of Stephen Coakley.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:35.160]  He was a psycho-activist, African-American from the Chicagoland area.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:44.160]  He was well-renowned for teaching about the Illuminati, the Boulet, FEMA, Rose Rockstile,
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160]  the whole nine-
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.160]  What was his name again?
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.160]  His name is Stephen Coakley.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.160]  Now, he's past or now.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160]  But his name is...
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.160]  I mean, the name seems familiar.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:58.160]  For people who know about the Boulet, that's the African-American version of the Masons
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.160]  that they then kind of try to use to control people, right?
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.160]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.160]  Stephen Coakley was very known for that on the grassroots level, very popular.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.160]  Again, he was my mentor along with...
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.160]  I know you're pretty good friends with Brother Minister Louis Farrakhan.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.160]  But I just wanted to see if you were familiar with him because he was doing this before.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160]  That was a Facebook, YouTube...
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160]  Yes, no, I remember the name.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:26.160]  And as for Louis Farrakhan, he's a great brain, very, very smart person.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.160]  And the media kind of takes out of context what he says.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160]  But I want to have peace.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160]  I want everybody to do great.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.160]  And I think that Farrakhan does understand the larger picture.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.160]  And I know he's been involved with Kanye West behind the scenes, the rest of it.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.160]  I know Farrakhan told me point blank.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.160]  And I said, is this all record?
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160]  He said, no.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.160]  But he didn't say it on camera that he was...
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160]  He liked Trump.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.160]  And I know he's been kind of back and forth trying to get his constituents to understand what's happening.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:56.160]  But I think with this message saying Trump is destroying all our enemies a month ago,
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.160]  do you think people in the nation of Islam got how far Farrakhan's going
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.160]  trying to warn them of the battle we're in right now?
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.160]  I do.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.160]  I think it's going to take more teaching about that.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:11.160]  One of the reasons why I was really glad to see Trump run for office
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.160]  because he was trying to break the stranglehold that many of the politicians
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:20.160]  have had on this country for years, including him.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.160]  Exactly.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.160]  Trump is very not simple in the word simple, but very straightforward.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.160]  He wants prosperity for everybody.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.160]  He does not... he looks who a person is.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.160]  Like Martin Luther King said, like not the color of the skin, who they are.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.160]  And Farrakhan looks right at me.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.160]  And he said, no, I think Trump overall is going to shake the system up, is going to win.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  And he said, and I think you know that.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.160]  And he said, but you know...
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.160]  And I said, listen, I don't have any little communication with Trump except every once in a while.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  But Farrakhan was pro-Trump when I met with him.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]  Thank you, Antoine.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160]  We'll be back.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:02.160]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:08.160]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients,
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.160]  amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.

[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.160]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.160]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:15.160]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.160]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.160]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.160]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later,
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.160]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.160]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.160]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.160]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:50.160]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.160]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.160]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.160]  The real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen,

[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:20.160]  There's an attempt to turn off the world economy.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.160]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.160]  And you tried it.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:29.160]  We have a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160]  But you failed.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.160]  Do you still think that chef will brought down the World Trade Center?
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.160]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:45.160]  If the government has something to hide, are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:50.160]  This story does not end up.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:56.160]  Mueller and the Bushes and the Clintons thought they'd stage 9-11 with their Islamic buddies.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.160]  And now, you know, does Trump played that card during the campaign?
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.160]  He played it back the week after the attack happened.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:10.160]  And he believed there were bombs in the building because his engineer that he hired built the World Trade Center.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:16.160]  The architect that built it, the Japanese American, said that it was blown up.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.160]  And Trump's just sitting back.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.160]  He could play that card up front, but they'd say he's crazy.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.160]  He's got to turn the economy around.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.160]  He's got to unify people together.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.160]  He's got to defeat the deep state, and then he's going to bring it out.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:37.160]  But you notice when I came out last Monday and told you that Trump is looking to release
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.160]  the fact that Mueller covered up 9-11, which has already been documented.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:46.160]  They've got a string of more than 30 senior FBI agents, current and retired,
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:53.160]  ready to expose how they were ordered to shut up by the Clintons, by the Bushes, and then by Mueller.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:56.160]  Ha ha ha, Mueller.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:02.160]  It's the Ace of Spades. Building 7, the FBI CIA headquarters blown up the bombs in it.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.160]  The witness protection programs.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.160]  Oh yeah, Barry Jennings all of it.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:16.160]  These guys are so cowards that they couldn't even imagine talking about this out loud.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:22.160]  And the pedophile airplanes with Jeffrey Epstein and Mueller running it for the FBI.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:27.160]  All of it's coming out. All of it.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.160]  So good luck.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.160]  Ha ha ha ha.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.160]  Because no matter what you do, Mueller, no matter what Bill Clinton does, no matter what you do,
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.160]  it's all coming out now.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160]  You want to bang heads?
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.160]  You guys keep looking for a fight.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.160]  You found one, didn't you?
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:58.420]  gonna bang heads with you so hard you're not gonna even know what to do. If you
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:04.100]  want to bang heads with me you came the right spot. See with me it's not some
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.620]  macho thing it's it's life and death. My soul hangs over the precipice of
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:13.100]  eternity. Maybe for what my ancestors did or what I did whatever it is. I just
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:18.380]  know God wants me to take you down all you narcissistic mental patients come
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:25.160]  back deep state white shoe boy butt smelling Ivy League turds. All that
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.480]  matters is she burning hell.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:39.880]  So just keep pushing and pushing and pushing and just like Hitler in that
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:47.720]  bunker as we close in on you. You're into the right thing aren't you? I know you are.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.240]  I want to go to Robert in Seattle and Dennis in Kentucky and Robert in
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.680]  Pennsylvania and Patrick in Indiana and George in Las Vegas and Alexander and
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.960]  Alpine Illinois and Craig in Arizona and Tony in Texas and many others. Right
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.560]  now let's go to Robert in Seattle in a deep state stronghold of Jeff Bezos you're
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:15.840]  on the air go ahead. Alex pleasure to speak with you. First I'd like to say
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:22.480]  thank you for red-pilling me opening my eyes what's really going on. Second
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:29.120]  thing I'm a white male I work hard I was raised by my grandparents taught me an
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.480]  honest days work the value of a dollar. I'm heading to Home Depot today to go
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.280]  work on my house because the economy is doing so well I got a nice raise I'm
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.640]  actually can afford to buy things now and I live in the area with all these
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:49.240]  med jobs that walk around that know have no idea what they're talking about when
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.800]  you gauge them in conversation they go right to the attacks and I feel like I
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.000]  walk around with a target on my back I've actually wore a Trump shirt out one
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.600]  day gotten several arguments and it's mostly around the Seattle area I haven't
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:11.720]  been to Portland I want to go August 4th I suggest you don't go because I think
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:17.520]  something would happen bad if you were seen on site so for you you stay back
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.760]  let's be clear anti-fuzz attacking people I've been to Seattle because my
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.440]  wife wanted to go visit some family she has it lives there and like I walk
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.120]  outside the first ten minutes and people are attacking me now let's be
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:38.480]  clear I'd shake 10 15 hands and have folks wave at me for every person that
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.120]  attacked me but still they are crazed and I've got a stack of news I haven't
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.640]  gotten to of all of this the attacks in the in the in the in the in all of it
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:53.120]  but they are absolutely crazed man and and and they're pissed that they are
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.040]  fundamentally hate America they'll tell you they hate America and it's like but
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.840]  you live here morons all the anti-depressants people are on man I
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.320]  got off of them some of your supplements kind of woke me up you know the
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:12.200]  I don't really help but it's just you know I questioned God a while back and I
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:17.440]  realized that my job in life is to protect my family protect my freedom
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.960]  protect my right to do what I want to do without impeding on people and that's
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.880]  what I do every day no I agree work hard I agree but but but you mentioned how
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.000]  like St. John's work we don't even sell that we should and major studies is like
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.400]  double better than Prozac but but but the issue a dead-temp toxic effects is
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:41.680]  that we have vitamin C deficiencies we have iodine deficiencies these cause
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.080]  our major issues I mean my god I got an iodine six years ago it made me a lazy
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:53.600]  ass I used to swim and lift weights every day and was fat I got on X2 and I
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.760]  mean it's incredible I like lost 30 40 pounds it always stayed off my libido's
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.480]  better it's like I'm 16 years old but again this is the iodine conspiracy
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.920]  we'll tell you something to be a man is to be expendable and that doesn't mean
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:12.160]  you don't have worth you have great worth but men are expendable and exactly
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.720]  what you said the minute you realize being a man isn't about choosing the
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.000]  biggest gang or always being on the winning team it's about doing what's
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.800]  right being strong and not caring what other weak people say but following the
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.960]  compass God gave you and so I know what it is to wear a Trump shirt or an M4
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.680]  shirt outside I know what it is in a in a blue state area to go through that we
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.040]  have to do that and use those opportunities when they do it to
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.320]  videotape it as we're doing to just expose that these are authoritarian's
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:48.040]  imagine if we give in to them now how bad it will be later so that's men's job
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.160]  the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in a moment of comfort
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.360]  or convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.640]  Martin Luther King you look at Martin Luther King he said don't judge the man
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.400]  what color they are what gender they are what they do what that just like me you
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.960]  got good food I go to your restaurant got me good music I listen to you don't
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.000]  care if you're black or white I listen to some song whether it be hip hop or
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.320]  country or blues or I don't think well this is a black artist let me click on
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.840]  that this is a white artist or this is a Hispanic artist or I'm gonna go see a
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.320]  Mexican director they do have like some of the best directors I'm I just go oh
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:25.600]  that was a great movie who's the director oh it's another Mexican it's not
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.320]  like some cliche it's with the patterns you notice in life and so that's what
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.920]  I'm getting at here is that we have free will we're gonna do it God bless you
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.680]  Robert in Seattle keep it up Dennis in Kentucky where they just attacked the
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.400]  Senate majority leader last night and so much more straight ahead on the other
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:49.600]  side of this break but listen no matter what happens this life is only a test our
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.000]  relationship with God is numero uno

[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:42.800]  you know what I just say this because it's important for people to know it's
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.240]  not like info wars is that important or we're on a power trip it's just
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:53.080]  important to metaphysically say it before I ever knew what I was doing I got
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.440]  offered pretty big Hollywood roles like out of the gates you know two three
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:04.760]  minutes talking major movies and paychecks and voiceover deals I made a
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:10.880]  million dollars on a voiceover I did for a national insurance company through a
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.880]  union in a year or like 900 something thousand dollars and you know what I did
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.120]  I put it right the general fund and built info wars not that money's bad but I
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:28.920]  don't care about that I got a car that runs great got medicine got a house like
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.360]  it is that's why I want to keep you poor they want to keep you down on a level
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.640]  where you never get to the realization is that it doesn't matter at a certain
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.480]  level like most of time I fly coach on a plane because what's the point of paying
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:46.120]  three times more but I've been offered all these big Hollywood roles and man
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:55.440]  they got bigger once I wouldn't sell out so I turned down ten million dollars a
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:05.160]  year in 2002 ten million dollars a year no employees to me now all these years
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.080]  later we bring in way more than that but it pays for all the crew and all the
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.840]  satellites the rest of but I just it's like Hollywood thinks it's God it thinks
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:18.880]  you've got to go with it and even the conservative end of Hollywood says you
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.280]  know I'm a billion-dollar producer and these are nice people but we want you to
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.920]  go make this movie and make this show it's like I can't do that because every
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.440]  time I agree to it it then has to go through this process of being watered
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:43.400]  down what is important and I only make this point because I just got you know this phone call in a big hot
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.880]  movie that's being produced they wanted me in a major role that wouldn't do it
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.440]  and it was a smaller role than it was a cameo and something against the
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:57.520]  production it's that you understand I can't refuse Hollywood and then not
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:06.720]  refuse a part of it what is powerful what is real is directly talking to you
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:15.080]  unscripted live this isn't an act and that's the whole thing like I remember
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.720]  growing up my mom watching the Oscars thinking boy that's really cool those are
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:23.680]  really the cool people and by college they were like mom I go home mom you're
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:31.320]  watching the Oscars they're a bunch of losers and so it's just so liberating to
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:35.840]  not care about that and then people can't believe they just can't believe
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:40.280]  like you don't want the history channel show you don't want the Discovery
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.680]  Channel show you know I'm like already got two or three of them they never even
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:54.320]  know I have two or three of each already did it and not to sell out I just was
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.880]  like sure I'll do your I'll do your show I'll host your show and then they put it
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:04.760]  on it's such a joke man it's like always other talk show hosting people yeah
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.880]  look at that shot of Hollywood people look at them they're the actors they're
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:15.720]  the candy-ass they want to be the big star on TV like Meryl Strep promoting
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:24.240]  pedophilia and like somebody like me has got to be no I don't want to be in that
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:30.400]  and then it's always the pitch like we'll censor you if you don't we'll come
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:37.080]  after you know I already got the message but what hurts is friends I've had in
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:42.360]  some cases 20 years that were truthful and when they get threatened they roll
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:52.280]  over like a dead hog in the middle of a pool in summer they just roll over it's
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:38:01.920]  very very sad but I do historically and metaphysically and ritually
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:10.080]  reject Hollywood and reject everything associated with it I will have nothing to
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:23.840]  do with it nothing nothing 0 0 absolute total 0 understand that so it's like
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.400]  Fox News try to give me three different TV shows and then when I refused the
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.560]  third one after about two years they had a big article the Newark Daily News back
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.160]  when I was like you know being attacked once a week in the news now it's like
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.880]  every five seconds and it was like Jones wanted a job at Fox News but he got
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:46.720]  rejected and and again it's not about me bragging oh I got offered a job at
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:54.040]  Fox News it was like I got offered a job drinking out of porta-potties and look
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.000]  I'm glad handy's there I'm glad Carlson's there they're great people I'm glad
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.560]  Lou Dobbs is there I'm glad Lord Ingram is there I'm not saying Fox is bad but
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:08.640]  the producers and the managers and the jerks the types that fired Matt Drudge
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.440]  when he had the top-rated show there they're the losers and Matt Drudge doesn't
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:20.600]  need them I don't need them that's what I'm trying to say is that I I'm innately
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:31.000]  me and I'll never forgive Fox News trying to give me three shows and I was
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  like you're kidding I get on a plane Friday night and I fly there and tape
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.840]  Saturday and air Sunday where I moved to New York so I could and I don't see my
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:49.240]  oh this is a big chance for you and then they'd rape me they would rape me and
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:55.840]  say that I wanted them you know it's like the ugly girl in high school that
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.040]  ties to get her brother to fight you he's like screw you remain my sister and you
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.840]  kind of slam his head in the wall he goes and the sister runs over and says
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.480]  Bobby he didn't really do it I'm sorry it's like it's it's not it's like Fox
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:21.680]  News so I can sell catheter lines I want to change history I want to bust up the
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:28.280]  establishment I want to change the world I don't want to be in Hollywood movies I

[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.880]  pedophile planes he imagined me and signed up to that how Mueller used them
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:51.280]  to set up thousands of politicians raping little nine ten-year-old girls
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.400]  that's all admitted in that big sack of crap thinks I'm afraid of him oh I want
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.480]  to just bring him down living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.320]  is the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.960]  Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.440]  rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.720]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:26.280]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:31.440]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.760]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:41.760]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:47.160]  turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.680]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:57.720]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it info

[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:15.680]  clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.480]  1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.120]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.640]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit

[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:43.000]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by

[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:19.440]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:25.400]  I'm looking at a story from worldnetdaily.com upon info wars.com I read this earlier today I'm
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:31.760]  at the cover today but illegal alien to find 280 dollars for killing an FBI
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.880]  agent and fire marshal and then you go I looked at the police report it's all
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:41.080]  true and again I don't care what color you are whether you're black white
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:48.800]  brown whatever it's like illegal aliens I had an illegal alien only like 20
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.440]  miles an hour it's like 16 17 years ago in a wendy's park a lot hit my truck
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:59.520]  crush the side door in and the cops go oh we can't get him out of insurance just
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.640]  go and my insurance charged me and I don't care the fact is I'm a person too
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.920]  the illegal alien isn't allowed to just do this but just like the illegal alien
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.080]  shot the young woman in the back her dad held her she died in the San
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:23.920]  Francisco jury said we're letting him go he's an illegal alien and you ask
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:30.520]  yourselves what paradigm is this what world is this the globalist half-two in
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.560]  Europe and the US incentivize free housing free welfare no problem come
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:41.080]  here to bring the worst people not bring the good people from those countries
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:46.400]  but bring the worst to destabilize it's a military attack and they admit it is
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.200]  people go what do you mean it's military attack a military attack means
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:53.720]  they're taken over not the people they're bringing in but the big powerful
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:58.120]  corporations manipulating it they want to conquer you it's the way of the world
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.680]  there's always people that want to do that and those of us that don't think
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:06.600]  like that are always blind to it I'll get a virtue signal here but man let me
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:12.720]  tell you something I love people with brown skin I find women with brown skin
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:19.400]  very attractive the point is it's all a fraud we're all together but you can't
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:23.760]  let Soros a Nazi collaborator blow up the whole country when he's done it to
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:31.280]  other nations and not recognize he's a bad person let's go to Dennis in
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.560]  Kentucky where the senator later just got run of another restaurant harassed
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:40.400]  with his wife being called a Nazi when Mitch McConnell's for the open borders
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:45.120]  guy another thing is it's what they go we're in a
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:49.920]  killer and Paul he supports Trump and then he's the most anti-trump guy when
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.960]  it comes to real issues the only guy that brings up real issues on Trump
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.800]  because I'm anti-trump on some issues it's the ignorance man it's it's crazy
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:02.400]  so let's go to Dennis go ahead Dennis in Kentucky thanks for holding thank you
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.120]  so much for having mr. Jones and and it's a pleasure to actually speak with
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.520]  you for the first time in my life I usually call him when Hoenn is on
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:15.640]  because I know that I can actually have a third time but I will say this on your
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:22.720]  on your dilemma with mr. Joe Rogan you owe Joe Rogan nothing Joe Rogan is a
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:30.680]  sense liner he knows where his butter is bred he's always been that way he used
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:36.120]  to be a person that tried to get people to do anything for money you remember
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:41.800]  fear factor that's how Joe Rogan became a household name it wasn't for anything
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:46.760]  else Joe Rogan was a fear factor guy that tried to get you to eat Rocky
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:54.440]  Mountain oysters well it'd be like it'd be like donkey balls exactly so for Joe
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:58.000]  Rogan to sit here and pretend if you look at his body language during that
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.080]  that transmission you gave earlier look how he always looked over to make sure
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:08.560]  that Jamie was giving him the yes or no nod all you got to do is just look at
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.680]  body language that's all I can say about Joe Joe's my friend I'm getting the
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:18.840]  fight with him I just know that there's major web censorship going on and then
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.640]  he continues to misrepresent what me and others are saying and I just want Joe to
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:27.520]  realize why isn't he on the winning team we're gonna win anyways he's on the
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.640]  wrong side of history he knows it but his he is being for fun it as the face of
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:39.760]  you too you gotta unrealize that he joke moment is the face of you know I
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:43.120]  totally here that's my beef I said an earlier live thing I did before the show
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:49.160]  is that he doesn't get censored I've called up and asked for his help not for
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:54.760]  me but for everybody and then and then just no response so all I know is he's
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:52:01.000]  got Joey Diaz on there you know acting like we're just saying all this stuff I
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.920]  don't want to fight with him but God he just continues to misrepresent what
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:11.200]  we're saying okay because he actually knows who you are but he knows that
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.880]  those people have their foot on his neck about what he can say when he can say
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:23.440]  it and how he chooses to say it it's okay mr. Jones you have been proven
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.480]  throughout your track record as an upstanding citizen and a patriot for
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:33.160]  this country if anyone else has anything to say about it all they have to do is
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.720]  come and debate you right around no I agree God bless you I appreciate your
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:43.480]  call I just I have a loyalty to old friends and I like Joe and I just he's
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:47.680]  got Shapiro on there and he's got all these other people and it's just it like
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:52.800]  saying Soros was a victim of the Nazis that he said he loved it man he loved
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:57.200]  rounding people up and to me that's what made me mad but notice Joe in the new
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.280]  video doesn't defend Soros so maybe that's a change I don't want to get
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:06.520]  sideways Joe I just I don't know what to say actually I don't want to say at this
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:09.720]  point God bless you I appreciate your call got a bunch of the colors here and
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.560]  we got George in Las Vegas no more Hillary let's go to George in Las Vegas
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.360]  and then Tony George you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead hi mr.
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:23.760]  Jones thank you for taking my call thank you I just was watching here and
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.600]  you announced that Hillary said she's gonna be running again well she's told
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.880]  her constituents she is is in the New York Post and dredge report but she
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.520]  clearly wants the money that she's running so she's she's definitely already
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:40.680]  stealing the money for the run right right it's just you know I was thinking
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:47.160]  this country has gotten almost tore apart by this last election and it's like
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:51.600]  she's going to try to do it again and just finish the job well that's the
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.600]  satanic arrogance I mean I know that for a fact she had a brain tumor removed four
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:00.240]  years ago she's walking dead but it just yeah she'll never she's not gonna win
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:03.880]  she's not gonna run you watch she'll be in a hospital or in my opinion dead in a
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.360]  couple years but it just shows how the demon never stops the zombie never stops
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.680]  right and so I was just thinking hopefully with all these charges and
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.600]  proof that we have on her and Bill and everybody else maybe they'll take her
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:21.720]  away before anything happens I know that Trump is playing a hundred percent by
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.880]  the book he's totally surrounded but he's winning and we're trying to turn the
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.440]  country around but I just wish my average American knew how serious it was
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.400]  because I don't know what leads to Trump I will I will
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.680]  the truth and it's very frustrating God bless you George all right we got
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:43.360]  Alexander Craig Tony got so many great callers Tony in Texas you're on the
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:52.320]  air thanks for holding hey Tony Tony's gone okay let's go to Craig Craig in
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.880]  Arizona you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead Alex how are you sir
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:02.160]  I'm blessed brother I'm very humble ball you folks I appreciate you I just want
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:06.320]  to take a quick moment to thank you and all the independent journalists of the
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:12.120]  world for standing up and holding the flag up at Fort McHenry and keeping our
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:17.520]  flag standing and keeping our flag going and saving the Republic sir thank you
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:21.840]  well God bless you know it truly is a fight for the country it doesn't mean
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.640]  America's perfect America's got a lot of problems but it's based in Christianity
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.760]  it's based in pro-human ideas not that we ever did that but we believe in that
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.460]  and that's why the enemy hates it like look at how the evil globalist hate
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:37.240]  America what does that tell you about America well in the words of George
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:42.520]  Washington a true patriot would rather stand on his feet than die and then
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:47.560]  surrender on his knees God bless you thank you all right we'll go to Alpine
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:52.680]  Illinois Alpine Illinois and Alexander Alexander go ahead hey Alex Jones
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.760]  pleasure to speak to you nice talk to you Alexander go ahead so I'm new into this
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:03.800]  politics game and I just I just wonder if if that 9-11 thing gets fully exposed I
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.840]  feel like that would be the trigger for the Civil War but at the same time I'm
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:13.520]  wondering will the last beat us by infesting us with their war off their
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.920]  world population before like we get to that point well that's here's the deal
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.640]  justice be done may the heavens fall 9-11 was staged with globalist
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.400]  radical Islam that has to be exposed to the deep state the average third world
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:32.640]  population is a victim of globalism morally in many cases they are better
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.280]  than the average bull rotten America be they black white it's just that they're
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.240]  being brainwashed as soon as they get here so their only uses a weapon like a
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:45.120]  dam that breaks if water's coming down your down your road to kill you water's
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:50.000]  not bad there's just too much of it so African immigrants Latin American
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.760]  immigrants Eastern Europeans they're not our problem except they're being
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.800]  brainwashed against us when they're brought in so they're only a weapon and
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:04.920]  so our bigger problem is the GMO the vaccines the globalist their propaganda
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.800]  if we got our country back we can bring in a hundred million two hundred
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.880]  million people I don't care if they're black Hispanic white whatever as long
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:18.960]  as they get a shot at being pro-america invited in they get in and are turned
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.160]  against the country the minute they get here so I just want them to like be
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.960]  shown like the different slideshow here's communism here's freedom which one do
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.120]  you want you've got a birthright America's already brown America's already
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:36.080]  Hispanics already have the population they'll be 80% in 50 years will they
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:42.520]  reject it or they accept Americana I'll see you back tomorrow 11 a.m. Central
