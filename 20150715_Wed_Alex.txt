[00:21.120 --> 00:30.720]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night on this wednesday july 15 2015 day
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.160]  one of jade helm we're going to be watching that very closely we've got
[00:35.160 --> 00:38.240]  some reports on that coming up we're also going to be talking about this new
[00:38.240 --> 00:42.800]  video from planned parenthood we're going to be talking about the deal with
[00:42.800 --> 00:46.320]  iran obama's deal with iran people are weighing in on both sides of that we've
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.800]  got the neocons like dick cheney furious about it but then of course we've got
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.400]  this is a deal that has actually been put together by obama i don't know who's
[00:56.400 --> 01:00.800]  side to take i i really don't have a dog in this fight so i'm gonna go back and
[01:00.800 --> 01:05.040]  look at this in historical context we're gonna look at this in terms of what was
[01:05.040 --> 01:09.240]  actually done in terms of lifting the sanctions will that make a difference or
[01:09.240 --> 01:11.880]  not one way the other so we're gonna talk about that a little bit of course
[01:11.880 --> 01:15.720]  alex jones is going to be joining us later in the program he's now working on
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.840]  a big special report he's going to be back and later on in the program we're
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.640]  also going to have as a guest with us today doctor group before we do i want
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.840]  to go over some of the news that's here we've got a big news day today i don't
[01:30.840 --> 01:33.680]  want to go into depth on those stories that i just mentioned but some of these
[01:33.680 --> 01:37.760]  smaller stories i thought this is kind of interesting at the same time we've
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.040]  got jenet yellen top of the drudge report kind of warning congress to lay
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.920]  off of the federal reserve don't put any regulations on me we've got a santa
[01:48.920 --> 01:53.320]  cruise county that votes to cease doing business with five too big to fail
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.160]  megabanks and of course what they do in this letter is they cite the involvement
[01:57.160 --> 02:01.960]  of city group jp morgan chase barkley's royal bank of scotland ubs they leave out
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.840]  for some reason hsbc but they talk about how they have been found guilty of
[02:06.840 --> 02:11.480]  rigging markets the live war markets have they been found guilty by the justice
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.240]  department of course air colders justice department didn't send anybody to jail
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.720]  he didn't suspend anybody's charters he gave them fairly small fines so at least
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.080]  at this local level i point out the story even though it's a small story
[02:23.080 --> 02:28.040]  because i think we have to understand what's going on globally but we have to
[02:28.040 --> 02:31.320]  act locally that's what the globalists have been saying for a long time to their
[02:31.320 --> 02:35.880]  grassroots people act locally but think globally and we need to do the same
[02:35.880 --> 02:39.560]  thing we need to understand the global conspiracy for government we need to
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.720]  understand who the global uh corporations are behind this global
[02:43.720 --> 02:46.920]  government and we need to start shutting them down at the local level
[02:46.920 --> 02:50.440]  look at this from the hill we have taxpayers who are going to be paying
[02:50.440 --> 02:55.240]  four million dollars for the ceo's of fanny may and freddy mac
[02:55.240 --> 03:00.600]  do you remember the bubble and the burst of the real estate bubble part of that
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.800]  was because of large incentives bonuses given to the ceo's of fanny may and
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.880]  freddy mac to look the other way to extend loans to people who were not
[03:11.880 --> 03:17.320]  qualified for these loans now they want to give them salary increases of 150
[03:17.320 --> 03:22.040]  thousand dollars a year go from 600 000 to 750 000
[03:22.040 --> 03:27.160]  dollars because you know they just never can get enough money to those guys
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.080]  at the same time what do we get in the united states well we're getting the
[03:31.080 --> 03:37.080]  iron fist everywhere we've got california who just recently passed the sp277
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.000]  bill that mandated vaccines for children in order to get an education
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.920]  the only exception for the time being is homeschooling
[03:44.920 --> 03:48.440]  you can't put them even in a private school without getting them
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.920]  vaccinated with the vaccines that the government demands on the schedule that
[03:52.920 --> 03:56.680]  the fact that the government demands no exceptions for anyone so they just got
[03:56.680 --> 03:59.720]  that passed and you know what if you don't stop tyranny
[03:59.720 --> 04:03.800]  they just keep coming at you so now they're coming again with a
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.520]  bill to make adults who are working in any kind of
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.520]  rest home or adult care facility to make it a legal requirement it'll be a
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.800]  criminal offense as well as taking the license of the organization if they
[04:15.800 --> 04:18.760]  don't get vaccinated now that went up for a hearing last night we had that
[04:18.760 --> 04:22.440]  article up on info wars dot com i don't know the result of that
[04:22.440 --> 04:25.320]  hearing last night if that is moving forward or not but that is
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.240]  something people need to keep a close eye on if it doesn't move forward i can
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.160]  tell you that is the direction going down into medical
[04:33.160 --> 04:37.400]  tyranny is the direction that we are going and at the same time
[04:37.400 --> 04:41.160]  we see judges at the us circuit court of appeal demanding that
[04:41.160 --> 04:47.000]  nuns are now going to have to pay for abortion causing drugs
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.960]  nuns nuns i mean this is the insanity this is crony capitalism writ large
[04:53.960 --> 04:58.920]  this is what obama care is about stay with us we'll be right back
[04:58.920 --> 05:04.760]  joe biggs here with info wars dot com today is july 15th 2015 day one of jade
[05:04.760 --> 05:08.520]  helm one five now everyone has been wondering what will happen
[05:08.520 --> 05:12.280]  over the next few months from july 15th to september 15
[05:12.280 --> 05:15.960]  in these exercises will there be a military takeover will they come in to
[05:15.960 --> 05:18.760]  take your guns or will it be like we've said from the
[05:18.760 --> 05:22.280]  beginning simply an exercise to condition the american
[05:22.280 --> 05:27.080]  public to military up and down the streets helicopters flying overhead
[05:27.080 --> 05:32.200]  soldiers no longer dressed in their actual military gear but in civilian
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.200]  attire blending in doing suspicious activity and gaining
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.280]  intel on the public now will you sit around and do nothing or will you get
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.760]  up off the couch grab a video camera and help document this exercise
[05:44.760 --> 05:48.760]  governor greg abbott of texas has called the texas state guard to monitor
[05:48.760 --> 05:52.440]  these exercises throughout the state so i would encourage each and every one of
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.200]  you info warriors out there grab a camera and help expose
[05:56.200 --> 06:00.200]  this jade helm one five exercise
[06:00.280 --> 06:03.560]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers
[06:03.560 --> 06:07.480]  as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[06:07.480 --> 06:11.080]  info wars dot com because the companies i've been approached by
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.480]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be
[06:15.480 --> 06:19.240]  so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers

[08:09.720 --> 08:20.200]  and the gcn radio network
[08:20.200 --> 08:24.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this wednesday july 15 2015 of course
[08:24.680 --> 08:28.920]  this is day one of jade helm it was about a
[08:28.920 --> 08:32.680]  week ago that the washington post did a story
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.640]  jade helm 15 heavily scrutinized military exercise to open without
[08:37.640 --> 08:40.840]  media access that's exactly we could go july 8th
[08:40.840 --> 08:45.080]  actually week before that they reprinted a mocking
[08:45.080 --> 08:48.200]  article that had been circulated a couple of months ago making fun of the
[08:48.200 --> 08:51.800]  people in bass drop texas for being concerned and wanting to know what
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.680]  their government is i mean why should the slaves ever question
[08:56.680 --> 09:00.120]  what our masters tell us and of course these are the guys who want to be our
[09:00.120 --> 09:04.280]  masters they want to master the human domain that includes us especially us
[09:04.280 --> 09:07.880]  that's where they're training here so a week before they had this mocking
[09:07.880 --> 09:10.840]  article saying the americans are coming the americans are coming they're
[09:10.840 --> 09:14.760]  invading texas that was never our concern
[09:14.760 --> 09:17.720]  and we've made this clear from the very beginning we didn't think this is going
[09:17.720 --> 09:20.760]  to be the onset of martial law if that was ever the plan of course that's not
[09:20.760 --> 09:25.000]  going to be the case now because it's widely understood what's going on with
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.080]  jade helm but now we saw about a week ago
[09:29.080 --> 09:31.880]  washington post actually talking about how there wasn't going to be any media
[09:31.880 --> 09:35.240]  access they said embedded reporters will not be permitted at any point during
[09:35.240 --> 09:37.720]  the exercise this is from lieutenant colonel mark
[09:37.720 --> 09:41.160]  lastoria same guy who went to a bass drop the
[09:41.160 --> 09:45.400]  washington post pointed out that that for several times they have requested
[09:45.400 --> 09:49.640]  access to observe jade helm they said they made the case to the military that
[09:49.640 --> 09:52.440]  firsthand coverage would help to explain the mission
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.760]  yes see if you don't have anything to hide like these multinational treaties
[09:56.760 --> 09:59.240]  that are being done in secret like pretty much everything our government is
[09:59.240 --> 10:02.520]  being is doing in secret we keep hearing these assurances that
[10:02.520 --> 10:05.960]  you know these treaties that we're doing they're going to be great for you
[10:05.960 --> 10:08.680]  you're going to win america that's what the american politicians tell the
[10:08.680 --> 10:11.800]  americans european politicians tell the europeans they're going to win in these
[10:11.800 --> 10:15.400]  trade agreements but they won't show us the trade agreement
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.400]  they tell us don't worry we're not going to give monopolies to
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.120]  monsanto with the big pharmaceutical companies
[10:22.120 --> 10:25.960]  but just trust us we can't show you the agreement right now they can't show us
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.800]  what's going on it was a year ago that the military
[10:29.800 --> 10:35.800]  was meeting in the pentagon and one lady stood up there that was an officer
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.560]  she just stood up to the to the guy who was the
[10:39.560 --> 10:42.600]  head of the press corps i think i don't remember what his exact title was but
[10:42.600 --> 10:46.360]  she said nobody believes us they say that we're just giving them
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.880]  mindless propaganda how do we get through that and he goes yeah it's a
[10:49.880 --> 10:52.520]  problem because you know we got drudge out there and we got all these different
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.320]  alternative media and the internet and i mean these people are questioning what
[10:55.320 --> 10:58.760]  we do and pointing out when we lie to people
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.120]  so the washington post is telling them hey hey let's just have first-hand
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.960]  media coverage you can shut down all the speculation about what you're doing
[11:05.960 --> 11:10.680]  which they call conspiracy theories okay if you investigate if you question the
[11:10.680 --> 11:14.200]  official story that's always called a conspiracy theory
[11:14.200 --> 11:19.480]  come on can we move on past that that was something that was created by the cia
[11:19.480 --> 11:23.080]  50 years ago after the kennedy assassination to shut down
[11:23.080 --> 11:27.000]  any questioning of the ridiculous official story at that point time and
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.760]  they've used it to try to cover up every ridiculous lie they've told us
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.960]  since then we're not supposed to investigate we're not supposed to
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.800]  question that's precisely what an investigator does for a police
[11:37.800 --> 11:40.760]  department where they're investigating murder or some other crime they always
[11:40.760 --> 11:43.640]  come up with plausible scenarios who benefits from this
[11:43.640 --> 11:47.080]  what can we learn about this they try to uncover facts they try to put together
[11:47.080 --> 11:49.800]  stuff because nobody comes out and says well this is what
[11:49.800 --> 11:53.640]  happens and of course our government doesn't operate in a transparent mode
[11:53.640 --> 11:57.240]  anymore so the washington post says hey give us first-hand media coverage we
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.720]  could shut down the speculation but lastoria said
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.400]  this is what the washington post says well to lastoria told us it's not
[12:03.400 --> 12:06.840]  possible to allow a journalist to travel with special operation forces in the
[12:06.840 --> 12:10.040]  field he cited the isolated nature of the mission
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.640]  and the need to protect the identities of the special force
[12:13.640 --> 12:17.400]  troops but then they point out well the military has granted
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.600]  access to special operation training in the past
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.840]  they said in one recent example a journalist observed the exercise robin
[12:24.840 --> 12:27.400]  sage in north carolina remember when they talked about that
[12:27.400 --> 12:30.920]  remember when we said hey what are you doing here they said we do this stuff
[12:30.920 --> 12:34.920]  all the time we do robin sage every year in north carolina
[12:34.920 --> 12:38.520]  and of course you know they tell us it's the same thing well it's not the same
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.600]  thing they allow journalism coverage in robin sage in north carolina
[12:42.600 --> 12:47.240]  they do robin sage every year they don't do this particular exercise and they go
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.080]  on with this they say the exercise was considered to be a final test for
[12:51.080 --> 12:54.440]  green beret soldiers in training it calls for them to work
[12:54.440 --> 12:58.920]  through a scenario in which they organize a guerrilla force to overthrow the
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.240]  government of the fictional nation fictional
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.640]  nation of pine land there's another difference between jade
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.240]  helm and robin sage as uh louis gohmert pointed out
[13:13.240 --> 13:16.680]  he had been in the military for a long time i think he retired as a captain he
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.080]  said we always had fictional areas that we went against
[13:21.080 --> 13:25.160]  you know we worked in we trained in military bases not outside of the
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.680]  military bases amongst the civilian population
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.920]  but of course this is an exercise that doesn't have a fictional basis that's
[13:32.920 --> 13:35.160]  one of the things that he was concerned about one of the things we're concerned
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.360]  about look we don't need the military conducting
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.160]  exercises outside of military bases we don't need the military training to
[13:43.160 --> 13:46.840]  take over civilian populations outside of the military bases
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.720]  understand that when the military does these training exercises and we're
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.480]  seeing these things happening all along they come up to intimidate russia
[13:53.480 --> 13:55.960]  in the ukraine or what they do military training exercises in the
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.120]  Mediterranean they go into the ukraine they do these various exercises both
[14:00.120 --> 14:02.920]  russia and the us do this they've always done this
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.680]  go right up close to where they're going to be fighting do the training
[14:06.680 --> 14:12.760]  it's a method of intimidation okay it's also a method of intimidation so
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.080]  at one point I remember this interview with Vladimir Putin we've played it on
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.680]  the info wars before where some guys tell them hey
[14:20.680 --> 14:23.640]  these exercises are being done on the border of your country
[14:23.640 --> 14:27.080]  they're not directed at you and when the translator
[14:27.080 --> 14:30.440]  ran that through Putin looked at him and just laughed
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.760]  for about 20 seconds come on we know the same thing we've seen these
[14:34.760 --> 14:38.440]  exercises being built up year after year after year we saw them
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.800]  marching people out in the dead of night in fort lauderdale they typically
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.960]  don't tell people that you know we see this being this kind of training
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.080]  going on when it was happening in la they talked to someone he says well you
[14:49.080 --> 14:52.200]  know you train the way you're going to fight where you're going to fight if
[14:52.200 --> 14:54.040]  you're going to fight in the mountains you train the mountains if you're going
[14:54.040 --> 14:56.520]  to do it in the desert you do it in the desert
[14:56.520 --> 15:00.360]  if you're going to train in american cities you train in american cities
[15:00.360 --> 15:04.280]  with the police of course you know we don't need
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.120]  this kind of training we don't need special forces operating as boots on
[15:08.120 --> 15:11.240]  the ground for the nsa that's what they've put themselves out there for
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.160]  that's what mcgraven was shopping himself out for that's the thing
[15:15.160 --> 15:21.000]  that concerns me the most okay that we would have the military putting
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.520]  themselves out there as boots on the ground for the nsa and you
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.520]  if you understand what human domain analytics is about if you understand
[15:28.520 --> 15:33.000]  what mastering the human domain is about that was the key note
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.240]  title the title of the keynote speech at the us geospatial
[15:37.240 --> 15:41.160]  intelligence foundation a couple years ago what they're doing is they're
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.320]  collecting biometrics on you not just the fingerprints and everything and
[15:45.320 --> 15:48.840]  of course we got another article here about how the government has just lost
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.120]  21 million fingerprints have been hacked for that
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.280]  after losing millions and millions of social security data
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.400]  losing their employees data me really are we supposed to trust these people
[16:01.400 --> 16:04.760]  but the scariest thing about this is that they're taking this biometric
[16:04.760 --> 16:08.360]  information they're combining it with activity based intelligence
[16:08.360 --> 16:13.320]  so that they can track everywhere you go that becomes the ultimate biometric
[16:13.320 --> 16:17.960]  that was a report that we did that rob Jacobson put together
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.240]  jacari jackson narrated that just a couple of weeks ago
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.960]  talking about how the ultimate biometric is your activity based
[16:25.960 --> 16:30.440]  intelligence who you know where you go when you go
[16:30.440 --> 16:35.080]  and that's not our quote that's not our summary that's the summary of ibm's man
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.440]  who works in this field this is the coming
[16:38.440 --> 16:41.800]  area the up and coming area of intelligence it's been there for a
[16:41.800 --> 16:44.920]  long time it's been a us geospatial
[16:44.920 --> 16:48.680]  intelligence group for at least 15 years that's when james clapper was put
[16:48.680 --> 16:51.880]  in charge of it it predates that it's a massive part of the
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.280]  military industrial complex and the special forces people
[16:56.280 --> 17:00.120]  admiral macraven when he was there as commander was looking for
[17:00.120 --> 17:04.680]  increased involvement with special forces we should be very concerned that a
[17:04.680 --> 17:07.640]  government that wants to track us everywhere we go
[17:07.640 --> 17:12.600]  know everything about us denies everything uh denies us knowing anything
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.600]  about them we should be very concerned when they start combining with troops
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.680]  labeling our states our real areas as enemy areas
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.440]  and create an exercise it's going to last for a couple of months
[17:24.440 --> 17:29.080]  this is an intelligence gathering operation it began when people push back
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.440]  against it they wanted to mark down who's for them and who's against them
[17:32.440 --> 17:36.280]  well put me down as against this i have no
[17:36.280 --> 17:41.640]  i have no intimidation about saying that put me down as against a militarized
[17:41.640 --> 17:48.120]  police state a standing army is a danger to this republic and it is no
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.520]  better example of this than military exercises that
[17:52.520 --> 17:55.080]  say they're going to be moving amongst the population trying to keep from
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.600]  being detected this unconventional warfare unconventional warfare doesn't
[17:58.600 --> 18:01.320]  mean it's just a little bit different from what they've done before it's a
[18:01.320 --> 18:04.920]  very specific term this is what special forces do
[18:04.920 --> 18:08.120]  they go in they identify who in the government they can work with
[18:08.120 --> 18:11.480]  who is going to be opposed to them so they know who to take down
[18:11.480 --> 18:14.520]  who to reward who to do their dirty work it's a
[18:14.520 --> 18:17.800]  PSYOP operation that's also part of unconventional warfare but they're
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.560]  combining this with geospatial intelligence biometric
[18:21.560 --> 18:26.120]  information this is pre-crime profiling you
[18:26.120 --> 18:31.240]  should be very concerned about this very concerned let me give you an example
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.560]  would you look at police pre-crime profiling that is being passed over to
[18:35.560 --> 18:39.320]  artificial intelligence as we're seeing increasingly a good example of how this
[18:39.320 --> 18:43.320]  can go wrong as already has as they're developing the software
[18:43.320 --> 18:46.680]  they have all these cameras watching people they have so many cameras they
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.480]  can't hire enough people to watch us to look at those cameras
[18:51.480 --> 18:55.480]  same problem that the east german stasi government had right so what's the
[18:55.480 --> 18:57.720]  solution well now they've got computers that they
[18:57.720 --> 19:00.200]  can program and they can give them these algorithms so
[19:00.200 --> 19:04.760]  here's an example one of these tests they were looking at a guy who was
[19:04.760 --> 19:08.920]  standing next to his car for a while and then the camera
[19:08.920 --> 19:13.240]  and the ai noticed that this guy who was standing next to this camera for
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.320]  a little bit of time all of a sudden kneels down and disappears
[19:17.320 --> 19:23.800]  ah they say this looks like a car theft so they dispatch 9-1-1
[19:23.800 --> 19:27.720]  the guy was changing his tire but of course in this environment
[19:27.720 --> 19:30.360]  where the police are being trained by the federal government
[19:30.360 --> 19:33.480]  to shoot first and don't even ask any questions
[19:33.480 --> 19:39.160]  that could wind up getting someone killed we need to understand what our
[19:39.160 --> 19:42.440]  founders said what madison said a standing army
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.040]  is a danger to the republic the means of defense abroad
[19:46.040 --> 19:49.480]  have always become the tools of tyranny at home
[19:49.480 --> 19:52.280]  stay with us when we come back we're going to talk about what's going on with
[19:52.280 --> 19:55.480]  planned parenthood this new video that was released and the pushback
[19:55.480 --> 19:59.800]  against it we'll be right back

[20:04.200 --> 20:06.840]  by now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from
[20:06.840 --> 20:10.360]  electronic pickpocketing ten years ago i created a way to protect my own cards
[20:10.360 --> 20:13.240]  from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing
[20:13.240 --> 20:15.960]  a national id card with a built-in radio chip called
[20:15.960 --> 20:18.920]  rfid i felt having to broadcast my personal information
[20:18.920 --> 20:23.240]  was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards
[20:23.240 --> 20:27.000]  debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.160]  would all soon incorporate rfid it was then i formed id stronghold to
[20:31.160 --> 20:34.440]  share my inventions and blocking rfid signals with the world
[20:34.440 --> 20:37.560]  there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about rfid

[24:21.160 --> 24:24.520]  us later in the show he's working on a big story right now but he'll be in
[24:24.520 --> 24:27.640]  studio with us i want to go to a report
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.440]  that joe biggs shot yesterday about the beginning of jade helm let's run that
[24:32.440 --> 24:36.200]  report joe biggs here with info wars dot com
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.200]  now we are less than 24 hours away from operation jade helm 15 being conducted
[24:42.200 --> 24:45.640]  now there's a lot of things i want to talk about the fact that the mainstream
[24:45.640 --> 24:49.800]  media continuously tries to demonize info wars dot
[24:49.800 --> 24:53.800]  com on its coverage of jade helm well conspiracy theories are running wild
[24:53.800 --> 24:57.400]  tonight about the army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.640]  called jade helm 15 texas will be simulated
[25:01.640 --> 25:05.640]  hostile territory while that hostile characterization didn't sit well with a
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.320]  far-right radio host in austin who told his listeners that he had
[25:09.320 --> 25:14.040]  access to the secret document that details of federal takeover in texas
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.280]  the fact that so many americans really just don't even trust the government
[25:18.280 --> 25:21.560]  since the obama administration has been in place
[25:21.560 --> 25:24.840]  and it has nothing to do with race we don't like bush either
[25:24.840 --> 25:28.600]  but things have really gotten bad since he has been
[25:28.600 --> 25:32.840]  the president of the united states and like ted cruz said there's nothing
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.080]  wrong with people questioning the government that is our right as americans
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.040]  we're supposed to question the government because i'll tell you what our
[25:40.040 --> 25:45.320]  government will question us all the time so we have to flip that around on them
[25:45.320 --> 25:48.600]  and try and find out what's going on and expose the truth
[25:48.600 --> 25:51.960]  now there's a number of things that the mainstream media has been doing
[25:51.960 --> 25:56.120]  they say that we try to fear monger that we're basically
[25:56.120 --> 26:00.120]  giving birth to this paranoid group of americans about jade helm
[26:00.120 --> 26:04.440]  when in fact they do the exact same stuff except even worse because they have a
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.240]  much larger following foxnews cnn millions and millions of people all
[26:09.240 --> 26:12.920]  around the world watch these places and in the days coming up to the fourth
[26:12.920 --> 26:15.880]  of july weekend what do they do they said there was going to be an imminent
[26:15.880 --> 26:20.200]  attack by isis on the fourth of july weekend that's
[26:20.200 --> 26:23.720]  fear mongering they had no proof of that happening
[26:23.720 --> 26:27.800]  whatsoever and the fourth of july came and nothing happened
[26:27.800 --> 26:32.840]  you hear nothing from the entire populace of americans complaining hey
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.280]  why are you guys pushing this why are you doing this but i guarantee you
[26:36.280 --> 26:39.560]  when jade helm comes and goes and nothing happened
[26:39.560 --> 26:43.400]  the same thing is going to happen to us they're going to demonize us again going
[26:43.400 --> 26:46.040]  oh my god look at these kooky tenfold hat people
[26:46.040 --> 26:48.920]  that said that there was going to be an overthrow of the the government and
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.120]  that they were going to take your guns and nothing happened oh my god
[26:52.120 --> 26:57.400]  um that's ridiculous because they're doing the exact same stuff
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.560]  they fear monger more than anybody every time you turn on one of those tv shows
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.120]  it's the most depressing thing in the world and all we're trying to do
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.960]  is look at these documents and slides and go hey this needs to be questioned
[27:09.960 --> 27:13.240]  this needs to be looked at and we're not the only people who think that
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.840]  because governor greg abbott of texas thinks the exact same thing he's
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.160]  listened to his constituents and is now going to have the texas state guard
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.640]  monitoring the jade helm one five exercises you have chuck norris coming
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.960]  out saying hey if you don't know about jade helm
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.360]  you should there's a lot of people around the world who are concerned about it
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.160]  and all eyes are going to be on texas utah southern california and florida
[27:37.160 --> 27:40.840]  over the next two months to see whether or not there's a takeover
[27:40.840 --> 27:43.720]  or if nothing happens but there's one thing i can tell you will happen
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.400]  a conditioning of the people and that's what we've said since day one
[27:47.400 --> 27:50.680]  this will be used as a tool to condition the american public
[27:50.680 --> 27:55.160]  to see military roaming up and down the streets in humvees helicopters flying
[27:55.160 --> 27:59.640]  at night exercises being conducted now someone inside special ops
[27:59.640 --> 28:03.000]  saying that there will be no media access

[28:10.920 --> 28:14.200]  events now what are they thinking when they release a statement this
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.120]  as further speculation to what's going on with jade helm
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.480]  we've already caught the architects of jade helm in a lie
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.600]  numerous times they said that the people the private landowners came to
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.280]  special operations and requested that their land be used for an operation
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.000]  that they didn't even know existed when in fact

[30:10.920 --> 30:14.520]  salad and wine info wars.com writer steve watson
[30:14.520 --> 30:17.720]  noted that the washington post even changed its headline from

[30:21.800 --> 30:26.040]  to undercover video shows plan parenthood official discussing fetal organs used
[30:26.040 --> 30:29.480]  for research the story itself was edited with body parts

[30:33.400 --> 30:36.680]  changes by the publication because there's a politically correct way to

[33:52.120 --> 33:55.800]  it's really cool that the shareholders of pepsico
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.200]  big builder bird group company are not allowed to know
[34:00.200 --> 34:03.800]  uh what they're using the baby parts for foreign the flavoring but we already
[34:03.800 --> 34:07.320]  know so enjoy the flavor we're going to get the
[34:07.320 --> 34:10.440]  real solution which is going to be a combination of death panels and and
[34:10.440 --> 34:14.200]  sales taxes i'm consistently pro-death i'm for assisted
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.280]  suicide i'm for regular zones and i'm for whatever gets the freeway movement
[34:18.280 --> 34:21.560]  is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that
[34:21.560 --> 34:26.840]  patient would it be better not to lay off the those 10 teachers
[34:26.840 --> 34:31.800]  and to make that trade up in medical costs but that's called the death panel
[34:31.800 --> 34:35.400]  uh and you're not supposed to have that discussion they told me to uh
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.720]  to say that they were sorry but that you had become
[34:39.720 --> 34:48.440]  unreliable
[34:48.440 --> 34:52.200]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that
[34:52.200 --> 34:55.960]  would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.040]  it will do it to its dissidents that kind of society will also
[35:00.040 --> 35:04.360]  eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the
[35:04.360 --> 35:09.640]  quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a
[35:09.640 --> 35:13.240]  suicide cult the scoops are on their way
[35:13.240 --> 35:19.000]  the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way

[35:27.480 --> 35:36.440]  come on is soylent green is people
[35:36.440 --> 35:40.680]  brilliant piece by Darren McBreen
[35:40.680 --> 35:44.760]  yeah this is ultimately folks this is not about pro-choice
[35:44.760 --> 35:48.360]  this is not about the right to privacy can we even
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.920]  hear them say those ridiculous words anymore when they take away your right
[35:52.920 --> 35:57.240]  to make decisions informed consent about what's injected into your body they
[35:57.240 --> 36:01.320]  want to talk about pro-choice they want to talk about a right to privacy when
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.840]  we've got a government that spies and maps out everything that we do
[36:06.840 --> 36:09.960]  when they take away our informed consent on every basis so of course we've got
[36:09.960 --> 36:13.560]  another bill before the california legislature now
[36:13.560 --> 36:16.920]  that they got informed consent removed from parents for their
[36:16.920 --> 36:21.880]  children in order to get an education now they're going to extend it to nursing
[36:21.880 --> 36:26.680]  homes and of course we've talked to nurses against mandatory vaccines this
[36:26.680 --> 36:29.720]  has been going on for quite some time through intimidation
[36:29.720 --> 36:33.240]  to nurses and health care workers and hospitals now they're going to make a
[36:33.240 --> 36:37.320]  crime out of it in california and of course and we interviewed her
[36:37.320 --> 36:40.200]  one of the things that she pointed out to us was that they knew that when they
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.440]  gave these vaccines to premature low birth weight babies
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.520]  they knew it was going to require intubation it was going to create
[36:48.520 --> 36:52.520]  respiratory emergencies for these children and yet they did it anyway
[36:52.520 --> 36:57.640]  they said get the stuff ready we're about to vaccinate these kids
[36:57.640 --> 37:00.680]  and they knew they couldn't handle it but they did it anyway
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.720]  that's where we are folks and oh by the way in case you thought that was a
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.240]  conspiracy theory or you didn't believe her when she said that
[37:09.240 --> 37:13.720]  within about a month she found a study where the journal of the AMA
[37:13.720 --> 37:18.200]  actually admitted that they had done a long-term study of several thousand
[37:18.200 --> 37:23.320]  children and had seen exactly that and refused to stop doing it
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.040]  now yesterday we had this video that was broken by an undercover
[37:28.040 --> 37:33.320]  research a group that was looking at Planned Parenthood
[37:33.320 --> 37:38.200]  of course we have the doctor and let's understand folks
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.800]  we need to get over this idea that just because somebody has an
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.480]  MD degree does not make them trustworthy
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.920]  does not make them ethical okay they can be corrupted
[37:48.920 --> 37:52.280]  like anybody else you've got good doctors you've got bad doctors you've got
[37:52.280 --> 37:54.600]  good cops you got bad cops you got good people in the
[37:54.600 --> 37:57.720]  military you got bad people in the military okay
[37:57.720 --> 38:02.040]  that's why we have to have a system that doesn't operate
[38:02.040 --> 38:08.280]  on blind trust of authority the doctors can be corrupted we've seen
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.000]  many many incidents of this we've had doctors who did the Tuskegee experiment
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.200]  we've got doctors who are working with the CIA doing torture in Gitmo
[38:18.200 --> 38:21.720]  over and over again we see this in America we don't have to go to Nazi
[38:21.720 --> 38:24.600]  Germany to point it out but of course we had Joseph Mengele
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.080]  doing experiments on people in Nazi war camps saying that this is for the
[38:29.080 --> 38:31.480]  greater good we're going to learn things about the
[38:31.480 --> 38:36.120]  human body by experimenting on these people without their consent
[38:36.120 --> 38:41.480]  and that's going to help the rest of us really okay so now we've got this
[38:41.480 --> 38:45.160]  Planned Parenthood doctor and she's not just any doctor
[38:45.160 --> 38:50.680]  Dr. Deborah Nucatola she is Planned Parenthood Federation of America
[38:50.680 --> 38:55.480]  that's the overreaching group that franchises us out I guess
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.560]  she's the senior director for them of medical services and they did an
[38:59.560 --> 39:03.160]  undercover video of her and she is monologuing like a
[39:03.160 --> 39:07.080]  supervillain and one of the things that is most
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.720]  annoying and frustrating about this and just I don't even know it's just
[39:11.720 --> 39:14.440]  exasperating to see her and her callous
[39:14.440 --> 39:17.960]  cavalier attitude munching away in this restaurant
[39:17.960 --> 39:21.320]  while she's talking about how she's going to chop up body parts
[39:21.320 --> 39:26.280]  a la carte pre-orders on these body parts and we're talking about what she
[39:26.280 --> 39:29.880]  had to say but first this is the way the mainstream media spun it
[39:29.880 --> 39:33.000]  back they wouldn't report it for the first part of the day they waited until
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.720]  the very end of the day so they could come up with a spin on it well one of
[39:35.720 --> 39:39.080]  the things that they did was when they first came out
[39:39.080 --> 39:43.960]  the headline was undercover video shows Planned Parenthood executives
[39:43.960 --> 39:47.160]  discussed it discussing I'm not so disgusted
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.320]  shows Planned Parenthood executive discussing organ harvesting that was
[39:51.320 --> 39:54.920]  the first headline from the Washington Post then they changed it
[39:54.920 --> 39:57.960]  and said no she's not discussing organ harvesting
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.840]  she's discussing fetal organs used for research
[40:02.840 --> 40:09.080]  look if that was true it would simply include the and and I'm sure it is true
[40:09.080 --> 40:11.720]  I'm sure they do use it for research among other things whatever they're
[40:11.720 --> 40:14.920]  doing with it it's an indictment of the entire
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.760]  medical community the entire medical community that is now clamoring across
[40:18.760 --> 40:22.280]  the country to force us to take whatever
[40:22.280 --> 40:26.200]  they tell us that we have to take to remove our informed consent for vaccines
[40:26.200 --> 40:30.840]  as they remove any legal liability from the pharmaceutical companies that make
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.000]  something and call it a vaccine as John Rappapour said when he was on
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.800]  last friday they can do genetic experimentation they can do
[40:39.800 --> 40:43.800]  things that will genetically modify your DNA and they can call that a vaccine
[40:43.800 --> 40:47.560]  they can call anything that they inject into you a vaccine in which case
[40:47.560 --> 40:51.560]  they've been given legal immunity since 1986 so they have every financial
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.600]  incentive to a do no testing to make sure this is safe
[40:56.600 --> 41:01.640]  and be do as much of it as they can but this is what Washington Post says
[41:01.640 --> 41:03.960]  about this in terms of the way they spin it they
[41:03.960 --> 41:07.320]  they changed the headline from organ harvesting
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.360]  to research here's here's some good news in here I really want to thank governor
[41:12.360 --> 41:17.480]  Greg Abbott I am constantly pleasantly surprised at what this man has done
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.480]  since he's been in office a short time he tweeted this out yesterday and this is
[41:21.480 --> 41:24.920]  in the article as well this is an article that's up on
[41:24.920 --> 41:30.360]  infowars.com Greg Abbott tweeted out last night he said I already sued
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.160]  Planned Parenthood for Medicaid fraud now Texas will look into these organ
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.440]  harvesting claims of course it wasn't just the
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.120]  Washington Post it was CNN it was Newsweek it was the New York Times
[41:42.120 --> 41:45.560]  it was all the mainstream media coming back and saying move along
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.440]  there's nothing to see here this is a conspiracy theory this is uh
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.160]  this is the way CNN puts it they said it is a purported video
[41:55.160 --> 41:58.520]  no it's an actual video you can see it you can see it on our site you can see
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.920]  it on the internet I would suggest that you watch it
[42:00.920 --> 42:03.800]  because this is the way they push back on they say the video
[42:03.800 --> 42:07.720]  seemingly shows a member of the conservative Manhattan Institute's
[42:07.720 --> 42:12.200]  Center for Medical Progress claiming to be a startup biotech firm
[42:12.200 --> 42:15.960]  attempting to buy human fetal tissue for medical research Planned Parenthood
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.080]  dismissed the video calling it highly edited no it's not highly edited and
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.480]  it's not a purported video it's for real and let me read you some of the stuff
[42:25.480 --> 42:28.680]  that's there and I'll let the guys play this as a b-roll in the background for
[42:28.680 --> 42:32.360]  people who are watching this but it's difficult to hear it on the
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.120]  radio uh they it is a hidden camera that's that's
[42:36.120 --> 42:41.240]  done at a uh launch meeting and they have it
[42:41.240 --> 42:45.000]  subtitled with large subtitles so you can see that
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.960]  and by the way anybody that wants to say that it is heavily edited
[42:49.960 --> 42:54.120]  the Center for let's say what is the name of this organization Center for
[42:54.120 --> 42:59.560]  Medical Progress that did the investigation they put out a 60 page
[42:59.560 --> 43:06.040]  transcript so you can see everything there okay but what they have her saying
[43:06.040 --> 43:09.800]  and these long monologues that she's got are damning enough
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.560]  let me read some of this to you they ask her how much of a difference
[43:13.560 --> 43:16.920]  can this actually make you know if I kind of know what it's expected or we know
[43:16.920 --> 43:20.840]  what we need so this is what I'm saying this is the pre-order your body parts
[43:20.840 --> 43:24.760]  a la carte and she says well if I know what's expected that makes a huge
[43:24.760 --> 43:28.200]  difference I'd say a lot of people want liver and for that reason
[43:28.200 --> 43:32.200]  most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance
[43:32.200 --> 43:36.360]  so they'll know where they're putting their forceps this kind of rate
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.280]  limiting step of the procedure is calvarium
[43:40.280 --> 43:43.560]  calvarium is the head basically the biggest part you know like
[43:43.560 --> 43:47.320]  Christ was crucified and Calvary the place of the skull the calvarium is
[43:47.320 --> 43:50.360]  the Latin for the skull so she says yeah we
[43:50.360 --> 43:53.960]  we use the skull we try to do that but you know we want to maintain the chest
[43:53.960 --> 43:56.440]  cavity areas what she's saying now here's what she's going back to her exact
[43:56.440 --> 43:59.320]  quotes she says and with the calvarium in general
[43:59.320 --> 44:02.600]  some people will actually try to change the presentation
[44:02.600 --> 44:08.600]  so that it's not vertex okay now understand and this is their comment
[44:08.600 --> 44:11.960]  in the video when they say heavily edited what they did was they added
[44:11.960 --> 44:15.480]  commentary they stopped it at that point they let it go a little bit she says so
[44:15.480 --> 44:17.720]  you start from a breach presentation in other words
[44:17.720 --> 44:20.680]  we don't want it to come from a vertex presentation so
[44:20.680 --> 44:24.520]  we find it useful in order to harvest these organs
[44:24.520 --> 44:28.440]  we find it useful to manipulate the baby into a breach
[44:28.440 --> 44:33.240]  position for birth and so then they put up on the on the video they say well
[44:33.240 --> 44:36.120]  using ultrasound guidance to manipulate the fetus
[44:36.120 --> 44:40.120]  from vertex to breach orientation before intact extraction
[44:40.120 --> 44:46.840]  is the hallmark of the illegal illegal partial birth abortion procedure
[44:46.840 --> 44:51.480]  and they say of course the sale and purchase of human fetal tissue is a
[44:51.480 --> 44:56.840]  federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $500,000
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.720]  now this doctor knows this she knows that what they're doing is illegal
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.560]  and she responds to that she says well you know
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.160]  partial birth abortion is illegal we know that but she says
[45:09.160 --> 45:15.320]  laws are open to interpretation actually they're open to
[45:15.320 --> 45:19.800]  prevarication aren't they doctor to do whatever you want
[45:19.800 --> 45:24.760]  now understand that as I point out moving the child
[45:24.760 --> 45:29.960]  into a breach position is the hallmark of partial birth abortion
[45:29.960 --> 45:35.480]  as I've said before I never really paid any attention to abortion I
[45:35.480 --> 45:39.560]  we were fortunate my wife and I we were never in a situation where we had to
[45:39.560 --> 45:43.560]  make that decision and I feel very bad for people who have
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.400]  had to make that decision I never really approached this
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.240]  from any perspective other than let's say libertarian perspective where it's
[45:51.240 --> 45:53.720]  like I don't want government making decisions for me
[45:53.720 --> 45:57.400]  I'll decide for myself I really hadn't thought this through
[45:57.400 --> 46:01.400]  until I ran for Congress and then I had people asking me because partial
[46:01.400 --> 46:03.880]  birth abortion had just come out at that point time
[46:03.880 --> 46:07.720]  asking me what my position was on it I'd never heard of partial birth abortion
[46:07.720 --> 46:12.680]  so I was curious and looked it up now what they do is they take a baby that is
[46:12.680 --> 46:17.400]  viable that is near to full term they turn the baby around
[46:17.400 --> 46:22.360]  they cause the mother to have a breach birth and then before the baby is fully
[46:22.360 --> 46:26.520]  out of the mother they murder it
[46:26.600 --> 46:30.760]  they murder it that is what this is that's why it is illegal
[46:30.760 --> 46:34.600]  but that is what they're doing so that they can preserve
[46:34.600 --> 46:38.120]  the tissues they want to get the extremities they want to make sure they
[46:38.120 --> 46:41.000]  get all the organs that are in the thoracic area
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.440]  so they're manipulating it as a partial birth abortion
[46:44.440 --> 46:49.640]  they are taking these parts as pre-order tell us what you want we'll get it all
[46:49.640 --> 46:53.640]  a cart for you okay she says at the national office this
[46:53.640 --> 46:56.360]  is the doctor talking again from Planned Parenthood
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.120]  she says at the national office we have a litigation and law department
[47:00.120 --> 47:03.720]  which just really doesn't want us to be in the middle
[47:03.720 --> 47:07.400]  right now on this issue yeah I bet they don't
[47:07.400 --> 47:12.680]  but they are thanks to the work of the people who did that undercover video and
[47:12.680 --> 47:15.480]  that is again the Center for Medical Progress
[47:15.480 --> 47:19.400]  this is the first they say of three videos
[47:19.400 --> 47:23.240]  that are going to be released they say this is a nearly three year long
[47:23.240 --> 47:27.000]  investigation it's part of a documentary that is going to show
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.200]  what is going on with this now one of the things that Planned Parenthood said
[47:32.200 --> 47:36.120]  was and their excuses they say well parents patients
[47:36.120 --> 47:40.680]  sometimes want to donate tissue to scientific research
[47:40.680 --> 47:44.600]  if you watch this video and I suggest you watch it if you can stand it it'll
[47:44.600 --> 47:48.680]  it'll it'll probably get you very upset it should get you very upset unless your
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.240]  conscience has been seared with a hot iron
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.960]  if you look at this there's nothing in there about talking to patients about
[47:57.960 --> 48:01.400]  donating tissue they're saying you tell us what you want
[48:01.400 --> 48:04.760]  we'll get it okay they're not informing the patients
[48:04.760 --> 48:08.360]  they're also not looking after the patient's best interest
[48:08.360 --> 48:14.120]  when they create a breach birth this is something that is an indictment not
[48:14.120 --> 48:17.800]  only of Planned Parenthood this is an indictment of our legal
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.640]  system it's an indictment of our society it's an indictment of medical
[48:21.640 --> 48:24.760]  research in general that they would do something like this
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.440]  I don't care if STEM research is the one that's making money
[48:28.440 --> 48:32.120]  they're playing a shell game saying oh we're not making any money off of this
[48:32.120 --> 48:35.880]  baloney we know exactly what's going on with this and we know that there's a
[48:35.880 --> 48:38.680]  whole chain of people who are making money off of this
[48:38.680 --> 48:44.840]  and this is an indictment as I said of everything in this country we need to
[48:44.840 --> 48:51.160]  shut this down this is this is just I just don't have words for it
[48:51.160 --> 48:55.240]  interesting that as this was all going on yesterday somebody decided that they
[48:55.240 --> 49:00.920]  would hack Scott Walker's website readyforwalker.com I don't know
[49:00.920 --> 49:04.120]  this is a story that came out on Tuesday I don't know if they did it on
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.000]  Monday or not but they hacked readyforwalker.com and redirected it to
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  Planned Parenthood oh great guys aren't they
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.360]  so we've got a lot of candidates who are reacting to this
[49:16.360 --> 49:20.280]  but I want to see the public reacting to this I want people to take a look at
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.400]  this I want you to look at it for yourself I
[49:23.400 --> 49:27.560]  want you to educate others educate yourself many people
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.480]  have sat on the sidelines for decades as I did
[49:31.480 --> 49:34.840]  not understanding what was involved in this many people who had an abortion
[49:34.840 --> 49:38.040]  did not understand what was involved in this I understand that
[49:38.040 --> 49:42.840]  we all understand that we all do things in our life we regret
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.720]  we need to stop though we need to take a close look at what's going on
[49:47.720 --> 49:50.680]  I tell you one of the other things that bothers me this is another article this
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.520]  in the news today man left paralyzed after militarized
[49:54.520 --> 49:58.120]  police fill him with bullet holes because he's got eight ounces of weed
[49:58.120 --> 50:01.080]  this is a guy who's sitting in his chair playing
[50:01.080 --> 50:07.480]  xbox when he gets a SWAT raid and he is shot multiple times and paralyzed
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.400]  the war on drugs another piece of insanity
[50:11.400 --> 50:15.640]  in our society listen with all the stuff going on
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.880]  about El Chapo or El was it Chapo Chapo Chapo
[50:19.880 --> 50:25.800]  Chumpo I don't know anyway this guy that Donald Trump is talking about so much
[50:25.800 --> 50:29.160]  wouldn't it be interesting if Donald Trump would talk about how this guy
[50:29.160 --> 50:33.720]  became a billionaire in the drug trade you know how he became a billionaire you
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.640]  know why he's such a big guy because of our war on drugs because of
[50:37.640 --> 50:42.520]  prohibition it made him a made man like Al Capone
[50:42.520 --> 50:46.120]  prohibition doesn't work it paralyzes people who are playing
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.320]  video games in their home and not bothering anybody
[50:49.320 --> 50:59.160]  say with us we'll be right back we're going to talk about Iran as well
[50:59.160 --> 51:02.760]  so I say to market lunch look you know I keep hearing from the government that
[51:02.760 --> 51:06.280]  you know they're worried someday ISIS may get here and I go duck
[51:06.280 --> 51:11.000]  a garland texas mohammed cartoon shooting ISIS is already here

[52:06.600 --> 52:09.480]  electronic pick pocketing 10 years ago I created a way to protect
[52:09.480 --> 52:12.440]  my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking
[52:12.440 --> 52:16.600]  about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID
[52:16.600 --> 52:20.840]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[52:20.840 --> 52:24.760]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards US passports
[52:24.760 --> 52:29.240]  hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID
[52:29.240 --> 52:32.760]  it was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions and blocking RFID
[52:32.760 --> 52:35.880]  signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there

[55:24.120 --> 55:28.120]  on the left hand side and the last segment we were talking about of course
[55:28.120 --> 55:31.000]  the mexican drug lord who's just escaped from prison the
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  multibillionaire who just escaped from prison and i said you know with all the
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.640]  talk that we have and of course there's a lot of points to be made about the open
[55:37.640 --> 55:40.920]  border the absurdity of the situation the danger of the
[55:40.920 --> 55:45.720]  of the situation that criminals and drug cartels can easily flow through the
[55:45.720 --> 55:51.480]  border how did these drug cartels come into existence
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.440]  though let's not give that part of the story a pass
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.560]  what made this guy as i said just before we went to break
[55:59.560 --> 56:03.560]  what created him what made him a billionaire is the war on drugs what
[56:03.560 --> 56:06.920]  created the drug cartels that are so violent over 30 000 people i don't know
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.880]  what the exact total is uh in mexico have died brutally died i mean this
[56:11.880 --> 56:15.000]  drug cartel that he's had of the sinaloa cartel
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.840]  they had their money laundered by hsbc they were producing ices
[56:18.840 --> 56:23.160]  style videos where they're chopping people's heads off with chainsaws
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.080]  but of course hsbc eric holder's former client
[56:27.080 --> 56:29.960]  was given pretty much a pass for laundering money they even had their
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.640]  own teller window there so we can't talk about the
[56:33.640 --> 56:39.720]  origins or the real problem of the violence which is the drug trade drug
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.560]  prohibition which gives a monopoly to these criminals
[56:43.560 --> 56:46.520]  no we can't talk about that we can only talk about the open borders
[56:46.520 --> 56:49.480]  the open borders and the violence coming across the open borders you
[56:49.480 --> 56:54.120]  understand is a symptom of the problem it is not the origin of the problem
[56:54.120 --> 56:57.880]  and it is the the drug war is the origin of violence within america
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.720]  not even coming into our country from other countries
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.720]  now as as donald trump is talking about this as we look at donald trump
[57:05.720 --> 57:09.240]  it's still very very early i mean all these can is probably going to be some
[57:09.240 --> 57:12.200]  more republicans jump into the race i don't know
[57:12.200 --> 57:15.880]  there's a gazillion of them in there already opposition research is already
[57:15.880 --> 57:19.480]  beginning on donald trump because he's now shot to the front of the pack
[57:19.480 --> 57:23.560]  because he's talked about something that is a concern to republican voters
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.560]  that they used as an issue in the last election then immediately turned their
[57:27.560 --> 57:31.640]  back on it just like they did obama care but now national review is pointing
[57:31.640 --> 57:33.880]  out another issue and you know when we look at
[57:33.880 --> 57:37.960]  at donald trump i i i wonder you know is this guy going to be a dark horse i
[57:37.960 --> 57:41.000]  really think he's really more of a stalking horse i think he's out there
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.480]  putting positions out there for people
[57:43.480 --> 57:46.760]  uh it's kind of like if you don't know what stalking horse is uh jeremiah
[57:46.760 --> 57:49.720]  johnson at one point he hides behind a horse so he can get up
[57:49.720 --> 57:53.240]  close to a bear and the other guy that he's with
[57:53.240 --> 57:55.960]  as they're hiding behind the the the horse to get a closer shot the other
[57:55.960 --> 57:59.000]  guy says uh and you're going to see how many legs
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.040]  we got and the guy says bear doesn't know how many horses
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.120]  how many legs a horse has got uh that's what a stalking horse is is using
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.560]  something as a shield to get in is he a stalking horse for the democrats that
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.080]  he has given so much money to but this is an article even though it's
[58:13.080 --> 58:15.560]  opposition research even though it's coming from national review and the
[58:15.560 --> 58:18.040]  club for growth we know where these guys are coming from it
[58:18.040 --> 58:21.400]  raises some very troubling issues about donald trump
[58:21.400 --> 58:25.800]  and his use of imminent domain do you remember kello the kello decision which
[58:25.800 --> 58:29.000]  said that governments can take other people's private property and give it
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.920]  to someone else donald trump is like a character out of the
[58:32.920 --> 58:36.600]  Pixar movie up except he's the bad guy and we're going to tell you about that

[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.960]  i was talking about donald trump and as i point out opposition researchers
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.720]  are you beginning on this because uh he's shot to first place so
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.560]  national review and club for growth uh some and we know where these guys are
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.760]  coming from uh gonna be supporting bush i'm sure
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.720]  so they're coming out they don't want him to get too far ahead they don't want
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.320]  him to get too big so we're already seeing some opposition research coming
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.680]  out this is the way the game is played nevertheless
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.480]  nevertheless even though we know where this is coming from even though we know
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.600]  they've got an agenda listen to the information that they came
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.320]  out with about donald trump this is something that's been around for a
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.160]  while largely forgotten the point out in the infamous
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.760]  2005 kello decision from the supreme court that held that public use could
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.040]  include well private use as long as the new property
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.240]  owners paid more taxes than the previous one in other words it allowed
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.320]  developers and the government to gang up on homeowners remember up
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.480]  the pixar film where you've got the older guy doesn't want to leave his home
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.400]  they build they offer him all kinds of money they start to build the
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.840]  thing around his house until they can find a way to get him out well the way
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.840]  that trump uh got a widow out of his house is
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.080]  very interesting and this is i think a very big issue it certainly is a big
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.080]  issue to me the idea that large crony
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.280]  capitalists people who are well connected in government
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:02.040]  can throw us out of our homes this is the central issue in my opinion with the
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.240]  keystone pipeline people can debate the environmentalism
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.200]  of it they can debate the jobs aspect of it
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.520]  uh nevertheless what concerns me about this and i have an opinion on those
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.440]  things as well but what concerns me and what is a game stopper for the keystone
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:21.880]  pipeline in my opinion is that trans canada a foreign corporation
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.640]  multinational corporation based in canada has been given the right of
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.160]  imminent domain that they can throw people who are on their farms for over
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.440]  a hundred years just throw them off of their property
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.360]  because they're connected this is what donald trump did
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.640]  they say a decade and a half ago it was fresh on everyone's mind that donald
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.360]  trump is one of the leading users of this state
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.720]  sanctioned form of thievery this is from the national review
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.440]  it was all over the news and perhaps the most remembered example john stossel
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.560]  got him to sputter on about how if he wasn't allowed to steal an elderly
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.080]  woman's house in order to expand his atlantic city casino
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.640]  the government would get less money now he also had another case that was in
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.120]  bridgeport connecticut in 1995 he says there he was telling everybody
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.880]  dump was said we're going uh trump said we're going to have a national
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.160]  tourist destination by building a 350 million dollar
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.360]  combined amusement park shipping terminal seaport village
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.080]  and office complex on the east side of the harbor the wrinkle was
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.600]  five businesses and the city owned pleasure beach
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.640]  now occupy the land he says so what do we do
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.320]  trump says the city would become partner with trump connecticut
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:36.440]  ink and obtain the land through its powers of condemnation
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.120]  trump would buy the land from the city that's the way the
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.840]  current put it the connecticut current this is what happened the entire
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.400]  development would cost the city nothing trump said no private homeowners would
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.480]  be affected because there's no dwellings on the land
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.680]  trump would own everything but he would throw five businesses
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.720]  out and take over their businesses why because he has a more important business
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.360]  he's a bigger business he can make more taxes for the city
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.000]  okay now we get to atlantic city with an elderly widow
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.960]  vera coking she'd owned property near trump plaza hotel for three decades and
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.600]  she didn't want to move trump thought the land was better
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.400]  suited for use as a park or a parking lot or an area for waiting limousines
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.280]  he tried to negotiate at one point he offered her a million dollars for the
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.200]  land she wasn't taking it so he got the new jersey casino
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.240]  reinvestment development authority to file a lawsuit
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.200]  tell her she had to leave in 90 days and he would give her
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.240]  a quarter of a million dollars a quarter of what he had offered
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.840]  she fought in court she won this is before kello
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:48.680]  but look this is crony capitalism this is the idea of someone who loves money
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.120]  that is the root of all evil if you define yourself
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.640]  your net worth by what you have in the bank you're a clueless
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:02.120]  fool stay with us we'll be right back on monday obama's defense secretary said
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.320]  that the pentagon's ban on transgendered individuals
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.680]  is outdated and the administration has ordered a study
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.960]  to end the practice at a time when our troops have learned from experience
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.000]  that the most important qualification for service members
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.520]  should be whether they are able and willing to do their job
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.160]  our officers and enlisted personnel are faced with certain rules that tell them
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.160]  the opposite the defense secretary said in december
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.480]  air force secretary deborah lee james said anyone who is capable of
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.440]  accomplishing the job should be able to serve
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.920]  adding that times change it is also supported by the former defense
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.520]  secretary chuck hagel contrast all those statements of
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:48.520]  inclusiveness with soldiers at ford hood being told that christians
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.680]  are a radical terror threat you can find more reports

[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.920]  lot of stations carry news at the top of the hour
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.400]  i was talking about opposition research uh that was on donald trump
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.920]  essentially pointing out that 15 years ago 20 years ago
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:00.520]  he was championing the cause of uh confiscation of private property for
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.040]  big corporations that's just where the sky is coming from
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.120]  you need to understand when somebody the thing that's troubled me many people
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.840]  keep writing me all the time what about donald trump what about donald trump
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.040]  look i understand what he said about open borders i understand
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.560]  the whole idea of catch and release of dangerous criminals but like i pointed
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.680]  out in the last hour let's talk about the origin
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.840]  of people like el chapo el chomchompo whatever the guy's name
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.720]  i don't know but let's talk about this little criminal
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.640]  who is now a multi-billionaire because of our policies because of the war on
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.120]  drugs and understand that the war on drugs is a u n agenda just like a u n
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:42.680]  agenda 21 the u n created it down to the four levels of
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.520]  drugs four classes of drugs the four schedules of drugs they created that
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.760]  10 years before nixon declared war on drugs before the federal government
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.640]  enacted that into law for which they did not have
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.920]  legal authority i would add remember that when we had
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.720]  alcohol prohibition they had to add a constitutional amendment because there
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.080]  is nothing in the constitution that gives the federal government
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:11.960]  the lawful authority to prohibit anything it required a specific constitutional
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.600]  amendment it took another one to overturn it
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.320]  nevertheless when it came to the 20th century we didn't care about the
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.760]  constitution anymore the latter part of the 20th century i should say
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.560]  we didn't care about it by mid-century so nixon enacted a u n agenda and that is
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.840]  the source of the violent crime in our country as well
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.760]  as in mexico as well as the violent criminals coming across i understand
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.120]  the catch and release issues but we need to get to the root issues and we need
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.480]  to understand that when somebody comes this is just my
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.680]  personal opinion on trump it bothers me very much when the guy announces his
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.760]  candidacy and his big thing is to brag about his
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.160]  net worth and like i said just before we went to the break
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:54.920]  if you think your net worth is based on the dollars in your bank account
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.680]  you have a serious character problem serious character problem anyone who
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.200]  loves money we have to understand that is the root
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.120]  of all evil we have to understand that people who love money that much
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.440]  people like john d rockefeller when he was asked how much is enough he was a
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.400]  richest man in the world and the reporter asked him how much
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.600]  mr rockefeller how much money is enough he said just a little more
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.600]  you have to understand it is an addiction talk about drugs hey
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.560]  money is an addiction to folks you can be addicted to it you can be the servant
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.360]  of it it can be the source of all evil i want people in character
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.360]  who have who have character who will be the leaders of this country i want
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.040]  people who understand the issues to be the leaders of this country
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.320]  not somebody like donald trump who would use
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.040]  the new jersey casino organization to throw a little old lady
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.440]  out of her house because he wanted it for parking lot this is like something
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.960]  straight out of pixar's up he offered a million dollars
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.600]  she wouldn't take it should live there for 30 years she didn't want to move so
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.640]  he got the gaming authority to throw her out tell her she's got 90 days to go
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.440]  and i'll pay you a quarter of what i paid you earlier
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.960]  that's the kind of guy that's proud of his negotiations
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.960]  he talks like a gangster he operates casinos he acts like a gangster
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.960]  he's a crony capitalist i'm not interested okay and donald trump so don't
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.800]  write me about donald trump anymore okay i'm done with donald trump and we
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.760]  haven't even started the stupid presidential election you need to
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.440]  understand the presidential election is just a side show
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.520]  anyway folks if we're ever going to change things in this country we're
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.960]  going to do it at the local level we're going to understand
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.880]  that we have a system of law part of that system of law
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.800]  are juries where we take it upon ourselves
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.960]  to watch each other's backs to judge the law
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.600]  as well as the facts of the case even though most of the judges in this country
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.960]  will lie to you about that and it's
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.320]  even in the constitution of many of the states but it is part of
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.400]  our legal tradition it was understood by our founders it goes back to england
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.040]  this is something that goes back a very long time but we have
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.480]  such a corrupt judicial system that most of the judges will
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.320]  lie to you about it they'll throw you off the jury if they know that that's why
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.120]  you're basing your decision on so don't tell them
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.200]  act like the government keep your secret agenda do whatever you want to do
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.880]  don't tell them but you sit there and you judge the facts of the case because
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:29.960]  you know what folks one out of 12 persons can shut down
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.960]  this criminal system we've got one vote at a time
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:39.720]  okay called the 8% solution that's all it needs we need 8% of the people who
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:43.160]  will stand up on principle and say i'm going to look at this
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:47.400]  law whether this is good or not and i'm going to make my decision on that
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.280]  we also can have state nullification but the whole idea
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.160]  that we're going to get somebody elected that we're going to send some one
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.920]  individual to washington i understand the importance of having a leader who can
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.640]  articulate principles that's why i like ran paul
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.640]  he's not perfect okay but he can articulate some of the things that are
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.560]  there we go right there the 8% solution i didn't come up with that i
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.720]  thought i did somebody already thought of it they put a
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.440]  web page out there about that uh we need somebody who's going to articulate
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.480]  the fundamental problems that are before our society right now and i don't
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.000]  think anybody does it better than ran paul and again he's not perfect i don't
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.680]  rubber stamp everything that he does but he does it far better than anybody
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.600]  else that's out there but we're not going to have
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.960]  a mr smith go to washington and make everything all better
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.840]  it ain't going to happen we're going to have to do it at the local level we're
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.640]  going to have to do it lower down let me tell you something
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.160]  when i was involved with a libertarian party i realized that what these guys
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:44.280]  were doing they were trying to focus everything on the highest level races
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.400]  we couldn't we would have to spend all of our energy just trying to get on the
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.040]  ballot because you know the republicans and democrats they always give
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.880]  themselves an open spot on the ballot they're always in the debates of course
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.080]  you had to spend so much money as an independent or a third party to get on
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.680]  the ballot and then of course they wouldn't let you into the debates
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:05.160]  our ballot retention was based upon the number of votes we got for governor or
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.720]  for president in north carolina so they deliberately skew the game to get you
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.160]  focused on the most difficult races to win the most
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.560]  difficult place to make a change and completely suck up all your resources
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.760]  that's what the national press does to the american population until we focus
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.520]  on things at the state level use jury nullification use state
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.040]  nullification get good people elected in state government we're not going to
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.680]  see anything change we have to start shutting down
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.200]  washington excising it out of our life like we would
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.320]  if it was a cancer let's go on to uh iran i want to talk a little bit about
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.000]  iran i don't understand fully everything that's in the deal but let's
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.440]  look at what we know about it and let's start with
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.200]  the two different sides because i look at dick cheney
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.960]  lindsay graham john mccain on one side the neocons
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.320]  i look at the obama administration on the other side we've got valerie jaret
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.600]  somebody who went to iran her parents took her to iran because they hated
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.800]  america so much she was born in iran she's an iranian
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.720]  citizen she's essentially the henry kissinger or zabignou
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.200]  brzezinski of the obama administration she has a lot of influence and power
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:18.440]  and so when i look at this i look at this like well i don't get any clues as to
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.440]  which side to pick right there okay i'm also not an israel
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.000]  first or i don't have a dog in that fight okay so i'm looking at this
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.160]  strictly from what's happening here and i course uh let's let
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.400]  some of these people weigh in let's go to the clip that we've got of dick cheney
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.040]  let's start with that clip uh there's one interesting thing in the agreement
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.960]  today this is the last sentence of the first paragraph
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:48.840]  it says iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will iran ever seek
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.320]  develop or acquire any nuclear weapons now who the heck believes that
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.200]  uh it's just beyond me uh i try to understand what it is brock obama
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.880]  thinks he's achieving here why he looks at the world and okay that's good yeah
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.400]  like that interesting dick cheney is actually reading
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.920]  he says hey i'm looking at this agreement it's like this is a guy who just
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.640]  they basically just did whatever they wanted to during the uh
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.960]  during the bush administration and he said who believes this that's right
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:19.400]  dick cheney when dick cheney calls you out on credibility you've got problems
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.160]  okay this is the guy who got us involved in a war
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.440]  based on lies okay a war with iraq uh so he he calls it out on uh
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.280]  on lies let's go to uh the clip from trump trump has a little bit different
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.400]  take on this let's talk about the iran deal the president
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.000]  said that it's not built on trust it's built on verification
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.760]  it's not true it's absolutely not true how do you know that they can do whatever
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.240]  they want to do because i know many of the people involved in the
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.240]  negotiation the iranians are very good negotiators the
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.720]  persians are always great negotiators they are laughing at us back in iran
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.920]  and why didn't we get our prisoners back why doesn't somebody say
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.200]  where are our prisoners nobody's even talking about we have four people that
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.000]  are in prison that shouldn't be why couldn't they make that part of the
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.720]  deal okay i don't know i i didn't have time to
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.200]  look up what he's talking about in terms of prisoners so
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.240]  but that's a good point okay but nevertheless we see other neocon
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.760]  commentators like mark levin and we have an article up on info wars dot com
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.960]  from breitbart mark levin says the iran deal has planted the
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:22.040]  seeds for world war three this is munich okay this is appeasement
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:27.320]  because you know if you don't push for war then you are an appeaser that's
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.160]  what we're told all the time uh cheney also said the one thing
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.480]  that really disturbed me was when we said that we have quote stopped the
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.320]  proliferation of nuclear weapons that's a lie yeah absolutely it is a lie
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.280]  you know we've had sanctions and i'll talk about this when we come back
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.040]  we've had sanctions against iran since 1979
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.640]  so it didn't stop them from getting as far along as they are so
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.240]  i question whether or not the sanctions have been effective
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.440]  or not and of course there were more sanctions that were put on by the
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.600]  bush administration with dick cheney we'll be right back
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.800]  we we are a survival company we manufacture our own line of level

[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.960]  in the next segment we're going to be joined by Dr. Group and Anthony Gucciardi
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.840]  from Natural Society we're also going to open up the phone lines and you'll be
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.640]  able to ask Dr. Group questions there's a lot of news a lot of
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.760]  health news has come out of course as I mentioned earlier in the show
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.520]  a movement in California this is an article up on info wars.com California
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.840]  now wants to be the first state to mandate adult
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.240]  vaccines with criminal penalties for those who refuse
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.080]  say it never stops you let them do that to parents to children
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.920]  they will then move to one class of adults to another class of adults
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.680]  we have absolutely no rights in that respect we also see and this is
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.360]  interesting I think uh judges are now saying that
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:25:00.120]  nuns must obey Obama on Obamacare this is a story from W&D they say two
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.760]  judges on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.480]  have ruled that the Obama administration can force
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.080]  nuns from the little sisters of the poor in Denver
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.680]  to pay for abortion causing drugs you're forcing
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.160]  nuns to pay for abortion forcing drugs okay
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.360]  they're these are nuns we're talking about two to one
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.200]  there you go there's our rights just out the window the first amendment out the
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.240]  window because we've got two judges who say so
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.720]  two judges okay they say although there's an exception for churches
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.800]  faith-based faith-based groups like the little sisters of the poor
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.400]  who run homes for needy elderly around the world
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.640]  have to comply or face penalties this is why we have the first amendment
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.520]  because the government shouldn't be sitting there deciding
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.280]  okay this church gets it but that group doesn't because they don't have an
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.880]  official worship service they just help the poor and needy so we're
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.920]  going to hit them with a hammer we're going to mandate that they buy
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.000]  insurance from our corporate sponsors this is naked
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.200]  crony capitalism folks written large this underscores
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.280]  that anything that anything that the government wants
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.800]  to trump the first amendment will trump the first amendment if they have the
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.600]  slightest concern in it they'll take away your first amendment rights
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.440]  here's what one of the nuns said as little sisters of the poor
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.360]  we simply cannot choose between our care for the elderly poor
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.480]  and our faith we should not have to make that choice
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.560]  because it violates our nation's commitment to ensuring that people from
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.480]  diverse faiths can freely follow God's calling in their lives
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:40.200]  see the first amendment says that government shall make no law
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:45.000]  bridging the freedom of speech or the free exercise of
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.800]  religion but of course Congress doesn't make the laws anymore the
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.200]  supreme court does so the supreme court should be there as a check
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.560]  against a congress that makes a law that violates
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.760]  our freedom of speech our freedom of the free exercise of religion but instead
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:06.040]  they write the law nobody checks them listen when we look at these cases like
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.040]  this case in california there was just a an article up from
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.400]  washington post about how the accountant of auschwitz has been sentenced to four
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.560]  years in prison for 300 000 deaths this guy is in his late 90s
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.920]  he was a bookkeeper who catalogued the cash and the valuables
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.600]  pulled from the new arrivals at Auschwitz okay
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.600]  they give him four years which i guess is a life sentence when you're 96
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:34.120]  what did he do wrong okay why what did he do that we're not doing here
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.880]  when we look at Auschwitz besides the the mass murder when we look at
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.240]  the medical experimentation going on by joseph mingala
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.480]  the justification was this is for the greater good yes i'm doing horrific
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.840]  things to these people without their consent
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.520]  but this is for the greater good how are we any different
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.520]  from those people briefly before we get joined by
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.080]  dr group and anthony gutcher already in the next segment
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.520]  i wanted to go back to iran because i was just starting to talk about what
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.240]  actually happened with it what what is going to happen
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.280]  what we had here was a removal of 18 billion dollars in sanctions
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.480]  okay so they're going to get 18 billion dollars in sanctions let's put that in
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.800]  perspective 18 billion dollars uh taken away of
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.720]  sanctions from iran we have an 18 trillion dollar debt
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.160]  in this country an 18 trillion dollar economy essentially
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.360]  we're a thousand times larger than they are i don't think
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:36.280]  that this is going to make them a superpower challenge to us we have to
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:42.520]  understand that these sanctions have been put in place since 1979 they put
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.160]  sanctions in place when iran took over the embassy they
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.360]  increased those sanctions in 1995 they increased them again
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.440]  in 2006 did it change anything did it stop them
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:57.240]  from creating centrifuges or working on nuclear reactors no
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.680]  it had absolutely no effect so to say that this is
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.480]  world war three that this is munich all over that this is
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.920]  nuclear proliferation i just don't buy it i really don't
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.120]  why did we put the sanctions on them in 1979 well of course it's because they
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.840]  took over the american embassy why did they do that
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.440]  what we that's where our understanding of history begins but it actually goes
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:26.040]  back to 1953 the first successful cia coup was in iran
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.240]  they established the shot of iran and the cia
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:35.160]  put in the savak a brutal secret police i learned about that when i was in
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.600]  high school from engineering students who were from iran
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.560]  that's what i've been concerned ever since i realized our government did it
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.360]  there i realized our government can do it here
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.400]  that's what i've been concerned about since then that's my biggest concern
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.080]  not what's going on the middle east they will be right back the empires on the
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:59.080]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.000]  you may have seen the disgusting and disturbing hidden camera footage
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.480]  shot by the center for medical progress of a planned parenthood exec discussing
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:12.920]  harvesting baby organs while stuffing her face with salad and wine info wars
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:16.760]  dot com writer steve watson noted that the washington post even changed its
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.680]  headline from undercover video shows planned parenthood exec discussing
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.560]  organ harvesting to undercover video shows planned
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:27.640]  parenthood official discussing fetal organs used for research the story
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.800]  itself was edited with body parts like heart and liver being changed to tissue
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.320]  yet no note was made of any changes by the publication because there's a
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.440]  politically correct way to talk about harvesting baby organs
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.200]  and then there's the truth meanwhile all democratic candidates have been silent
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.360]  on the alleged planned parenthood felonies that's right it's a felony to
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.520]  harvest organs of aborted babies watch the video and check out the article

[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.720]  i'm david night and joining me now in studio is anthony gucciardi from natural
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:27.320]  society and doctor group and we want to take some of your
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:31.320]  calls where you can ask doctor group questions that number is going to be
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:37.880]  800-259-9231 again that's 800-259-9231 that'll be
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.840]  questions for doctor group and before we get to those calls and so on
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.400]  point out as you were we're talking before the break during the break rather
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.920]  about what's going on with monsanto there was an article a couple of days ago
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:55.080]  on info wars dot com which of your foods are sprayed with roundup
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.560]  just three days before harvest uh an amazing it's pretty much amazing
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:03.960]  we look at this anthony is pretty much everything that is a staple food
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.960]  wheat corn pretty much everything is on that list and at the same time we now
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.400]  have monsanto pushing back against the findings from the world health
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.360]  organization that came out said yeah we thank glyphosate which is roundup
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.360]  we think that it is carcinogenic carcinogenic and now monsanto
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.840]  is hiring a research firm to give them the results that they want
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.040]  right and they also bought the b research firm after it was found out that
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.400]  their herbicides were killing the bees yeah right so it's it's pretty easy to
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.120]  see how they work that's global warming there was just an article about that
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.080]  the other day it's forget the the pesticides it's now global warming
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.040]  that's going right right of course even though there's studies over and over
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.240]  again yeah and this this segment i'd like to cover a few things i'd like to
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:49.000]  cover how we actually could get a new gmo regulation plan in place in the
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.920]  white house is saying they might do it
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.440]  the gmo pigs that could be coming to your dinner table
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.760]  how living in nature can boost your income up to 20 000 according to this
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.560]  study and make you feel seven years younger we could talk
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.360]  about the garter cell vaccine and a bunch of different stuff
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.360]  but first before i segue into dr group and we start taking your calls and all
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.160]  that i want to talk about a piece that's really important
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.200]  and that's one that a lot of people missed and that's called activism works
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:17.800]  white house announces new gmo regulation plan i wrote this
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:21.560]  a few days ago and what's happened now is the white house has
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.800]  announced in a memorandum that we they say we understand people want gmo
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.320]  labeling we promise we're actually going to do something about it now
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:33.400]  of course i don't necessarily believe them but this is good news because it
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.520]  shows that they're actually being forced to answer to us
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.800]  and they're being forced to say this is what they they say in this memorandum
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.920]  that so many people millions of millions of millions of citizens have voiced
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.440]  concern about it that they're looking into an independent third party group
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.960]  to verify the scientific integrity and safety of gmo's
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.720]  and look into gmo labeling plans nationwide oh that'd be great
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.200]  and but you look at the flip side of that and there's that monsanto protection
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.920]  act that's been reintroduced by mike pompio
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.280]  and that would ban gmo labeling in the united states and we're going to talk
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.320]  about that too and what you've also got the treaties the transatlantic
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.680]  trans-pacific partnership treaties which could make this
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.720]  moot you know they could just take this away with one stroke so they could come
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.760]  out and say yeah you know we did this for you guys we heard you we
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.640]  enacted this but now we've got the treaty that takes it away and the bottom line
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.680]  is vigilant everywhere yeah you can't rely on the government and that's why
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.360]  dr group i want to segue into some of the things we can do for ourselves
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.480]  and also take everybody's calls because at the end of the day
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.720]  you cannot rely on the government to protect you no i mean my solution for
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.440]  that is just don't purchase anything that has the toxic compounds in it and
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.920]  continue the activism and continue to fight against the gmo's
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.280]  you know that is good that the government is announcing that you know
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:50.200]  obama came out and said that uh one of the things if he was elected is he was
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.560]  going to require gmo labeling and you know with march against monsanto the
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.400]  monsanto video revolt we've done a lot of good
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.560]  also i mean now they have non gmo verified but like you said i mean who
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:07.480]  knows there's a there's a big fight going on right now between the government
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:13.240]  the pharmaceutical companies the vaccine issues the gmo issues
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.080]  my solution is just going back to nature really and and
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:22.280]  looking and educating people and determining let me know i mean is this
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.360]  food toxic i'm about to feed to my child or i'm about to put in my mouth i mean
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:30.280]  it really goes back to simplicity and the basics and things and just
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.880]  understanding more about your body and understanding about food
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.480]  and avoiding those things i mean now people are not buying as much chemicals
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.360]  people are not they're switching over to natural things and
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:47.560]  as you can see with the big companies the chemical companies
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:51.640]  they're all racing to come out with organic products and natural products
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.960]  right now because of the demand out there from the general consumer so
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.280]  in one area we're making a lot of progress and then
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.400]  in the other area we're getting a lot of opposition but i don't think the
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.520]  opposition is to the point where it's actually taking over
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:10.680]  the consumer because when it goes down to yeah they know people there's no
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.400]  question people even mcdonald's is out there saying
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.960]  we're going to make our stuff healthier we're going to get rid of gmo's or
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.480]  anything but in most cases it's just a head fake you talk about non gmo
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.320]  verified i mean that doesn't mean that they can't put pesticides on it
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.000]  it just means that the pesticides wouldn't be gmo pesticides right so it's a
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.360]  bit of a head fake from the grocery industry just like we see that coming
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.800]  from from mcdonald's and now this bill here might be
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.480]  just a head fake from the political industry okay so we have to
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.600]  watch out for our own food yeah there are a lot of head fakes out there just
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:44.520]  look at the bpa baby bottle head fake they made everybody focus on baby
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.800]  bottles yet they're still lining every single can and mill
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.320]  carton and everything else with bpa so there there is a lot of truth to that
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:55.160]  the good news is though that organic is booming and monsanto lost
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.760]  100 plus million dollars in the fourth quarter last year monsanto's
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.720]  i mean at mcdonald's they mixed them up they're basically the same thing
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.840]  mcdonald's is closing 700 stores in the united states
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.360]  and they're losing so much money every month they've stopped reporting on it
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.120]  okay and it just goes to show the opposition against gmo's is real
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.240]  the only people standing up for gmo's are the ones that are basically being
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:18.440]  paid off on it like hillary clinton says that monsanto's gmo's are great and
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.600]  obviously she's going to support them and it goes back to not trusting things
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.160]  like the white house memorandum saying that they're going to look into a new
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:29.320]  gmo regulation plan but it is a powerful message and we do have the clip
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:33.880]  ready i believe where obama and promised in 2007 that he was going to label
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.480]  gmo's just so everyone's clear this is what's going on these are the lies that
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.840]  get people elected because they know the public is for this so maybe we could
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.120]  play that clip it'll be transparent too here's what i'll do as president i'll
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:49.480]  immediately implement country of origin labeling because
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.440]  americans should know where their food comes from
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.960]  we'll let folks know whether their food has been genetically modified because
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.000]  americans should know what they're buying we'll let folks know whether their
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.120]  food has been genetically modified because americans should know what
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:05.400]  they're buying we agree now is the time to label
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.200]  genetically modified foods because americans have a right to know what
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.600]  they're buying
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:20.360]  And of course he didn't keep that promise notice. He says immediately will enact GMO labeling and everyone's like yeah, let's do it
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.700]  Yeah, we love you
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:25.400]  Wait a minute. It's 2015. That was in 2007
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.680]  Right. I'm still waiting for him to be honest and transparent. Yeah, where is it?
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.960]  And there's been a letter written by just label it.org
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:38.400]  I think we have it over here somewhere it basically just says Obama you promised to label GMOs in 2007 everyone's seen the video
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.800]  We know you said it. Where is it?
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:46.920]  And then he says, well, well, you know the White House we put out this memorandum and it's it's some we're gonna work on this
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.000]  No, no, no, we weren't gonna work on it in 2007. We were gonna do it
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.800]  Mm-hmm. That just shows though the manipulation. They know what people want 90 plus percent want labeling but anyway
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:02.320]  Yeah, I mean and not only the GMO issue, but like you said the glyphosate the glyphosate the atrazine
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.440]  I mean all that stuff the endocrine disrupting chemicals that are flowing off into the water supply and that's why
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.160]  You know the earth is sick
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.440]  I mean you look around and you see all the people that are sick out there, but the earth is also sick trees are dying
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:19.200]  We're losing 200 species every single day. We have
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:27.640]  The air quality is contaminated the water the food everything so but the good news is there's solutions to that
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:32.240]  I mean you can clean the air quality in your home so you can breathe clean air you can clean up the food
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.080]  So you can eat clean food
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.280]  You can clean up and drink clean water you can detoxify your body on a regular basis
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:44.880]  Yeah, so, you know, that's the whole purpose you have to understand how to combat the system and how
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.680]  Look and understand what they're doing and then at the same time utilize technologies
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:55.440]  In your own life and your own family's life to make sure that you're avoiding all that just what I was saying earlier
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:01.360]  We have to understand what their globalist plans are, but we have to act locally specifically for our own interests
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.160]  That's what we have to do. Let's go to some of the calls. Let's go to Trish in Canada Trish
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.960]  Your call for dr. Group
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.600]  Hi there. How are you today? No good. What's your question?
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:15.040]  My question is in regards to managing chronic pain
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.040]  supplements
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040]  nutritionals
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.760]  Okay, that's actually a pretty good question. I don't know where you're in pain, but
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:30.560]  Uh, the normal medical approach obviously to treating pain is with pain medications and that ultimately doesn't
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.120]  address the root cause of why you're in pain to begin with
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.800]  One of the things that I've used that's worked really really good over the years is just cleansing the body
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.600]  I mean, everybody has a self healing mechanism
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:48.480]  Within their bone body. I mean, we were born with it and that's something that is not taught in any school
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.840]  Out there. I mean all all the schools and the training that I went through no one ever taught me
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.400]  about the self healing mechanism
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.520]  Just after evaluating hundreds of thousands of individuals that we've put through
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:08.720]  intestinal cleansing and liver and cleansing and chemical and heavy metal cleansing and got all of those chemicals and toxins
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.360]  out of their body
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.640]  Then and open up their elimination routes and change their diet and to where you're eating healthy
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:23.200]  Your body has the ability to heal itself of anything whether it's pain whether it's any type of degenerative illness
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:29.040]  It just is crying out for you to clean it up and detoxify your body
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:35.120]  And so what we would do for individuals with pain is start with an intestinal cleanse using the oxy powder
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:41.200]  Then go on to liver cleansing then chemical and heavy metal cleansing and parasite cleansing
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:46.880]  And at that point in time if you're in pain your liver is already seriously congested
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:54.400]  You've probably you've been on pain medications which damage the intestinal tract and the liver which are by the way two organ systems
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.600]  that the medical profession has tried to
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:06.000]  Reduce the amount of information on and not train doctors on over the years because they know that those are the biggest secrets behind
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:12.240]  Health is a healthy intestinal tract and a healthy liver and by the way the liver is the only organ in the body that
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.720]  Regenerates itself and regrows fully. That's why you can do a partial liver transplant
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.760]  You'll regrow it and the intestinal cells actually turn over every 24 hours as well
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.320]  So back to the pain. I suggest doing a complete body cleanse, but a couple other things that work really good natural
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:34.400]  oregano oil for some people has the same effects as morphine
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:40.080]  But it's all natural and it's non-toxic and it's not an opiate. So you're not going to become addicted to it
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:46.240]  Also high dose vitamin D. There was a great book written by a guy named Jeff bulls
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.320]  I think and it was the miraculous healing benefits of d3
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.720]  And what he did he had pains all over his body joint pain. He was martial artist athlete
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:03.520]  And this has been documented now. This was probably a couple years ago with hundreds upon hundreds of people
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.280]  And that have been taking upwards of 25,000 I use to 50,000
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.400]  I use a day and please consult your healthcare practitioner
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.480]  Or your medical doctor because we're not allowed to actually give out any medical advice
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:22.080]  But I highly recommend anybody in pain that has joint pain joint popping anything like that
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.080]  look into
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.720]  reading the miraculous healing benefits of
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:35.520]  Megadoses or high doses of d3 and we actually have here the winter sun, which is a vegetarian vegan source of d3
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.680]  Which is a really active form and that's one of the things that I recommend
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:47.200]  Pretty much everybody take because when we look at and do the research and trace back all these chemicals
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.760]  And how they affect the body and then what type of nutrients we can use and what type of things
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:57.200]  Pretty much everybody's deficient in we know now that every cell in the body has iodine receptors
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:03.120]  We know that that was taken out of the marketplace on purpose. It's been suppressed. It's heavily regulated by the DEA
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.200]  As a matter of fact, we had to go through massive interview processing
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:14.880]  Just to be able to procure the deep earth iodine crystals to produce the survival shield x2
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:22.800]  So also iodine works for pain, but really getting back to the basics cleaning your body up and looking at
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:29.840]  Determining the root cause and avoiding all the chemicals and toxins in your lifestyle that you have oregano
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.440]  oil and d3 and iodine and you notice now
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:40.160]  We can talk about this too this headline from nature super muscly pigs created by small genetic tweak
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:46.800]  And the reason I bring this up about GMO pigs is because as you were saying everything really comes down to cleansing the body
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.280]  giving the body what it's neat what it needs and so many people I think are in pain because
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.080]  They're increasing their threshold of toxic intake on a daily basis. I mean the new
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:03.040]  GMO creations that we face on a daily basis the new herbicide pesticide exposure the radiation from Fukushima
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:07.760]  Everything is hitting us all at one time and we're seeing explosion of diseases across the world
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:12.000]  And how are we supposed to deal with these things? Well, we develop products, you know, we develop supplements
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.360]  We try to do healthy habits and everything like that, but at the end of the day
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.080]  It's just such a load on our bodies
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:21.520]  So I think you know the root cause is also the attack on our systems
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:28.320]  You could teach any doctor or any individual person how to pretty much eliminate any symptoms
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:34.160]  In less than about three or four hours because it comes and this is something that just amazed me and I didn't learn this
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:40.080]  It took a long time to realize but when you think about it, it's really in simplicity is that
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.160]  All it boils down to is every single person is born with a self healing mechanism
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:50.960]  And that's your body's own ability to heal any type of symptom. So technically
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  There's really not any such thing as disease out there, you know cancer arthritis heart disease whatever you have mental illness to
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.680]  Whether you're suffering from depression anxiety
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:09.200]  It's all because your body's self healing mechanism. All those things are just a list of symptoms and an identified
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.840]  disease attached to those symptoms
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.480]  But when people understand how easy it is and how fast the body really wants to heal itself
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:25.600]  Just by cleansing itself out. Look at the earth and look at animals, you know, the earth cleanses itself as well
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:32.160]  And with wind and rain and snow. I mean now you have geo engineering actually trying to manipulate the earth and
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.920]  Prevent cleansing of the earth the natural cleansing of the earth unfortunately
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:43.920]  But it really is in simplicity and it's amazing what happens and how fast you can regenerate the body
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:52.320]  And how fast you can eliminate symptoms just by getting on a few nutrients and paying attention and focusing on
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:55.520]  Reactivating your body's self healing mechanism
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.920]  Just making sure that your body is as healthy as possible so that it works as well as possible really you mentioned anthony
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:08.800]  The gmo pig I guess makes me think about spam and we got somebody wants to ask a question about school lunches
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:12.560]  Maybe that includes the gmo pig sherry in colorado. Go ahead
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.840]  Hi, thank you for taking my call
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.480]  I have a girl in middle school and with everything that's going on
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:27.120]  I'm just afraid that you know school lunches might have a whole bunch of gmo's in them that we're not aware of
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:36.880]  Well, you're right, you know anytime you assume things like that most of the time you can feel it and it's really sad that
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.920]  The majority of the schools
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.360]  It's almost the worst food that you could feed the children. You don't want to eat michelle obama maggot lunches
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:49.360]  What's wrong with that? Haven't you seen the pictures? It looks delicious
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:56.240]  Well, you maybe you might want to eat that but uh, I mean if I was in a survival state, maybe it's probably actually I'm eating a
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.720]  Maggots probably actually healthier believe it or not then what you're gonna get in school lunches
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.080]  Look at this headline michelle. Oh lunches to expand to daycares as well. You know, they've always been really bad
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.720]  It reminds me that old woody ellen joke about the two ladies to go to a restaurant and the one says the food was horrible
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.120]  And the other one said yeah, and then such small quantities too
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.960]  I mean, that's basically what michelle obama school lunches, right? I mean my recommendation
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:24.480]  I get that question all the time and I know some schools are very particular and usually what
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:33.120]  People do is they just tell the school principal or whoever they need to talk to over there that the child has allergies
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:37.360]  And they usually they'll allow them to bring a lunch with them
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:41.600]  Although a lot of times they make them sit over in the corner with all the other kids with allergies
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:47.600]  But I mean it is a solution to pack a good organic toxin free lunch for your child and just
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.640]  Tell them you have there. We're gonna be right back. We're talking to dr. Group taking your calls

[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.080]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:08.880]  10 years ago
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:14.400]  I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national id card
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:20.480]  With a built-in radio chip called RFID. I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:28.960]  Soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:34.000]  It was then I formed id stronghold to share my inventions and blocking RFID signals with the world
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:40.160]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected

[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:18.160]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and joining me in the studio or anthony gucciardi from natural society and
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:24.000]  Dr. Group we're taking your calls your questions to dr. Group before we go back to your calls though
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  Uh this
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.720]  Hour of the alex jones show has been brought to you by the products that we sell at info wars life dot com the high quality products
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.600]  That we sell there and anthony we still have x2 in stock and it was sold out at one point in time
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.760]  But I think it is still in stock. Is that correct? That's right
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:45.840]  And I want to have dr. Group explain the process of how we actually get the iodine crystals the purple crystals to make survival shield x2
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.000]  But we just got an emergency supply because we were sold out for about I believe it was a week or two last month
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.760]  Now we have another emergency supply that's been in and we are going to sell out this week
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:01.920]  Uh, it's it's nerve-wracking to me because we try to forecast this, but it's very expensive to mine these crystals
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.360]  It takes a lot of investment
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.920]  It takes a lot of time and at the same time we're not going to sacrifice the quality to just get more in
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:11.600]  And I would like dr. Group to explain a little bit about this process before we take your calls
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.160]  And we're going to talk about how living in nature can help you make according to the study
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.000]  Up to $20,000 extra a year and feel seven years healthier too
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.680]  But dr. Group, let's talk about how x2 is actually created with the crystals
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:31.120]  Well, actually there's been a pretty heavy demand. There's limited availability right now just because I'm I
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:38.880]  Unfortunately don't have the specific contract with the company that's mining the crystals from deep in the earth
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.440]  Apparently
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:47.280]  In japan and all over the world people are catching on more and more they're seeing more health problems, especially along the coastlines
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:53.280]  There's a higher demand practically every single month right now for iodine and we're talking about companies
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.040]  I don't know if they just want to stockpile it or what's going on
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:58.960]  but I know that fukushima
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.960]  Has been releasing some reports of
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.680]  additional radiation high level radiation that's been going into the water
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:08.480]  And uh, I guess the high up
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:14.080]  Individuals and the high up companies are trying to stock up as much iodine as they possibly can
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:21.760]  They're not buying as much of the high quality iodine. I mean we try to get the highest quality, which is the 99.99
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.160]  9% pure iodine crystals
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:28.480]  Right and it's not from the sea it's from the earth
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.520]  It's not from the sea it's from the earth and we've been battling and this is why I'm so passionate about it
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:32.800]  Why I want to plug it over and over again
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:40.240]  I want to keep talking about it because the difference between us and them and the government and us the government is stockpiling their own iodine
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:45.520]  Remember that right 28 28 million doses of potassium iodine the crap iodine
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.160]  And then we're actually securing the high quality iodine
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:54.800]  We're trying to fight against super super wealthy rich business owners super super wealthy elite people that are stockpiling it for themselves
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.200]  We're actually trying to stockpile it for you
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:04.640]  That's the oh, I know and I had actually had a big company contact me and wanted to buy the iodine crystals directly from me because
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.040]  it's so hard to
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:13.040]  Be able to get a purchasing license for those crystals because iodine is used to create methamphetamine
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.880]  And you have to go through the DEA. They do a background check on you
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:18.560]  They do a background check on your company
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.600]  You have to fill out massive amounts of paperwork
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.840]  And you have to keep the iodine crystals in a safe like a bank safe
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:31.280]  Where only one person has a code and that individual is checked and they come out there
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:37.920]  So they're not just handing out these licenses or these ability to buy iodine to anybody
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.640]  So now I have these companies contacting me wanting to buy
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.760]  Kilograms of the raw iodine crystals. So
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.960]  Uh, I mean, and why do you think they make it so hard? Obviously they want to stockpile it for themselves
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:54.240]  They know the truth. They know what it's done 10 10 point increase in IQ over 10 years
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:59.760]  Or was it 20 in some areas where they added iodine and reduced the fluoridation. I mean, it's obvious what's going on
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:05.840]  Right. It is obvious what's going on. It's why I always keep a good supply and it's one of the most effective
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.920]  I mean, if I was to choose one thing
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:13.360]  Out of all the different health products out there, I mean, I would definitely have iodine
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.400]  A nascent detoxified iodine like the survival shield x2 in my medicine care
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.480]  We've got one of the callers who has a question about detoxing and we're gonna come back. Stay there with us
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:32.080]  Uh, Jerry in Florida, Janine, Matt, Denise, uh, we'll be right back taking your calls. Stay with us

[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:31.760]  I'm david night your host in austin and joining me in the studio are anthony gucciardi of natural society and dr
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.560]  Group and we're taking your phone calls. Let's go back to one of the phone calls right now. Let's go to uh
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.920]  Jerry in florida jerry had a question about detoxing
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.440]  Hey guys, how's it going? Good. Very good
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:50.080]  And listen after the south carolina shooting, um, suboxone had really come to the forefront
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.280]  Uh for opiate addictions that live in florida and at one point have gotten
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:03.040]  Uh, they took the painkillers and with all of the different forms of detoxification that it came about whether you're not the donor
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.720]  Colt turkey or any of that what what they had prescribed me was
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.800]  Um, suboxone, which I had done the research and found out that it was just
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:15.840]  Uh, buprenorphine with something else. It's not really that great narkan and ninoxone
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.400]  And that was you know, pretty much that was invented for you know, epidurals
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.440]  It was a lot of work went into it and it was pretty safe
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:29.280]  And then the patent ran out so they added this other junk to it, which is designed to induce an acute
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.280]  Detox effect if you used opiates, but is there a natural way to
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.600]  You know deal with the opiate addiction
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:40.640]  I mean I'm past my now, but I still have friends that are dealing with it and I said a gigantic problem in florida
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.360]  Or you guys know that one city in florida sold more
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.600]  oxycodone than you know, the whole state of california in a year
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.200]  Wow
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:55.920]  There is a way uh, there are natural ways to deal with opiate detoxification and any type of prescription
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:57.680]  drug
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.880]  You know addiction it's amazing how many people are addicted to pain medications or opiates
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:09.440]  Uh, believe it or not gluten actually has an opiate effect and even when you stop eating bread
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.520]  You can go through withdrawal syndromes
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.560]  It it all boils back to the root cause again and I associate the addiction
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.680]  Um, it everybody's different obviously
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.920]  but by cleaning up your body again detoxifying the liver the liver has
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:31.360]  It's been shown that the intestinal lining with the probiotics in there
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:37.360]  And when the probiotics are in balance you secrete the proper neurotransmitters almost that keeps you happy
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:44.560]  So what happens is when the gut microflora dies off because of the poor diet and the gmo's and all the acid foods
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:53.280]  Then the liver also becomes toxic and the liver becomes fatty when the liver is congested and fatty and the intestines aren't functioning properly
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:57.760]  That's when you start getting a lot more depression anxiety
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:04.160]  And usually you can associate some sort of mental illness or mental health problem with addiction
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:08.000]  So what I recommend doing and this is what I recommend
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:12.080]  anybody with any type of opiate addiction is is realize that
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:19.200]  You're only usually addicted because you have chemicals that are causing malfunctions
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.480]  In the way your neurotransmitters are in your brain. They're either blocking neurotransmitters mercury for example
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.480]  You mix that with aluminum and it causes
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:37.760]  Malfunctions you have gluten in the food you have artificial sweeteners which have been proven to work as excitotoxins artificial sweeteners
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.480]  food dies
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:46.480]  There's a combination nobody knows what happens when you combine all these man-made chemicals, but we do know
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:52.640]  That they have a profound effect on the brain on your emotions. So
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:59.040]  You you can't just cold turkey those opiates obviously because that can throw you into a pretty hard detoxification
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.480]  And something you probably don't want to go through. So what we do is called time contingent detoxification
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:10.880]  You start cleansing up your body. You start cleansing your environment. You repair repair the gut
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:18.160]  You know taking the oxy powder to clean it out and then taking a good probiotic to repair the gut and then the liver cleansing your liver
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:25.760]  Eating healthy and then slowly reducing your amount of medications over a period of time
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.800]  And usually that is a good
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:32.320]  Method that works in the majority of the time
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.760]  All right, we're gonna go to break again. I'm talking to uh, dr. Group. He's taking your calls on the phone
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:42.400]  We're gonna go back to when we come back after break to janine matt in dc. Denise

[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:18.960]  In these exercises will there be a military takeover will they come in to take your guns or will it be like we've said from the beginning
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:24.720]  Simply an exercise to condition the american public to military up and down the streets
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:30.800]  Helicopters flying overhead soldiers no longer dressed in their actual military gear
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:37.680]  But in civilian attire blending in doing suspicious activity and gaining intel on the public
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:44.400]  Now will you sit around and do nothing or will you get up off the couch grab a video camera and help document this exercise?
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:50.480]  Governor greg abbot of texas has called the texas state guard to monitor these exercises throughout the state

[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:02.800]  Waging war on corruption
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:08.640]  It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:20.240]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and i'm joined in studio with anthony gucciardi and dr. Group
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:27.760]  We're taking your calls during the break. We were talking about what real food is and anthony had some good comments on that
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:33.360]  Go ahead anthony. Yeah, you know so one of the callers earlier called in and she was wondering about some healthy lunch for her kids
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.120]  And this really applies to everyone though
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:40.000]  So she was saying you know at the cafeteria they presumably give them some pretty bad food
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:45.040]  And the whole idea of healthy food has really changed and I think it's important for everyone to understand that
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.880]  And I call it the new health paradigm and what that means is that an apple
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.520]  50 years ago or even 100 years ago is no longer the apple of today
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:59.440]  Yeah, right because previously you just pick an apple off a tree put in a basket and give it to somebody or eat it right away
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:07.120]  That's the apple the apple now is the modern industrial apple that apple is sprayed with let's say round up herbicide
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:09.920]  It is sprayed with some type of fungicide
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.800]  It is sprayed with a whole host of other different chemicals
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:20.960]  And then there's a glaze put on it so that it retains its shine and it retains its beauty when it goes into the grocery store
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:24.960]  And then beyond that there could even be put some uh preservatives on the apple
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:29.520]  So that the grocery store has an increased profit ratio when they don't have to throw it out as quickly
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:32.240]  So the modern day apple is much different
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:35.840]  Just as the modern day meat is much different with the hormones
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:39.360]  And the cloning technologies that's been used and been found in the food supply
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:46.000]  So the idea of healthy is completely changed and that is why every single thing that we look at in terms of scientific studies
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:50.720]  I believe will be considered to be mostly invalidated when it comes to health supplements and food
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.880]  Over the next few decades specifically that means when people do a
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.480]  Uh research piece such as oh is vitamin e good or bad?
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.720]  And they don't distinguish between synthetic vitamin e which causes birth defects
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:06.960]  Or organic food-based vitamin e which actually helps and kills cancer cells
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.800]  Which is a new study that just came out three days ago
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:15.200]  So we know there's a difference and when we know that but the scientists who are quote unquote mainstream scientists
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:17.360]  Refuse to acknowledge this new health paradigm
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:23.440]  They are in the old health paradigm where everything is exactly the same. So if they did a study our pair is good for you
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:26.880]  Uh, they don't distinguish is the guy buying his pair
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:31.840]  Organic from Whole Foods or is he buying it at Kmart in the discount aisle for five cents?
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.400]  That has been loaded with pesticides herbicides and fungicides because I could easily do a study
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.840]  Where I get the most garbage produce in the whole entire world and show that it causes cancer
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.440]  Just as you could if you wanted to do some bad things to the nutraceutical industry as they have
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.920]  Take the synthetic forms of supplements and say is vitamin e bad?
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:55.120]  It looks like it is looks like multivitamins are killing people
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:59.520]  Yeah, that's because you're taking centrum and flintstones vitamins, which have aspartame in them
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.640]  high fructose corn syrup all synthetic vitamins all junk and then they're saying vitamins are bad for you
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:09.920]  So it's a total facade and the insiders know this but it's important for everyone to understand this and only when we do
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:12.240]  Can we move forward and dr. Group?
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.400]  I wanted to obviously take another call, but first a little bit of a solution
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:22.000]  It's thrown in here. This article is really interesting to me. This is the headline. This is a really a clickbaity headline
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:27.840]  Living your trees has health benefits worth 17 900 euros fine study
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:33.920]  Right and and the one I read said that it actually has a statistical increase in your income if you live near trees
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.760]  but this one says
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:40.560]  That you could basically make an extra 20 thousand dollars a year in benefits in terms of your health
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.160]  Not having to spend time on your health and have better mental health and all that kind of stuff
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:47.280]  If you live near trees and have nature in your home
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:52.640]  So simply putting a plant in your workspace can drastically change your life
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:54.880]  I mean these are simple things that we can do when we understand
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:01.680]  The primal aspects of our body and our biology and how to center ourselves and personally I always talk about if we
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:07.600]  Experience nature on a daily basis. We can humble ourselves and not be so caught up in stress and the daily
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:11.120]  You know craziness of our life. So maybe money does grow on trees
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:14.480]  Certainly it has a qualitative effect on your life
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:18.320]  Even if you can't quantify it down to a dollar and cents thing
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:21.280]  I mean you can actually feel it. That's a great point you're making
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.560]  Anthony about an apple is not necessarily an apple
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:28.800]  It's not the apple that we had decades ago or a century ago because they've been focused on
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:33.040]  Marketing on how it's presented on how on shelf life
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:39.920]  They've been selectively breeding for a long time even before they started doing direct genetic modification to make sure that it
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.520]  Doesn't turn brown when you cut it. I mean, so it's a completely different
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.160]  Yes, I'll tell you a strange story
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  But it works is somebody told me a long time ago before I had kids and what they were doing for discipline for their kids
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:58.880]  But they would walk them out and have them hug a tree whenever they got upset about something or they got angry about anything or
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.320]  Have them, you know, they also had a little meditation chair and I tell you what I tried it and it actually works
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.240]  You know when when my kids get upset about something or get angry
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:11.680]  I have two boys and they're at the age where they're bickering back and forth
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:13.520]  And I'll just say
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:17.680]  You need to release your emotions. You have some emotions inside you need to get out come walk with me
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:22.720]  And we'll walk over there and we have a tree and they'll and they'll hug the tree and within I mean
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:27.600]  I could literally count to 30 seconds and they're completely calm. I mean, there's that's not new
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:36.400]  Yeah, you can look at at nature healing people for thousands and thousands of years. I mean, it's everybody feels good
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:41.520]  When they're in nature, that's another reason why I recommend everybody put plants in their house
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.160]  You know two or three plants in every room of their house
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:52.400]  Because what do plants do? They increase the oxygen content. They suck up the co2 in the air. They also
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.920]  Take all the chem a lot of the chemicals out of the air
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:59.600]  So plants will actually clean your air for you in your home. So
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:05.520]  Very important. Let's go to some of the callers who have a question about diet from matt and dc matt go ahead
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.760]  Hi, thanks for taking my call. First, actually, I wanted to comment on this previous caller about the opiate withdrawal
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:15.840]  Um massage therapy actually can do a lot for people going through withdrawal
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  but my main question goes to um
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:25.360]  Just I was curious about dr. Group's diet on what he eats and how he feels about the vegan diet for psychological and health benefits
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:28.480]  Well, thanks matt
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:31.200]  Diet is one of the things that I think everybody
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:38.640]  Individually needs to look at depending on that's why I don't think there's one diet. That's good for everybody
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.080]  Because if you look back in history, it's really when people used to grow their own food
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:48.720]  It was what would grow on my land? What can I grow on my land that I can eat?
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:50.720]  so really
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.360]  The perfect diet would be a diet that
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.320]  Is indigenous to the area that you live in?
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:04.080]  I've been experimenting with diets and with my diet for a long time. I used to eat meat
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:09.760]  I was having digestive problems. I got off of meat. Those went away, but I'm an oh blood type
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.280]  I cold turkeyed the meat and then after about a month. I was feeling weak fatigued
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:19.920]  I mean, I could barely get out of bed. So I had to slowly introduce it back into my diet
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:23.920]  Then over a period of time. I slowly got off of meat
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:29.120]  Now I do believe you need protein and that's that's a whole nother subject right there
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:35.680]  But believe it or not what what we're dealing with today, which is one of the main problems with diet. I'm pretty much a
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:42.160]  80% raw food. I eat pretty much 80% raw food usually around 90% raw and 10%
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.080]  cooked and mostly I haven't eaten meat in in years
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:47.680]  but
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:49.680]  what I'm learning is
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:53.920]  The body there's there's carbohydrates fats and proteins
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:59.920]  The you need the proteins and the fats, but you really don't even need the carbohydrates that much. That's why Atkins
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.040]  Program was so effective with the low carbohydrate. I don't necessarily agree with that, but
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:12.560]  I like a vegetable based diet fruit based diet diet and a nut and seed based diet is what
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.920]  Seems to work the best for most people
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:23.120]  But I also think each individual person should customize their diet and pay attention to their body because I also think that everybody
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:25.120]  has
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:27.120]  a certain genetic codes that
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:30.000]  You know certain foods may cause them allergies
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:36.720]  A lot of people who you know react to potatoes some people are gonna react to corn. I mean different things
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:41.680]  So every dot everybody's diet should be kind of customized really each individual should
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:44.800]  Pay attention to how food makes them feel
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:51.840]  And see what foods are going to work the best in their body. That's great. Let's go to uh one in new jersey
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:55.760]  Kind of a related question. I guess the inflammatory bowel disease. Go ahead one
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.040]  Yes, I don't get afternoon gentlemen
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:05.120]  uh, yeah, my question for dr. Group is uh, I'm currently taking a free though and on the time when I have a flare-up
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:10.160]  I wind up uh, dr. Book describes me a prednisone, which is horrible
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:16.480]  And uh, I just want to know what is your take on uh, uh, substituting that for uh,
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:20.000]  organic slippery elm bark powder
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  Okay. Well, we did a lot of research. That's actually one of our uh specialties is bowel disease and the different causes of bowel disease
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:34.720]  Because that's really the root cause of all disease, right? I mean all disease causing talk toxins enter through
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.280]  The bowel to begin with
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:42.400]  Um, so we looked at first thing you need to look at is what is causing the problem?
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.320]  Why do you have inflammatory bowel disease because you don't really want to say, okay?
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:53.920]  Uh, what can I do to replace this? I mean, and even in naturopathic schools and all the herbal medicine schools, they still teach
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:59.920]  How to treat the symptoms and not how to treat the root cause what I want like to teach people
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:05.360]  Because the true definition of a doctor right as a teacher not a prescriber whether it's natural or not
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:11.440]  There are certain things we talk about here that I think everybody needs and and everybody should do on a regular basis
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:13.440]  So we're just not getting in the food supply
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.640]  So we're just not getting in the food supply. I was wondering if he's on gluten. Are you eating gluten Juan?
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.120]  Any type of wheat products
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  So you see there's your issue right there. I wouldn't I mean personally that's the root cause
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:34.960]  I wouldn't even get into the world of supplements until you address the intake first and foremost, right?
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:41.040]  Because I mean if you have for example, we know that mcdonalds can kill the good bacteria in your gut for up to two to three weeks
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:44.240]  Or permanently, okay? So if you're eating mcdonalds for a week
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:50.480]  Let's say it can devastate the gut bacteria in a way that you may never replenish naturally in your life without taking probiotic
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.840]  So if you're eating as you say everything under the sun, which is fine
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:57.600]  But it's time to change that because you have inflammatory inflammatory bowel disease
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:01.280]  And I've suffered with stuff like gastritis and IBS in the past and for me
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.960]  The number one thing is gluten because what happens is you've destroyed your gut so much basically that it's now ripping at it
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:11.600]  Micro at a micro level and entering all the toxic stuff that you eat through the gut lining
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:15.200]  So you need I mean not to interrupt with you because you were getting on to it
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:18.240]  But I could just I could just tell a lot of people they they say like well
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.520]  I want to take you know
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:25.200]  Slippery Elm or whatever I want to take this and this but you first have to address what's going in does that make sense Juan?
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:30.000]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean let me just add one more thing to that
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:38.240]  Um, what what you have slippery elm cascara sagrada senna marshmallow root all of those mucous forming herbs
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.400]  Can be used temporarily in the gut but over a long period of time
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:49.920]  They don't address the root cause of the problem oxy powder by the way has gone through phase one two and three clinical trials specifically for
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:55.360]  Irritable bowel IBS and I suggest that you clean it out with we're going to be right back
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:56.640]  Hang on we got to go to a break

[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:16.000]  Welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david knight and i'm joined in this segment
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:18.640]  By anthony gucciardi and dr. Group
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:23.040]  We're going to be taking in this last segment that we have with them more of your calls and questions
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:29.920]  Health questions, of course this hour of the alex joneshow is brought to you by the products that we sell at infowarslife.com
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:34.480]  anthony we were talking about x2 survival shield nascent iodine
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:38.800]  That is back in stock. We also have back in stock super mail
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.920]  Yes, we do and again x2 we're going to sell out this week
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:44.640]  So if you want some get some now and you know
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:48.960]  Unfortunately looks like super mail is going to be along those lines too at current rates
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:54.720]  And the reason i wanted to bring that one up specifically for this for the segment is because i was talking to dr. Group in the break
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:59.360]  And i'm familiar with how it works and i know about the different herbs and everything like that
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.960]  But i'm just continually impressed over and over again when i take it and i'll admit i'm a little afraid to take it sometimes
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:08.560]  I try to take it every day i put it my protein shake sometimes i want to take more
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:13.040]  But i'm a little afraid because i'm already a driven person and i'll already stay up till 3 am working
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.360]  I will do it i mean i've done it routinely over and over again sometimes i stay up till like 6 am
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:19.360]  I actually like working overnight sometimes anyway
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:24.560]  I'm afraid to take super mail vitality sometimes because i don't want to stay up till 4 am not that it even gives me
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:27.040]  It's not just the energy it's not like it's going to keep me up all night
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:28.560]  It makes me driven
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:33.680]  It makes me want to do crazy like amazing things like it makes me think well, gee i just gave this much to a charity
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:39.360]  I want to give 50 times that next month and it just sets these goals in my brain that are just so crazy
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:43.760]  And i know many people are super happy with that and i'm happy with it too
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.320]  But what is it that literally just drives me when i take that do you remember when you were 16?
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:51.440]  And you wanted to stay up all night and you could stay up all night
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.960]  I still do actually and you know you would feel great the next morning
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:59.920]  That's because all your hormones were in sync you had high testosterone you had high dha
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.160]  You had growth hormone kicking through your body and all the functions in the body have to deal with hormones
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.280]  And that's any male for that matter and women are having hormone problems too
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:14.960]  We've talked about it a lot the all the endocrine disrupting chemicals right now that are
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:18.640]  Everywhere in the world in the water and that you know food supply
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:27.120]  The phthalates which are endocrine disrupting chemicals. I mean we all have hormone problems and hormone depletions and hormone imbalance
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:31.200]  That's why the medical community is trying to make so much money right now
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:35.120]  On hormone replacement therapy because they see it's happening. Well
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:41.760]  It's the old let's cause the problem so we can make money trying to fix the problem
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:46.320]  But they're not fixing it all they're doing is injecting more home hormones into people so
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:48.960]  Super male vitality
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.360]  You said about an apple right that you might have
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:57.200]  One apple two apples next to each other one apple is organic super nutritious the other apple
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.440]  You can't see the thousands of chemicals and toxins and fungicides and everything on it
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.200]  Well, if you look at both of them, you're not really going to know right until you analyze them
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:11.200]  It's the same thing with herbs. It's called choosing your herbs with the highest therapeutic value
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:16.800]  So if you look at maca root, for example, which is one of the main ingredients in super male vitality
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:21.680]  There's a thousand different suppliers for maca root if you take all of those
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.440]  Suppliers and run analysis on all of the maca root because you're looking for the active
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.320]  therapeutic compounds the ones that are actually going to work the best and have
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:36.640]  The strongest amount of the phytochemicals in them
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:41.280]  I can tell you that evaluating herbs for years and years and years
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:45.760]  There's very very very few companies a lot of the herbs come from china india
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:51.840]  They sit in warehouses and 120 130 degrees. They're already powdered
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:59.920]  Which means they lose the therapeutic and phyto essential oils get oxidized off of them. What we try to do is go directly to the farm
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:03.840]  Find out the highest quality the highest potency levels
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:09.520]  To get those herbs cut and sifted, which means the plant is pretty much in its whole state
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:19.680]  Then we grind it and put it immediately into the high technology proprietary process with vegetable glycerin that we use to preserve and encapsulate
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:25.600]  The high quality compounds in those and we do that with multiple herbs that are in super male vitality
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:30.960]  Super female vitality all the products that info wars life sells
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:36.000]  So it's that's the difference between what we have here and all the other people out there
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.880]  And that's what makes super male vitality so successful
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:45.760]  Because any male over the age of 28 and i'm not just making this up. You can look at any scientific research behind this
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:53.920]  We our hormones start declining at age 28 our DHEA our testosterone our growth hormone just keep going down down down down
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:29:01.040]  Down with age. That's why we start developing body more body fat at the age of 28 and the liver becomes congested again
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:05.360]  And that's why I believe every male should be supplementing with some sort of
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:12.320]  Hormone that's it's not actually a hormone by the way. It just helps your body balance and secrete those hormones naturally
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:19.600]  Let's go to uh, we don't have too much time very quickly. Let's go to janine and minnesota. You had a question about liver cleansing janine go ahead
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:26.080]  Yes, I do and it is a quick question. Um, it's not only for me. Uh, I've had
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:30.000]  Many discussions with other people that are in the same boat
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:32.800]  Uh, we want to do the liver cleanse
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.720]  But we have had our gallbladders surgically removed
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:40.160]  We do not we want to know if it's safe to do it
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:46.160]  Just as written or 10 10 second. Yes, janine. We only have 10 seconds left
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:52.960]  But it's actually even more necessary to do it if you don't have your gallbladder because the liver has to take over for the gallbladder
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:58.080]  So it's a good question anybody who has their gallbladder out should be doing more liver cleanses. Thank you
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:05.280]  When speaking about ices president obama recently said this ideologies are not defeated with guns
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:12.160]  They're defeated by better ideas. The president was meeting with military leaders at the pentagon when he made the comments
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:19.200]  Perhaps obama should have considered this notion before continuing the policy of flooding the chaotic middle east with weapons
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:22.400]  As info wars has tirelessly documented
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:26.240]  us weapons have fallen into ices hands time and time again
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:33.600]  And bolstered the terror group via the insane policy of arming and training the so-called moderate rebels in libya
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:35.600]  syria and iraq
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.480]  The cia has shipped weapons to al-qaeda affiliated groups in syria since at least
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:43.840]  2012 a fact reported by the new york times
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:51.440]  iraqi intelligence even claims that the us is intentionally dropping weapons to known ices linked groups of rebels
[02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:58.160]  Where were the better ideas when it mattered? You can find more reports on info wars dot com

[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:17.120]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host
[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:23.120]  We're going to take some of your calls and apologize to the people that have been on hold to talk to doctor group with health questions
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:29.120]  We're going to purge those phone lines. Sorry folks those of you who've held on
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:34.160]  I want to give that number out again to people who want to call and talk about some of the other topics
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:39.840]  So we talked about earlier about the iran deal about the planned parenthood video
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:42.720]  Perhaps about jade helm
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:49.600]  There's some other news items that I want to cover as well. Let me give you that number 800-259-9231 again
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.840]  That's 800-259-9231 if you'd like to talk about those topics
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:56.560]  Of course, this was some information that we had
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:58.720]  About a week or so ago
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:02.000]  where the office of personnel management for the federal government opm
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:11.200]  Announced that more than 21 million people had been affected by a data breach and this was a second data breach at that point in time
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  21 million
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:16.480]  Social security numbers were compromised in this
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:24.640]  Hack they say the hack is separate from the breach of opm data that compromised 4.2 million social security number
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:28.160]  So that was a couple of weeks before so in the last couple of weeks
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:35.200]  We've lost first 4.2 million social security numbers then at 21 million social security numbers now a week later
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:43.280]  What have we lost over a million fingerprints opm announced last week that the personal data for 21 and a half million people
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:48.000]  Of course have been stolen, but now it's 1.1 million fingerprints
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:50.720]  Can you trust the government?
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.560]  Can you trust them to keep any of this information private as we get all this stuff all the biometrics on us?
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.440]  Of course, we're very concerned about how the government is data mining things
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:06.400]  But also in terms of how they cannot even protect it from criminals or foreign governments who would hack into it
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:11.840]  And of course many of the people who've had this stolen. Of course, they're federal employees people who had
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:16.800]  Trusted the government to watch their data. No, they're not doing a very good job of that
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:18.400]  But they also
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.760]  Are joining with hackers. This is something we learned from wiki leaks
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:27.280]  They say what this is a article from the new american. They say what does an italian?
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:29.280]  software company and
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:32.240]  Orlando law enforcement have in common well
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:34.960]  This is the company hacking team
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:41.200]  They say the italian company that sells surveillance software to government and law enforcement agencies worldwide
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.920]  Is now selling information and software to orlando police departments
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:53.040]  They've been working with some of the worst abusers of human rights
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:57.760]  And I guess we'd have to put the united states government in that category as well since they do
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:02.400]  Look at everybody in the world's information and try to store it
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:10.320]  They said they also found in terms of looking at the investigations. They found emails from orlando's from orlando, florida
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:17.440]  Law enforcement the police department there said that they would like to speak to someone regarding their products to intercept people's
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  emails and spy on them
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:22.240]  it's not even
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:25.440]  news anymore that our government is spying on us in every single way
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:33.360]  Tapping everything that we do listening to us on the phone and of course what this software does is it monitors email conversations
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:36.400]  It can turn your phone or your laptop on
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.280]  And send it back to their surveillance company again. That's why I say when we talk about
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:46.000]  The rhetoric that's been used over the years where remember roby wade was
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:52.320]  As we were told that the supreme court had discovered in the constitution a right to privacy
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.760]  They seem to have lost our rights to
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:00.240]  Due process they seem to have lost our rights to
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:03.120]  our fourth amendment protections
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:06.800]  To have a search warrant taken out if they want to search somebody's homes
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:14.080]  How absurd that they would sell this as a right to privacy when they spy on everything everything that we do
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:18.160]  Briefly before I go back to your phone calls another couple of articles that are up
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:22.960]  Murder rates we see this is good news drop as concealed carry permits are
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.680]  soaring and of course we've just had yet another state come in and
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:31.520]  Legalize constitutional carry which means that you don't have to get
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:35.600]  Permission from the government to exercise your god-given
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:42.960]  constitutionally recognized right to protect yourself to keep and to bear arms not to just keep them locked up in a
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:45.280]  Gun chest back at your house
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:50.640]  And then another before I go to your calls one last story here a strange story that
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:55.040]  Went up last night. It's from kit daniels. It's on info wars.com gay man
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:38:01.280]  Sue's bible publishers over homosexuality is a sin versus in the bible now
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:08.320]  This is a gay man has filed a 70 million dollar lawsuit against two publishers of bibles
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:16.320]  Claiming that their translation of the bible calling homosexuality a sin caused him emotional distress and of course those publishers or zondervan
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:18.640]  one of the largest christian
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:20.720]  book publishers and
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.960]  Let's see. I don't see the other one on here
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:27.200]  But it's listed in the article if you want to see that and they point out that the
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:33.280]  Gay activists have written their own bible. They call it the queen james version
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:37.440]  Well, you know, if he's concerned about the particular passages that he's quoting
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.240]  I just have to say wait until he gets to the part about Sodom and Gomorrah
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:44.720]  He's not going to like that at all
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:48.000]  And that's not to pour anything
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:57.600]  Condemnation on homosexuals. Okay, you need to understand and homosexuals need to understand why this is such a big issue to Christians
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:02.080]  Every sin is rebellion against God
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:04.080]  That's what we understand
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:10.080]  And so we don't want to be involved in participating in the celebration of something that we see
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:15.680]  As rebellion to God and to all the Christians out there who's saying, yeah, yeah, wait till they get to Sodom and Gomorrah
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:22.560]  I just want to say that there aren't any of us that don't have our own pet sins and no sin
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:26.080]  No matter how small you think it is is rebellion to God
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:29.200]  That's why we all need a savior
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:34.320]  It isn't something that, you know, got somebody that's going to come to you and tell you that, uh, yeah, you know, yeah
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:38.160]  I don't do this. I don't do that and I try to be as good as I can and I think I'm
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:43.520]  I'm doing pretty good and God's just going to take the rest of it. It's like no, you don't understand the true nature of sin
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:47.360]  You don't understand that it is any sin is
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:49.920]  Cosmic rebellion to God
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:56.320]  And no matter how small or how large that sin is you still need Christ and you still need the bible
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:03.600]  To tell you about it. Uh, but that's where we're headed this kind of absurd claim where we're going back and forth
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:05.600]  And I just wish people would understand
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:11.040]  That I I think we need to get the government out of these areas of our life
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:20.000]  And I've seen Christians on the other side making demands saying that we have to make sure that the government doesn't take away contracts from different organizations because
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:25.760]  They do this or they don't do that because their position on homosexual marriage is not the right thing to do
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:32.400]  Homosexual marriage. It's like get yourself weaned off of a government that tries to bribe you with your own money
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:37.840]  That is what is fundamentally behind this whole thing about homosexual marriage. I believe
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:42.880]  Anyway, they've had the ability people have had whether if they're homosexual
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:48.400]  They had the ability to have their own relationships. Nobody is throwing them in jail like we did 150 years ago in England with
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:50.400]  um
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:53.040]  The guy that uh, gosh again oscar wild
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:55.040]  Uh, was jailed because of that
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:01.200]  Nobody is having that done, but they're looking to get subsidy to get official government recognition
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:04.080]  And so are the Christians and I say to both sides
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:12.000]  Let's forget about official government recognition. Let's make our own relationships. Let's work together on voluntary contracts
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  We can do that. We can set up our own
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:16.400]  life
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:19.680]  Wills living wills when we have a loved one that is in the hospital
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.960]  We can do that. We can work for employers that appreciate us that want to have us as employees
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:27.360]  That will voluntarily give us the kind of benefits that we want
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:31.520]  We don't have to use government to hold a gun to somebody's head and make it happen
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:34.720]  And that's true for Christians as well as it is for
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:39.520]  People who want homosexual marriage. I think that's where we need to go with this. That's uh,
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:45.360]  Something that was mentioned by david simpson here in texas. I think that's the right approach to take
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:50.000]  Again before I go to your calls. I just want to talk a little bit more about this Iranian thing
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:56.880]  When I look at this and I look at the 18 billion dollars in sanctions because that's basically what we have presented on our side
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:02.400]  In exchange for that, we're supposedly going to get more access to look to see what they're doing with nuclear weapons
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:08.960]  I don't see it as a prelude to world war three unless someone on the other side wants to start it
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:15.040]  Certainly, we are taking sides in the middle east. There's we need to understand that the middle east is not monolithic
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:23.520]  The Arabs the muslims are divided into different groups. We need to understand that there's sunnis in iraq also isis
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:25.840]  Or sunni, okay
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:30.640]  The iranians are shia different kind of islam and of course the Saudis or Wahhabis
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:33.680]  And I have to ask why are we ally?
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:39.360]  Why are we allying ourselves with the Saudis the most brutal regime of any of them and of course they're all
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:41.680]  Jockeying for position all trying to get
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:43.280]  uh
[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:47.840]  Ally themselves with the united states with each other for leveraging a situation, but we get
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:54.240]  Saudi Arabia which uh beheads more people than isis and that is our closest ally
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:00.640]  Embedded inside of the cia. Why is that the case? Why are the Saudis our closest allies?
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:02.480]  certainly
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:04.480]  Iran has has done
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:09.040]  Some things that we're concerned about but we've done things to iran that they that people should be concerned about
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:16.720]  We shot down a commercial airliner. Did they do anything after that? No if that had happened the other way around it would have been instant war so
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:23.520]  Hopefully this is going to be something that will deescalate the situation. We know that north korea has a nuclear bomb
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:29.120]  I'm not happy with a lot of countries having the nuclear bomb. I wish we didn't have it here right now
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:36.000]  Frankly, I wish we didn't have nuclear power plants. I'm very concerned about how we dispose of nuclear waste the long-term issues of that
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:42.560]  Nevertheless, I don't think it is the end of the world. We have attacked this in other ways trying to keep them from getting the bomb
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:45.440]  Of course, that's what the stutz net virus was all about
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  infecting their computers
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:50.880]  The thing that I thought was interesting
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:56.000]  Was the celebration of the iranian people saying well, you know, this is great now. We can get things like iPhones
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.800]  I mean, they're they're not that different from us folks
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:03.680]  And perhaps that's going to be the way that the cia stops them from getting the bomb
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:07.600]  Once they get iPhones in the hands of everybody in iran. I guess it's game over
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:12.480]  For them pretty much the way that it is for us as well. Let's go to your calls. Let's go to uh
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:15.200]  gail in iho ohio go ahead gail
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:19.440]  Hi, hi
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:21.520]  You said you want to talk about the military go ahead
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:29.120]  Yes, um, I come from a small town in main a very small town. It's called Hudson, Maine
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:35.120]  Probably can't even find it on the map. It's about 25 miles north of bangor, Maine
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.720]  Today talking to my aunt on the phone
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:43.360]  She said there's something going on and i'm not sure what it is
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:46.560]  but there is
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:54.880]  A whole bunch of military next door to her at the fire station and they're all dressing khaki colors carrying guns
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:01.920]  She got a guy came to her door this morning and said don't worry about two o'clock
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:09.760]  If you hear a bunch of gunfire, it's not real bullets. We're just practicing. She called it a reenactment
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:15.920]  But she wasn't really sure what is going on, but I mean this is a little tiny town
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:17.760]  um
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:23.760]  Almost everybody there doesn't have a landline. So I don't have cell phone numbers of anybody
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:31.680]  I think it's interesting when you bring this up because we're getting so many reports from so many different places people seeing massive amounts
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.240]  Of military equipment. Is it heightened?
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:39.920]  Because people are concerned about jade helm or is it something that we're seeing the military do more of?
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:42.480]  and of course right now people are
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:47.040]  Are looking at this and and questioning it because it's something that they haven't seen before
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:50.560]  That's a big part of what all of these exercises are about
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:56.000]  They're about getting us accustomed to see the military on the streets all the time
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:02.080]  That is a precursor to them taking a much more active role in law enforcement
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:08.720]  Uh, essentially paving the way if they want to for uh enacting martial law at some point down the future
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:15.440]  Very covertly because people will have their guard down because they've seen so much movement of military and equipment
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:18.320]  And they have become accustomed to it. I frankly
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:23.200]  Don't want to live in a banana republic with nuclear weapons
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:29.840]  And that's what this country is turning into rapidly when we look at the continuous surveillance as I point out before
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:35.040]  That's one of the things that concerns me most about jade helm is the fact that you've got special forces
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.320]  Admiral mcgraven selling himself to the nsa saying will be the boots on the ground the human intelligence
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:45.920]  For the nsa and data collection. Uh, thank you so much for that. Let's go to um,
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:49.360]  Eric in new york. Eric you had a comment about the military
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:53.360]  Uh, good afternoon, david. Hi
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:47:01.360]  Go ahead. As you know, the u.s. Military are treated by guinea pigs anyway with the vaccinations and they briefed the pleaded iranium
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:07.440]  Do you believe that this is some sort of a future plan for ai intelligence and
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.160]  autonomous drones and whatnot
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:14.960]  Oh, absolutely. And if you haven't seen it, I would suggest you go back and look it was a couple of months ago
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:18.000]  Rob do and I did a long report here in the studio
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  about uh, jade helm about mastering the human domain about geospatial intelligence human domain analytics activity based intelligence
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  So we break down all those pentagon terms for you all those acronyms
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:36.560]  We talk about what our concerns are for where this is going and you need to understand as I think you do based on your question
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:43.680]  That uh, it's not going to be that far in the future that when they're going to have autonomous killing machines
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:49.920]  They're gradually pulling this back. They still have human operators that are making decisions from a distance
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:53.040]  That is troubling, but it's going to be even more troubling
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:59.040]  When they bring in autonomous killing machines and this is not something we're making up. This is not science fiction
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:07.200]  This is these are DARPA projects. You can read about it. They're multiple DARPA and pentagon projects working on autonomous killing machines
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:14.240]  We've talked to Noel Starkey from the uk. We we've got people in a lot of different countries that are coming together trying to make
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:17.200]  Sure that we get some kind of a prohibition against this
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:23.600]  I don't know if that's going to work or not. We've had prohibitions against other types of warfare that basically have not been good
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:24.720]  This is
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:26.720]  This is something that is coming up in the future though
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:31.760]  They're not going to need veterans and of course when people look at the way the veterans have been treated in the hospitals
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:37.600]  That's something you need to look at closely and understand the difference between the promise of health insurance
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:41.280]  Which is what the VA is and the provision of health care
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:47.440]  There's a big gap there and we need to keep that in mind when we look at obama care as well because again
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:50.320]  That is something we're being required to buy health insurance
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:53.680]  Health insurance doesn't mean that you're going to get health care
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:58.560]  I know many cases personally of people who had health care all their life
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:04.880]  And then the health insurance company found a way to dump them when they found out that they had terminal cancer
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:08.400]  I know many cases of that and of course that's essentially
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  Eric what we're seeing in the VA isn't it?
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:18.800]  Yes, we are and I think it's a frightening future that humanity faces and when you realize that
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:23.840]  Nothing else really matters with the baseball game, you know, you got to care about your family
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:29.680]  I'm not really a religious person, but I think that there's a supreme beam and um, I think
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.360]  The educated people from poor backgrounds the upper class the middle class
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.960]  Have to discuss this because as you said Dave, we're heading towards a future where
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:49.040]  The elite think that biological evolution won't be needed. They're called transhumanism as you announced has pointed out and
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:55.600]  Uh, that's a scary. That's their end game and um, I always keep that in mind when I think of Iran
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:57.600]  um
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:49:59.600]  Anti-game marriage and whatnot. I think
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:02.160]  Overall the final issue is
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:08.960]  Their final solution. I mean, yeah, that's where all of this. That's where all this tyranny's final step
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:12.240]  Is a massive, um eugenics
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:17.040]  Program, that's where it ultimately leads. Thank you Eric and you you said that you're not a religious person
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:20.320]  I am a religious person. I would say the people who are not religious
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:25.520]  I would tell say to them that you need to understand that if people don't recognize your leaders
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:30.240]  And the elites who are running the the world here if they don't recognize a god
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:32.640]  They see themselves as god
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:40.720]  That is one of the most dangerous things that we could have that the technological elite that our political elite would see themselves as god
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:43.440]  That's why in the declaration of independence
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:48.800]  They appeal to the creator as a source of our human rights not given to us by the government
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:51.600]  So understand that even if you don't believe in god
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.640]  Understand you don't want men who think they are god. Stay with us to be right back with more of your calls

[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.520]  There's nothing new under the sun
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:44.560]  And the proof positive of that in my heart is that these scientists I hear you and alex
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:49.920]  Expounding on the on the facts not making things up, but expounding on fact
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:53.280]  And all these guys are doing is what?
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:55:01.120]  Men's minds and books that have been written in the past. They're just making those books come to
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:05.440]  Come become reality and in fact
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:09.760]  You know, I believe that when faced with a immoral situation
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:11.760]  We must obey god rather than man
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:19.920]  And so I say that there's nothing new that's going on which is why a student individuals like yourself like like alex
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:26.320]  Like several others are Georgian or a many of your guests. We all see this as just a repetition
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:34.240]  And that's what making the predictions of what is to follow so easy because man is following man
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:41.840]  And stupidly carrying out that agenda. I don't know. Do you believe that way? Oh, absolutely
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.440]  I I think it's very dangerous as I talked about last week
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:49.600]  You know anybody that's seen Jurassic Park, you know the underlying theme of that
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:52.800]  People remember if they've seen the movie not not even read the book
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:58.480]  They remember the underlying theme is the character played by Jeff Goldblum who says just because you can build it
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:04.480]  Doesn't mean that you should build it. They have completely divorced technology from any kind of ethical
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:08.960]  understanding and of course, uh, you know, they think that they're going to achieve
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:13.760]  Eternal life. They think they're going to achieve power over other people through the technology
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:20.320]  But many of the scientists are not even thinking about that aspect. They're just narrowly focusing on the problem
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:25.520]  Michael Crichton called it in the book the original book Jurassic Park. He called it thin intelligence
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:30.160]  He said they see very narrowly. They don't see what's surrounding it. They don't understand the context
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:37.920]  They don't see the consequences we need as scientists to start thinking about the consequences of what we're doing
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:42.960]  And if they won't do it the rest of us need to make sure that we stop that
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:46.560]  I know Hugo DaGarras thinks that's going to result in the art of like wars
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:53.360]  We have an intellectual elite who are once the populace starts to realize and of course realize it a bit too late
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:57.440]  That's what we want to make sure doesn't happen that people don't realize it too late to do something about it
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:01.280]  But he says once they realize it will be too late the intellectual elite will go their own way
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:07.200]  There will be a massive war with giga death. Let me tell you what with these technologies if they're not kept under control
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:12.800]  There will be giga death. We've got the government bringing in deadly bacteria that are not indigenous to our area
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:18.640]  Creating gain of function experiments trying to make them more lethal trying to make them more easily transmitted
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:23.600]  They call them select agents. That's the cdc's term for it. I mean that's absolute insanity
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:29.360]  You want to get concerned about nuclear weapons in iran get concerned about what your government is doing in your own backyard
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:31.040]  We've got 200
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:37.680]  Level three level four biosafety labs in the united states over 100 of them have had leaks have had problems
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:43.840]  That's a greater existential threat to the united states than some third world country on the other side of the world
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:49.760]  You need to understand what your own government is doing through DARPA through these other experiments and do something about that
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:52.480]  Thank you brad and la. Let's go to rich in new york rich
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:59.120]  Yeah, how you doing, Dave? Listen, don't you think that the uh the problem with immigration and also the cartels is
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:03.920]  It's an easy one to solve. I mean, we're always sticking our nose in somewhere. How about fixing mexico?
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:08.400]  Because I talked to plenty of mexicans and they don't want to be americans. They want to be mexican
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:14.080]  They can't be mexican because they can't work there. So they come here. Yeah, well, that's that's just it
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:19.200]  They don't want that to happen. They want to keep the borders open because they want to get everybody in one spot
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:22.800]  They want to it's a cloward and piven strategy
[02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:30.320]  They want to overwhelm the united states with a population that they can control divide and conquer as well as economically through the welfare system
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:34.560]  That's what I believe. Stay with us. We're going to take some more of your calls right after the break

[03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:21.360]  One segment of overdrive. We're going to try to get to some of your calls
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:26.080]  Some of the people have been holding for a while. I wanted to give them a chance to ask their questions

[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:51.440]  Go ahead zen zen girl in florida go ahead
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:58.720]  Okay, let's go to hb and fema 4 you had a comment great show david night great show
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:03.200]  Joyce riley had a quote posed a question yesterday morning on her show
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:08.560]  Who gives the united states the right to say who can have nuclear weapons and who can't that's right off here
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:11.440]  Let's talk about it. Well, that's right. And I think if we
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:16.240]  We haven't effectively been able to stop north korea
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:19.040]  But that is a good point when we go back and we look at this
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:21.040]  Just remember the vietnam war remember
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:27.040]  We we saw southeast asia monolithically everybody was asian and because the vietnamese were asian like the chinese
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:30.000]  We believe that the vietnamese were going to become
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:32.560]  Come within the influence of the chinese
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:38.000]  It's very important to go back and look at a documentary called the fog of war. It's a great documentary from one of the
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.560]  I think his name is ero more as a great documentarian
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:42.560]  In that
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:46.560]  You have robert magnum era at the end of his life making a confession
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:51.280]  I think about where he went wrong talking about how years later he went back to vietnam
[03:01:51.920 --> 03:01:57.600]  And met with former leaders of vietnam and the guy angrily pounded the table and said
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:01:59.440]  Why did you do this?
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:02.480]  Why did you come up with this idiotic strategy of a domino theory?
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:04.480]  Don't you know anything about history?
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:05.520]  Don't you know about our history?
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:08.560]  Don't you understand that for hundreds for thousands of years?
[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:12.560]  We've been fighting the chinese for our independence and of course we see that that is going on to this day
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:17.440]  We now have the chinese government is trying to encroach in vietnamese territory with islands and other things that they're doing
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:18.960]  They're still fighting them
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:24.240]  The domino theory was nonsense. The domino theory didn't stop anything. It didn't change anything when we lost vietnam
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:29.760]  I don't think that the situation is going on in the middle east is going to change anything as I point out before
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:32.880]  We've got three different groups there. We got the sunnis the she is the wahhabis
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:37.200]  We ally ourselves with the most radical the most violent regime there
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:40.080]  If you believe the government's official story of 9-11
[03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:45.200]  Then we are lying ourselves with the people who follow the sect of islam that took down the world trade center
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:48.320]  If that's what you believe, okay, so why is that happening?
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.240]  Why is it that we're doing it with those people? It makes absolutely no sense to me
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:58.240]  I don't think that removing 18 billion dollars worth of sanctions from iran is going to really substantially change the world
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:02:59.280]  I really don't
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:04.160]  And if you're concerned about nuclear proliferation, what what are they doing about north korea?
[03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:07.760]  I don't understand that either. Let's go to uh, thank you for your comments
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:11.680]  HB. Let's go to john in california. I want to try to move quickly. Go ahead john
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:20.880]  Well, hi, Alex. How you doing today? I'm doing good. I'm david though. Okay. Okay, you know, uh, what I want to talk about was, uh
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:25.040]  You're looking at all of this information. Um, if you
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:27.760]  You are minds are like a calculator
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:33.280]  You put in this information from this part of the world this information from this part of world this power multiple
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:38.000]  Informations just from this one country and you press the equal button
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:44.160]  You don't really get a direct answer and I think the problem is there's nobody knows what's coming
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:48.400]  Um, I don't know where our world is headed, but I think there's a handbasket involved
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:54.000]  That's true. That's true. That's what we need to keep our eyes open for jade helm. Yeah, thank you so much
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:58.160]  I will move quickly to some other people with with comments. Uh, let's go to rick in new jersey
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:00.800]  rick go ahead
[03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:02.800]  rick go ahead
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:05.440]  Ricky there, no, only one thing
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:12.160]  I just I hear all this rhetoric from all the candidates and everything and I just don't know why I come always talking about reinstating glass stegel
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:17.760]  I mean, I'm no great money guy, but wouldn't I put the derivatives and everything? Well, I hold it dead back on wall street
[03:04:18.160 --> 03:04:20.160]  Well, you're assuming that they don't
[03:04:20.480 --> 03:04:27.200]  The kind of shenanigans that have been going on. I mean, it's not even just glass stegel when we had the dodd frank reform bill
[03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:30.400]  Uh, that was basically an open
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:34.720]  An open case for the for the banks to continue this type of thing
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:40.000]  Uh, and now we have what they allowed them to do was to put, uh draconian
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:43.600]  Requirements on everybody in terms of if you're having a hard time getting a home loan
[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:48.960]  You can think that quote unquote reform bill, but it has done nothing to stop the speculation
[03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:57.760]  That's it for today's broadcast. Join us tonight at seven central for the nightly news
