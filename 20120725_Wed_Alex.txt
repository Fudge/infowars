[09:34.160 --> 09:39.400]  now in the last three years publicly bragged they have conquered us through fractional reserve
[09:39.400 --> 09:48.160]  banking and derivatives fraud they crow from the rooftops that we are their chattel slaves
[09:48.160 --> 09:53.320]  the military has been captured by NATO in the UN Congress has been told to stand down
[09:53.320 --> 10:01.040]  and they have followed orders our country is seized at the federal level the states have
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.880]  been predominantly federalized the last vestiges of the old republic are being dismantled by

[10:54.560 --> 11:01.720]  good attacking everything independent everything sovereign from the family to human DNA itself
[11:01.720 --> 11:11.560]  we are under unmitigated unprecedented sustained vicious total core of evil attack the general
[11:11.560 --> 11:18.480]  public medically is in a trance mainline journals you can look that up every disease
[11:18.480 --> 11:27.000]  and neurological disorder is exploding we are under soft kill mayday mayday mayday worldwide
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.920]  emergency transmission the united states is no more the republic has been smashed and
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.840]  overrun and taken they are now beginning the preparation for reeducation mop up phase of
[11:39.840 --> 11:44.480]  what's left of the states counties and cities that could be organized into a resistance
[11:44.480 --> 11:53.000]  mayday mayday mayday mayday mayday the republic is in an emergency situation people inside
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.160]  the nsa atf fbi are leaking the criminal plans the reeducation camps the gun confiscation
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.760]  plans the military's response at the top is to say yes those are real documents big deal
[12:06.760 --> 12:12.000]  or to try to arrest the whistleblowers we need more whistleblowing we need everybody to choose
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.400]  what side they're on and to start going public if you can if not getting the info out or
[12:18.400 --> 12:27.600]  at least not executing these orders that you're being given that is treason it is lawlessness
[12:27.600 --> 12:34.520]  and it is the gutting of our country and our families it is the delivery of our sad republic
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.240]  into the hands of the slaughterhouse of the new world order the republic has already been
[12:40.240 --> 12:48.360]  cut a thousand times and lies in a coma and the globalist are now preparing to use our
[12:48.360 --> 12:59.800]  near lifeless corpse to launch world war three it is beyond saddening to see mayor bloomberg
[12:59.800 --> 13:11.880]  engage in absolute criminal rebellion and sedition against the skeleton of the old republic
[13:11.880 --> 13:20.680]  to see him openly call for military coup in the united states with the trader phone hacker
[13:20.680 --> 13:30.880]  criminal pierce morgan while that demonic banker globalist enforcer michael more denigrates
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.720]  our founders and our republic and calls for scrapping the constitution and they call for
[13:35.720 --> 13:42.840]  banning all guns and saying maybe you can have a single shot black powder gun and of
[13:42.840 --> 13:50.660]  course they'll get those as well it is unspeakable just how evil these people are you notice
[13:50.660 --> 13:55.640]  their billionaires their hundred millionaires they get their money from the power structure
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.520]  that is monopolistic they're not communist folks they use communist at the ground level
[14:00.520 --> 14:05.480]  as their siege force as their jihadis just like they're using al-qaeda in libya and syria
[14:05.480 --> 14:13.520]  as their shock drips they use the communists the same way and i am reeling right now by
[14:13.520 --> 14:19.840]  the just brazen attack and the fact that people don't understand law or the constitution
[14:19.840 --> 14:26.240]  or the bill of rights that what bloomberg as a sitting mayor one thing of a citizen called
[14:26.240 --> 14:33.560]  for this but a sitting mayor calling for police nationwide to stand down and not respond
[14:33.560 --> 14:43.680]  to fires robberies rapes killings is a call for anarchy and holding us hostage and is
[14:43.680 --> 14:52.400]  a call to bring the country to its knees in his view to hold us hostage and that gives
[14:52.400 --> 14:57.080]  you an idea into his mindset why do these people stage these shootings or stage fast
[14:57.080 --> 15:02.640]  and furious that cost thousands of shootings and deaths so they can have enough chaos that's
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.400]  what the memo show with fast and furious here is the method out in the open because they
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.440]  think you're in a trance and most their audience is literally watching television they're in
[15:12.440 --> 15:20.040]  a daydream state that's a medical fact folks when you suspend disbelief you've now gone
[15:20.040 --> 15:26.280]  into a dream state now continuing here he's open just like they write memos saying we
[15:26.280 --> 15:30.040]  need a new oklahoma or 9 11 or mass shooting we published that article yesterday with all
[15:30.040 --> 15:35.600]  their quotes to reconnect and be able to take over they think you're stupid so they communicate
[15:35.600 --> 15:42.040]  out in the open and he was communicating with police chiefs on the show last night when
[15:42.040 --> 15:49.000]  he said imagine your servants under the state constitutions under the city charters and county
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.280]  charters to go out hired by the people to protect and serve and he says oh cops are
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.080]  being killed by guns actually the number one causes automobile accident numbers of cops
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.480]  getting killed is actually about flat it's higher in the 70s and 80s looking up you got
[16:03.480 --> 16:07.360]  a better chance that you know a cop I think it's like a six to one dying in a car wrecked
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.760]  and being shot just being shot not dying from the shot we curtain was a big article on that
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.800]  actually guys I didn't bring that in oh no here it is something to keep in mind is hysterical
[16:15.800 --> 16:20.320]  gun grabbers attack the second amendment and it goes over you've got a 0.1 chance of being
[16:20.320 --> 16:24.720]  involved in a mass shooting of five or more victims out of the shooting statistics you've
[16:24.720 --> 16:31.600]  got a 0.1 chance the most common death by gun that they put in here is people breaking
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.880]  in your house or gang bangers killing each other 20 plus times so 21 on average guns
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.000]  are used to frustrate crime to every time they're used in crime and the system knows
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.960]  that they just don't promote those statistics but I don't want to digress here the magnitude
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.640]  the magnitude of Bloomberg who sues gun manufacturers around the country to try to shut them down
[16:53.640 --> 16:59.120]  that way using his city that crime command center of the globalist to try to shut down
[16:59.120 --> 17:03.360]  our second amendment that's failed and so he says to police I'm going to play the clip
[17:03.360 --> 17:09.400]  here in a moment he says what you do is you just go on strike until people until the government
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.400]  the people do what you want and ban these guns like they've done in New York I say call
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.240]  his bluff but that is an act of terrorism that he's saying hold us hostage you know next
[17:19.240 --> 17:29.000]  what what are they saying next turn the power off what are they saying next you'll have
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.680]  us under siege again but the only places this will really work is Detroit Chicago New York
[17:35.680 --> 17:39.480]  where they've taken over where they've restricted the guns where they've totally banned them
[17:39.480 --> 17:46.120]  LA would collapse in within three days into fire and mass death so cleanse yourselves
[17:46.120 --> 17:51.280]  LA New York Chicago do it have your cops not be out there shaking people down for revenue
[17:51.280 --> 17:57.400]  generation and the rest of it and give the green light to all your little anarchy people
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.200]  to start the French Revolution you notice Batman just came out that's what it's all
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.160]  about it's about French Revolution anarchy in New York so go ahead you know where the
[18:06.160 --> 18:11.080]  cops aren't allowed to do anything so this happens go ahead the only place your terrorism
[18:11.080 --> 18:15.360]  will work is where you've made people dependent where they're in these artificial metropolises
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.120]  and can't take care of themselves and that's your model that was your model and fast and
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.600]  furious criminals was a create chaos down there and you did and you wanted to blame
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.640]  our second amendment but people leaked it you see so go ahead and show us your pure evil
[18:29.640 --> 18:35.280]  go ahead and move with your bravada and your arrogance that we're looking for is hubris
[18:35.280 --> 18:43.600]  move with your hubris now because what you've done is illegal a sitting mayor has told police
[18:43.600 --> 18:48.240]  that's like telling air traffic controllers to go on strike with no notice it is an active
[18:48.240 --> 18:54.320]  public fire in the theater crime Bloomberg has committed but don't look for Fox News
[18:54.320 --> 18:58.720]  to go after him Bill Crystal has called for all semi-autos to be banned on Fox News we
[18:58.720 --> 19:03.000]  have the clip of that Rupert Murdoch has come out in a tweet and in statements and said

[24:41.360 --> 24:47.280]  financial reports under systems so bloomberg is an organized crime figure and that's what
[24:47.280 --> 24:52.240]  he is and he's there in new york with the organized crime police shaking the public

[25:12.880 --> 25:18.200]  gets so bad they agree to turn their guns in really places like kenneth saw georgia said

[25:21.600 --> 25:26.360]  the just department admitted in one year every state that's put a concealed carry in so people
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.400]  understand they can carry guns they could already carry him but you just go through their licensing
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.360]  process to carry it concealed under common law that's illegal criminals carry their weapons
[25:35.360 --> 25:39.640]  hidden in common law that's where all this comes from folks so they go oh we'll give
[25:39.640 --> 25:43.880]  you a license for something that's illegal under common law open isn't see but they hope
[25:43.880 --> 25:47.960]  everybody's ignorant about that but in the places where they've put them in within two
[25:47.960 --> 25:56.520]  years on average look these up 24% drop in violent crime home invasions women jogging
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.240]  it all some of the statistics are even greater that's an average police listing are all nod
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.720]  their heads they read those crime statistics but that sure doesn't get pushed in the media
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.680]  does it now I know the average police I've talked to a lot of people know ten years ago
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.520]  I was all constantly after the police now more and more I've talked to so many I've
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.280]  seen polls I realized actually most of them actually understand what's happening because
[26:19.280 --> 26:23.440]  we told them plus they're on the inside they see it all coming through but let me just
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.720]  tell you something these criminals that run this country the offshore mega banks that
[26:27.720 --> 26:32.320]  Brad they've conquered this country and I've read your time magazine economist financial
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.960]  times I've played video clips off the news I mean they're saying it I played congress
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.040]  being told the UN is over our military I'm getting chills so hard I am folks I'm getting
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.320]  chills so effective you zoomed in on me I've got goosebumps right now I've actually got
[26:47.320 --> 26:54.400]  goosebumps right now folks look I've got goosebumps this is so bad see that I've got goosebumps
[26:54.400 --> 26:57.640]  right now you're watching on prison planet dot TV when I say that I'm not saying that
[26:57.640 --> 27:04.120]  for a fact I'm getting chills chills of you know chills you're at a mugger jump out around
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.240]  the corner on you that happened to me twice growing up in Dallas and you get those chills
[27:08.240 --> 27:13.520]  right then inside your body powering up for a fight you know that feeling I mean my body
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.280]  my mind sees all this and it's so real even though I'm conditioned you know from fighting
[27:18.280 --> 27:22.640]  it every day being close to it that my whole body is just like get ready Alex get ready
[27:22.640 --> 27:30.040]  get ready you know your worst analysis is accurate and it's just so crazy that we really
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.800]  are in the hands of foreign banks the congress has been told the UN runs this and we got
[27:34.800 --> 27:43.480]  mafia people the mayor of LA I mean total scum you know says California's Mexico publicly
[27:43.480 --> 27:51.920]  I mean total racist you've got you've got Bloomberg total gangster you got Rahm Emanuel
[27:51.920 --> 27:58.320]  total gangster they're publicly robbing everything they're publicly shipping guns to Mexico to
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.480]  create a crisis and then they go on the news and they tell the police how was this a paramilitary
[28:04.480 --> 28:07.680]  coup because I wrote something for curtain there and I'm going to add this he's listening
[28:07.680 --> 28:12.400]  to make clear just where I see military coup and I mean by that the police have been militarized
[28:12.400 --> 28:17.560]  they are a paramilitary force now and they'll tell you that themselves that conversion has
[28:17.560 --> 28:24.080]  happened from peace officer to paramilitary enforcer that that conversion is almost complete
[28:24.080 --> 28:28.400]  the ghost of the old republic is still in some of them but and those that have even woken
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.920]  up which are a lot of them still it didn't matter the conversions been made it's kind
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.320]  of like a lot of German soldiers didn't like Hitler but they were still in the military
[28:36.320 --> 28:40.240]  they still followed orders so we're now to that point here it's not just choosing which
[28:40.240 --> 28:45.880]  side spiritually you're on you've got to walk the walk if you talk to talk and that starts
[28:45.880 --> 28:49.280]  with talking the talk if you're if you're talking the talk in your mind you got to start talking
[28:49.280 --> 28:55.520]  it physically out into the world and then that will lead to bigger things of physically
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.960]  and physically means calling to talk radio creating newsletters local magazines because
[28:59.960 --> 29:03.160]  they're going to kill the internet they're going to start curtailing it and blocking
[29:03.160 --> 29:06.680]  us that's why we're coming out next month with a newspaper I haven't announced that

[37:39.720 --> 37:47.960]  everything to go to hell in a handbasket they will do it you know why because justice favors
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.960]  those that stand up for themselves and we haven't been standing up we haven't gotten aggressive
[37:52.960 --> 38:02.320]  with our first amendment yet people haven't taken this serious yet fortune favors the
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.960]  bold the fortune we want is liberty and freedom in our time and for our children and to build
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.640]  a good strong society where the innocence are protected and where the creative are protected

[38:40.560 --> 38:51.680]  can't defend themselves it's on it's on i got a bunch of guests coming up and i want
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.440]  to play these clips but you have to understand it no one seems to understand this it is military
[38:57.440 --> 39:06.480]  coup by siege or siege coup to cut off the resources and to have the central government
[39:06.480 --> 39:11.040]  say that's that's a soviet model how many guests in the last year have said just paul
[39:11.040 --> 39:17.080]  craig roberts last week or craig roberts paul craig roberts is on today colonel roberts
[39:17.080 --> 39:22.360]  said no i and all of our other guests have said former military police you name it they
[39:22.360 --> 39:29.480]  have said that they're going to go with a soviet siege model where they turn stuff off and now
[39:29.480 --> 39:35.120]  what is bloomberg said i'm telling you folks they're following an exact blueprint okay you
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.360]  have to understand all of our families are in grave danger they are going to go after
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.680]  everybody if you own a business if if you're a millionaire folks and there's tens of thousands
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.680]  of those in the u.s. you're going to a reeducation camp you're getting arrested you know you're
[39:50.680 --> 39:56.800]  going to be drug out of your house you understand folks they're going to go after everybody
[39:56.800 --> 40:02.640]  unless they're an inner democratic party member they are going to arrest most of the republicans
[40:02.640 --> 40:10.600]  that's why the republicans rupert murdoch and bill crystal whose father was the top trotsky
[40:10.600 --> 40:17.680]  ike and ran similar operations and i mean i mean we are in so much trouble ladies and
[40:17.680 --> 40:23.880]  gentlemen i cannot describe to you the level of danger that we're in when you see rupert
[40:23.880 --> 40:29.800]  murdoch come out and say ban all semianos period when you see bill crystal come out
[40:29.800 --> 40:36.400]  and do it they have been told join with sauron they've been told get in line under emperor
[40:36.400 --> 40:43.480]  palpatine oh oh man we're in a lot of trouble folks they're going to drop the hammer probably
[40:43.480 --> 40:46.680]  they understand it's going to be rough but they you know what fortune favors the bold
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.560]  they're going for it they think so little of you they use al-qaeda and all these countries
[40:51.560 --> 40:54.560]  right now while telling you give your rights up for al-qaeda you know what they're now
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.920]  segwaying into the lone wolf it's the number one threat who is it it's the conservative
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.120]  libertarian you're now getting the blame i've gotten the blame in publications and on big
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.680]  radio shows they're saying i've caused the shooting as we said they would do they're
[41:08.680 --> 41:14.320]  saying rush limbaugh did it on national news they're saying just like clinton said 95 it's
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.760]  people like rush limbaugh and the rhetoric the rhetoric when these criminals come to take
[41:18.760 --> 41:25.520]  our guns and and tax us into oblivion they're coming and all of you that think you're going
[41:25.520 --> 41:29.040]  to get a free ride from the system when they're done with you you're going to be working for
[41:29.040 --> 41:35.480]  a quarter of what you worked for you're destroying everything all you control freaks and bullies
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.920]  that get off on being part of the power structure and the dress up of the uniforms and the rest
[41:39.920 --> 41:47.680]  of it you have no idea what you are unleashing you will burn in your heart and in your gut
[41:47.680 --> 41:54.160]  in your mind later wishing you would have said no it is a paramilitary coup to tell
[41:54.160 --> 42:00.520]  the police to stand down nationwide so that hell is released just like they did in mexico
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.960]  the police stood down there paid off by drug dealers guns shipped in there by the u.s.
[42:04.960 --> 42:10.720]  government to destabilize it they want to do that here in the united states now areas
[42:10.720 --> 42:18.400]  like texas and other areas where you got about 70% of people packing i think crime in many
[42:18.400 --> 42:22.240]  areas will actually go down because people are just going to start killing crooks just
[42:22.240 --> 42:29.160]  like that you step on the property you're dead i i i tell them go ahead we're calling
[42:29.160 --> 42:36.160]  your bluff criminal go ahead and have that demonic police force that that so slovenly
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.920]  and gang members that i cannot believe what i've witnessed we're we're good looking families
[42:41.920 --> 42:48.080]  ask police for directions and get screamed at and say do i look like a phone book police
[42:48.080 --> 42:53.600]  with their hats on sideways with their bellies hanging out smoking cigarettes while telling
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.160]  the media they have no first amendment i mean we video taped at all you could type in new
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.040]  or police arrest abc tv news anchor and and and the guys like out on the street corner
[43:03.040 --> 43:06.960]  they come over to you can't be they got cigars and cigarettes and their hats on sideways because
[43:06.960 --> 43:11.160]  i have a first amendment they go no you don't arresting you can see the sugar i mean this
[43:11.160 --> 43:16.120]  is this is it because they can do whatever they want now this is anarchy by the government
[43:16.120 --> 43:20.080]  anarchy by the crooks that have taken over and they want to make it even worse and turn
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.600]  loose all the illegal aliens and all the all the criminal elements just like bane does
[43:24.600 --> 43:30.280]  in batman the difference is they want the police to join bane we were talking yesterday
[43:30.280 --> 43:33.880]  about what's the message of batman and now that i've seen it we wrote notes up and erin
[43:33.880 --> 43:37.800]  said french revolution and that you don't have any hope only the police will protect
[43:37.800 --> 43:42.200]  you during it they're getting ready for that here in this country the jackabites were the
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.880]  prototype of the communist they wanted to abolish the family and have a nine day week
[43:47.880 --> 43:52.760]  i'm only like what ten months or something they wanted to change get rid of the family
[43:52.760 --> 44:01.160]  this is always when they're playing they want to reorder things they want to play god yeah
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.680]  search youtube if you want the one with the cops arresting the abc news local tv host
[44:05.680 --> 44:08.600]  and they know who he is and he's like they're not allowed to film here and he's like but
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.720]  i'm on the street corner they're like smoking cigarettes going yeah look at taking a jail
[44:12.720 --> 44:20.800]  now i mean this is what we face so good good bloomberg you pig and all of you get out of
[44:20.800 --> 44:25.920]  my country get out of my country michael moore get out of my country pierce morgan uh flip
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.760]  a calderon go to vote you know stay down in mexico down there in your club talk or see
[44:30.760 --> 44:33.960]  where you've disarmed everybody and you can feed on your poor hardworking people down
[44:33.960 --> 44:41.360]  there we don't want to live under your mafia system okay all of you get out of my nation
[44:41.360 --> 44:45.080]  now michael moore says the founders wouldn't want guns today and that folks they're for
[44:45.080 --> 44:50.240]  tyrannical government and the government's arming to the teeth against us with with
[44:50.240 --> 44:56.440]  laser beams and sound cannons and microwave guns and drones and armored vehicles and tanks
[44:56.440 --> 44:59.360]  and they're and they're saying they're gonna use the military against us and what marines
[44:59.360 --> 45:03.560]  in every city and it's all being announced and your answer is turn our guns in because
[45:03.560 --> 45:09.440]  you are a globalist propaganda operative shelling tyranny as a people's revolution
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.520]  what you are is a disgrace and michael moore just like joseph gerbils when your force has
[45:14.520 --> 45:19.400]  attacked the american people and hell is brought to these land if we defeat you which we will
[45:19.400 --> 45:24.920]  i on record and calling for michael moore if the crimes he's calling for executed i want
[45:24.920 --> 45:31.720]  him in the dock at nurenberg too i want i want you all brought to justice do you understand
[45:31.720 --> 45:36.040]  every stinking one of you that wants to put us in reeducation camps and confiscate our
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.440]  guns so we have to face the criminals you've created and bred off welfare you want to destroy
[45:40.440 --> 45:44.920]  this country so you can sit and squat on it and control it socially under your ten FEMA
[45:44.920 --> 45:50.680]  regions you are nothing but a propaganda minister for the globalist and believe me when they
[45:50.680 --> 45:54.320]  carry out these crimes they're they're getting ready to execute you are going to be held
[45:54.320 --> 46:03.360]  accountable bloomberg and michael moore and all of you they hate america they hate you
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.920]  and your family they talk about it they hate you they hate your security they want you
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.000]  to live behind eight locks in new york being robbed on the subway every day let's go to
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.160]  bloomberg and his off the charts call for sedition this is worse than telling air traffic controllers
[46:18.160 --> 46:23.480]  to just walk off the job you can't do that he's telling him again we're going to let
[46:23.480 --> 46:26.760]  crime you've already done that we know you release the violent offenders to scare us
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.880]  in the submission then the chicago police chief 30 years ago got caught on tape bragging
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.280]  how that works we know how it works in your mafia country we know how you want to make
[46:35.280 --> 46:39.880]  the whole country under your mafia control where you sit there as a good fella and talk
[46:39.880 --> 46:44.200]  down to us all over the united states and go man this is the way it is you're going
[46:44.200 --> 46:49.120]  to do it we say yeah well your mafia crap doesn't fly down here in texas and a lot of other
[46:49.120 --> 46:53.080]  places around this country it doesn't fly upstate new york it isn't going to fly in
[46:53.080 --> 46:57.560]  kansas it isn't going to fly in missouri it isn't going to fly in oklahoma it isn't
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.480]  going to fly in florida it isn't going to fly all over this country it isn't going
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.840]  to fly in little towns all over this land you criminal that's criminal what you did
[47:05.840 --> 47:11.040]  and you know it and you showed us who you are here he is with a foreign collaborator
[47:11.040 --> 47:16.000]  operative here's the collaborator with the foreign operative here broadcasting does
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.160]  we need to turn our guns in here it is every time one of these things happens gabriel
[47:21.160 --> 47:28.360]  gifers last year this shooting here there's an outrage and then very quickly it dissipates
[47:28.360 --> 47:33.280]  the american people quite quickly go back to their normal lives and they don't demand
[47:33.280 --> 47:39.120]  action in the way that i would expect them to why do so many americans not feel angry
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.880]  enough get ready well i would take it one step further i don't understand why the police
[47:45.880 --> 47:52.200]  officers across this country don't stand up collectively and say we're going to go on
[47:52.200 --> 47:56.020]  strike good not going to protect you and i don't want the tickets the public through
[47:56.020 --> 48:01.800]  your legislature do what's required to keep us safe after all police officers want to
[48:01.800 --> 48:08.280]  go home to their families and we're doing everything we can to make their job more difficult
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.920]  but more importantly more dangerous by leaving guns in the hands of people who shouldn't
[48:13.920 --> 48:21.080]  have them and letting people who have those guns by things like armor piercing bullets
[48:21.080 --> 48:25.880]  the only reason to have an armor piercing bullet is to go through a vote bullet resistant
[48:25.880 --> 48:33.040]  vest in case you've got crazies with bulletproof vest or corrupt military coming to take your
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.120]  guns but basically all bullets are armor piercing folks it's just they have them that are specifically
[48:38.120 --> 48:42.520]  got the steel cores on them again ladies and gentlemen they're engaged in a criminal
[48:42.520 --> 48:47.760]  takeover they've signed us on to their foreign banking scam 1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion
[48:47.760 --> 48:53.920]  644 trillion the washington post says is our debt even though our part of that is 15 trillion
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.680]  we really owe the bankers through fraud 15 trillion and change not 644 trillion but he
[48:59.680 --> 49:03.560]  says look they got the secretary of the army said they're gonna put troops in every city
[49:03.560 --> 49:09.760]  they're getting everybody ready for this and he's there implying police what about chicago
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.520]  and new york i've seen the numbers they get more cops killed there per capita anywhere
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.600]  it's in the crime so bad there in chicago the police won't even go out into certain neighborhoods
[49:17.600 --> 49:24.720]  now you want to make it like that here you want to make i mean i just saw a case just
[49:24.720 --> 49:29.760]  two days ago where somebody was in a store went and bought a knife and was stabbing
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.160]  people and somebody with a gun told him put your hands up you're dead i'm sorry if you're
[49:35.160 --> 49:40.600]  already stabbing people and i'm in a grocery store and i had a good firearm on me you're
[49:40.600 --> 49:45.360]  not getting a warning and the police shouldn't warn you either you're already stabbing people
[49:45.360 --> 49:49.960]  running around it's dangerous to tell somebody to drop it you're dead okay you come in my
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.920]  house you're dead you're already assaulting somebody with a deadly weapon i'm not telling
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.640]  you drop jack diddly squad let's get that part straight right there i'm gonna fill you
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.960]  full of holes right there on the spot let me tell you don't know that guy's on pcp or
[50:02.960 --> 50:10.680]  what this guy up here at walmart one of the first austin cops killed what a decade last
[50:10.680 --> 50:16.160]  cop before him was killed by a felon on the run there you go they weren't falling along
[50:16.160 --> 50:19.760]  that felon had a gun this guy was on a bunch of psychotropic drugs didn't even know who
[50:19.760 --> 50:25.360]  he was by the way this supposed ronald mcdonald's shooter at the batman thing his mother says
[50:25.360 --> 50:29.680]  she never said that it's a total setup even local fox news is saying none of this stuff
[50:29.680 --> 50:32.920]  adds up and people are asking questions and saying there were multiple shooters and that
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.360]  and and that he was wearing a black mask and it wasn't ronald mcdonald and his mother didn't
[50:36.360 --> 50:40.360]  say that the police just folks it's set up by the way you know who that police chief
[50:40.360 --> 50:47.560]  worked for he worked for bloomberg good old bloomberg bloomberg helped keep his mouth shut

[54:16.560 --> 54:39.960]  we've got to call these tyrants out for what they are they're just accustomed us to total
[54:39.960 --> 54:45.480]  tyranny you know gun sales were already at record levels they doubled since the shooting
[54:45.480 --> 54:50.240]  so there's your message you mafia criminals you're not getting our guns as you rob america
[54:50.240 --> 54:55.120]  bloomberg's robbing america but the bankers they're all looting us and they're here saying
[54:55.120 --> 54:59.480]  hands up when you rob a bank when you rob a country you say hands up when a country gets
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.000]  occupied they stay turned your guns in and the globalist of occupied all these other
[55:03.000 --> 55:09.120]  countries they want everybody's guns rob jagabson ran in here and when I say it's illegal folks
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.920]  I already knew that but I'm getting articles written right now because the debate erupted
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.160]  isn't illegal for someone to call for a police strike yes if you're in the police department
[55:17.160 --> 55:21.720]  it's illegal it's illegal for the union and folks it is illegal for the mayor because
[55:21.720 --> 55:26.760]  he is in an executive position but again the president can ship guns to mexico and blame
[55:26.760 --> 55:33.760]  the second amendment total felonies nsa spies on us without warrants total felonies police
[55:33.760 --> 55:39.600]  strike police strike occurs when law enforcement is affected by labor dispute they're extremely
[55:39.600 --> 55:46.440]  rare generally they're illegal but for labor reasons the law is difficult to enforce not
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.520]  when you have the mayor call for it legality thus anyone calling on a police to stop work
[55:51.520 --> 55:57.320]  or support a fellow worker would be guilty of criminal offense and I looked it up it's
[55:57.320 --> 56:01.200]  illegal in new york in fact guys when you printed this I don't think you printed me
[56:01.200 --> 56:13.160]  all the references but there it all is was a there's a book on it police strikes is being
[56:13.160 --> 56:18.400]  number and all that but the point is is that is it legal to say I'm gonna turn the lights
[56:18.400 --> 56:25.320]  off in new york till you do what I want that's called holding a hostage oh you gotta have
[56:25.320 --> 56:29.600]  us come inspect your house a little green investigation to pay us money this all this
[56:29.600 --> 56:36.880]  is criminal government now here's michael more as a 30 minute interview with this pig
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.520]  this authoritarian despot trash words don't describe it he knows exactly what he's doing
[56:41.520 --> 56:46.800]  he's not some useful idiot he says everything should be banned onto muskets and then he lies
[56:46.800 --> 56:50.760]  and say the founders wouldn't agree with this today folks the founders I've got this type
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.960]  in founding father quotes on the on on the second amendment they said it's for the government
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.160]  it's for a tyrannical force and we should have whatever the government has well you
[56:58.160 --> 57:02.360]  know that's way out of balance so here they are and they're all calling for including ripper
[57:02.360 --> 57:08.440]  murdoch bill crystal and others ban all semi-auto and ATF of course it said they want to ban
[57:08.440 --> 57:14.120]  right now this is it folks this is it this is it you're like oh they won't try that
[57:14.120 --> 57:17.400]  yes they will police are like but nobody's gonna turn them in it's gonna be a war that's
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.640]  the plan okay and they're telling you your criminal police chiefs a lot of them that
[57:22.640 --> 57:26.440]  they have these federal boards at the side and you know like to tell the city if they
[57:26.440 --> 57:31.000]  want grants behind the scenes who to put in his police chief any police chief tells you
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.120]  confiscate guns as a criminal any police chief tells you take part in occupation like Katrina
[57:36.120 --> 57:40.920]  is a criminal remember that decide who you stand for now this is a big deal let's go
[57:40.920 --> 57:45.240]  to the criminal Michael Moore here it is this must seem odd to people in other countries
[57:45.240 --> 57:50.440]  that we view our Constitution as if it was written by God himself that it was somehow
[57:50.440 --> 57:55.840]  through some sort of divine intervention or whatever it was etched in stone like Moses
[57:55.840 --> 58:05.360]  and the tablets and and and because what they thought was right in 1776 to 1789 that was
[58:05.360 --> 58:11.400]  a that is the way we have to live today in the 21st century I mean we wouldn't we wouldn't
[58:11.400 --> 58:15.160]  go to a doctor and have haven't put leeches on us to suck the blood out of us because
[58:15.160 --> 58:20.600]  that would cure us that's what they did you know 150 years ago no no no 2000 years ago
[58:20.600 --> 58:26.960]  they took all your your arms your swords see it was new to arm the people so you wouldn't

[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:21.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:30.840]  well here's my statement that i added to curtain in those article bloomberg cops should go on
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:36.600]  strike until Americans surrender their guns no from Alex Jones bloomberg is illustrating
[1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:42.840]  what an out-of-control despot he is not content to simply shoe gun manufacturers nationwide and
[1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:49.880]  destroy our right to self-defense he is now inciting police to engage in a type of paramilitary coup
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:01:01.800]  or siege threatening anarchy and holding the people hostage it's called a siege coup that's
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:05.320]  the term i coined for but they've done it many times in history they just turned the lights off
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:11.560]  shut down the roads siege everybody until they acquiesce i say we call their bluff police should
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:16.360]  go on strike and we'll see the cities where guns have been confiscated like new york la and chicago
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:21.800]  to sit into flames and other areas where the public are armed we'll see a drop in crime
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:26.920]  yeah that's right 90% of the cops are just out revenue generating anyways but the police won't
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:33.160]  actually go on strike because all they want to do is revenue generate bloomberg get out of my country
[1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:38.200]  why don't you go with pierce morgan and get out of america and go back to north korea
[1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:41.480]  you are nothing but a crime boss in a degenerate tyrant
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:48.120]  and i got watson doing his own article by the way there was a big debate whether this was
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:52.520]  criminal when i was saying it on air i wouldn't say it unless it was criminal everything they're
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:56.360]  doing is sedition against this country and is criminal and they've shown it these are radicals
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:01.400]  folks this is how you overthrow the czars and bring in what happened i mean that's their plan
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:07.960]  that's exactly that's exactly what's going on in fact it was pretty much new york mob that
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:12.920]  went over there and did that to begin with if you didn't know that in russia don't go on strike for
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:20.920]  tougher gun laws uh is the new headline washington cbs now bloomberg has responded saying he clarified
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:29.480]  today he didn't mean it literally he says new york law prevents police strikes you're a criminal
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:37.640]  you're a criminal okay you are a criminal period suing gun manufacturers all over the
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:42.680]  country and losing but over and over again using taxpayer money to sue them to try to shut down
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:50.760]  gun manufacturers you're trying to get other cities with you to go against the states the
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:55.320]  cities are chartered by the states through the counties you're a seditious criminal
[1:02:56.520 --> 1:03:01.720]  how much of these criminals are we going to put up with okay i'm done and let me tell you
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:06.520]  something it's not fun every day i'm a smart person i know i'm risking my life i know they
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:11.800]  could set me up they'll torture the hell out of me in prison but you know what that's what it takes
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:17.960]  to have freedom okay i'm not given into this scum my ancestor didn't and i'm not nothing
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:23.320]  makes me more angry than a bunch of cowardly filth that think they intimidate us and think they
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:29.400]  control us i'm calling your bluff you criminal degenerate and if you smash me like they smash
[1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:34.200]  colonel travis at the alamo all that does is make the tree of liberty rise and smash you because
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:40.680]  in the final equation that is my only goal and i beg on the altar of god that he
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:48.280]  empower that same spirit he gave us that led to 1776 to sweep you aside and that we persevere
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:53.560]  the slings and arrows and all the persecution and all the attacks and all the hate that you spew
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.360]  at us we will defeat you and our listeners will support us and they will spread the word and a
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:07.400]  tide is rising an army is coming an army of people with truth in their hearts and love in their eyes
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:13.000]  but anger for evil we are coming to defeat your new world order make no mistake god's help you

[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:22.840]  but your new world order was destined to fail from the beginning
[1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:28.760]  oh what's going on on my computer

[1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:25.240]  bloomberg says police should go on strike nationwide until americans surrender their guns
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:31.640]  since then he's gone out on cbs news saying don't go on strike whichever gun laws that's the headline
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:35.560]  he went on to say that he admits that it's illegal in new york as we read to you earlier
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:42.360]  continuing tsa has expanded its invasion to california train stations and bus terminals
[1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:48.920]  we got video of 10 of them standing around with firearms and police dogs a hardcore video up there
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:53.160]  tsa now announcing they're going to stop you at checkpoints and download your smartphone data
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:58.280]  they've got rip software where it takes a few minutes to download it so i mean you talk about
[1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:05.480]  beyond nazi germany it's here now dr paul craig roberts uh is with us for the next 30 minutes or so
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:09.240]  and then after that i'm going to open the phones up for police uh head of congressman former
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:14.120]  congressman bob bar joining us talk about a host of issues but i want to open the phones up after
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:18.440]  dr roberts leaves his former head of policy at the treasury former wall street journal editor
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:23.320]  and best-selling author syndicated columnist i want to open the phones up for police because you
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:29.720]  know it's illegal to call for you to go on strike so we do so we turn our guns in uh just incredible
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:35.080]  that he said that on cnn michael more saying the founders didn't mean for us to have guns on there
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:40.920]  i mean this is incredible uh so we're going to be going over all of that but i wanted to get
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:47.160]  dr roberts on about a week and a half ago and he's he's now with us over an article uh that he did
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:52.600]  the collapsing u.s economy and the end of the world a very powerful article at paul craig roberts
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:58.440]  dot org uh mirrored at info wars dot com but again paul craig roberts dot org a superlative
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:04.840]  website sure i want to get into this what what you see happening in the world the acceleration of
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:09.160]  naked tyranny how bad you think it's going to get because you saw this a ways off but things seem to
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:17.240]  be accelerating but first off what do you make of bloomberg uh and michael more and now we have
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:23.160]  rupert murdoch and bill crystal saying no one should be allowed to have semi-automatic firearms
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:30.040]  i've never seen such a unified front against our guns well alex um i've said it for a long time and
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:36.440]  i would imagine you have two an armed population is totally inconsistent with the police state
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:41.480]  so now that they do have a police state uh they're going to take away the guns
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:50.920]  uh how exactly they'll go about it one never knows uh this latest uh movie theater shooting
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:58.440]  is so bizarre it almost looks like it had to be orchestrated and of course these types of events
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:08.760]  very much play into the spin that's used to prepare people for uh having to turn in the guns
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:18.040]  so i don't think americans will much longer be allowed to uh to be armed they're going to be
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:26.760]  disarmed because the only amendment left in the constitution is the second one if they can take
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:33.880]  away uh the right to do process habeas corpus uh you know the prohibition against cruel
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:38.760]  non-usual treatment because they now torture if they can take all these away i think take away the
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:48.200]  guns and so it's just a question of uh of of them doing it it probably won't be much longer
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:54.360]  and people said oh they won't pass government health care oh they won't obama won't sign
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:12:00.680]  india a oh obama won't put our military under nato it's all being done and they've gotten rid of all
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:06.200]  the other nine amendments and they're trying to phase it in but the second amendment still stands
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:12.680]  in the way the minute they get that it's going to be like the final you know rock in the damn
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:17.800]  giving way and it's just going to collapse into an orgy of corruption i mean i'm sure you've seen
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:21.880]  the army admits the reeducation camp documents that were made public two months ago they said yeah
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:26.760]  that's ours they admit they're training for gun confiscation the secretary the secretary of the
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:32.120]  army said in the cfr as you know two months ago he said yeah we want a brigade in every city
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:37.640]  of marines and army i mean it's all happening what are they getting ready for dr roberts i
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:47.080]  don't know but uh they certainly have a police state it's in it's in place and um we we no longer
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:53.880]  have any rights if they don't want us to have them they can bring any kind of charges against
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:13:02.280]  anybody at any time or they can simply disappear them uh you know there's no longer protection
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:07.320]  against being thrown into a dungeon uh with the rest for the rest of your life without ever being
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:14.440]  told why you're there much less a court being told or a jury or any evidence presented so
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:23.480]  as far as i can tell the constitution no longer exists there no longer exist any constraints on
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:33.480]  the power of government and um it's uh age is turned a lot of people are evacuating the united
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:39.800]  states what do you think about that phenomenon well they've got good sense if i wasn't so old i do
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:44.840]  i'd do it too and i think more people would be doing it if they could sell the property but
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:51.720]  right now you can't really sell anything you have to give it away so not that there's any really
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:58.360]  safe place to go if you think about it you know the united states claims that uh its law reaches
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:05.800]  every country and uh it and if the country doesn't give you back uh they'll be paid a bribe to do it
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:10.120]  and if that doesn't work it they'll send somebody in to kidnap you and take you off yeah they've
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:14.680]  been doing that a lot now or they say they'll just have a drone kill you even in a friendly country
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:23.240]  uh that's right they'll kill you with a drone or or um the local population wants the power of the
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:31.960]  united states declines um the locals may turn on you because uh they'll blame the americans for all
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:35.880]  the terrible things that are happening the world oppression or whatever and they'll you be in the
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:45.080]  middle of them so uh you might not even be safe and what's the friendly environment abroad once
[1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:52.120]  the power of the united states is seen to be eroding away diminishing which it has to do
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:15:00.280]  with the rate at which debt is pouring out the rate at which the debt's being monetized this has
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:06.360]  to put pressure on the dollar on the dollar's value and although the federal reserve is propping
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:15.560]  it up in many ways right now these props can't last forever so when dollar's value uh falls enough
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:20.280]  that it gets abandoned as world reserve currency the power of the united states will be dramatically
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.160]  curtailed what will qe3 i know that the federal reserve has been hinting more at that the financial
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:29.880]  times two days ago said it's probably coming soon but they've held it off longer than some thought
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:33.960]  you predicted they would hold it off longer i remember that over a year ago and they did
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:39.240]  most people said they would have it by the end of last year uh what could precipitate what you
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.720]  call the end of the world i mean you've i never seen you write articles about the end of the world
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:50.680]  well i i'm trying to remember that article um i pointed out all of the things that were undermining
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:59.640]  the economic position of the united states and its native puppets and and of course we see forming
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:05.640]  other blocks for example the bricks you know brazil india uh china russia
[1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:13.800]  south africa are now forming to avoid the use of the dollar in their international settlements
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:18.920]  so they're going to pay each other off or settle their balance of payments between each other
[1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:24.440]  in their own currencies and there was a report recently that china and japan it made the same
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:34.120]  agreement so you can see there uh the the second third largest economies and uh and the most important
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:40.760]  countries uh like russia brazil's the biggest country in south america south africa of course
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:45.480]  is the dominant economy in that continent and if they're all moving away from the dollar then
[1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:52.040]  the the demand for for dollars has to fall and even though they're bought heavily into it i mean i
[1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:58.840]  i guess they understand a great evil has risen well i think they see uh i think they see trouble
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:04.680]  coming with it and they just don't want to be dependent on it because when it goes there'd be
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:11.240]  a lot of dislocation why are the western elites giving away all their power in an orgy of power
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.640]  grabbing i mean they've got to know that they're going to end up in the final equation not winning
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:22.280]  this well i don't you know as we talked about this before i'm not so sure they know as much as you
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:29.320]  think they do and i think the hubris ran away with them look alex from the soviet union collapsed
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:35.160]  what did we have we had the neoconservative response the end of history the utter total
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:43.640]  victory of the united states and capitalism and so this just hubris ran away with them they just
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:50.680]  became without any kind of judgment or discernment there there was no alternative to america period
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:58.120]  and they've not gotten over that they they keep pressing it further but so i don't think they'll
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:05.720]  be prepared for the for the outcome any more than napoleon was prepared for the outcome of
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:13.960]  his invasion of russia or hitler so people make fundamental mistakes they they get over confident
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:19.240]  well i checked history i've never seen russian ministers even when they were like totally red
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:24.920]  say we're preparing to nuke you and medietjev and putin are saying you're encircling us you're
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.000]  trying to overthrow our government we're preparing to nuke western europe and they've got their their
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:35.160]  bombers flying back in the submarines and the military's funding al qaeda to attack syria i mean
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:43.960]  this is insanity well it's insanity it's uh part of the neoconservative drive for american
[1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:51.000]  hegemy and it's part of the huge sums of billions and billions of profits the military security
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:57.640]  complex is making out and making out of the american drive for hegemy so you have their
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:04.840]  their uh powerful uh interest who benefit from this insanity and that's why they're doing it they
[1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:12.680]  get you know everything is short term they think short term and they're benefiting short term and
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:19.960]  so they're leading the world to disaster because of their short term focus they've restarted the
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:27.160]  cold war with russia they're starting it with china you know all of the developments uh in
[1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:34.520]  the pacific the united states has announced that it's it's going to re-focus its fleet on the pacific

[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:14.280]  father of reaganomics big publications have called him one of the top 10 living economists out there
[1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:18.280]  i think was that money or forbs i forget uh he's was got about six minutes left sir
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.680]  we got some big breaking news after he leaves us i'll just leave it at that it's top linked on drudge
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:31.480]  our story right in the middle column uh looking at the libor scandal and what's happened with that
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:38.120]  just another admission of banks all over the world coordinating interest rates to rip people off
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:44.920]  and then i saw the fine they had it was like a tiny micron of the overall profit i mean
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:49.240]  this will collapse society of just lawlessness is legal what's your take on that
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:56.520]  okay alex the the uh fixing of the libor rate is just part and parcel of the fixing of the
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:01.480]  interest rate by the federal reserve and the bank of england the purpose of the low interest rates
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:07.480]  is quite different from the spin in the news it's not to rip people off or to let the banks
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:16.600]  borrow cheaper when you have a lower libor rate it means that the prices of all of the
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:24.280]  debt instruments that are linked to libor rise you know the price of a bond or a debt instrument
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:29.960]  goes in the opposite direction of interest rates so a lower libor rate means the price
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:36.680]  of all of these derivatives and so forth that are linked to libor these floating rate instruments
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:43.000]  those prices jump and so since that's what the banks have it makes the prices of that
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:50.920]  of the instruments on their books rise and it makes them look more solvent than they are so
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:57.320]  the whole reason for fixing the interest rate is to create this artificial appearance of bank
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:04.920]  solvency and that's why the fed and the bank of england didn't blow the whistle on the banks
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:11.400]  fixing the libor rate there are other ways they fix the rates the banks if you for example if you
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:18.440]  sell an interest rates a swap that's the way of shorting interest rates so if the banks put on a
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:25.000]  lot of sales of interest rate swaps it drives down interest rates and therefore the values
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:31.720]  of the assets on their books rise so it's part in other words alex we have a financial system
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:39.000]  that's been so corrupted by concentration of banks into too big to fail and by deregulation
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:47.800]  that the only way it can be kept afloat is through organized fraud fraud by the central banks fraud
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:54.600]  by the banks themselves and that's what it takes to keep the system afloat now you're obviously a
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:59.240]  total insider can speak to that and i agree with you that obviously that's the main overriding
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:03.400]  you know issue i mean i mean you've helped you have set these things legally in the past you know
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:09.880]  back with congress and and the fellow reserve but looking at this isn't it also then that the banks
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:14.680]  then also get the money at zero percent and then can loan it out for more i mean there is that profit
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:22.200]  angle as well yes but that's inconsequential compared to the rise to the capital gains
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:29.560]  not it got it it props up all the derivatives and it props up the the treasuries it props up
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:36.280]  everything that's linked to a floating rate and since rates tend to move in the same direction
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:44.120]  it also props up the treasuries it helps the feds policy succeed now the real question is
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:52.760]  how long can all this propping up go on the way i see it can come undone is when the the bricks
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:58.520]  in china and japan and all these countries they start abandoning the dollar they won't just dump
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:04.840]  them overnight but as they start using their own currencies in place of the dollar in international
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:10.040]  settlements the demand for the dollar will start coming down now it's harder for the fed to fix the
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:15.880]  price of the dollar than it is for them to fix the price of bonds traditionally they fixed that they
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:21.080]  can support the dollar by raising interest rates but they can't raise interest rates when their
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:30.040]  policy is low interest rates so that's where the thing can come undone they may find themselves unable
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:36.200]  to keep the dollar from sinking and if the dollar sinks it means the values of assets
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:44.760]  denominated in dollars also sink so they will lose control over the bond price this is why they
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:51.400]  manipulate the gold and silver market because they don't want gold and silver rising it's a way of
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:56.520]  of devaluing the dollar so every time the gold and silver starts going up they sell naked shorts
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:03.800]  it's also why they prevent any real decline in the stock market every time people exit the stock
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:12.040]  market and sell they go in and buy stock index futures and then that all sets the selling in
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:18.520]  the market and that's the plunge protection team correct that's that's right and so the whole the
[1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:24.200]  whole finance the whole financial system is rigged not just interest rates gold and silver prices
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.040]  you know dr roberts it's been hard to get you on the last two weeks can i twist your arm to come

[1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:09.400]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:14.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:20.040]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:25.160]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:30.440]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:35.080]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:40.440]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:31:40.440 --> 1:31:44.840]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:21.080]  guns in sounds like something bane would do in a fictional movie you break the law bloomberg
[1:33:21.080 --> 1:33:27.800]  the law you'll hear from me i know i'm working for the republic i'm the info wars dot com radio show
[1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:36.200]  all right ladies and gentlemen let's go back to dr paul craig roberts great website i'm so glad
[1:33:36.200 --> 1:33:40.760]  and last year so he started this website because it really is a nice website i visited all the time
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:47.720]  paul craig roberts dot org and the institute for political economy i'm going to keep him about five
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:54.280]  six minutes here finishing up on what's happening militarily around the world and i was asking him
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:57.800]  here in the break before last what he wanted to continue with and he said well you know the subject
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:04.120]  we're on where this leads so i want to ask him let's just do that now is there from your historical
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:09.640]  research from being the number two in the treasury wall street journal editor you know at the head of
[1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:15.000]  big prestigious think tanks you know the intelligence you know you've been part of it i know you've
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:19.320]  been ostracized a bit for not worshiping and drinking the kool-aid now you wouldn't be invited
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:25.800]  to the wolf's lair either in 1945 i imagine by hitler but the point is is that you see the
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:30.520]  emperor has no clothes is there any way to navigate this because you're saying the power structure
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:35.320]  doesn't really have a plan i agree that they're out of control and delusional but they got a plan
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:41.240]  it's checkpoints everywhere it's drones it's citizen spies all the local cops i talked to were told
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:46.440]  yeah we're getting ready for marshal law basically i don't know if that's going to happen but their
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:54.040]  plan is a post free economy in this new klep no kleptocrat type system so is there is there any
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:35:00.680]  way to avert that on the road we're on well they may have a plan like that domestically but i thought
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:04.840]  you were talking about internationally sure but everything i mean i mean is there any way out of
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:11.480]  this is there any way for alex what what they may not uh they may or may not understand is the economy
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:17.080]  is collapsing out from under them now are they doing this because they know the economy is collapsing
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:24.920]  or is it just a grab a power by security agencies and they're not aware so i don't know what happens
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:31.080]  when when the economy collapses out from under them i don't know uh what they'll do or what they'll
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:36.280]  be able to do how much resistance they would meet from desperate people i just can't predict that
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:45.000]  but what i think is happening is much of the rest of the world is realizing that the days of the
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:52.200]  united states power has peaked and is on a decline so we're meeting firmer opposition from the russians
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:36:00.280]  firmer opposition from china from other countries like brazil and i think our nato puppets are also
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:09.080]  realizing that they may be aligned with a collapsing empire and so we may see that all of a sudden
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:19.160]  washington can't pull the strings anymore that that it's uh it's its hegemy is over and if the
[1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:27.080]  world turns its back on us and ceases to follow our leadership and ceases to quake and fear and
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:35.000]  ceases to be bought off uh then the whole situation changes and i do not think washington has any
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  control over that they may have a lot more control over the domestic population with the police state
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:47.880]  they've put in place but how these things play out i don't know it'll be interesting times and
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:54.760]  dangerous times and at some point people like you and i may be carted off or we'll have to shut up
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:37:05.400]  so it's hard to know how this all all ends up wow it's it's really is indescribable how real this is
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:10.840]  and historically for those of us that have studied history how unbelievably off the chart uh things
[1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:15.800]  have gotten you know who concurs with you as you know has been the last four chairman of the joint
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:21.240]  chiefs until they got demsy who reportedly can hardly tie a shoelaces they've all said this is
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:25.960]  insane and that these wars are going to bring us down they've said no repeatedly and been removed
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:31.800]  and they had a sent com fox felon was removed uh i actually know that you know the higher
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.840]  levels of the pentagon have been telling the the the bankers you know stopped this but it's a
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:43.080]  psychology of of people like corezine with 40 to one bets with other people's money and it just
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:51.000]  it just you know you realize it's a bunch of arrogant cocksure uh ivy league you know wild men
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:55.240]  because i've been to some parties where some of these guys are at and they act like 14 year olds
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:02.600]  on drugs see washington is unaccountable that that was what was established by the bush
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:09.480]  and cheney administration that that the executive branch is no longer accountable to law to the
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:17.640]  constitution to congress or to the courts and and and obama who said he was going to fix all that
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:25.960]  has has merely continued it and codified it into law so that we now have the executive branch is
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:31.800]  independent of law of the constitution and is not accountable uh the president of the united
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:36.920]  states can announce that he has a policy of drawing up a list of american citizens to be
[1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:43.960]  assassinated without due process and he's not immediately impeached now if reagan had done
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:49.080]  something like that or for that matter something as recent as cotton they would have been immediately
[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:57.240]  impeached so this shows you how rapid the dissent is how rapid the changes are that the president
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:04.040]  can say hey i can kill any american that i'm suspicious of without giving any or nato is over
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:09.560]  our military i mean that way they just get it what's really i think that's not true uh no i agree
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:16.440]  with you let me tell you is over nato they are first of all nato hadn't got any military
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:25.080]  it's the american military and we dress it up with a few uh small detachments of people here
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:29.560]  and there but the entire countries of europe they're military probably in any larger than the
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:35.000]  georgia national guard now listen i totally agree with you in fact let me elaborate this is how they
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.680]  get congress out of the way who is over the power to wage war and the purse as you know
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:47.960]  in the constitution is now they say oh nato in the un is who we get authorization for but really
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:53.480]  nato in the un are puppets of the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:40:00.760]  and so it's this game because right in front of this is this military uh coup run by the banksters
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:08.200]  well i think that uh you're right that when we say oh uh we don't have to go to congress we
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:14.760]  go to the un or we can go to nato uh we say that when we think we can make the un and nato do what
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:20.600]  we want uh the trouble with the un though is that china russia have vetoes and they're using them now
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:29.560]  so that avenue is not is not working for them and of course they tried to overthrow russia by
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:35.320]  financing the russian political opposition through the national downwind for a democracy which is
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:42.440]  essentially a cia state department front and uh and and putin finally caught on and has now made
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:47.720]  all of the russian opposition that are funded by american money to registers foreign agents
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:57.000]  so the russians are catching on the chinese can see the uh the american bases surrounding them
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  you know we're trying to get the naval base in it from vietnam we're trying to get an air base from
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:09.160]  thailand uh we're trying to get uh the philippines to let the navy back in subic bay we're building
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:17.160]  a new base on the south korean island we've sent marines to australia and other places and so china
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:24.440]  sees this and so this of course will affect their attitude toward cooperating the united states on a
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:33.720]  variety of fronts and and we may think we can buy off the other asian countries indonesia vietnam
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:42.600]  thailand but china is close to them we're not and they'll assess that so i think what what we may
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:50.760]  see here is the beginning of the unraveling of of american hegemy i do i don't know sir in closing
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:57.000]  that was my next question then i want to briefly ask you about syria and just the spectacle of al-qaeda
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.640]  publicly working for the west now which of course always did but but looking at this
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:07.160]  i mean i've studied history but you negotiate with russia you dealt with it you know you
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:11.320]  were alive back when this was all really you know in the thick of it do you ever remember
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:17.320]  the time where russian presidents and prime ministers openly said okay we're preparing to use
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:22.680]  nuclear weapons against you don't deploy those missiles i mean that because historically the
[1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:28.360]  russians don't usually bluff and for me that that's a big deal and now they put spit snats
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:34.920]  into syria we know western commandos through nato us backed are in there now trying to take
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:39.880]  demascus in other areas i mean this uh clearly that's not a suicide bomb that just killed most
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:44.840]  of military leadership it went through a window it was a cruise missile i mean all of this i mean
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:52.280]  this is war this is full-on war with proxy states well it's very dangerous i certainly agree and
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:59.320]  you're completely right that both medeviz and pudin have raised a specter of nuclear war they say
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:05.640]  that that these things are getting out of hand for no good reason and the downside is horrendous
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:16.760]  and the washington remains deaf they don't hear it so as i have said before and in other articles
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:24.600]  and for quite a time the united states is the greatest threat to life on earth of any country
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:33.800]  that is in existence and the outcome may be that there's no life on earth and certainly they don't
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:40.600]  listen to anybody they don't listen when the russian prime minister and the russian president
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:46.760]  issue clear warnings they don't hear it so why are they gonna listen to me or you or anybody
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:52.120]  you're going to nuke western europe if you move your missiles in no that's not what they said
[1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:59.000]  no what they said was look if you're going to surround us with missile bases we are going to
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:06.200]  target western europe capitals with cruise missiles yeah well looks yum which your missile bases can't
[1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:11.880]  do anything about and not only that we're going to target your missile bases with cruise missiles
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:18.760]  and so your missile bases won't be there either and so what the russians are saying is that what
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:24.680]  you're doing is utterly stupid because it's not going to do you any good and yet you're raising
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:31.640]  tensions and so why don't you stop that's what the russians keep saying they're not threatening
[1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:35.640]  that they're going to blow anybody out they're just saying look we have these all-setting
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:41.960]  steps we'd rather not spend the money doing this we have better uses for it domestically
[1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:49.400]  but if you're going to surround us with anti ballistic missile bases in order to neutralize
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:57.560]  our nuclear deterrent we will simply put the warheads on cruise missiles that your anti ballistic
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:03.480]  missiles cannot touch because they're flying low the ground the cruise missiles and we'll target all
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:09.240]  the european capitals sure but if you go back to 888 remember that they did have their chairman
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:14.360]  join jesus staff said if you don't pull back we've just rolled nukes in my point is they're going to
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:22.200]  a very aggressive stance again well i think that they're they're they're going on and they're not
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:27.320]  going to sit there and take it and they're taking the aggressive stance comes from the united states
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:32.840]  oh i understand but i'm saying it it's it's a major escalation they are initiating all of the
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:40.040]  trouble all of the aggression and they have now said that they have responses that can all set
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:45.400]  whatever advantage we expect to get from these bases so why don't we just quit doing it now so
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:52.600]  everybody doesn't waste their money and and so we we can get over this but there's also cruise
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:46:00.040]  missiles launched off submarines the russians have well no no doubt they probably won't need them but
[1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:08.360]  the point is i don't think the russians want a nuclear war i'm not sure about the neoconservants
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:19.160]  i think i recall seeing a video of of uh william christel uh in some debate or something in which
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:27.640]  he says what's the good of duke the missiles if you can't use yeah i remember that so uh in fact
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:31.960]  if you do remember and you have asked files if you can find that i sure would like to have the
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:39.160]  the uh the url to it but go look that up uh william christel says you know what's the
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:43.480]  point nuclear weapons if you can't use them that's like saying hey why not just drop your kid into
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:47.640]  a wood chipper what's the point of having a two-year-old if you can't drop them into a wood chipper
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:53.240]  i mean it's just total total madness uh dr paul craig roberts i love the site paul craig roberts
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:47:01.240]  dot org thank you for letting us carry your work uh there um at info wars dot com and i did have a
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:07.640]  question for you that i meant to ask you when we were off air uh but uh what i'll do is uh is
[1:47:07.640 --> 1:47:10.920]  we're about to go to break here in just a few minutes if you could stay on skype i had one more
[1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:18.200]  question for you off air if that's okay okay alex all right thank you so much uh for joining us today
[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:22.520]  uh there goes dr paul craig roberts we're going to break here in just a few minutes i said that
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:28.280]  if police officers wanted to call in to give us their take on obama saying go on strike excuse me
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:35.160]  obama surrogate uh bloomberg shane go on strike forty and slip there uh if if if we don't ban our
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:41.160]  guns and michael morris saying take all guns but but black powder a single shot um that that's
[1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:45.880]  illegal and they've come out in the news cbs news has pointed out that is against new york law so
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:53.080]  is this not holding people hostage and i asked for police officers to call in 800 25 at 9 92 31
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:59.960]  we take one call and go to break and uh then we are going to continue with your calls uh laurence
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:05.400]  in new jersey a police officer uh what do you think of uh bloomberg saying police should go on
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:10.840]  strike nationwide until the people turn in their guns i think it's an absolute disgrace
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:18.840]  hello uh yes sorry i i have a plug that goes in here and it's too small and it keeps coming out
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:25.240]  so i couldn't hear you at first go ahead i apologize no that's my fault i think it's a
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.800]  testament to our poor leadership that we have running this country you know he's supposed to be
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:35.720]  a uh a senior leader of over i don't know how many millions of people in new york city
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:40.200]  and he comes out and he says something like this for his entire police force to say
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:45.880]  i honestly don't see how anybody under his chain of command could respect him after something like
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:51.400]  that i couldn't i mean i'm former military and i'm currently a police officer here in new jersey
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.760]  you know that to me is a disgrace you can't walk away from your responsibility like that
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:02.680]  you can't incite people to walk away from their responsibility like that i just don't see any excuse
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:08.280]  for it well it's illegal and and it is calling on basically terrorizing people in cities where
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:13.160]  they've been disarmed like new york can you imagine if the police even though they're
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:17.800]  famously corrupt they're in new york well a lot of them are good people still you imagine if the
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:22.120]  police disappeared i mean people are getting mugged left and right when the police are there
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:26.920]  can you imagine if the biggest police force in the country disappeared and the public can't
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:31.720]  protect themselves what the hoodlums would do as a police officer right across the water from them
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:37.000]  what do you think would happen i could tell you exactly what would happen you'd have martial law
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:41.720]  you would have to have martial law that'd be the only next best option is they would have to
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:47.480]  mobilize probably units in the national guard and get them out there on the street right away
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:52.200]  but he's saying nobody should be there he's saying nobody should be there so what would the criminals
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:56.760]  do they would start looting and somebody had the idea to set things on fire and i i would guarantee
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:50:03.400]  within six hours of police walking off in la or or new york or chicago the city would be on fire
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:09.240]  oh it'd be mayhem it would definitely be mayhem i don't work in a large department like that
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:13.960]  but i could tell you that especially on the weekends it gets kind of crazy and without us
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:20.440]  being around i mean there would be very few uh there would be no there would be no law and order
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:26.920]  it would be a free for all and you know we we have to we have to retain some semblance of order
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:32.520]  uh for something like this i mean it's just unbelievable that uh somebody at that high up
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:37.640]  in government would would actually say something like that out in public you know i thank you so
[1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:45.400]  much warrants any anything you'd like to add well you know i i'm watching your show and you

[1:54:52.200 --> 1:54:58.280]  all these criminals over run us i'm not going along with it okay they ship guns to mexico
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:05.480]  to create bedlam in a disarmed society now you in some small town in texas or somewhere
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:13.080]  that the police stood down nothing would really happen in most cases there would definitely be
[1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:18.360]  some problems but if you had them stand down in new york where you got 10 million people
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:22.840]  and they're disarmed and you got the biggest population of criminals are there to suck off
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:26.760]  welfare and everything they're going to start raping and robbing and pillaging in hours if the
[1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:32.440]  announcements made no cops banks would be robbed instantly instantly bank robberies would start
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:37.720]  robberies of everything looting of walmarts it would be and then people start torching stuff
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:42.680]  guaranteed the arsonist would go insane then they'd start shooting the fire department because
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:49.480]  they wouldn't stand down now i'm ranting and i apologize for that uh laurence you were going
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:55.320]  to finish your point about automation police officer in new jersey go ahead yes um you know
[1:55:55.320 --> 1:56:00.360]  you speak a lot about drones being used and these type of things and in my position i've never seen
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:07.560]  this although uh i'm really not for it especially being a former military officer um i'm also now
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:12.360]  seeing here in new jersey they're going with these red light cameras and they're you know they have
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:18.520]  an instituted photo radar but a lot of people feel that that's next you know i think these uh
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:22.840]  the automation that they're using is just one more way of them keeping tabs on things and it's
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:28.760]  becoming a uh a reach into people's pockets no it's all federally paid for it has a back door
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:34.280]  and they're going to phase out police are actually out there doing things and only use you to be
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:40.280]  political minders that's the official plan automated autonomous drones are already in the sky
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:45.720]  humans aren't going to be in combat within 10 years under DARPA public plans humans will work
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:51.480]  on robots and you might have some special forces for certain duties going up against other humans
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:58.680]  but it's going to be rain of the robots that is their public plan you know there's no honor in it
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:03.080]  and you know especially when it comes to you know police work you need to have discretion
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:08.440]  when you've got a camera that just snaps a picture of somebody who may have you know one guy brought
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:12.760]  up a legitimate point last night on a local radio station he says what happens if i have to move out
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:19.400]  of a you know i guess that you could say ambulance emergency vehicle an ambulance or something and
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:25.080]  i act i cross the line i get snapped you know now i got no no no that that's come out listen
[1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:30.360]  they're illegal you've got to have a sworn peace officer give the citation it doesn't stand up in
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:36.280]  court but they don't care they just it's been thrown out in a lot of areas but you can't have
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:41.400]  citations being sent that weren't signed but look we're allowing the globalists to cut humans out of
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:47.400]  the equation and and yes red light cameras are horrible these face scanning ones all of it is
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:51.720]  going to be the end of us the globalists admit it's about getting humans out of the equation
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:58.600]  so that we can't say no to them this is the plan this is the total takeover plan honestly i mean
[1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:04.600]  i'm very limited in what i can do i could speak my feelings about it you know and it's up to people
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:10.280]  like you to go out there and expose it and get enough people riled up to change the law you know
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:15.080]  it's really bad it's yeah they do they're a bunch of crooks well what happens is the local ones get
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:21.000]  promoted up if they sell people out and and again the buck stops with the people we've gotten lazy
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:25.720]  we've gotten stupid we've gotten drunk on entertainment we've gotten in a trance state
[1:58:25.720 --> 1:58:31.320]  we got to come out of it but soon the buck won't stop with us they're going to have an automated
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:38.120]  control grid in where the computers close the highways that's the plan derrick the speed police

[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:59.080]  two more here from derrick and then steve a bunch of others are ringing let's talk to steve who's a
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:06.680]  police officer in texas listening on 16 30 a.m. we've got so many affiliates is that is that what
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:13.320]  area is 16 30 i forget on my chat floor sir okay yeah great affiliate up there wonderful people
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:18.680]  that's who i thought what's the call letters again i'm not sure what the call is or i just
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:23.560]  know that it's uh 16 30 a.m. i know we need to plug all those folks anyways i apologize for
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:29.240]  bumbling around uh what is your take on being hearing bloomberg tell police nationwide to
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:35.320]  stand down and let old ladies get raped well i believe like you said in a in a large city that's
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:41.000]  something because i'm actually uh i work for the district attorney out here in taren county and uh
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:47.320]  pretty much i left a large department because it's very politicized at a at the large departments
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:51.720]  the smaller departments really don't believe in a lot of the things that the globalists are pretty
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:57.080]  much pushing but uh what i've learned is that the larger departments are mainly like the
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:02.840]  dallas and forward departments they pretty much um they they're more they're more politics than
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:07.400]  actual law enforcement but i believe it's a it'll be a a complete mess for the larger cities
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:13.880]  yeah i mean in la if the police stood down people would start robbing immediately
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:17.400]  can you imagine los angeles if the police walked off the job
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:24.440]  well i i remember there was a situation because i actually moved out here from uh arizona and um
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:29.640]  and i was a state trooper out there in arizona and i remember uh there were a lot of situations
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:35.080]  out there where they pretty much um were were kind of pushing the law enforcement officers
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:40.920]  to not really enforce certain things and uh basically leave it up to the uh to the citizens
[2:02:40.920 --> 2:02:45.720]  and uh the citizens believe in uh not being armed and things of that nature so we were getting a
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:50.920]  lot of situations where people were pretty much desperate and i believe that that'd be a situation
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:56.760]  in new york or any of the los angeles or even dallas of forward areas where there's a larger
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:03:01.240]  population that pretty much believes that there shouldn't be they shouldn't have the right exactly
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:05.400]  no i mean imagine in bloomberg had the police stand out in new york where the people are
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:09.880]  sitting ducks i mean where i live in out in the country outside austin cops want to stand down go
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:16.040]  ahead somebody comes up but rob me they're deader than a hammer but can you imagine in new york
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:22.440]  with all those domesticated people oh man i tell you that would be really bad but i guess he's kind
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:26.680]  of a criminal in heart so he'd like to see that hell on earth bloomberg is such a criminal you
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:29.960]  know they admit what he said is criminal but he won't get any trouble for it god bless you sir
[2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:34.920]  good to hear from you derrick is in california police officer in training uh what's your uh take
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:43.080]  on all this uh i think this is absolutely ridiculous and um i've been talking to a lot of people in
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:49.400]  the force and a lot officers that i've known for a while and they absolutely agree with me agree
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:54.200]  with everything you're saying and there's just two things that i don't know i think that people
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:59.400]  are missing especially in big cities like los angeles or los angeles or anything is that
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:04.520]  you know you get rid of everything and like you've already said it'd just be pandemonium
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:10.680]  like it already is insane but just stepping it up like that only criminals people that wouldn't
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:15.720]  give up their guns would have guns and then you know people innocent people can't do anything about
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:23.960]  it exactly within 24 hours la would be on fire guaranteed absolutely and uh one thing you see
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:29.320]  uh getting banning things all it does is create a black market and all we're gonna have to do
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:35.640]  is deal with just more criminal insanity and nothing good can come from it so there is a
[2:04:35.640 --> 2:04:40.520]  lot of people that are starting to understand that though but at the same time i'm the only thing
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:46.440]  that i'm scared of is you know there'll be good cops that won't um well i'll tell you this if they
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:52.120]  order you to go confiscate guns i mean that is a that you're asking to be killed if that happens
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:59.560]  i would not follow that order if i was you i'll be back stay with us

[2:08:33.800 --> 2:08:43.080]  tsa expands to california train stations and bus terminals incredible footage by a guy that's
[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:46.920]  reported for us before is youtube channels george for title i'm gonna get him on the nightly news
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:53.960]  tonight and it shows what looks like more than 10 of them with dogs sidearms you name it milling
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:57.800]  around and the video is up there at the site we're going to pull some more stills out of it
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:03.080]  but really really scary to see that and then i i said this earlier in the show and the crew
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:09.080]  went and looked it up bloombergs had to respond to cbs and he said it's illegal in new york uh to
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:13.720]  call for police to strike uh you know if you're in the police force or government and so i didn't
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:19.960]  mean that he called for police to stand down nationwide until we turn our guns in on the same
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:25.880]  show and he agreed it's on cnn's website it's 38 minutes long both of them you know commercial
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:31.640]  free there cnn's cut out the ads you can watch it we've played the clips in the first hour they
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:40.920]  said ban everything ban everything all guns except for black powder single shot and and they said
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:46.360]  that's their goal and the un treaty of course even forms is analyzed it allows registration
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:50.840]  and then confiscation of all semi-auto the atf last year wanted to ban all shot guns that are
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:54.520]  bottom loading saying they're not sporting well the second member's not for sporting
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:10:02.280]  very dangerous times and i couldn't think of a better time to get former congressman bob bar
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:07.480]  on the transmission because he's been suing tsa trying to find out from their leaks that
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:12.040]  drudge report and info wars dot com and alex jones have been listed i've talked to tsa people
[2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:16.920]  where they're told yes that we're basically extremists because we're showing the tsa is
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:21.560]  outside of jurisdiction they're not really police officers we had a congresswoman on
[2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:25.720]  who's introduced bills to try to have them stop calling themselves officers they're not just out
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:29.880]  of federal jurisdiction they're not even sworn officers the one thing of the fbi was running
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:33.400]  checkpoints that would be a fourth amendment violation this is a tenth amendment as well
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:39.320]  bob bar's a lawyer so he can also uh and and a known constitutional scholar he can break it down
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:46.200]  for us but uh we've just got all this craziness accelerating right now and an orgy of calls
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:55.080]  by rupert murdoch and bill crystal and pierce morgan and bloomberg and michael moore and all
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:59.240]  these hollywood stars are saying they're now being honest they're saying you know what we want to
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:07.400]  ban your guns period get them to us and it is so crazy we've done the math it's 0.3 percent to
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:12.440]  be in a mass shooting with five or more people killed out of the number of people that are shot
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:17.960]  at and you've got a very low chance of being shot period it's not a very common cause of death
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.560]  it's just wild to see this authoritarianism so i want to go over all that with bob bar who
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:27.960]  was joining us about tsa and some updates on that but first sir you've heard my little news
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:35.080]  brief here i know you follow the news what do you make uh of this uh authoritarian uh coming
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:40.280]  out of the closet we're seeing because it it quite frankly is shaking me that they're this brazen
[2:11:40.280 --> 2:11:46.920]  uh thank you alex always good to be with you and your many many listeners uh yeah it
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:55.800]  it it's disturbing but it's nothing new uh the forces that wish to silence individual liberty
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:02.200]  and the ability of people to both express themselves uh freely and to protect themselves
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:11.880]  uh are are always out there uh they were there uh before 1776 they were there after 1776 they've
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:18.680]  been with us uh throughout all of the ups and downs of uh of our country's greatness uh and
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:26.040]  even though from time to time we that is the proponents of of liberty yourself myself and
[2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.600]  your listeners and many other people across this land every every even though once in a while we
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:37.720]  do win a victory at the polls or legislatively or through the courts the forces against us never
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:43.240]  ever give up this is one thing that i've learned through the years serving on the board of the
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:50.520]  national rifle association for example and that is even though for example in today's political
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:58.760]  climate the current administration under president obama uh dare not overtly push their gun control
[2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:04.360]  agenda uh that doesn't mean that they have given up on it nor does it mean that there are not other
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:10.600]  groups out there and individuals like uh bloomberg and new york and hollywood elites uh that are
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:18.360]  constantly pushing uh the envelope of their anti freedom anti gun agenda well said i mean i forgot
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:24.120]  how how many hats you wear that you've been on the nra board and i just want to say something
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:30.200]  in the last five six years i've seen the nra go from really kind of a weak milk toast stance to
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:34.520]  really getting aggressive now and coming out and saying hey he does plan outside of the second
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:39.400]  amendment to try to restrict it hey this treaty is a threat and i've been very critical of the nra
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:45.560]  but thanks for your leadership and others i'm well we're starting to really see them uh get up on
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:50.920]  their hind legs can you give us some inside baseball on what's precipitated that because it's very good
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:59.400]  news uh probably more than any other one word uh it was uh the word heston charlton heston uh when
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:07.400]  he took over the reins of uh leadership of the nra back in the uh mid late 1990s and during which
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:15.720]  time he served for i think five years as president of the nra uh he gave it uh backbone and courage
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:26.200]  uh and enunciated a message that that really galvanized and organized uh both internally
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:33.160]  within the nra our true core mission to protect uh the freedom uh embodied in the second amendment
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:39.560]  and it gave a a real voice outside of the nra it gave people real courage to stand up and say yes
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:45.480]  we support the nra yes we understand what they're doing yes we're with you charlton heston
[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:51.480]  that i think was it was a real turning point uh i came on the board at the same time uh so i saw
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:56.840]  it really uh develop on and you're still on the board i just want to tell you yeah we like what
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:02.840]  you're doing thank god the nra is not selling us out we want to commend you congressman bar
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:08.440]  that's something else you work so hard former congressman bar so we just want to thank you
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:14.280]  on air for that because this is such a desperate fight as you know well it it is and uh the venue
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:20.520]  is not just here in communities in america it's not just uh in city halls like uh mayor bloombergs
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:26.440]  in new york it's not just at the capitals across the state it's not just in washington uh it's on
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:32.920]  the banks of east river in new york at the united nations and other international organizations uh
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:40.040]  as you've uh already talked about uh and we'll keep hammering away at i hope uh the united nations
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:46.600]  is over the course of the next week uh until the uh the very end of this month uh busy drafting up
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:55.720]  an arms trade treaty or ap and p uh that would definitely impact negatively our second amendment
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:16:00.120]  guaranteed rights uh to defend ourselves through the use of firearm in this country
[2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:08.040]  very exciting um that um people seem to be waking up to this but it's also frightening
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:14.360]  that the system doesn't care it's just rolling forward what is the sense of the nra uh in your
[2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:18.760]  you know study of this and also being an ngo so you can keep an eye on what's happening uh does it
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:24.920]  look like obama's going to sign it and that the senate might ratify it uh yes and no yes to the
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:32.200]  first question no to the second uh under the the leadership of uh john bolton both when he served
[2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:39.000]  as the uh the undersecretary of state uh during the uh early years of the bush administration uh at
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:47.080]  which time he uh had as a part of his portfolio the united nations uh and then later as our acting
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:53.080]  ambassador to the united nations toward the end of this the bush administration uh john bolton uh
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:59.960]  and his immediate successor in that job did a tremendous job of holding the line against these
[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:07.160]  un encroachments into uh second amendment uh rights and policy in this country that changed
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:15.640]  immediately when the obama administration came in took office in 2009 and with uh helary clinton
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:23.400]  taking the reins at uh the state department uh they announced publicly uh in 2009 that the united
[2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:31.000]  states had shifted its position and would now support uh the drafting of an arms trade treaty
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:38.120]  now uh even though the administration has said we have some objections uh to the language that
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:43.400]  they're crafting my view is that when push comes to show up when all the dust settles that they would
[2:17:44.040 --> 2:17:50.120]  support it but i do not believe that the senate as it's currently configured even though the
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:56.600]  republicans don't have a majority i don't think the senate would go along with that there have been
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:01.400]  i think more than sufficient u.s senators from both parties this is not just a republican
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:08.120]  position who has said they would not vote to uh to ratify an arms trade treaty
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:17.800]  certainly fortuitous timing the tragedy in colorado and they didn't waste any time seizing on it
[2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:22.040]  um you know as i mentioned earlier i want to get your take on that and then segue into the tsa and
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:27.240]  and what liberty guards doing and how folks can get involved with you on that you're standing up to
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:33.240]  the tsa and get your take on where you see that fight going right now you're where it currently is
[2:18:33.240 --> 2:18:39.560]  michael moore uh saying ban everything down to flintlocks because that's all the founders will
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:46.040]  want us to have he now speaks for them and uh again the atf is saying they want to ban shotguns
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:49.960]  that were saying last year that are bottom loading because it's only for sporting when we know it's
[2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:55.720]  not for sporting what is your argument back to him saying that oh that's an old document we
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:19:01.480]  need to update it what what is your response to michael moore now alex it's hard to know where to
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:09.240]  start with somebody who takes such an idiotic absolutely idiotic position uh is that the uh the
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:15.720]  whole notion of a militia uh which our founding fathers both from their experience and their
[2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:21.960]  study of history and their knowledge of the citizens being the last bulwark against the
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:28.200]  success of tyrannical government they understood that the militia was and is the people of this
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:35.400]  country the citizenry uh and anybody who says well the militia is simply the national guard or it's
[2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:40.760]  simply an organized group and if you don't belong to it you don't share in the second amendment
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:46.600]  rights guaranteed by the rights guaranteed by the second amendment has no concept whatsoever of
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:54.920]  either history or the real world out there uh and not only that but uh as the justices on the
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:20:02.520]  supreme court uh who voted in and and supported the majority opinions in the 2008 and 2010
[2:20:03.080 --> 2:20:09.160]  second amendment cases the heller case in washington dc and the mcdonnell case in uh chicago
[2:20:09.160 --> 2:20:17.880]  as those majority opinions uh understood and read uh the second amendment uh was not limited
[2:20:17.880 --> 2:20:22.280]  nor are the other amendments guaranteeing our freedom such as the first amendment
[2:20:22.840 --> 2:20:31.000]  limited simply to those physical things that existed at the time of the uh amendments drafting
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:36.680]  and incorporation i mean the you know this idiotic position by by michael more you know would he
[2:20:36.680 --> 2:20:42.200]  would he claim or would he take the position that the first amendment only guarantees the printed
[2:20:42.200 --> 2:20:48.040]  word not the movies that he makes simply because that was the only medium of expression back in
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:54.520]  the late 18th century exactly and he acts like the thought is old when really the constitution
[2:20:54.520 --> 2:21:00.520]  and bill of rights is new what they want to go back to is a thousand-year-old law that slaves
[2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:08.520]  can't have weapons well uh a very good point and and part of the reason uh why uh for example uh
[2:21:09.160 --> 2:21:16.280]  gun laws were passed many years ago here in in the south uh was to uh was to deny certain
[2:21:16.280 --> 2:21:23.160]  restrictions on gun laws were passed and into laws exactly were to deny freed slaves free black
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:28.840]  americans the right to possess firearms well just because the polls show america's becoming more
[2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:33.160]  pro gun i know you as an nr a board member know this for some of the new listeners just because
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:37.400]  we're winning the fight for the second amendment with the hearts and minds doesn't mean we're
[2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:42.360]  going to win legislatively doesn't matter obama care was unpopular they still got it and that
[2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:45.880]  that's what's really scary is the supreme court could have a good ruling on the second amendment
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:50.120]  i guess because you guys at the nr a and others argued it but then have a bad ruling on health
[2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:54.200]  care we don't have much time with you i know you've got to go in about five minutes one minute on
[2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:59.320]  the health care bill and then let's get into liberty guard and the tsa expanding out to our highways
[2:22:00.040 --> 2:22:06.760]  well liberty guard that i had uh and uh your listeners can go to it at www dot liberty guard
[2:22:06.760 --> 2:22:13.320]  dot org uh we're involved in in both of these issues uh we uh we drafted got signatures and
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:20.360]  presented to the supreme court petitions against obama care uh and we have been engaged in a long
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:27.080]  running uh series of skirmishes with tsa as a matter of fact uh we have a lawsuit pending against
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:35.240]  tsa simply to try and get them to comply with the law in this country uh that says the the
[2:22:35.240 --> 2:22:41.080]  citizens have a right to know what their government is doing uh tsa believes that it is above the law
[2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:45.480]  the same as the department of homeland security believes that it is above the law and doesn't
[2:22:45.480 --> 2:22:52.440]  have to disclose how many people are being spied on illegally or the process that the tsa goes
[2:22:52.440 --> 2:22:59.800]  through to develop and implement these naked x-ray uh scanners and and so forth so liberty guard
[2:23:00.680 --> 2:23:05.480]  is very proud uh through its supporters to be involved in in both of these battles
[2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:12.200]  again that was over a year ago that you tried to do a four request simply for documents that
[2:23:12.200 --> 2:23:18.120]  that should be public and they won't release it they get caught lying about their radiation studies
[2:23:18.120 --> 2:23:22.760]  they never did they get caught lying about strip searching now if you argue they try to take you
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:28.280]  to the back room as if that's an intimidation i mean how far is this going to go congressman
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:33.880]  it'll go as far as the citizens this country allow it to go i mean it's the same as another
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:39.640]  issue that liberty guard has recently become active in and that is uh the anti drone effort
[2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:45.560]  as a matter of fact we have at liberty guard a program a dump the drones uh and people can
[2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:51.320]  find out about a petition to the congress and get a get a free bumper sticker by making a
[2:23:51.320 --> 2:23:56.760]  contribution to help uh dump the drones uh they can go to liberty guard dot org and help us out
[2:23:56.760 --> 2:24:01.720]  with that also and what's great about liberty guard is you've got little cards there tell folks how
[2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:06.520]  they get those and it shows solidarity and i've talked to people who've been there and i've talked
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:11.320]  to some tsa folks on the inside are upset about what's happening obviously they say that it's
[2:24:11.320 --> 2:24:15.800]  that solidarity of that liberty guard guard that looks professional let's them know you're part
[2:24:15.800 --> 2:24:21.880]  of an organization we've got to basically you know unionize not like government does but just
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:26.520]  you know collectively by our free association and let them know we're getting organized tell
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:33.240]  people about that this was a part of our program when the tsa a couple of years ago started these
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:39.960]  uh these uh the naked body scanners and uh forcing people to go through them it's called the opt out
[2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:49.960]  alliance opt out alliance uh and uh supporters can go to liberty guard dot org uh and get a free
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:55.560]  card that that he that has printed on the back sort of like the maranda rights for uh criminal
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:25:01.960]  suspects it has printed on the back your rights as a as a citizen and as an air traveler in this
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:09.480]  country amazing uh continuing um here with congressman bob bar of liberty guard dot org
[2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:17.080]  congressman in closing here again obviously romney is pushes a lot of things we don't like
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:21.560]  and i never really believe in lesser of two evils even joe ferret didn't support mccain four years
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:27.080]  ago and wrote a books you know saying none of the above but with obama i mean really he's moving
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:33.800]  so quickly what do you expect him to do if he gets back into office just go hog wild uh that
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:39.560]  probably is uh a typical alex jones understatement uh that he'll go hog wild he's he certainly would
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:45.320]  because for example just take the the one issue that you let off with here alex and that is the
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:51.800]  the firearms issue uh this administration has not all of a sudden become a pro second amendment
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:57.560]  that's not the reason that they are not pushing an overt anti firearms agenda particularly in the
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:03.480]  wake of the horrific shooting in aurora colorado last weekend they're doing they are not pushing an
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:10.680]  anti gun agenda only because politically they can't afford to do it right now if they uh if this
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:16.520]  president is reelected uh there will be no such constraints and they will push forward not just
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:22.600]  nationally but through their local surrogates like uh like mike bloomberg in new york uh and
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:28.680]  some of the big city liberal mayors house where they will really push their anti firearms agenda
[2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:34.040]  well he is such an authoritarian and i think he's gotten in big trouble now calling for police to
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:40.440]  stand down nationwide that is a type of paramilitary siege to say well well you know we'll have this
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:45.240]  stand down until you do what we want uh former congressman bob bar thank you so much for spending
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:49.640]  time with us now it's always a pleasure and an honor to be with you thank you thank you

[2:35:56.200 --> 2:36:01.240]  that's his nickname erin dykes it's his girlfriend's nickname for him he lost uh 92 pounds you've seen
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:07.000]  the transformation but but that's not why what we're covering here today in just the last 25
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:13.640]  minutes of this hour i twisted some arms because he's a busy guy and got him on the show um ceo
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:18.520]  of young jevity now he started the company with these health cards and now he's become a ceo the
[2:36:18.520 --> 2:36:23.000]  last year of young jevity bill andrioli and let me tell you it's great to be able to call the
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.520]  ceo of the company why i need something you know done because you know i'm one of the biggest
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:33.320]  distributors now for young jevity through info wars team dot com and it's great people just get
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:38.280]  him on the phone and then he knows everything about the company he's so involved but this was a side
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:42.680]  issue nobody was pushing me to get into these these cards and then when i realized wait a minute
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:48.600]  big pharma is mandated by congress to give people these discounts it's just like when we have doctors
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:53.160]  on who explain they're supposed to give 30 of their care as charity care most these are charity
[2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:57.400]  hospitals but they don't tell you when you don't have insurance why the illegal aliens get coverage
[2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:01.880]  but you don't they're supposed to give you the free care not just the emergency room you know my
[2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:07.480]  dad in medical school he's a dentist was taught that the point is though with this this access is
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:14.280]  those promos that that they try to comply with congress and say okay we'll have discount on
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:20.040]  basically everything we'll have discount programs but they don't tell you about them it's like these
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:23.720]  grants where you know they don't tell you about the grants but there's books that explain it well
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:27.480]  this didn't get in government money that's why i've never promoted folks that have those things you
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:32.040]  know get grants do this and that because it just adds to the dependency take from one person give
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:38.040]  to another this is you get this free pharmacy card you go to info wars team dot com or info wars rx
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:42.920]  dot com and again we fight big pharma the whole nine yards there's a lot of that stuff you need
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:46.680]  there's a lot of it that does work we're always exposing the big corrupt drugs they overcharge
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:51.560]  for that don't work the point is this is something real world that's absolutely free
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:58.120]  and then you know you ask how longevity makes money off of this well it's a tiny amount then
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:03.560]  that goes into the kitty for the promotion of the fact that you get the cards out to people
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:07.320]  and here's the best part you don't just go to info wars team dot com big banner at the top

[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:25.720]  it's i'm telling you there are so many incredible deals out there like this
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:30.120]  in other industries and things but this is the only one like this when it comes to prescription
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:37.320]  stuff period period whether it's your prescription eye medicine or whether you know it's uh birth
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:42.520]  control whatever it is and this is at hundreds of stores that there's a big banner at the top
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:48.280]  and and and then you click on that and info wars team dot com on the big blue banner right there
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:55.640]  and it takes you to info wars rx dot com and again i was going to go record my dad who's always been
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:39:00.280]  real private endorsing this and i never got around to it i'm going to have that next week so you can
[2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:04.120]  hear him like a three or four minute you know he wants to radio not tv didn't want to go on air
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:09.960]  you know talking about his experiences in the last three or four or five months i don't know six
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:16.680]  months handing these out and how wild people have gone with them because it's like immediate hey
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:22.040]  you're going to get a prescription for antibiotics as we just did a root canal here's one of these cards
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:27.320]  and he makes a little bit of money off the discount they get because it's a promotion
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:31.480]  a promotion built in they don't want anybody to know about because they're mandated to do it now
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:37.480]  i'm going to shut up i've talked for six minutes while he's holding bill andrioli of the genius
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:42.360]  that came up with this i mean he really is a genius 65 million americans uh don't have health
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:46.840]  benefits at all according to fda statistics just under 50 of the u.s population uses prescription
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:54.920]  drugs just over 80 of the age 60 uh and uh over uh used prescription drugs it just goes on and on
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:40:01.400]  with all the numbers just over 80 of the age 60 and over use prescription drugs the average
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:06.760]  use is two and a half prescriptions per month on average 370 million prescriptions are dispensed
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:12.360]  every month over 300 billion was spent on prescription drugs last year alone according to the us bureau
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:17.400]  labor statistics and it goes on the pharmacological industry is expected to continue to grow at a rate
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:23.240]  of 70 percent over the next 18 years and it just goes on to say that means prescription drug costs
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:28.440]  could exceed one trillion annually and within just five six years from now by 2020 the cost of
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:33.160]  prescription drugs could exceed the entire amount of social security benefits paid to our elderly
[2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:38.760]  population you wonder why mexico has the exact same drugs 10 times cheaper or more or canada five
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:44.600]  times cheaper it's because the government has allowed them to create monopolies and rip people
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:49.880]  off in america and so programs were created well i'm going to shut up you're the expert bill you
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:55.560]  you discovered this found out about it launched it it's giant now people can find out at info wars
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:01.160]  rx.com how to get the card for themselves it you just fill it out and it gets emailed to you it takes
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:07.240]  about a minute or to order them in bulk and sign up to be a distributor who hands them out for free
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:12.440]  and then you make money saving people money all because the people perish for lack of knowledge
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:18.120]  we have the knowledge we are accessing the pool of money they're waiting and big pharma again
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:24.680]  does not want you to know about this the retailers if you know okay they'll take it and believe me
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:30.360]  it works bill andrioli i'm ranting explain it to people well you've done a great job explaining it
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:35.560]  so far and alex you do look fantastic with that weight loss and hearing your father's testimonials
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:41.720]  and so many testimonials but like you said this is big big big business in just over the last year
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:47.560]  we've saved the american consumers over 20 million dollars and why i get excited about that is that's
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:52.920]  20 million dollars of money that people were going to spend anyway on their prescriptions and we
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:57.800]  can't help it alex if people are on prescriptions okay but if they're spending 20 million dollars we
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:02.440]  can save them that 20 million dollars of the money they were going to spend anyway that's 20 million
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:08.360]  dollars we can put back in the american consumers pocket back in the american economy and it's as
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:14.520]  simple as what you just said all they have to do is go to info wars rx.com go to info wars team.com
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:19.720]  either site click on it put in their their name and they can print the card right there they can
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:24.600]  print the card right there bring it to their local pharmacy of choice hand it off to the pharmacist
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:28.840]  the pharmacist is going to punch in the information just like they would as an insurance card and
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:34.680]  you're going to be able to save up to 10 to 85 percent off your prescriptions yeah i've saved
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:40.040]  20 something but some some people alex they'll save 10 but we've had people that have saved
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:44.920]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars we've had people come up to us crying because for
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:50.040]  years they've been paying an extra two three four five hundred dollars on their prescription costs
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:53.640]  it's getting to the point out there in this economy it's getting to the point where some people are
[2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:57.480]  trying to make a decision whether they're going to put their money towards their prescriptions
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:01.800]  or whether they're going to put food on the table and with this free that's what i love about this
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:06.120]  you're not asking any of your listeners for any money here this is a free gift for everyone who
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:12.760]  is listening they can go to info wars rx.com info wars team.com download that card for free
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:16.520]  so you're able to give these american consumers something for free that they were going to spend
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:22.760]  money on anyway and save them that 10 to 85 percent to me it's a no-brainer it's a win-win for everyone
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:27.720]  involved and again if we've been able to save 20 million dollars of the last year over 20 million
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:32.760]  dollars of the last year with the listeners here at alex jones i believe because your listeners
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:37.960]  is so vast i believe that what we've saved in this short amount of time you'll be able to save
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:45.960]  that kind of money within a couple months here on the alex jones show well bill again i heard
[2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:52.920]  about this six seven eight months ago i don't remember and i'm like really they young jevity uh
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:57.000]  you know merging with uh bill andrioli over a year ago i went and watched some of the speeches
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:02.760]  and i'm like yeah i get it but you can save 10 to 80 percent or whatever i mean this is insane
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:07.320]  how does this work and then i finally researched it finally got some cards finally waited till we
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:14.280]  had to go get a prescription and i went in the cvs down the street gave it to them they typed it in
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:19.480]  it was like 20 something percent off and then my dad that's what he's saying he usually tells people
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:24.840]  about the uh generic or whatever so they save money well they're even saving on that and he was
[2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:28.280]  talking about on average i'm going to go interview him in the next few days if i get time he was
[2:44:28.280 --> 2:44:34.360]  talking on average about 30 plus percent savings people are seeing and again this is hitting big
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:40.120]  pharma this is hitting them and was i correct because i did some more research and and i mean
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:45.080]  how did you discover this how did you come up with this idea well the the way it was discovered
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:49.320]  we've always been into the benefits okay fdi was the company that merged with the young jevity and
[2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:54.520]  we were a benefits company and we were already saving people money just by having that information
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:45:00.200]  on the back of their benefits card and what we came up with was an idea where what if we also
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:05.000]  was you already made mention of what if we also made it an opportunity where people pass out these
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:10.120]  free discount pharmacy cards you know would there be a marketing potential there for people to get a
[2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:15.480]  little bit of a of a commission back a utilization bonus back and we were able to strike that deal
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:20.200]  and once we did that it really took off because people hand this off to their friends and family
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:24.360]  but now because of this utilization bonus that they're able to make they're handing it off to
[2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:29.080]  people that they do and don't know people are just on the streets handing this off to people and
[2:45:29.080 --> 2:45:34.280]  they're sharing a gift with people which is absolutely fantastic and the average the overall
[2:45:34.280 --> 2:45:39.320]  average you were saying 30 something percent but the overall average is of average of 41 percent
[2:45:39.320 --> 2:45:45.400]  savings and alex you know as well as i do but between you know uh people that are doing uh all
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:49.160]  the you know the all the different prescriptions that are out there that cost from you know ten
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:54.920]  dollars to thousands of dollars the amount of money that we're saving people uh is is enormous
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:46:00.200]  like i said everywhere we go we have people come up to us and and thank us uh for what we've done
[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:04.200]  because they've been able to take this money and you know i heard you talking about your weight loss
[2:46:04.200 --> 2:46:08.360]  and how healthy you and your family and some of the people that work for you and how how great
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:13.000]  everyone is doing and that's what we want to make sure people understand too we're not promoters of
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:17.480]  drugs and and i know you understand that but we can't help it that some people are already on
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:23.160]  these prescriptions so if we can save them 10 to 85 percent on the prescriptions that they're taking
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:27.560]  right now and then they can take that money that they're saving on the prescriptions and put it
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:32.280]  towards nutrition like young jevities nutrition young jevities 90 for life the healthy stop packs
[2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:36.920]  the beyond tangy changereen the palm burst you know all the different product lines that we have
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:40.760]  that they can take the money they're saving and they're putting that money towards nutrition the
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:44.840]  ultimate goal is to get them off of them oh yeah i forgot that that's what you guys are saying as
[2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:51.000]  well perfect i mean go save the money with the prescriptions and then start trying real minerals
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:56.520]  real vitamins trace elements and then see the real effect that is man i tell you it's amazing but
[2:46:56.520 --> 2:47:01.160]  listen i've seen discount cards i've seen you know coupon stuff and if i'm you know see the
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:05.400]  newspaper and see some coupons and we're going to the store we use them why not but i mean the
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:11.320]  point is that this is how does this work though because i guess i mean explain it to me because
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:16.360]  i've gone and done the research but you can probably put it better than i do they've set aside
[2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:21.400]  money that they claim is their their discount program that's across the board that's how they
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:25.000]  go and explain to congress though we're going to make it better for people but then they don't
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:31.560]  advertise it but then this card you've set up with over 60 000 locations i know hundreds of
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:35.720]  you know retailers including all the biggest and then this goes and this just simply
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:40.440]  activates that and it's across the board all of the products basically is that how that works
[2:47:41.080 --> 2:47:44.840]  it's not it's not all the products there are differences matting on the different prescription
[2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:50.680]  drugs that people are looking at but this is a 300 billion you know more than a 300 billion dollar
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:55.640]  industry and i say all the products we haven't personally ourselves seen anything where it
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:47:59.720]  didn't have a discount what what does it not cover some of you know if you go to walmart and
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:03.560]  they have some of those drugs you can get for five dollars whether we can save you money or not
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:07.320]  you know would be it would be a question mark there if someone has already got insurance
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:12.120]  and uh around 50 percent of the time we're going to save them more than they would receive
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:16.200]  off of their prescription benefits off their insurance so we're able to save all kinds of
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:22.360]  people money uh whether or not they have whether they have insurance or not but again it's a 300
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:28.360]  billion dollar industry and when we first started you know there wasn't 60 000 pharmacies but think
[2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:32.840]  about it you know you go to every corner right now every you know every corner all across this
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:38.120]  nation there's this four different you know in all four corners there's a different company whether
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:44.280]  cvs walgreens right a whatever it might be and if cvs across the street is offering this discount
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:48.600]  and walgreens isn't where people are going to go they're going to go to cvs well i'm here to tell
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:53.240]  people continue i'm here to tell people i did not even i knew about this i kept meaning to
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:58.680]  investigate it i went and tried it it worked i meant to call and you know learn more but i
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:02.840]  never got around to it i'm so busy and then all of a sudden i had dinner last week well i called
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:06.440]  you right after and i got because i know you're the guy that came up with this and my dad's like
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:10.440]  this is incredible and again i'm going to get him to you know do an interview and explain it all
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:16.520]  to people but he's been giving it to thousands of people and uh they're now ordering the cards in bulk
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:21.160]  and they're giving them out briefly but we're going to come back but start explaining the business
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:26.360]  opportunity i after all we're free market libertarian types it's not just that you get discounts
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:32.120]  explain how when you hand them out then you get part of the promotion money for handing them out
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:37.800]  explain how that works okay well we have thousands of independent marketing directors all across the
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:42.440]  nation that also when they're when they're introducing people to the whole 90 for life
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:46.920]  opportunity the whole young jeffy opportunity they're able to walk up to people and for a lot
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:51.880]  of people the most difficult part of this business for them is maybe styling that conversation but

[2:49:55.640 --> 2:50:00.760]  free give them a free gift and the end consumer can go into that pharmacy without taking any
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.600]  additional money they are already going to spend the money on the prescription anyway
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:10.440]  and now they can save that 10 to 85 percent they're excited they say thank you what a fantastic
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:15.080]  introduction and again now they save that 10 to 85 percent we can tell them how they can take that
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:20.680]  savings and put it towards you know the 90 for life product line the young jeffy product line so
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:27.000]  the opportunity is that there is a there is a utilization bonus that comes back off of every
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:31.320]  single utilization from the prescription so as people go in and they only have to show that card
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:35.880]  once alex they show that car once the pharmacist is going to put all the information just like it's
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:40.360]  an insurance copy and put all in their computer system and every time that person goes back to
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:45.560]  pick up a prescription without them showing the car without them saying anything boom that commission
[2:50:45.560 --> 2:50:51.560]  is going to get paid out back to that person who shared that gift it's unbelievable it is so good

[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:51.160]  they also at the same time if they'd like to there's an opportunity obviously when they're
[2:55:51.160 --> 2:55:55.480]  referring other people to our products and there's also an opportunity for them to get this these
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:56:00.760]  discounted cards not only for themselves and their family but also these cards that just like you
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:05.160]  they can pass out these cards and they can receive those commissions and again to be able to give
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:10.040]  someone a gift you're giving them a gift you're making a commission and that person didn't have
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:15.160]  to spend any extra money for you to receive that commission like you said alex that's a win-win when
[2:56:15.160 --> 2:56:19.800]  you don't have to ask someone for money and you can make a commission that's pretty good and think
[2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:24.280]  about the churches and all the large organizations that are out there i mean how much better is this
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:29.080]  than a bake sale or whatever they're doing why does anybody else know about this because i did
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:33.880]  research you know a lot on this nobody else is doing anything like you're doing here i mean
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:39.240]  there's some other things but they're not as good how did you do how did you do this again we had
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:44.120]  already had on the benefits card when we saw how many people we were saving money with just because
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:49.160]  they were using our benefits card you know we viewed that and said there must be an opportunity here
[2:56:49.160 --> 2:56:55.000]  there must be something here that can really really take this to a whole other level and again by
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:00.680]  paying those commissions or utilization bonuses out it gave people a whole other reason to go spread
[2:57:00.680 --> 2:57:05.640]  the word on this and get the word out and now we have tens of thousands of people hundreds and
[2:57:05.640 --> 2:57:10.600]  hundreds of thousands of utilization that are happening every single month and why i'm excited
[2:57:10.600 --> 2:57:14.520]  to be on this call with you as i know those numbers i just gonna skyrocket because of your
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:21.320]  viewership here i don't know this is something that again i've seen at work folks uh go to
