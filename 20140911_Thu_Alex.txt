[00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:06.294]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:08.056]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:09.817]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:11.419]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.960]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.163]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:21.267]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:47.379]  13 years after the tragic attacks that were used to literally wage war against the Bill of Rights and Constitution and launch a raft of fraudulent black hole wars that have destroyed America's faith and credit around the world.
[00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.431]  And as a collective scar on our conscience.
[00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:57.772]  Thank you for joining us on this September 11th, 2014.
[00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:04.533]  9, 11, 13 years later.
[00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:09.914]  We are going to have our reporters live from New York City coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.335]  We'll get reports from them.
[00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:13.655]  We'll air other reports they shot last night and this morning.
[00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.656]  They're getting a lot done, follow a lot of really important information.
[00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:26.548]  We are obviously going to be breaking down President Obama's war speech, which I'm sure he'll be given another peace prize, because why not?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.901]  It's all about being ironic.
[00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.002]  It's all about being absurdist.
[00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:36.364]  It's all about being total oxymoron hypocrisy.
[00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:39.786]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:41.906]  The latest on Ebola.
[00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:44.248]  The latest on Obamacare.
[00:01:44.248 --> 00:01:47.689]  Every week I've seen headlines where a million people kicked off here.
[00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.089]  300,000 there.
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.289]  500,000 here.
[00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.489]  100,000 there.
[00:01:52.651 --> 00:02:01.260]  As new phases of it kick in, 250,000 Virginians will lose health care due to Obamacare, it's now been announced.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.682]  It just goes on and on.
[00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:06.406]  Big solar flare set to hit the Earth the next day, gonna break that down.
[00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:07.727]  More on Scottish independence.
[00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:12.974]  Now that's spurring independence talk from Texas to Kurdistan.
[00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:14.575]  That's in the New York Times.
[00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:17.216]  And it is spurring it.
[00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:21.118]  Reuters says that Russia has successfully tested a nuclear missile.
[00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:22.839]  More plans, says their Navy.
[00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:30.603]  Russia's now turned off 45% of the gas to Poland as the colder weather begins to set in.
[00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:33.404]  And it's setting in all over the world a little early this year.
[00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:36.446]  Earliest snowfall on record in South Dakota.
[00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.272]  That story is out of the Argus Leader.
[00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:42.994]  That's a cool name, Argus.
[00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:48.717]  Out of the Argus Leader, and it's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:51.800]  It's all part of the Earth cooling now.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.764]  Well, it stopped heating 19 years ago, and then it's been cooling for about five to six, depending on what numbers you look at.
[00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:01.366]  And it has nothing to do with humans, it's that ball of gas up there in the sky.
[00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:05.389]  A couple years ago, it started cooling down and not being as active.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.443]  In overall heat it's putting off, generally.
[00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:13.445]  And so the Earth cooled.
[00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:26.956]  I'm not a physicist, an astrophysicist, though I do interview them here and I do read the publications, but I don't need to be an astrophysicist to know that when you live closer to the equator, it's hotter because the sun hits you more.
[00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:33.562]  And the sun hits the Arctic and Antarctic obliquely, sometimes not for months, so it's 50, 60, 70 below!
[00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:41.376]  I mean, if I stuck my head in an oven that was on, it would burn me!
[00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:44.978]  If I turned it off, it won't be hot!
[00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:50.800]  But the UN, five years ago, when everybody was pointing out it was the sun, they said no, and they had a vote.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.942]  And they voted and said the sun does, quote, does not affect climate.
[00:03:54.942 --> 00:03:57.983]  Which is another statement like two plus two equals whatever the government says.
[00:03:57.983 --> 00:04:00.384]  No, it equals four.
[00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:01.585]  And that's what we've reached here.
[00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.926]  This is all on purpose, and I now am sure of that.
[00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:06.607]  And I've read publications where they admit that they're throwing it in our face.
[00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:12.407]  You guys get me the Karl Rove, we're history's actors now, full quote.
[00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:15.928]  Just type in Karl Rove, we're history's actors, quote, and it's all over the place.
[00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:22.270]  Where he told the New York Times and Washington Post, we can tell you that the moon is made of cheese, you will buy it.
[00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.872]  It's just like when O'Brien is torturing Winston, and O'Brien says, I'm going to keep torturing you until you say what I want.
[00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:32.254]  He goes, I've already said that 4 plus 4 equals a million, and 2 plus 2 equals 10.
[00:04:32.254 --> 00:04:35.375]  And he goes, I want you to see every number.
[00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.689]  And not be able to make a decision and believe whatever I say.
[00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.172]  I'll say it's 4, I'll say it's 10, I'll say it's 20.
[00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:45.515]  And finally, Winston gets it and is mentally broken.
[00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:47.817]  That's what's happening here.
[00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:54.604]  With the open arming of Al-Qaeda, I mean, that will teach ISIS and Al-Qaeda to give them unlimited funds.
[00:04:54.604 --> 00:04:56.986]  And boy, he's a war president, he's gonna get tough on them.
[00:04:56.986 --> 00:04:58.408]  They're gonna overthrow Assad, folks.
[00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:09.557]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:05:09.557 --> 00:05:16.019]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:18.360]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.441]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[00:05:21.441 --> 00:05:28.324]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:28.877 --> 00:05:32.540]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.803]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.604]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:46.450]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.591]  But for how long?
[00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:49.812]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:54.236]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:57.058]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:05.084]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:08.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:10.168]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant.
[00:06:10.168 --> 00:06:16.532]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:16.532 --> 00:06:22.437]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:06:22.557 --> 00:06:26.539]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.461]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:37.886]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:39.987]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:41.028]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:50.336]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:05.795]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:08.135]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:13.417]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:18.359]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:21.901]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:25.983]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:30.305]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:30.305 --> 00:07:40.530]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.732]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:51.464]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:55.431]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:13.603]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:13.603 --> 00:08:18.486]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.486 --> 00:08:20.947]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:20.947 --> 00:08:23.489]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:24.169]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.371]  We return Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.112]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:29.372]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:33.154]  Here we are 13 years later.
[00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:38.698]  After the tragic attacks that killed 3,000 plus people in New York and Washington D.C.
[00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:48.996]  The wars that were then triggered in Afghanistan and Iraq have killed over a million and a half people, almost all of them civilians.
[00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:51.258]  And how many thousands of U.S.
[00:08:51.258 --> 00:08:52.299]  troops?
[00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.522]  Five plus thousand dead in Iraq.
[00:08:55.522 --> 00:08:57.784]  That many dead in Afghanistan.
[00:08:57.784 --> 00:09:00.746]  Tens of thousands of wounded.
[00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:01.967]  I know so many veterans.
[00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:02.928]  I mean, a lot of them.
[00:09:04.363 --> 00:09:12.667]  And they've almost all got brain injuries or their organs are messed up because the armor is really good.
[00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:20.090]  And so they'll survive getting blown up in a tank or an armored vehicle or in a Humvee, but the shockwave still just goes right through them.
[00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.192]  Screws up their eyes, screws up their liver, their heart, their brain.
[00:09:24.192 --> 00:09:27.954]  So let's be clear, nobody got out of this cheap.
[00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:43.519]  I don't think 10,000-plus dead troops is cheap, but compared to some wars where you have 20 million Russians dying in World War II, 20-plus million Germans, what, 300-something thousand Americans, hundreds of thousands of Brits.
[00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.739]  I'm going off memory.
[00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:48.041]  Guys, I know it's 22 million Germany, 21 million Russia.
[00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:48.941]  Look up number of U.S.
[00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:50.842]  casualties in World War II, please.
[00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:53.784]  Of course, that didn't... I'm just fact-checking myself here.
[00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.062]  So my memory's almost always right on, but sometimes it gets off.
[00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:01.863]  We check that, and I want to challenge everybody here to check me as well.
[00:10:01.863 --> 00:10:03.324]  Okay, where do we start?
[00:10:03.324 --> 00:10:05.104]  Whoa, it's crazy.
[00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.725]  Okay, so I was wrong.
[00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:07.265]  It's 405,000 U.S.
[00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:07.505]  military.
[00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:14.825]  Civil War, 625,000.
[00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:15.365]  World War II, 405,000.
[00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:15.886]  World War I, 116,000.
[00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:16.566]  Vietnam War, 58,000.
[00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:19.548]  Does anybody believe that's a lot more than that?
[00:10:19.548 --> 00:10:19.948]  Korea War, 36,000.
[00:10:19.948 --> 00:10:20.488]  War on Terror, 6,717.
[00:10:20.488 --> 00:10:21.829]  I think that's an old number.
[00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:22.169]  It's over 10,000 now.
[00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:24.130]  It's kind of like the number I've seen of 340,000, 350,000.
[00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.171]  I guess they updated it.
[00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:42.379]  They changed the actuaries.
[00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:44.221]  The numbers are between 350,000 and 400,000.
[00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:47.303]  See, I was being conservative.
[00:10:47.303 --> 00:10:48.364]  My brain also does that.
[00:10:48.364 --> 00:10:50.406]  It always kind of downgrades things.
[00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:52.608]  I'm always getting accused of exaggerating.
[00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:57.492]  Nine times out of ten, literally, it's worse than I'm saying.
[00:10:57.492 --> 00:11:04.298]  In fact, the only disinformation on this show, if somebody wants to accuse me of something, is I don't try to lie on purpose.
[00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:06.620]  My brain, though, tends to dial stuff back.
[00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:14.321]  But for people that aren't aware of what's going on, it just sounds completely crazy, what's happening.
[00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:16.842]  And I don't blame people.
[00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:20.703]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:11:20.703 --> 00:11:28.706]  The reality of what's happening in our world is so much over the top than what anybody could come up with in fiction.
[00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:29.466]  Now that said,
[00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:35.269]  Obviously the big news is 9-11 and President Obama's speech last night.
[00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:44.712]  It's over-the-top brainwashing, over-the-top arrogance, over-the-top confusing the public, and I don't know how they can get away with this.
[00:11:44.712 --> 00:11:48.473]  It's just so transparent, and I guess they just don't care.
[00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:53.475]  It's like Congress has a 6 or 7 percent approval rating, depending on what poll.
[00:11:53.475 --> 00:11:55.516]  The highest is 10, but whether it's
[00:11:58.812 --> 00:12:04.237]  A Zogby poll, or a Gallup poll, or a... They've got a whole bunch of them.
[00:12:04.237 --> 00:12:06.359]  They're between 6 and 10 percent.
[00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:11.223]  So let's just say Congress, to err on the side of conservatism, has a 10 percent approval rating.
[00:12:11.223 --> 00:12:14.666]  That's a pretty illegitimate government.
[00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:20.031]  That's about as popular as Kim Jong-un in South Korea.
[00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:23.854]  In fact, I saw a poll, he's more popular than that, 20-something percent.
[00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:31.295]  of the South Koreans are crazy enough to want to be merged with the North and like the Communist policy.
[00:12:31.295 --> 00:12:32.976]  So I just answered my question.
[00:12:32.976 --> 00:12:40.481]  I was saying I think our government is more unpopular with the American people than North Korea is in South Korea.
[00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:50.867]  Even though North Korea is constantly promising to blow up and kill everyone and shell Seoul and attack South Korea, they have 20-something percent of people that support it.
[00:12:53.342 --> 00:12:57.065]  That's pretty amazing when you think about it.
[00:12:57.065 --> 00:13:03.411]  So when I say the public's gullible, the public's dumb, the public, you know, why are they going along with this?
[00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:04.812]  I think I've answered my question.
[00:13:04.812 --> 00:13:17.163]  We're being drugged by our hair by the crazy special interest in the establishment into crazy town.
[00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:24.460]  And it's like any unstable crazy person you've ever run into or worked around or known.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:33.482]  It just doesn't make sense what they're doing, short-term or long-term, and you see them digging their own hole in front of you and you can't stop them.
[00:13:33.482 --> 00:13:35.943]  It's a very powerless feeling.
[00:13:35.943 --> 00:13:47.006]  Well, I want to empower people because if we've got 90% or more knowing the government's totally illegitimate at the federal level, there's got to be a way we can work together
[00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:51.664]  To not go along with it and say no to it.
[00:13:51.664 --> 00:14:04.162]  And the first thing we can do is laugh at the system and really let them know that we're laughing at them and stop complying and get our state governments that are much more popular in the polls because they are on average much better.
[00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:08.016]  And that's the check and balance we have.
[00:14:08.016 --> 00:14:17.719]  We need to move forward with not what I'd call secession, but the right to reform the government under the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:19.039]  Okay, we reform it.
[00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:19.899]  We've been hijacked.
[00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:20.919]  We've been taken over.
[00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:23.160]  We want the Republic back.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:32.982]  And then under the Republican form of government, small R, we could then set about to completely dismantle government if we think that'll actually work.
[00:14:34.127 --> 00:14:38.589]  But can we just at least go back to limited government first?
[00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:45.492]  I mean, there are the solutions.
[00:14:45.492 --> 00:14:50.354]  Instead, things are going to get so bad historically that you're going to see Texas break away.
[00:14:50.354 --> 00:14:52.936]  The Pentagon's already predicted that 20 years ago.
[00:14:52.936 --> 00:14:54.996]  The Russians are predicting that a decade ago.
[00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:56.057]  They're top academy.
[00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:04.562]  Russia has said they either deliver to all their satellites that are part of Russia still, or they will lose them.
[00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:05.643]  I mean, Russia understands that.
[00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:07.806]  I'm not, again, saying Russia's wonderful.
[00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:15.815]  Russia has a policy to try to enrich their population because they realize that's good policy for everybody to build a better civilization.
[00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:17.397]  Doesn't mean they're not corrupt and have problems.
[00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:35.919]  Russia's more like a boss hog corruption like we used to be, which is terrible but wonderful compared to eugenics, scientifically applied, anti-human, exterminist, UN, world government, technocracy garbage.
[00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:47.823]  And the big tool of the technocracy is to get reality in such shambles that people just turn away and say, I give up.
[00:15:49.423 --> 00:15:52.664]  That's why Obama comes out and says, I never said you could keep your doctor.
[00:15:52.664 --> 00:15:55.306]  I never said it would cut your medical bill.
[00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:57.387]  I never said I wouldn't come after your guns.
[00:15:57.387 --> 00:15:58.887]  You have a business, you didn't build that.
[00:15:58.887 --> 00:16:00.988]  If you raise the debt, it doesn't raise the debt.
[00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:10.853]  It's meant to condition you to accept any level of lying, because in the information age, they can't hide stuff anymore, even short term.
[00:16:10.853 --> 00:16:17.876]  So instead, they just wanna overwhelm everybody, where we just short circuit, like Robbie the Robot, with too much information,
[00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:21.897]  Cannot compute, cannot compute, and smoke comes out our ears.
[00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:25.178]  That's what's going on here.
[00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:27.678]  And I have some clips here that illustrate this.
[00:16:27.678 --> 00:16:35.540]  Obama came out and said, ISIS, but to confuse people it's been ISIS, IS, ISIL.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.880]  It's really Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.241]  It's been Al-Qaeda the whole time.
[00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:44.102]  But to confuse it because it's so embarrassing that our government got caught by the military and everybody, it was the military mainly, last year.
[00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.705]  Openly running Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:47.865]  The military freaked out.
[00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:49.086]  Decompartmentalized.
[00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:51.067]  There was almost a total mutiny.
[00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:58.892]  The Secretary of Defense got all freaked out when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs went to him and said this is not going to fly.
[00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:00.553]  And so they figured out a new strategy.
[00:17:00.553 --> 00:17:01.814]  Change the name.
[00:17:01.814 --> 00:17:03.815]  Have them invade Iraq.
[00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.537]  And then say we've got to fund the main Syrian rebels
[00:17:07.847 --> 00:17:09.268]  That are Al-Qaeda by the way.
[00:17:09.268 --> 00:17:20.858]  They just keep calling the moderate group the main group, who admits all over the news they work with IS, Al-Qaeda, whatever you want to call it, to then attack Syria.
[00:17:20.858 --> 00:17:24.001]  Understand, the rebels aren't turning to beat Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:29.506]  They're going to be armed and given air support to go and overthrow Assad.
[00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:31.228]  Watch!
[00:17:31.228 --> 00:17:34.771]  Within a month to two months, they'll be bombing in Damascus
[00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:43.317]  And saying, well, to be able to take out Al-Qaeda, we've got to take control of the whole government to clean the country up.
[00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:47.803]  And then they're going to kill every Christian in the country, just like Libya, just like I told you they'd do three years ago.
[00:17:47.803 --> 00:17:51.407]  It's now a failed state with over 50,000 people confirmed dead.
[00:17:52.481 --> 00:17:53.622]  And if you're black, you're dead.
[00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:55.002]  If you're Christian, you're dead.
[00:17:55.002 --> 00:17:56.683]  They were all living there freely.
[00:17:56.683 --> 00:18:03.446]  The super racist Wahhabist Arabs are basically like hillbilly brown clan people or something.
[00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:05.427]  I'm telling you folks, they act just the same.
[00:18:05.427 --> 00:18:06.768]  They find black people?
[00:18:06.768 --> 00:18:07.448]  Dead.
[00:18:07.448 --> 00:18:08.529]  They find Christians?
[00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:09.169]  Dead.
[00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:10.270]  They find Jews?
[00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.590]  Dead.
[00:18:11.564 --> 00:18:15.687]  You can pull up the New York Times admitting jihadis war on black Libyans.
[00:18:15.687 --> 00:18:24.892]  I mean, they just find whole warehouses full of them dead and burned or dead out in the desert where they just take men, women, and shows videos of them.
[00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:26.553]  Bullets are too expensive to use.
[00:18:26.553 --> 00:18:31.896]  They use machetes and just hacking up black women and children.
[00:18:31.896 --> 00:18:40.602]  You're not going to hear jack squat out of just the Reverend Jackson and Al Sharpton and all these other idiots.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.301]  And you're going to see that.
[00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:46.421]  That's what this is.
[00:18:46.421 --> 00:18:52.765]  And then Obama, we'll play the clip when we come back, he said in the speech, we're gonna play a bunch of these clips, they're not Islamic.
[00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:56.947]  Well, they are funded by Saudi Arabia, the dominant Islamic state.
[00:18:56.947 --> 00:18:58.388]  80% are Sunni.
[00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.669]  This is the group radicalizing the Sunnis.
[00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:03.350]  This is 10% of the 80%.
[00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.751]  Do the math.
[00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:09.033]  This is the driving sector of Islam right now.
[00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:10.494]  To say it's not Islamic,
[00:19:11.874 --> 00:19:20.422]  I know Obama's an Islamic scholar and did go to Islamic schools, and when the Arabs heard him speak in Cairo, they fell down and cried, saying his Arabic is more perfect than an imam.
[00:19:20.422 --> 00:19:21.983]  Because, I mean, he was raised a Muslim.
[00:19:21.983 --> 00:19:22.904]  It is true.
[00:19:22.904 --> 00:19:24.285]  I'm not Islamophobic.
[00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:26.387]  I'm not starting a war with anybody.
[00:19:26.387 --> 00:19:32.072]  I wondered why they would say on the news, Obama truth squads will arrest anyone in Missouri that says he's a Muslim.
[00:19:32.072 --> 00:19:34.334]  Remember that when he was running in 2008?
[00:19:34.334 --> 00:19:35.135]  We played the clips.
[00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:36.856]  I was like, why are they saying that?
[00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:42.586]  Because whatever he is, he was raised a Muslim.
[00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:51.496]  And so he's up there as the Grand Imam, the Mahdi, saying that this isn't Islamic.
[00:19:51.496 --> 00:19:53.238]  And in a way, he is the Grand Mahdi.
[00:19:53.238 --> 00:19:58.625]  He is turning radicalism loose to take over the world while claiming he's fighting it and fooling everyone.
[00:19:59.457 --> 00:20:04.919]  Recent events have shown just how vulnerable we are to deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:10.700]  These diseases are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.881]  Now more than ever, there's a great need for a product that will help protect us.
[00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.122]  Look no further.
[00:20:16.122 --> 00:20:20.923]  Supernatural Silver can provide immune system support to help fight off these deadly pathogens.

[00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:08.131]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:21:08.131 --> 00:21:10.212]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:21:10.212 --> 00:21:11.493]  Police call it robbery.
[00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:14.311]  We call it avoidable.
[00:21:14.311 --> 00:21:20.338]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:21:20.338 --> 00:21:25.765]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.

[00:21:45.364 --> 00:21:47.426]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:58.726 --> 00:21:59.967]  Our big story.
[00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:04.971]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[00:22:04.971 --> 00:22:08.093]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:10.895]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.
[00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:17.801]  Staffed with formal special operations personnel, GunMagWarehouse.com is the only company that specializes in gun magazines.

[00:22:28.084 --> 00:22:29.205]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:29.205 --> 00:22:33.667]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:33.667 --> 00:22:39.411]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:42.993]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:42.993 --> 00:22:47.775]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:50.637]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:22:50.637 --> 00:22:50.877]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.877 --> 00:22:52.238]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.441 --> 00:23:01.425]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:23:01.425 --> 00:23:06.950]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.333]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:23:12.152 --> 00:23:16.438]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:18.560]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.844]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:23:21.844 --> 00:23:24.928]  Children left with no homes and no one's coming to help them.
[00:23:24.928 --> 00:23:27.772]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:23:27.952 --> 00:23:28.352]  I think so.
[00:24:18.866 --> 00:24:36.942]  Well, the Speaker of the House, Boehner, is giving a press conference right now and he's endorsed Obama's request to not give $500 million, no, no, not to give $500 million to the Syrian rebels, to give basically unlimited amounts of money.
[00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:39.364]  Speaking now at 12.24 Eastern Time.
[00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:42.847]  That's enough.
[00:24:42.847 --> 00:24:44.088]  Just get him off the screen.
[00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:51.817]  Again, if you're a radio listener, we're simulcasting on television as well, and we track and chronicle what the mainstream media and the politicians are up to.
[00:24:51.817 --> 00:24:54.521]  Boehner is the guy that supports Obamacare.
[00:24:54.521 --> 00:25:00.227]  Boehner is the guy that helps work with the Democrats to try to stop the Tea Party and the Libertarians taking over the party.
[00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:06.460]  Boehner's the guy that keeps protecting Obama on Fast and Furious and everything else.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:27.425]  And I supported Senator Paul saying we should bomb ISIS, but we started arming them to begin with as the rebels, so we've got to figure that out first, how they don't get weapons, and how we then don't give them a new foothold in the Middle East.
[00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:28.285]  Instead it's just
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:40.853]  I'm going to give weapons to the rebels and there'll be no boots on the ground even though he just sent an additional 475 US troops.
[00:25:40.853 --> 00:25:42.875]  That's Associated Press.
[00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.777]  Everything he says is a lie.
[00:25:47.893 --> 00:25:51.714]  Everything he says ends up being a fraud.
[00:25:51.714 --> 00:25:55.055]  And I know politicians do this and we just get to the point we accept it.
[00:25:55.055 --> 00:25:57.436]  That's them again breaking our will.
[00:25:57.436 --> 00:25:59.317]  That's what the TSA is all about.
[00:25:59.317 --> 00:26:00.577]  Checking your baby's diaper.
[00:26:00.577 --> 00:26:01.958]  But the border's wide open.
[00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:04.218]  Any illegals can fly without an ID.
[00:26:04.218 --> 00:26:11.861]  It's about things being upside down.
[00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:14.522]  Let's go ahead and go to this first clip.
[00:26:14.522 --> 00:26:15.362]  Obama says
[00:26:17.185 --> 00:26:23.067]  ISIL, to confuse you more, is not Islamic.
[00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:24.427]  Well, it is Islamic.
[00:26:24.427 --> 00:26:25.647]  It does come out of that.
[00:26:25.647 --> 00:26:27.628]  Talk about political correctness, though.
[00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:30.549]  It is not Islamic.
[00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:34.530]  And then he goes on to call it by another name to confuse people.
[00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.110]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:44.732]  At this moment, the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain.
[00:26:44.732 --> 00:26:46.453]  And one of those groups is ISIL.
[00:26:47.262 --> 00:26:47.942]  Oh my goodness.
[00:26:47.942 --> 00:26:48.883]  Nah, that's enough.
[00:27:17.247 --> 00:27:20.971]  We told you four years ago the plan, a year ago, six months ago.
[00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:23.233]  It's all on record at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:24.695]  Not because we're rocket scientists.
[00:27:24.695 --> 00:27:25.776]  It's a public plan.
[00:27:25.776 --> 00:27:26.857]  Wesley Clark talked about it.
[00:27:26.857 --> 00:27:30.060]  We can play those clips again if you'd like us to.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.203]  To use radical Islamists to stabilize the whole Middle East.
[00:27:33.203 --> 00:27:34.765]  It is our government and NATO.
[00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:40.833]  That put these people calling themselves Islamic State, calling themselves the Caliphate, Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:42.954]  It's all just names of the same thing.
[00:27:42.954 --> 00:27:45.456]  The stupid black flag is the Al-Qaeda flag.
[00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:48.758]  The same one bin Laden gave speeches in front of, okay?
[00:27:48.758 --> 00:27:51.540]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.021]  And that's how dumb they think I am.
[00:27:54.021 --> 00:28:04.208]  And now they admit Libya is a failed state and we've got to invade there because the very group they put in charge is blowing up the airfields and murdering the Christians and the non-radical Muslims.
[00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:10.598]  The only thing Obama said that was true in that statement is that the main victims are Muslims.
[00:28:12.063 --> 00:28:16.286]  In Libya and in Iraq, not in Syria.
[00:28:16.286 --> 00:28:19.387]  They've gone into mainly Christian areas and killed everybody.
[00:28:19.387 --> 00:28:22.169]  Three hundred plus thousand dead in Syria.
[00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:23.490]  You can look that number up.
[00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.470]  Most of them Christians.
[00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.312]  So, I don't even know if he's telling the truth there.
[00:28:27.312 --> 00:28:38.379]  But it is true that if you're not a radical Muslim, and you just want prosperity and take care of your family, and you don't want to eat hearts on television or blow up everything or blow up the shrine of Jonah,
[00:28:39.471 --> 00:28:44.172]  I mean, they're running around blowing up churches and Shiite mosques.
[00:28:44.172 --> 00:28:47.954]  The Shiites don't do that to the Sunnis, folks.
[00:28:47.954 --> 00:28:49.414]  And I'm not picking sides here either.
[00:28:49.414 --> 00:28:51.095]  I just study it.
[00:28:51.095 --> 00:28:54.536]  These Wahhabists are nuts!
[00:28:54.536 --> 00:28:55.436]  Just look at them!
[00:28:55.436 --> 00:29:00.278]  Crazy-eyed, they rape and kill everybody, they like sodomize men they grab.
[00:29:00.278 --> 00:29:01.358]  They're a bunch of perverts!
[00:29:02.978 --> 00:29:05.601]  They are just a bunch of lunatics!
[00:29:05.601 --> 00:29:07.723]  And so it's easy to hate them!
[00:29:07.723 --> 00:29:10.306]  I've got ISIS threatening us on Facebook and Twitter!
[00:29:10.306 --> 00:29:11.868]  Real groups!
[00:29:11.868 --> 00:29:13.430]  I'm not scared of you, scum!
[00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.132]  I got the Second Amendment!
[00:29:15.132 --> 00:29:18.276]  And I feel sorry for people that don't!
[00:29:18.276 --> 00:29:20.118]  And if our government has our way and gets our guns...
[00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:28.149]  They're blowing up old stuff from the Babylonian Empire and architecture.
[00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:30.090]  They are a bunch of demons.
[00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.431]  So when we come back, I'm going to play the next big lie.
[00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:33.692]  He avows no U.S.
[00:29:33.692 --> 00:29:34.572]  ground troops.
[00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:35.232]  There's U.S.
[00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:37.473]  ground troops in Syria and Iraq.
[00:29:37.473 --> 00:29:46.377]  That's been in the news for two years, covertly helping the quote, non-radical rebels who are ISIS.
[00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:52.217]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.217 --> 00:29:54.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:03.513]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[00:30:03.513 --> 00:30:08.057]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:30:08.057 --> 00:30:14.583]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:18.587]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:30:18.587 --> 00:30:20.248]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:30:20.248 --> 00:30:24.212]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[00:30:24.372 --> 00:30:33.058]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:30:33.058 --> 00:30:41.164]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:44.827]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[00:30:44.827 --> 00:30:50.631]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at
[00:30:56.715 --> 00:31:07.222]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:31:29.151 --> 00:31:33.797]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:31:33.797 --> 00:31:38.562]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:31:38.562 --> 00:31:39.564]  Talk about the effects.
[00:31:39.884 --> 00:31:41.386]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:43.308]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:31:43.308 --> 00:31:44.430]  I feel like I look better.
[00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.131]  I feel better.
[00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:46.212]  I feel sexier.
[00:31:46.212 --> 00:31:47.173]  I love it.
[00:31:47.173 --> 00:31:50.157]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:31:57.566 --> 00:31:58.668]  This is life changing.
[00:31:59.108 --> 00:32:05.352]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:05.352 --> 00:32:08.014]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:08.014 --> 00:32:15.059]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:18.081]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:18.081 --> 00:32:21.024]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:21.024 --> 00:32:23.025]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:25.867]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:25.947 --> 00:32:31.669]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:35.170]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.271]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:32:38.271 --> 00:32:45.593]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:15.022]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:50.145 --> 00:33:56.487]  Folks, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this September 11, 2014.
[00:33:56.487 --> 00:34:02.689]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34:02.689 --> 00:34:06.450]  The news websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.331]  I'm going to break down some of the top stories.
[00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:10.552]  There's a lot of them that are on the sites today.
[00:34:12.363 --> 00:34:15.925]  But first I want to finish up with Obama's speech and play some more clips.
[00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:19.768]  First off the doozy, Islamic State is not Islamic.
[00:34:19.768 --> 00:34:30.615]  No, it just comes out of the birthplace of it, Mecca, and claims to be the original true Islamic interpretation.
[00:34:30.615 --> 00:34:33.417]  And there will be no boots on the ground because there are already boots on the ground.
[00:34:36.244 --> 00:34:41.426]  And he goes on to vow to fight them by giving them billions of dollars.
[00:34:41.426 --> 00:34:47.608]  They've already been given more than four billion dollars by coalition of NATO and others the last four years.
[00:34:47.608 --> 00:34:50.189]  They were given nerve gas by Saudi Arabia to launch attacks.
[00:34:50.189 --> 00:34:52.490]  That got tested and proven by the UN and others.
[00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:57.952]  I had Colonel Schaeffer on yesterday who ran black ops against Al Qaeda for the army.
[00:34:57.952 --> 00:34:58.932]  Famous whistleblower.
[00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:09.876]  From Able Danger and all these other secret operations, they were ordered not to kill Al Qaeda commanders, including Osama Bin Laden, even the week before 9-11.
[00:35:09.876 --> 00:35:14.479]  They confirmed, could have killed him with drones, wouldn't let him.
[00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:26.426]  He said exactly what I said yesterday, we're getting some clips of that together for later in the broadcast, in the third hour of the show, and he'd been on Capitol Hill that day, met with intelligence people,
[00:35:28.615 --> 00:35:32.171]  And they told him, bottom line, it's well known.
[00:35:35.595 --> 00:35:55.953]  That indeed, all of this is happening, all of this is unfolding, and our government is basically protecting and working with ISIS, and that we should not do this and not give them weapons, and that giving money to any of the rebels will go directly to Al Qaeda, directly to the most radical.
[00:35:55.953 --> 00:36:03.059]  I said the public number is 65% of the radicals are Al Qaeda jihadis, and he said it's way higher, it's classified, I can't tell you.
[00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:10.212]  From the info I have, they're all ultra-radical, and they have a few fake fronts for the media.
[00:36:10.212 --> 00:36:14.439]  I mean, John McCain met with the radical ones.
[00:36:14.439 --> 00:36:15.400]  And so basically it's 95% Al Qaeda.
[00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:20.267]  And I talked to him some off air, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:22.029]  Undoubtedly, the phone was tapped.
[00:36:22.029 --> 00:36:24.751]  Undoubtedly, the system knows what was said.
[00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:26.733]  But they know what's going on.
[00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:36.702]  Our government knows, and was told by al-Qaeda experts on the Hill, briefing Boehner and others yesterday, that's all I can say.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.501]  In fact, there's the headline right there.
[00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:42.722]  I should take that interview and my other info.
[00:36:42.722 --> 00:37:01.532]  We should have an article that Republican and Democratic leaders were briefed by Al Qaeda experts from the Army and other areas yesterday that this is Al Qaeda and that almost all the rebels are Al Qaeda and that the military, the Pentagon, has told them it is not smart to do this.
[00:37:01.532 --> 00:37:05.874]  In fact, the Pentagon is on the news today saying there could be some real challenges to this.
[00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:06.734]  Oh really?
[00:37:06.734 --> 00:37:07.715]  This is the cover.
[00:37:10.302 --> 00:37:15.645]  To arm Al-Qaeda again, who the Syrian government and army had defeated.
[00:37:15.645 --> 00:37:24.670]  And our government was behind the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda groups attacking the military and Christians and others, until the Egyptians finally crushed them.
[00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.971]  The Egyptian military.
[00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:33.415]  And I'm not even endorsing the military coup, but they were just running around murdering everybody in a reign of terror.
[00:37:36.147 --> 00:37:42.431]  And we're trying to fully overthrow all the institutions, so they could run everything.
[00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:49.955]  So, 20 million people hit the streets, instead of 2 million hitting the streets that put Al-Qaeda in charge of Egypt.
[00:37:49.955 --> 00:37:52.657]  This is very sophisticated, what's going on.
[00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:57.960]  You gotta ask yourself, why is Obama teamed up with his Kenyan cousin, Odinga, pipelining money?
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.961]  We need to get Jerome Corcyon quick.
[00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:01.802]  Maybe even the day of you can do it.
[00:38:01.802 --> 00:38:03.303]  Pipelining that on record,
[00:38:05.418 --> 00:38:08.110]  And Colonel Schaefer and others have met with the head of...
[00:38:09.184 --> 00:38:11.786]  intelligence from Egypt and confirmed all this.
[00:38:11.786 --> 00:38:13.367]  This is in the Egyptian papers.
[00:38:13.367 --> 00:38:15.188]  Egyptian trials have brought it out.
[00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:21.132]  They're using Kenya and trying to have a Muslim uprising there to overthrow the Christian government.
[00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.753]  I mean, this is getting crazy, folks.
[00:38:22.753 --> 00:38:25.395]  What is the president doing?
[00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:35.001]  Arming Al-Qaeda, changing the name to ISIL, ISIS, Islamic State to confuse people, and now he's going to get tough on them by arming the good rebels that is them!
[00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.789]  That is so naked.
[00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:41.370]  So 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.150]  So ridiculous.
[00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.931]  Of course we built our businesses.
[00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:48.132]  Of course raising the debt limit raises the debt limit.
[00:38:48.132 --> 00:38:49.973]  Of course they're coming after our guns.
[00:38:49.973 --> 00:38:54.995]  Of course the NSA is spying on us.
[00:38:54.995 --> 00:38:55.855]  I can hardly breathe.
[00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:57.635]  I'm having like an anxiety attack over this.
[00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:59.316]  This is incredible.
[00:38:59.316 --> 00:39:01.357]  When you know the players, you know the facts.
[00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:09.574]  And I was hoping Colonel Schaffer, who I know for a long time and who I trust, would come on and correct me.
[00:39:09.574 --> 00:39:18.798]  But instead he came on and confirmed everything I already knew, and I wanted to throw up.
[00:39:18.798 --> 00:39:22.139]  Is it possible to arm non-radical rebels?
[00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:24.600]  And have them kick Al-Qaeda out?
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.581]  No.
[00:39:25.581 --> 00:39:30.643]  Across the border in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition.
[00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:41.150]  Tonight I call on Congress again to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters.
[00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:47.216]  In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its own people.
[00:39:47.216 --> 00:39:49.879]  A regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost.
[00:39:51.092 --> 00:40:03.558]  Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria's crisis once and for all.
[00:40:03.558 --> 00:40:03.938]  Third.
[00:40:03.938 --> 00:40:05.018]  That's enough.
[00:40:05.018 --> 00:40:07.500]  Just shut him up.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:12.242]  When you're informed, he's telling you that green is red.
[00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:18.191]  That white is black, that down is up, that left is right, that hot is cold.
[00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:26.493]  I mean, it's just the most bizarre, off-the-chart, over-the-top weirdness.
[00:40:26.493 --> 00:40:29.354]  I literally think I'm living in the Twilight Zone at this point.
[00:40:29.354 --> 00:40:32.375]  Islamic State is not Islamic.
[00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:33.315]  Boy, that's a whopper.
[00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:38.249]  We're not putting boots on the ground.
[00:40:38.249 --> 00:40:39.570]  The boots are already on the ground.
[00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.930]  NBC News was reporting they were already on the ground yesterday.
[00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:50.333]  AP is reporting publicly a thousand are already there and they're sending 475 more.
[00:40:50.333 --> 00:41:03.116]  The CIA with US and NATO commandos and Qatari commandos for four years have been in eastern Syria
[00:41:05.031 --> 00:41:10.237]  Western Iraq training the jihadis.
[00:41:10.237 --> 00:41:14.962]  And we know about it because our military, CIA pilots, NATO people.
[00:41:14.962 --> 00:41:20.368]  I mean, I have guests on that get subpoenaed by Congress.
[00:41:20.368 --> 00:41:21.189]  I mean, do you understand?
[00:41:21.189 --> 00:41:23.091]  We're really breaking reality here.
[00:41:23.091 --> 00:41:24.152]  We're not speculating.
[00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:33.413]  I've interviewed the people that offloaded the anti-tank and anti-helicopter missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:33.413 --> 00:41:35.193]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:41.775]  They're sitting there, getting off, there's people with black flags laughing at them, saying, we're gonna come kill you next.
[00:41:41.775 --> 00:41:43.975]  These people are so arrogant and crazy, folks.
[00:41:43.975 --> 00:41:48.857]  Narcissistic, just nutballs.
[00:41:48.857 --> 00:41:49.877]  On cartoon level,
[00:41:50.964 --> 00:41:52.725]  They're basically like hallucinating or something.
[00:41:52.725 --> 00:41:56.626]  That's how these Al-Qaeda people act, is like people on drugs.
[00:41:56.626 --> 00:41:58.206]  They're that whacked out.
[00:41:58.206 --> 00:42:03.168]  And can you imagine our military has been told to go to secret bases in Jordan and Turkey?
[00:42:03.168 --> 00:42:12.371]  Turkey has given hundreds of times artillery support to Al-Qaeda brigades infiltrating Syria.
[00:42:12.371 --> 00:42:16.693]  They go into secular people's houses and non-radical Muslim houses and Christian houses
[00:42:17.566 --> 00:42:25.930]  And line up the family and tell the father, get in this truck and drive it to the army checkpoint a mile away and blow it up or we're going to kill your whole family.
[00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.371]  This has been in mainstream news.
[00:42:27.371 --> 00:42:30.132]  We've covered it.
[00:42:30.132 --> 00:42:34.274]  And when they say no, they take the littlest daughter and shoot him right in the head.
[00:42:34.274 --> 00:42:37.116]  And you know what the dad does every time?
[00:42:37.116 --> 00:42:41.398]  He goes, all right, he gets in the truck and he drives it right into the police and blows the whole thing up.
[00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:46.058]  And I'll be honest, that's the only way you can get me to do really evil stuff.
[00:42:46.058 --> 00:42:53.228]  If somebody had a gun to my daughter's head and said, you drive this truck of explosives, you know most suicide bombers have their kids held captive, right?
[00:42:53.228 --> 00:42:55.130]  I mean, you know that, right?
[00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:58.355]  You don't think these Islamic State people actually blow themselves up, do you?
[00:42:59.992 --> 00:43:01.713]  Most of the time, they're holding hostages.
[00:43:01.713 --> 00:43:07.395]  Other times, they go find weird, brainwashed goat farmers who don't even know what planet they're on.
[00:43:07.395 --> 00:43:08.616]  Literally don't know where the U.S.
[00:43:08.616 --> 00:43:09.496]  is on maps.
[00:43:09.496 --> 00:43:11.938]  They've done studies and Afghanistan's in place.
[00:43:11.938 --> 00:43:14.899]  Who've grown up in dirt floor shacks on mountaintops.
[00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:25.344]  And they have them, they'll pay them $25,000, $50,000 to go blow themselves up.
[00:43:25.344 --> 00:43:26.584]  But why do you need to do that?
[00:43:26.584 --> 00:43:38.193]  You just go into a house down the street, you line up the family that just wants to live, and you say, I'm going to start shooting your kids, one after another, until you get in that truck and you drive it in there and blow that up.
[00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:41.569]  And you know whose houses they rob?
[00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:43.130]  This has come out in the news.
[00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.971]  Or they do that too?
[00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:46.755]  They'll go to a house that has a truck parked out front.
[00:43:46.755 --> 00:43:48.056]  Why do you think that?
[00:43:48.056 --> 00:43:51.740]  They'll load that truck knowing the driver knows how to drive the truck.
[00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:53.530]  They even get it down to that.
[00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.511]  They profile.
[00:43:54.511 --> 00:44:00.936]  I was reading an article where truck drivers in Afghanistan and Syria and places will park their truck down the street.
[00:44:00.936 --> 00:44:04.278]  You don't park your truck at your house because you know what happens?
[00:44:04.278 --> 00:44:13.186]  Your doors get kicked in at night and a bunch of crazy guys run in and they start raping your wife and daughters in front of you because you know they they're allowed to because they're on a jihad.
[00:44:14.178 --> 00:44:23.386]  And because, you know, you don't have a big beard like they do, and, you know, you're a Shiite, or you don't, or you're an Alawite, or you're a Christian, and they say, I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:44:23.386 --> 00:44:27.749]  And Obama is going to give billions of U.S.
[00:44:27.749 --> 00:44:35.215]  taxpayer money, not 500 million, you read the fine print, it's in the news, it's unlimited to these people.
[00:44:35.215 --> 00:44:36.617]  Let's go ahead and play the next clip.
[00:44:36.617 --> 00:44:38.618]  Obama vows no U.S.
[00:44:38.618 --> 00:44:39.159]  ground troops
[00:44:40.728 --> 00:44:41.509]  Versus ISIS.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:04.287]  Obama to send 475 additional troops to Iraq to aid in the fight against ISIS.
[00:45:04.287 --> 00:45:05.568]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:45:05.568 --> 00:45:09.091]  When he said there wouldn't be troops, that means a huge escalation.
[00:45:09.091 --> 00:45:10.232]  Because what do you do to your enemy?
[00:45:10.232 --> 00:45:11.253]  You lie to your enemy.
[00:45:11.253 --> 00:45:12.434]  And who are the American people?
[00:45:12.434 --> 00:45:13.915]  And who are those troops going to fight?
[00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:16.858]  Oh, there are a bunch of other weird jihadi groups fighting against ISIS.
[00:45:17.782 --> 00:45:20.344]  So, I guarantee our troops won't know who they're attacking.
[00:45:20.344 --> 00:45:22.707]  They'll be designated who to kill, who to bomb.
[00:45:22.707 --> 00:45:24.949]  It will be the enemies of ISIS.
[00:45:24.949 --> 00:45:30.794]  And then ISIS, working with Obama and the globalists publicly, will come out and say, How dare you bomb us, Obama?
[00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:33.137]  We will now blow up America because you do that.
[00:45:33.137 --> 00:45:34.658]  And then laugh.
[00:45:34.658 --> 00:45:36.059]  Working with Saudi Arabia.
[00:45:36.059 --> 00:45:37.521]  It is all theater.
[00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:50.448]  This is September 11th, 13 years later, the grand choke of paying Al-Qaeda publicly.
[00:45:50.448 --> 00:45:56.934]  But here it is, Obama vows no ground troops versus ISIS or ISIL or whatever the name is, this hour.
[00:45:56.934 --> 00:46:01.357]  Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIS.
[00:46:01.357 --> 00:46:05.481]  And anytime we take military action, there are risks involved.
[00:46:05.481 --> 00:46:06.001]  Oh yeah.
[00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:09.484]  Especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions.
[00:46:10.737 --> 00:46:17.819]  But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:22.761]  It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.
[00:46:22.761 --> 00:46:34.245]  This counter-terrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist using our air power and our support for partners forces on the ground.
[00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:45.059]  This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.
[00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:48.563]  And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year.
[00:46:48.563 --> 00:46:51.748]  It is forced against anyone who threatens America's core interests.
[00:46:52.478 --> 00:46:58.762]  But to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international... By the way, all lies.
[00:46:58.762 --> 00:47:05.947]  The Assad regime knows that this is an attack on Syria and that it will next be used to overthrow them.
[00:47:05.947 --> 00:47:09.730]  And the weapons being given to the rebels are to be used against Assad.
[00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:10.590]  This is U.S.
[00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.372]  advisors, weapons and air support.
[00:47:13.442 --> 00:47:15.943]  Inside Syria to topple Assad.
[00:47:15.943 --> 00:47:16.523]  Period.
[00:47:16.523 --> 00:47:18.384]  And now the Russians are going to escalate.
[00:47:18.384 --> 00:47:20.045]  They're going to send in Russian troops.
[00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:21.385]  And they're already there.
[00:47:21.385 --> 00:47:23.426]  And you're going to have, just like you've got U.S.
[00:47:23.426 --> 00:47:29.929]  advisors and quote, non-combat troops advising with the skirmish stuff going on in eastern Ukraine.
[00:47:31.038 --> 00:47:33.719]  You're now going to have... This is really about Russia, folks.
[00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:39.522]  This is our government using a jihad army against Russian interests.
[00:47:39.522 --> 00:47:42.243]  And I'm not lionizing Russia.
[00:47:42.243 --> 00:47:51.708]  I'm saying the criminals that run our country, the ones that gave us Obamacare and open borders and Fast and Furious and Benghazi, are messing with Russia.
[00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:56.130]  And there's an article out today, out of the London Telegraph,
[00:47:58.049 --> 00:48:13.656]  that says do not mess with the Russian wolf and it's an excellent story admitting that the West is bullying and trying to start a war with Russia and Russia is not backing down and so that it's escalating into a serious crisis.
[00:48:13.656 --> 00:48:14.616]  I have more clips.
[00:48:14.616 --> 00:48:20.079]  I have a report filed by our reporters on the ground in New York
[00:48:21.616 --> 00:48:31.202]  With a combat veteran who knows what he's talking about, former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs of Iraq and Afghanistan with the headline, Obama Vows to Fight ISIS by Arming ISIS.
[00:48:31.202 --> 00:48:34.824]  This is Joe responding in New York City last night after he saw the speech.
[00:48:34.824 --> 00:48:35.985]  It's pretty powerful.
[00:48:35.985 --> 00:48:39.207]  It's coming up after the break.
[00:48:39.207 --> 00:48:43.710]  Then we've got a bunch of other news on the economy, on the environment.
[00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:45.351]  There's a lot of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:45.351 --> 00:48:50.214]  It's just, if I keep harping on this, it's because I'm pretty shook up.
[00:48:51.383 --> 00:49:01.347]  By having Colonel Schaeffer on, who fought Al-Qaeda for a decade, actually took out a lot of their bases, and people say, well wait a minute, I thought Al-Qaeda works for the West.
[00:49:01.347 --> 00:49:02.368]  No, no, no, no.
[00:49:02.368 --> 00:49:06.850]  They stir them up, they turn them loose like pudding, rattle snakes in somebody's bed, okay?
[00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.291]  And then when they attack us, they take our rights.
[00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:11.672]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:49:11.672 --> 00:49:17.254]  And he was stopped from taking out Al-Qaeda leadership, and I got him on yesterday, and he said everything I said in five minutes.
[00:49:18.643 --> 00:49:20.304]  That it's horrible to arm them.
[00:49:20.304 --> 00:49:21.225]  They will attack us.
[00:49:21.225 --> 00:49:22.826]  They're coming after us next.
[00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:25.007]  These are people that have killed our troops.
[00:49:25.007 --> 00:49:26.749]  We should join with Assad.
[00:49:26.749 --> 00:49:29.931]  See, that would be a moral position.
[00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:34.954]  And Rand Paul should articulate that.
[00:49:34.954 --> 00:49:40.578]  Basically say, okay, we were wrong to try to back these rebels against Assad.
[00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:42.599]  Admit we're wrong.
[00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:43.740]  But see, they're not wrong.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.481]  They did it on purpose.
[00:49:45.745 --> 00:50:02.891]  We will now openly say that we'd like to help you Assad bomb the rebels period and drive them out of your country because you are a hundred times better than Al Qaeda and Christians could live in peace and you were working with the West and we use that to try to overthrow you and double-cross you.
[00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:06.432]  We stuck our hand out to shake your hand and tried to basically stab you in the heart.
[00:50:06.432 --> 00:50:12.914]  That policy was wrong and so we want to help you destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria and they could stabilize the Middle East.
[00:50:12.914 --> 00:50:14.135]  That is not what they're going to do.
[00:50:14.135 --> 00:50:14.935]  They're going to break
[00:50:15.845 --> 00:50:18.807]  Syria and Iraq into a new country.
[00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:21.348]  They're going to break Iraq into three pieces.
[00:50:21.348 --> 00:50:23.169]  They're going to break Syria into at least two.
[00:50:23.169 --> 00:50:26.231]  And take a piece of Syria and a piece of Iraq and put it together.
[00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:27.632]  That's been the plan the whole time.
[00:50:27.632 --> 00:50:29.453]  And they sit here talking to us like we're idiots.
[00:50:29.453 --> 00:50:30.773]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:50:30.773 --> 00:50:32.734]  This is not debatable.
[00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:34.655]  And Colonel Schaefer agreed with me.
[00:50:34.655 --> 00:50:37.237]  This is our government funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:38.899 --> 00:50:39.560]  That's what it is!
[00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:05.793]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement.
[00:51:05.793 --> 00:51:07.854]  But only if they can detect a signal.

[00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:06.598]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.598 --> 00:52:14.746]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.746 --> 00:52:19.270]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:23.074]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.214 --> 00:52:29.179]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:32.341]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:32.341 --> 00:52:37.705]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:54:43.433 --> 00:54:48.055]  Lower Manhattan on the 13th anniversary of the tragic attacks of 9-11.
[00:54:48.055 --> 00:54:58.360]  Our hearts still go out to all those that lost loved ones and lost limbs and got poisoned by the deadly dust that the government lied about on purpose, that was declassified, that the EPA head was ordered to lie.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.641]  That's all coming up.
[00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:02.742]  We're going to play Joe Biggs' report, one of many he's filed.
[00:55:02.742 --> 00:55:06.384]  He and Leanne doing a great job there in New York City.
[00:55:06.384 --> 00:55:10.066]  Before we do that, we have discounted
[00:55:11.397 --> 00:55:16.582]  The top product in the country for cleaning out your guts and it is the top product.

[00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.673]  They kept harping on me to carry it, and kept harping for me to try it.
[00:55:39.673 --> 00:55:44.358]  I finally did, and just Dr. Group is sensationally awesome.

[00:56:32.279 --> 00:56:38.804]  Here's Joe Biggs' report, Obama Vows to Fight ISIS, or ISIL, by arming ISIL.
[00:56:43.294 --> 00:56:50.020]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com at the 9-11 Memorial in downtown New York City.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:55.245]  Now today, DefenseNews.com put out an article saying, Former U.S.
[00:56:55.245 --> 00:57:00.510]  Intel Chief, military force won't beat Islamic State in war of ideas.
[00:57:01.567 --> 00:57:06.551]  Now, the former director is convinced that force alone is not the key to a U.S.
[00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:14.058]  strategy for defeating Islamic State militants in the Middle East or winning the war of ideas with extremism worldwide.
[00:57:14.058 --> 00:57:26.069]  He said, there are sufficient numbers of believers in their ideas and so we can kill all day long, but until we understand why there are sufficient numbers of believers globally, the group will not be defeated.
[00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:28.691]  Now tonight, President Obama will be speaking
[00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:35.258]  Once again, on the eve of the 9-11 tragedy that happened 13 years ago.
[00:57:35.258 --> 00:57:46.150]  This exact same day, one year ago, President Obama wanted to arm the Syrian rebels once again and then have us attack the Assad regime.
[00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:49.254]  Now tonight, he will be asking for support once again
[00:57:49.875 --> 00:57:49.915]  In
[00:58:15.942 --> 00:58:31.409]  Going to stand up here tonight in front of the American people and promise that it will defeat ISIS, says that he has the clearance to shoot at targets, but at the same time, he is going to give weapons to the FSA, which is then going to be given back to ISIS.
[00:58:31.409 --> 00:58:33.690]  Absolutely, and that's what Colonel Schaefer said.
[00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.951]  Full report at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:37.212]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:37.212 --> 00:58:39.853]  It's 9-11.
[00:58:39.853 --> 00:58:41.134]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[00:58:49.886 --> 00:58:57.168]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:59:19.437 --> 00:59:23.098]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:23.098 --> 00:59:27.379]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:27.379 --> 00:59:29.159]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:29.159 --> 00:59:34.501]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:10.179]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:11.780]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.503]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.503 --> 01:00:21.625]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.412 --> 01:00:32.915]  Our reporters are going to be joining us from New York City coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:32.915 --> 01:00:36.117]  I should have been plugging in the first hour.
[01:00:36.117 --> 01:00:38.820]  You're in for four hours of old Alex Jones today.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.661]  Old Alejandro.
[01:00:40.661 --> 01:00:43.163]  We're doing the fourth hour overdrive.
[01:00:43.163 --> 01:00:46.065]  I did three hours from about 1997 until about 2012.
[01:00:57.298 --> 01:00:59.199]  No, for a while I did three hours.
[01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:01.420]  Then for a couple of years, I don't remember.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.140]  I did three hours from about 1997.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.722]  It's a teleprompter for you, so sometimes I have to go back in memory.
[01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:09.883]  I did three hours from about 1997 to about 2004.
[01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:11.703]  Then I did four hours from 2004 to about 2012.
[01:01:22.935 --> 01:01:34.502]  And then I went back to 3 hours, but so many stations were carrying 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hour that a lot of them kept carrying the 4th hour so we'd re-air the 1st hour in the 4th hour.
[01:01:34.502 --> 01:01:37.564]  So that's why that happens for the stations that wanted it out there.
[01:01:37.564 --> 01:01:38.805]  Nowadays it doesn't even matter.
[01:01:38.805 --> 01:01:45.389]  The stations can program the satellites like a TiVo to play the hours however they want.
[01:01:47.397 --> 01:01:51.260]  But we still have that fourth hour open sometimes, that's why we call it overdrive.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.103]  Sometimes I do five minutes, sometimes I do 20 minutes, sometimes I do the whole hour.
[01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:57.704]  I will be doing an entire...
[01:01:58.703 --> 01:02:08.706]  hour from the new studio live today with our great crew who's always busy running this show and other shows, The Nightly News.
[01:02:08.706 --> 01:02:12.448]  And so we've kind of been, I've been procrastinating moving into the new studio.
[01:02:12.448 --> 01:02:14.688]  I don't expect any train wreck stuff to happen, but it does.
[01:02:14.688 --> 01:02:16.509]  It's kind of fun to be doing that.
[01:02:16.509 --> 01:02:17.989]  So I'm looking forward to it.
[01:02:17.989 --> 01:02:22.771]  We're going to have other fourth hours in the future where I walk around the studio with a headset on.
[01:02:23.211 --> 01:02:26.942]  We're gonna do stuff where I walk around on the streets doing live shows.
[01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:31.033]  I mean, I've done that for eight years, but we're gonna really start doing that a lot where...
[01:02:32.105 --> 01:02:51.563]  I'll have reporters back here at home base hosting the show and then I'll be walking around New York or London or Austin interviewing people, talking to folks, really making it man on the street, really immersing myself in a teleprompter-free, talking point-free mindset.
[01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:54.606]  Because I find when I'm sitting around in a restaurant talking to friends or
[01:02:55.487 --> 01:02:59.329]  Having a cigar once every couple months or something.
[01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:01.750]  You know, out by a pool or something with friends.
[01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.451]  That that's where the real discussions happen.
[01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:08.393]  That's where the real in-depth truth comes out.
[01:03:08.393 --> 01:03:09.953]  And I'll be quite frank with you.
[01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.534]  I enjoy doing live feeds from home.
[01:03:12.534 --> 01:03:13.835]  I enjoy doing YouTubes.
[01:03:13.835 --> 01:03:14.515]  I upload.
[01:03:14.515 --> 01:03:16.136]  I tend to get so busy I don't.
[01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:19.918]  I'm going to focus on making that a focus more and more.
[01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:22.619]  Where I might even once a week invite friends over.
[01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:38.463]  Uh, to a pool location or to a restaurant or wherever where we're authorized to have it and just sit around and have dinner and broadcast live and maybe go out and smoke a cigar afterwards and just really have real discussions.
[01:03:38.463 --> 01:03:40.564]  Maybe fly people into Austin.
[01:03:41.892 --> 01:03:58.115]  Two, just to hang out once a week and do a live feed so it doesn't get all caught up in the production and myself included worried about what's coming up or a bill I've got to sign or a sponsor I've got to talk to because that's what goes on here.
[01:03:58.115 --> 01:04:04.917]  Behind the scenes during the breaks, the guys try to keep me from doing it, but I'm just running around putting out fires, dealing with this, dealing with that.
[01:04:05.856 --> 01:04:22.028]  I want to bring some real purity to this, and I also want to bring some positivity, and try to inject, hey, we're covering negative stuff, that's because it's positive to admit what's wrong, and not just sweep it under the rug, but here are some open solutions as well.
[01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:25.471]  And I know we already do that, but I want to focus on being positive.
[01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:34.572]  And on really realizing that we can seize our destiny, seize the day, fortune favors the bold.
[01:04:34.572 --> 01:04:36.975]  And my fortune is not a pile of diamonds.
[01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:41.140]  My fortune is having a future for my children to grow up in a world with your children.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.141]  Don't we love our children?
[01:04:43.404 --> 01:04:44.765]  Before I had kids, I got so sick of that.
[01:04:44.765 --> 01:04:46.186]  Before the children, before the children.
[01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.728]  You biologically get it once you have children.
[01:04:48.728 --> 01:04:52.591]  That it's about that human continuum and building a better world.
[01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:56.453]  We'll be right back with our reporters on the 9-11 anniversary, 13 years later.
[01:04:56.453 --> 01:04:57.354]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:10.035]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[01:06:50.627 --> 01:06:51.388]  Open your eyes.
[01:06:58.911 --> 01:07:03.054]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[01:07:03.054 --> 01:07:07.598]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:07:07.598 --> 01:07:14.103]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:07:14.103 --> 01:07:18.106]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:07:18.106 --> 01:07:19.768]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:23.731]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[01:07:23.911 --> 01:07:32.598]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:07:32.598 --> 01:07:40.685]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[01:07:40.685 --> 01:07:44.368]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[01:07:44.368 --> 01:07:50.173]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at
[01:07:50.313 --> 01:07:54.036]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:54.036 --> 01:08:06.668]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:30.154]  Well, it's hard to believe 13 years has passed since the tragic attacks of 9-11.
[01:08:30.154 --> 01:08:37.517]  And the mainstream media is replaying the airplanes and the towers falling and people jumping out and government coming to save us.
[01:08:37.517 --> 01:08:49.524]  Meanwhile, I knew at the time, because I studied history, that under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and I'm not blaming Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan when we say that, the intelligence agencies,
[01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:57.278]  Knowingly armed and helped create what is Al Qaeda today.
[01:08:57.278 --> 01:08:59.058]  And I knew that they'd been protecting him.
[01:08:59.058 --> 01:09:01.558]  I knew Saudi Arabia was in bed with him.
[01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:09.440]  I was told by intelligence assets like Steve Pchenik, who ran basically army psychological warfare out of the State Department.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.140]  He ran the Camp David Accords on record.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.461]  Okay, I mean, that's the kind of stuff we're talking about.
[01:09:15.461 --> 01:09:19.282]  I was told by him that bin Laden already died and what hospital he was at.
[01:09:19.282 --> 01:09:21.202]  And then it came out in CBS News months later.
[01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:23.850]  Okay?
[01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:27.651]  And they would roll out his dead body later in a fake assassination thing.
[01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:29.172]  Might be a year, might be 10 years.
[01:09:29.172 --> 01:09:32.033]  Well, it was more than 10 years.
[01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:33.573]  I know NORAD stood down.
[01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:35.454]  I know there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:09:35.454 --> 01:09:38.414]  I know that 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.
[01:09:38.414 --> 01:09:41.916]  I interviewed the head of the visa section of the main Saudi Arabian U.S.
[01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.376]  Embassy, Springman.
[01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:50.158]  I saw him in the Toronto Star and in the Daily Mail up there, the national newspaper, and I got him on.
[01:09:52.532 --> 01:10:04.339]  And he said, we were ordered to let 15 of the hijackers in, even though they had Al-Qaeda designations, that they were maximum-level terrorists, and we were called by the CIA when we refused to give them visas.
[01:10:04.339 --> 01:10:05.280]  They said, that's their cover.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.541]  They work for us.
[01:10:06.541 --> 01:10:14.125]  So, see, bare minimum, the CIA protected 15 of the 19 hijackers.
[01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:14.706]  Boom!
[01:10:14.706 --> 01:10:15.626]  Right there.
[01:10:15.626 --> 01:10:18.148]  Where is the real investigation in Congress?
[01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:19.749]  Well, the bombshell was dropped by
[01:10:20.939 --> 01:10:25.762]  Colonel Tony Schaffer yesterday who ran the Army Black Op program against Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:25.762 --> 01:10:35.649]  It was blocked twice under Stratis Ivy and Abel Danger from killing Osama Bin Laden in the month before 9-11.
[01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:39.772]  Famous whistleblower testified to Congress on yesterday.
[01:10:39.772 --> 01:10:42.794]  Works for different intelligence groups and the Army War College.
[01:10:42.794 --> 01:10:45.176]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:45.176 --> 01:10:47.378]  He is in there briefing Congress yesterday
[01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:52.921]  Explaining to them that basically this entire group is Al Qaeda.
[01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:59.524]  And he dropped the bombshell on what is in the 28 pages that I've talked to different members of Congress that have been allowed to see it.
[01:10:59.524 --> 01:11:01.866]  The FBI is in the room when you go in.
[01:11:01.866 --> 01:11:03.406]  That's the tail wagging the dog.
[01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:05.567]  The Intelligence Committee cannot release it.
[01:11:05.567 --> 01:11:06.448]  They want it released.
[01:11:07.549 --> 01:11:31.369]  It exposes both Obama, it exposes, even though it happened before Obama got in, the same Democrats under Clinton that are running Obama today and the neocons under Bush knew Saudi Arabia was in charge of the hijackers and covered it up and wouldn't let other agencies stop 9-11, if you believe the official story, even at that limited hangout level.
[01:11:33.257 --> 01:11:35.259]  Because it would embarrass the Saudis.
[01:11:35.259 --> 01:11:38.801]  So bare minimum, prior knowledge that Tonalisa Rice already got caught in.
[01:11:38.801 --> 01:11:43.265]  Remember she got warned by Mayor Willie Brown the day before 9-11 not to fly to New York that day.
[01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:50.530]  The San Francisco Chronicle on September 11th reported that in their internet version, September 12th in print.
[01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:54.333]  She was warned by Mayor Willie Brown.
[01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:57.215]  Or she warned Mayor Willie Brown, excuse me.
[01:11:57.215 --> 01:12:00.698]  I mean that is just, that is just incredible.
[01:12:00.698 --> 01:12:02.119]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:12:03.001 --> 01:12:12.125]  You can look that up in the San Francisco Chronicle, that she warned Mayor Willie Brown, I flipped it, to not fly the day before.
[01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:16.086]  The Joint Chiefs were going to be in New York that day and canceled a week before.
[01:12:16.086 --> 01:12:22.349]  Until 9-11, there was a shoot-down order the generals had to shoot down aircraft that were going into populated areas.
[01:12:22.349 --> 01:12:29.792]  That power for generals to do that was taken away one month before 9-11 and given back to them one week after 9-11.
[01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:34.577]  There was a stand-down order.
[01:12:34.577 --> 01:12:43.606]  A coup with Saudi Arabia and criminal globalist forces, bipartisanly, inside our government, letting that take place bare minimum.
[01:12:43.606 --> 01:12:45.207]  That's 9-11 truth.
[01:12:45.207 --> 01:12:46.308]  That's what we know.
[01:12:46.308 --> 01:12:56.178]  And I could go on for hour after hour, I will in the fourth hour today, do a special fourth hour special, live, out of the new studio that's about
[01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:59.452]  30 yards away from where I sit.
[01:12:59.452 --> 01:13:00.832]  You've seen us do the nightly news out of there.
[01:13:00.832 --> 01:13:03.334]  You've seen us do live specials out of there.
[01:13:03.334 --> 01:13:06.196]  It's the first time we're going to merge the radio side with the TV side.
[01:13:06.196 --> 01:13:07.597]  So it should be fun.
[01:13:07.597 --> 01:13:09.718]  And I'm kind of looking forward to some train wrecks.
[01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:21.606]  So that is coming up today and over the next few weeks we're going to be in there at least once or twice a week doing the show live out of there until we segue entirely into that studio.
[01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:24.969]  And then I can cut from in there into here with our reporters
[01:13:25.913 --> 01:13:29.235]  Whenever they're ready to cover news and events as well.
[01:13:29.235 --> 01:13:35.459]  So, it's pretty exciting, the facilities that we've built up, thanks to all your support out there.
[01:13:35.459 --> 01:13:36.900]  There it is, San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:41.703]  Willie Brown got low-key early warning about air travel.
[01:13:41.703 --> 01:13:43.564]  By the way, they changed that headline later.
[01:13:43.564 --> 01:13:44.985]  That was September 12th.
[01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:49.949]  It was, Mayor Willie Brown got warning not to fly September 10th, was the original headline.
[01:13:49.949 --> 01:13:51.870]  Was warned not to fly September 10th to New York.
[01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:59.416]  But then they spun it and it went low-key, low-key, because it was such a big deal.
[01:13:59.416 --> 01:14:05.721]  Getting back to what Colonel Schaefer said, and we're going to Joe Biggs and Leanne McAdoo in New York City.
[01:14:05.721 --> 01:14:17.471]  He said that he's not allowed to tell us what's in the 28 pages, but Walter Jones, who's a frequent guest of this show, who a few years ago started the initiative to have those 28 pages released.
[01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:18.131]  He's a hero.
[01:14:18.131 --> 01:14:19.953]  We need to get him back on next week if we can.
[01:14:21.564 --> 01:14:24.106]  Now that I think about it, he'd have been perfect to have on on 9-11.
[01:14:24.106 --> 01:14:35.513]  Ron Paul has come out and said, yes, the 28 pages, he's talked to members of Congress that have now seen it, and it shows clearly that there was prior knowledge and it was allowed to happen.
[01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:36.794]  Ron Paul came out last week.
[01:14:36.794 --> 01:14:38.955]  We're going to cover that in the fourth hour as well.
[01:14:38.955 --> 01:14:49.962]  So, Schaefer gets called in, literally, and screamed at repeatedly when he comes on this show and says too much, because this show has such a big effect.
[01:14:50.478 --> 01:14:55.121]  He says some of the stuff on Fox News, he says here, and doesn't even get in trouble.
[01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:57.523]  He's told me he gets in trouble.
[01:14:57.523 --> 01:15:01.346]  I'm not going to even say with who, but there's good people in the government.
[01:15:01.346 --> 01:15:11.573]  But at the same time, if they say too much, then obviously it could get a lot of people in trouble.
[01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:14.455]  But at the same time, if we don't expose this, we're going to lose everything anyways.
[01:15:15.384 --> 01:15:18.825]  I mean it's gotten to that point, but how bombshell is that?
[01:15:18.825 --> 01:15:19.585]  To have Lt.
[01:15:19.585 --> 01:15:20.285]  Col.
[01:15:20.285 --> 01:15:22.586]  Tony Schaefer, not just some average Lt.
[01:15:22.586 --> 01:15:22.886]  Col.
[01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:25.807]  over supply, not that that's bad, but a Lt.
[01:15:25.807 --> 01:15:26.127]  Col.
[01:15:26.127 --> 01:15:29.528]  over black operations against Al-Qaeda for a decade.
[01:15:29.528 --> 01:15:35.009]  And he got into that because previously he was involved going in and killing them in shells, in caves, in facilities all over the Middle East.
[01:15:36.005 --> 01:15:47.669]  Saying our government's arming Al-Qaeda, all the Syrian rebels are Al-Qaeda, ISIS is Al-Qaeda, and that memo says that Saudi Arabia was involved and our government covered it up and knew beforehand.
[01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:53.851]  Exactly what Seibel Edmonds, the FBI NSA translator, whistleblower, said.
[01:15:53.851 --> 01:15:59.472]  It's criminal elements of our government running kids, drugs, weapons, you name it, with Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:04.514]  Joe Biggs, reporting from New York City, what is it like for you now to know that Colonel Schaefer,
[01:16:05.276 --> 01:16:11.709]  Went public here yesterday that he'd been on the Hill yesterday briefing Congress in a closed-door briefing.
[01:16:12.907 --> 01:16:20.954]  And that he and others briefed them, at a higher level than he is, that indeed this is Al Qaeda, said don't do it, work with Assad to take them out if you're going to do it, like Ron Paul said.
[01:16:20.954 --> 01:16:21.854]  They're not going to do that.
[01:16:21.854 --> 01:16:26.058]  They're going to go against Assad's wishes and actually give them weapons and money.
[01:16:26.058 --> 01:16:29.181]  And now we know what the 28 pages shows.
[01:16:29.181 --> 01:16:33.424]  As Ron Paul said, clear evidence of a stand down.
[01:16:33.424 --> 01:16:34.465]  This is incredible.
[01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:37.928]  What is it like for you getting wounded, losing so many buddies over there to know this?
[01:16:39.372 --> 01:16:42.454]  Quite frankly, Alex, it pisses me off to hear something like that.
[01:16:42.454 --> 01:16:54.641]  You know, Obama's even coming out last night in a speech saying that he wants to, once again, on the same anniversary as last year, on the eve of 9-11, goes and he tries to say that, you know, we want to go after Syria, we want to attack Assad.
[01:16:54.641 --> 01:17:01.505]  We're going to, you know, weaponize basically and fund more of these FSA troops over there, the Free Syrian Army guys.
[01:17:01.505 --> 01:17:06.969]  But we already know from many reports that the FSA gives the weapons over to ISIS
[01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:09.810]  And it's just this huge circle.
[01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:10.250]  It's crazy.
[01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.871]  They fringe the weapons.
[01:17:11.871 --> 01:17:20.034]  They're just a little happy face on Al-Qaeda so that the Pentagon can, you know, not get a rebellion of the troops learning that we're funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:20.034 --> 01:17:21.955]  Yeah, it's just another way to clear their name.
[01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:24.256]  They're trying to clean their hands.
[01:17:24.256 --> 01:17:25.477]  They're laundering it.
[01:17:25.477 --> 01:17:28.298]  They launder the weapons through FSA.
[01:17:28.298 --> 01:17:31.319]  Yes, that's exactly what is happening.
[01:17:31.319 --> 01:17:33.440]  You know, today we got out here, Alex, and
[01:17:35.188 --> 01:17:38.197]  This is a day that breaks my heart.
[01:17:38.197 --> 01:17:40.504]  You know, that the country that I believed in, I loved.
[01:17:41.977 --> 01:17:45.699]  Betrayed me, you know, the people that died on this day.
[01:17:45.699 --> 01:17:50.542]  And then the many people who died because they thought, like myself, we were fighting a just thing.
[01:17:50.542 --> 01:17:54.645]  We were trying to stand up for our country because our country had been attacked.
[01:17:54.645 --> 01:17:59.888]  You know, I wanted to do something that I thought at the time was very pure and for selfless reasons.
[01:17:59.888 --> 01:18:02.409]  I wasn't doing it for benefits, for college, anything like that.
[01:18:02.409 --> 01:18:03.710]  I didn't care about that.
[01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:11.615]  I wanted to come out here and I was willing to put my life on the line because I thought terrorists came over here and they attacked us and they killed thousands of people.
[01:18:12.176 --> 01:18:15.517]  And here I am now, 13 years later, and I know the truth.
[01:18:15.517 --> 01:18:18.698]  You know, I joined the military basically for no reason now.
[01:18:18.698 --> 01:18:22.860]  You know, everything that I thought that I fought for was a complete and total lie.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.560]  And I lose sleep over that.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.061]  It's a nightmare.
[01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:29.001]  And one thing that I hate is disrespect.
[01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:33.403]  And the fact that I passed a federal building, the flag is not at half-mast.
[01:18:34.051 --> 01:18:39.939]  I went inside that federal building and I asked him, why is the flag not at half-mast?
[01:18:39.939 --> 01:18:43.064]  When Nelson Mandela died, you guys had the flag at half-mast.
[01:18:43.064 --> 01:18:45.788]  When Whitney Houston died, you had the flag at half-mast.
[01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:50.775]  Why is the flag not at half-mast on the 13th anniversary of the worst attacks on American soil?
[01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:53.831]  Well, they're done with it now.
[01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:57.413]  They won't let the first responders or their families in to the event.
[01:18:57.413 --> 01:19:00.035]  It's all about Bloomberg to raise money for gun control.
[01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:02.917]  Yes, folks, his gun control foundation runs it.
[01:19:02.917 --> 01:19:04.959]  He gave it to his private foundation.
[01:19:04.959 --> 01:19:07.020]  What a pig!
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:10.283]  Yeah, they're charging the families to come in.
[01:19:10.283 --> 01:19:17.348]  Like Leanne said yesterday, it's like going to your son or daughter's funeral and being told you have to go pay to see the grave.
[01:19:17.348 --> 01:19:18.909]  It is the most ridiculous thing ever.
[01:19:19.758 --> 01:19:20.639]  Don't give them ideas.
[01:19:20.639 --> 01:19:24.062]  They'll actually put parking meters on the gravesites.
[01:19:24.062 --> 01:19:25.443]  Joe, don't give them ideas.
[01:19:25.443 --> 01:19:29.466]  I predict within one year they're going to put parking meters on graves at Arlington.
[01:19:29.466 --> 01:19:30.467]  I'm not kidding.
[01:19:30.467 --> 01:19:32.909]  Because, see, everything's over the top now, Joe.
[01:19:32.909 --> 01:19:39.014]  Have you heard Obama says, I'm not even joking now, have you heard Obama says, no boots on the ground even though troops were officially sent?
[01:19:39.014 --> 01:19:41.796]  And he says ISIS is not Islamic.
[01:19:41.796 --> 01:19:44.498]  Yeah, that was a huge joke.
[01:19:44.498 --> 01:19:47.581]  I got into a really big rant last night when I heard that.
[01:19:48.393 --> 01:19:50.074]  You guys have been filing some powerful reports.

[01:20:36.704 --> 01:20:38.324]  And your rights are at risk.

[01:21:46.544 --> 01:21:48.266]  What good is a big, berky water filter?
[01:21:48.266 --> 01:21:49.587]  We get that question a lot.
[01:22:02.261 --> 01:22:04.723]  We're not here at BigBurkyWaterFilters.com.
[01:22:04.723 --> 01:22:06.885]  And in a word, the answer is protection.

[01:22:57.935 --> 01:23:00.778]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:00.778 --> 01:23:05.903]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:05.903 --> 01:23:14.030]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:18.554]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:23:18.554 --> 01:23:22.358]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:28.463]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:28.463 --> 01:23:31.625]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:37.009]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:37.009 --> 01:23:45.175]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:23:45.175 --> 01:23:45.436]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:23:45.436 --> 01:23:45.976]  New business
[01:23:52.441 --> 01:24:19.609]  If you were a criminal organization that had control of the major intelligence agencies and you wanted to be able to overthrow the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[01:24:21.459 --> 01:24:43.232]  You want to be able to establish a police state and attack any country you wanted, you would make a secret partnership with Saudi Arabia, who's been working with the West for over a hundred years, and you would have them create laundered, black-op, crazy armies that didn't even know who they were working for, to run around and pillage Africa, the Middle East, Asia, you name it.
[01:24:43.232 --> 01:24:46.674]  So then, they pull out, the West gets to come in and take over.
[01:24:48.137 --> 01:24:49.798]  And our troops get to die fighting them.
[01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:51.538]  Oh, it's a real war!
[01:24:51.538 --> 01:24:58.041]  They're real radical islamicists, but they were turned loose, and now they've done it publicly.
[01:24:58.041 --> 01:25:16.008]  In Libya, and in Syria, and in Egypt, and they think we're so dumb that we're now going to openly fund what Congress wouldn't fund last year, and what Senator Cruz and Senator Paul spoke out against after we and others fought it.
[01:25:17.264 --> 01:25:20.446]  The military came out and said we're not going to be the air force for Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:20.446 --> 01:25:25.309]  Now, okay, you'll be the air force for the rebels fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:25.309 --> 01:25:27.231]  And you'll bomb any targets, we say.
[01:25:27.231 --> 01:25:31.454]  And they know Assad will start shooting at our aircraft, because they're in their country.
[01:25:31.454 --> 01:25:35.036]  And then they'll go, oh, we're going to bomb Assad now, too.
[01:25:35.036 --> 01:25:37.598]  So I would advise Syria, and I know they're not stupid,
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:43.263]  I'm against war and I'm against al Qaeda, so I will openly tell Syria what I think they should do.
[01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:52.069]  And as a stranger than fiction, it came out in the London Telegraph that the Syrian government does listen to the show and Assad listens and does actually base policy on this show.
[01:25:52.069 --> 01:25:56.372]  That sounds completely arrogant and crazy, but it is news so I might as well just say it.
[01:25:56.372 --> 01:26:00.195]  I don't say that a lot because it sounds so crazy, but it's been in the British newspapers.
[01:26:00.195 --> 01:26:01.076]  They hacked Assad's
[01:26:02.489 --> 01:26:04.630]  Computers and published a bunch of it.
[01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:05.511]  I've never been to Syria.
[01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:09.534]  I never talked to Assad I'd like to go see the Roman and Greek ruins there.
[01:26:09.534 --> 01:26:26.025]  They're better than what's in Rome and Greece They say just total intact cities of stuff that by the way Isis is blowing up when they get to it But I just don't know we articulate things so accurately from different angles that the Syrians listen to us Take the bombing
[01:26:27.603 --> 01:26:31.266]  They'll probably false flag and shoot missiles at our aircraft anyways and blame it on you.
[01:26:31.266 --> 01:26:38.572]  Announce you're not going to shoot at the forces and then just sit there and say, we don't know why America's bombing us.
[01:26:38.572 --> 01:26:44.036]  Because if you fight back, they're going to invade and they're going to murder everybody in the country who isn't al-Qaeda.
[01:26:44.036 --> 01:26:48.720]  You know they want to sack the country and blow it up and tear everything to pieces like the globalists like to do.
[01:26:50.578 --> 01:26:55.782]  And that's exactly basically what Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer said.
[01:26:55.782 --> 01:27:06.309]  If we really wanted to get rid of Al-Qaeda, Joe Biggs, former Staff Sergeant in Iraq, in Afghanistan, you know the region well, wouldn't we go to Assad and team up to take them out?
[01:27:06.309 --> 01:27:14.274]  I mean, how do you bomb the bad rebels working with the good rebels when it's well known publicly that 65% are Al-Qaeda, Joe?
[01:27:18.075 --> 01:27:19.818]  I've been told it's over 95 percent.
[01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:26.567]  Schaefer wouldn't say it on air, but little birds told me that the Pentagon knows full well they're basically all Al Qaeda, Joe.
[01:27:26.567 --> 01:27:30.593]  Yeah, I mean, they've completely taken up arms with ISIS.
[01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:32.195]  I mean, they have ditched all that.
[01:27:33.163 --> 01:27:36.144]  They are on ISIS's side.
[01:27:36.144 --> 01:27:39.665]  Our government wants this war with Syria so bad, it's mind-blowing.
[01:27:39.665 --> 01:27:41.565]  They're so thirsty for blood.
[01:27:41.565 --> 01:27:44.606]  They want to topple that regime, just like they did in Libya.
[01:27:44.606 --> 01:27:47.527]  They want to go, they want to start something with Russia.
[01:27:47.527 --> 01:27:49.947]  They're trying to get under Putin's skin, but he's not having it.
[01:27:49.947 --> 01:27:51.688]  These guys are out looking for a fight.
[01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:53.028]  They want another war.
[01:27:53.028 --> 01:27:56.829]  That's how we get those contract groups to get out there and make billions of dollars.
[01:27:56.829 --> 01:27:58.270]  That's all this is about at the end of the day.
[01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:59.430]  They want more and more money.
[01:27:59.997 --> 01:28:03.500]  They're just evil, blood-sucking vampires.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:09.924]  And these globalist contractors and big banks that own them, there's not going to be anywhere to spend your money if you blow the earth up.
[01:28:09.924 --> 01:28:11.486]  Yeah, but they don't understand that.
[01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:19.051]  Right now, they're just so high on this power trip that they have, that they don't even think about the results of what they're doing.
[01:28:19.051 --> 01:28:26.477]  I see that in personal life, we've all seen it, but when government acts like that, you get 20 million Germans killed thanks to Hitler.
[01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:29.622]  This time it'll be everybody, Joe.
[01:28:29.622 --> 01:28:34.845]  I mean, the London Telegraph says we've got to stop messing with Russia, it's going to cause nuclear war.
[01:28:34.845 --> 01:28:40.089]  That's usually a hawkish, right-wing publication.
[01:28:40.089 --> 01:28:41.630]  Why are they saying that today?
[01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:43.571]  Because they're not insane, that's why.
[01:28:43.571 --> 01:28:47.073]  It's just mind-blowing, like I said.
[01:28:48.077 --> 01:28:53.738]  How long have we been saying that the ISIS threat, although funded by CIA, is a very real threat?
[01:28:53.738 --> 01:29:02.420]  You sent us El Paso, you know, we had to go and pull a stunt crossing the border, showing you that an ISIS jihadist could indeed come in through our southern borders.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.780]  Everyone said that that was fear-mongering, they were crazy, that something like that could not happen.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:14.382]  Yesterday, they're finally coming out, mainstream media is saying it, the Department of Homeland Security is saying that there's a legitimate ISIS threat at our southern borders.
[01:29:15.757 --> 01:29:21.659]  If we can't take a fight, Alex, with another country, with Syria, with Russia, what are we gonna do?
[01:29:21.659 --> 01:29:29.721]  We're gonna fund a group ourselves, and we're gonna have them come into the country and open up and activate these sleeper, uh, these terrorist sleeper cells.
[01:29:29.721 --> 01:29:32.342]  That's the only way they can get their war then, within our own country.
[01:29:32.342 --> 01:29:33.742]  And take our rights away.
[01:29:34.224 --> 01:29:35.985]  Exactly, just like we saw in Ferguson.
[01:29:35.985 --> 01:29:37.206]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat.
[01:29:37.206 --> 01:29:38.147]  His wife could eat no lean.
[01:29:38.147 --> 01:29:39.868]  Between the two, they licked the bladder clean.
[01:29:39.868 --> 01:29:44.632]  You get to take over the whole world with a skeleton key magic wand that is al-Qaeda.
[01:29:44.632 --> 01:29:46.854]  I'm gonna come back and finish up with you and go to Leanne.
[01:29:46.854 --> 01:29:48.916]  I want to get the mood down there when we come back with Joe Benz.
[01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.156]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.156 --> 01:29:52.698]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.698 --> 01:29:55.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.542 --> 01:30:06.709]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:09.051]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:09.051 --> 01:30:14.335]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:14.335 --> 01:30:19.280]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.822]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:22.822 --> 01:30:26.885]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:26.885 --> 01:30:31.228]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:31.228 --> 01:30:41.454]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:41.454 --> 01:30:43.956]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:30:44.156 --> 01:30:52.363]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:30:52.363 --> 01:30:56.326]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:03.603]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[01:31:03.603 --> 01:31:08.146]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:31:08.146 --> 01:31:14.670]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:18.653]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:31:18.653 --> 01:31:20.314]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:31:20.314 --> 01:31:24.297]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[01:31:24.457 --> 01:31:33.143]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:31:33.143 --> 01:31:41.249]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[01:31:41.249 --> 01:31:44.912]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.

[01:32:06.461 --> 01:32:07.661]  Security alert.

[01:32:19.306 --> 01:32:20.847]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:20.847 --> 01:32:23.708]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:26.950]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:29.131]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:29.431 --> 01:32:30.751]  People are assaulting us.

[01:32:46.536 --> 01:32:47.516]  Imperative.
[01:32:47.516 --> 01:32:49.477]  Destroy Britain's T.V.
[01:32:49.477 --> 01:32:54.038]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:54.038 --> 01:32:55.639]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:32:55.639 --> 01:32:56.379]  You can feel it.
[01:33:13.547 --> 01:33:15.347]  We are on the march.
[01:33:15.347 --> 01:33:18.488]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:18.488 --> 01:33:25.830]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:33.072]  I get up here on air and I get hysterical because it's just so crazy.
[01:33:33.072 --> 01:33:36.772]  Our government really funded Al Qaeda to overthrow Libya.
[01:33:36.772 --> 01:33:40.753]  They tried to work with us for eight years and invested their money with us and let in all the U.S.
[01:33:40.753 --> 01:33:42.914]  corporations and French corporations.
[01:33:44.912 --> 01:34:05.421]  And the French turned around, because Gaddafi invested most of the money with them, and just stabbed him in the back and used it to bring in black ops, to then turn that country that was just beautiful, the infrastructure, the education... I'm not for socialism, because the only time it works is if there's one dictator and they actually distribute the money, but then people get decadent.
[01:34:06.198 --> 01:34:08.159]  But it actually worked in Libya.
[01:34:08.159 --> 01:34:09.519]  I'm a total capitalist.
[01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:12.340]  But compared to the rest of Africa, it became a safe haven.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.081]  That place is an admitted failed state, worst place in the world.
[01:34:15.081 --> 01:34:21.683]  50,000 people dead conservatively, most of them being chopped up by Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:21.683 --> 01:34:33.007]  Then our government tried to overthrow the second most populous country in Africa, Egypt, to put Al-Qaeda basically in.
[01:34:36.383 --> 01:34:47.933]  And what's crazy is when they put the Muslim Brotherhood in, they let Al-Qaeda in to just run around and just start murdering people and blowing up military bases.
[01:34:47.933 --> 01:35:03.446]  I've got so much family that's fought these folks in Afghanistan, mainly in Iraq, and they go, man, listen, these people will take their kid, pour gasoline all over him, I was talking to my cousin about this, and then call in a med-vac saying they've been burned in a car fire.
[01:35:05.327 --> 01:35:09.770]  And then when you land, the guy's dad will come out and try to blow himself up.
[01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:12.291]  And again, I'm not defending the West and the wars and the invasions.
[01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:13.412]  I understand that.
[01:35:13.412 --> 01:35:21.937]  Our government goes, stirs them up, funds the most radical people, and then lets us have a war with them to take our liberties.
[01:35:21.937 --> 01:35:24.659]  It's so sick.
[01:35:24.659 --> 01:35:31.263]  And now they're doing it in Syria and Iraq, and Obama says, I'm going to ask Congress for funding to the rebels.
[01:35:32.025 --> 01:35:37.307]  To take out Al-Qaeda when the rebels are 90 plus percent Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:37.307 --> 01:35:44.210]  And to confuse people, Obama says ISIL, ISIS, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:59.916]  In any military journal, it is not debatable that ISIS is made up of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:03.450]  They call themselves Al-Qaeda in Libya.
[01:36:03.450 --> 01:36:06.251]  This is Al-Qaeda, funded by Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:10.113]  It's in mainstream German, Dutch, British newspapers.
[01:36:10.113 --> 01:36:11.154]  Just type it in.
[01:36:11.154 --> 01:36:13.695]  Saudi Arabia armed ISIS.
[01:36:13.695 --> 01:36:15.816]  They gave them armored vehicles, rocket launchers.
[01:36:15.816 --> 01:36:16.596]  It's all U.S.
[01:36:16.596 --> 01:36:21.559]  stuff Saudi Arabia bought.
[01:36:21.559 --> 01:36:28.002]  But our government's so arrogant, they have C-130s landing in Jordan and Turkey, and they go to bases,
[01:36:30.743 --> 01:36:42.731]  And the Al-Qaeda people come up to the airplanes as 45-year-old, 65-year-old CIA people sit there with their mouths hanging open.
[01:36:42.731 --> 01:36:47.074]  I mean, normally they would send a truck with some troops or something to then deliver it to Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:47.074 --> 01:36:52.098]  They make our troops and CIA people actually go meet with Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:53.404 --> 01:37:04.631]  I mean, can you imagine being in the CIA and pulling up, landing in a plane and getting off, and there's guys with beards, with Al-Qaeda patches, and you're giving them Stinger missiles?
[01:37:04.631 --> 01:37:07.372]  That's what Tosh Plumlee talked about here.
[01:37:07.372 --> 01:37:08.293]  It's all been confirmed.
[01:37:08.293 --> 01:37:12.815]  I'm going to go back to Joe Biggs and Leanne McAdoo, because you guys have a lot of reports to follow for the Nightly News tonight.
[01:37:12.815 --> 01:37:14.156]  You're doing a great job.
[01:37:14.156 --> 01:37:15.737]  Joe, I just keep marveling.
[01:37:15.737 --> 01:37:17.638]  It's not even about arming Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:17.638 --> 01:37:18.699]  The story's bigger than that.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.936]  It's the mind games of changing the names that confuse us and what do you think they're planning there?
[01:37:25.768 --> 01:37:30.752]  Because, I mean, how are they going to... You know this is to overthrow Assad.
[01:37:30.752 --> 01:37:34.334]  How are they going to spin this back when they armed him to attack Assad?
[01:37:34.334 --> 01:37:38.377]  Now they claim they're attacking him, but it's really an attack on Assad.
[01:37:38.377 --> 01:37:45.703]  Do you think they're planning some new big terror attack that'll be so emotional that people will forget and will say, blow up Assad and maybe blame him or something?
[01:37:45.703 --> 01:37:48.605]  Kind of like they blamed Saddam when it was Saudi Arabia?
[01:37:48.605 --> 01:37:50.906]  I mean, what do you think's happening here, Joe?
[01:37:50.906 --> 01:37:52.127]  You fought these people.
[01:37:52.127 --> 01:37:52.988]  You fought Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:54.172 --> 01:37:55.652]  Well, the biggest thing is the hearts and minds.
[01:37:55.652 --> 01:38:02.474]  They want, they want you to feel like the bad guy that they want you to, whoever they, you know, Assad, that's our bad guy.
[01:38:02.474 --> 01:38:03.735]  So we paint that picture.
[01:38:03.735 --> 01:38:12.517]  Now the only way to get the, the hearts and minds of the American people to back a war with them is to feel like there's some kind of humanitarian crisis happening in that area.
[01:38:12.517 --> 01:38:13.958]  That's what happened a year ago.
[01:38:13.958 --> 01:38:16.739]  They said there were these chemical attacks, all this stuff is bad.
[01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:18.319]  Assad's bad, bad, bad, bad.
[01:38:18.319 --> 01:38:20.440]  Let's go fund the Free Syrian Army.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.200]  Bitch, by the way,
[01:38:21.704 --> 01:38:27.967]  Or a lot of the same rebels in Libya who also admit that Al-Qaeda is with them, which is now ISIS.
[01:38:27.967 --> 01:38:28.808]  You know, a lot of people forget.
[01:38:28.808 --> 01:38:30.849]  And they launched the chemical attack.
[01:38:30.849 --> 01:38:31.329]  Exactly.
[01:38:31.329 --> 01:38:34.270]  They want you to feel like there's a humanitarian crisis involved.
[01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:39.473]  That's how you get 90% of the hearts and minds of Americans, the sheep, the people who are asleep, not paying attention.
[01:38:39.473 --> 01:38:43.075]  They flip on CNN, Fox News, and they see the kids sitting in a cell somewhere.
[01:38:43.075 --> 01:38:44.896]  They see little kids running around crying.
[01:38:44.896 --> 01:38:45.696]  That's all they see.
[01:38:45.696 --> 01:38:48.118]  They see that one area where that camera's pointing.
[01:38:48.118 --> 01:38:50.639]  Meanwhile, while the rest of it's going on, the people are like,
[01:38:51.621 --> 01:38:53.091]  This isn't even happening here.
[01:38:53.091 --> 01:38:54.964]  They just want you to see that right there.
[01:38:56.092 --> 01:38:57.193]  That's all they care about.
[01:38:57.193 --> 01:39:06.679]  It's always going to be a humanitarian crisis to get these people here amped up to back the President to go on some bogus war again so we lose more Americans in a stupid war.
[01:39:06.679 --> 01:39:09.942]  Exactly, but this time it's not even flimsy.
[01:39:09.942 --> 01:39:12.043]  It's totally transparent.
[01:39:12.043 --> 01:39:15.025]  You've got Rand Paul and others saying, don't arm Al Qaeda.
[01:39:15.025 --> 01:39:17.987]  We're about to give money to the same people we fought.
[01:39:17.987 --> 01:39:20.189]  You've got generals saying it.
[01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:22.891]  And then the Republican leadership is lined up saluting Obama.
[01:39:24.272 --> 01:39:40.059]  Well, ISIS was very disorganized until a few months ago, where they have ramped up and gotten a lot more leadership.
[01:39:40.059 --> 01:39:45.581]  I don't know if you remember, we gave them the leadership with a deserter named Bo Bergdahl.
[01:39:45.581 --> 01:39:49.843]  We traded him for five top leaders who are now back in the mix.
[01:39:50.769 --> 01:39:54.833]  And of course, while these leaders were held for years, they were being told the real game plan at the highest level.
[01:40:09.878 --> 01:40:20.963]  That, oh, you're gonna go out and do this, you're gonna destabilize, but you don't go into Kurdistan, you don't go into Iran, this is the deal, we're breaking Iraq in three parts, you're gonna get a piece of it, and a piece of Syria, now go play dumb!
[01:40:20.963 --> 01:40:25.806]  But then they're so out of control, and they're always turning on each other as well, that they...
[01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:39.201]  They went outside the lines, they painted outside the numbers, and went into Kurdistan, and they even attacked Jordan a few weeks ago, and so it may be they're really getting ready to attack ISIS, because they've double-crossed the West.
[01:40:39.201 --> 01:40:39.882]  My point is...
[01:40:40.931 --> 01:40:44.014]  What are you doing working with Al Qaeda publicly?
[01:40:44.014 --> 01:40:46.636]  I mean, it's just... That's what I'm saying, Joe.
[01:40:46.636 --> 01:40:48.217]  How do they get away with this?
[01:40:48.217 --> 01:40:51.580]  I don't see the establishment pulling this off this time.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:41:00.488]  And they better know that if they let Al Qaeda attack the United States, I don't care how many times they change the name, they can change the name of Toucan Sam tomorrow.
[01:41:00.488 --> 01:41:01.809]  We know who's behind this.
[01:41:01.809 --> 01:41:07.394]  9-11 Truth will totally expose them this time.
[01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.155]  The thing is, though,
[01:41:09.338 --> 01:41:18.184]  The people have been dumbed down so much that truly, Obama can be so transparent and throw things in our face that most people won't even pay attention or see it.
[01:41:18.184 --> 01:41:18.924]  They won't even care.
[01:41:18.924 --> 01:41:25.128]  I mean, you can see Obama in a video going, all right, I want you guys to attack the southern borders.
[01:41:25.128 --> 01:41:29.491]  And people will turn on the TV and watch and go, nah, he didn't do that.
[01:41:29.491 --> 01:41:32.193]  You know, that's how transparent they've been able to be.
[01:41:32.193 --> 01:41:35.315]  Every plan that they've wanted up until now has worked.
[01:41:36.175 --> 01:41:45.143]  And when we say inside job, the media always spun that down to dumbed-down propaganda, that that means the police blew up the towers, or that means there are no Muslim extremists.
[01:41:45.143 --> 01:41:47.105]  No, that's not what we ever said.
[01:41:47.105 --> 01:41:51.648]  We said, wow, the head of the embassy says they were ordered to let the hijackers in, they were CIA.
[01:41:52.389 --> 01:41:56.752]  Hey, the head of the Defense Language School in Monterey says he trained Mohammed Ad and others, they were U.S.
[01:41:56.752 --> 01:41:57.973]  government agents.
[01:41:57.973 --> 01:41:59.474]  Hey, NORAD stood down.
[01:41:59.474 --> 01:42:01.716]  Hey, they're using this to take our liberties.
[01:42:01.716 --> 01:42:04.458]  Hey, they're using this to attack countries that had nothing to do with it.
[01:42:04.458 --> 01:42:11.183]  This is a pretext by criminal groups inside the country double-crossing us with Saudi Arabia and others.
[01:42:11.183 --> 01:42:12.224]  Period.
[01:42:12.224 --> 01:42:16.487]  There's no way that many coincidences happen on a one-sided assault.
[01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:21.485]  The only way for that many coincidences to happen are for both parties to be involved.
[01:42:21.485 --> 01:42:22.345]  The U.S.
[01:42:22.345 --> 01:42:23.645]  and the terrorists as well.
[01:42:23.645 --> 01:42:24.606]  Not once.
[01:42:24.606 --> 01:42:24.986]  I agree.
[01:42:24.986 --> 01:42:27.307]  Not once, not twice, not ten times.
[01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:28.407]  More than 15 times.
[01:42:28.407 --> 01:42:29.207]  I want to get him back on.
[01:42:29.207 --> 01:42:30.548]  He speaks good English.
[01:42:30.548 --> 01:42:35.630]  Andres von Muelow was the German defense minister, then he was the head of their CIA.
[01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:38.371]  He wrote a 300-page book.
[01:42:38.371 --> 01:42:40.172]  I have had him on the show.
[01:42:40.172 --> 01:42:42.752]  And the headline is, The CIA Executed 9-11.
[01:42:42.752 --> 01:42:44.473]  That's what it translates into English.
[01:42:44.473 --> 01:42:46.074]  This is the head of the German CIA.
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.240]  And here's his quote.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.321]  And that is up on Infowars.com.
[01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:24.857]  And he actually, in the book, breaks down, and he said on the air, the entire German Defense Command and the entire German intelligence knew instantly there were bombs.
[01:43:24.857 --> 01:43:25.477]  Instantly.
[01:43:25.477 --> 01:43:27.739]  I mean, these aren't morons.
[01:43:27.739 --> 01:43:31.181]  They were all just standing there with their mouths hanging open.
[01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:37.905]  Then they saw the insider trading by the executive director of the CIA, Buzzy Krongaard, even came out in Der Spiegel.
[01:43:37.905 --> 01:43:39.406]  Because Germans went public.
[01:43:39.406 --> 01:43:41.688]  They went, this is a Reichstag event.
[01:43:42.628 --> 01:43:46.633]  I mean, Andres Trambillo, folks, guy's like 170 IQ.
[01:43:46.633 --> 01:43:51.119]  He wrote a book proving that it was an inside job, bare minimum.
[01:43:52.506 --> 01:43:58.190]  We know they put the hijackers on and the few air calls that actually got out said we can't breathe, there's gas, there's smoke.
[01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:09.919]  They nerve gassed the people, remote control took over, flew the planes into buildings, the hijackers were trained for drills to test airport security in a CIA Defense Department program.
[01:44:09.919 --> 01:44:14.102]  That's why if you're a cop or anybody else, don't be part of secret drills.
[01:44:14.102 --> 01:44:19.066]  Because they're getting ready to say cops and military are going to blow stuff up, that's the next deal.
[01:44:19.066 --> 01:44:20.346]  Nine times out of, you know,
[01:44:21.465 --> 01:44:22.086]  One time out of 100.
[01:44:22.086 --> 01:44:24.027]  One time out of 200.
[01:44:24.027 --> 01:44:26.209]  It'll be a real terror attack.
[01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:29.732]  So most of the time it's a real drill.
[01:44:29.732 --> 01:44:31.994]  But this is how they set people up.
[01:44:31.994 --> 01:44:34.136]  I want to go to Leanne McAdoo, Joe Biggs.
[01:44:34.136 --> 01:44:36.017]  We're going to get more from you.
[01:44:36.017 --> 01:44:39.721]  Probably if you've got more to report coming up during the special fourth hour.
[01:44:39.721 --> 01:44:40.962]  We're going to focus in on 9-11 today.
[01:44:40.962 --> 01:44:43.624]  I'm going to have open phones next hour.
[01:44:43.624 --> 01:44:45.746]  We're also going to get Jerome Corsi to pop in.
[01:44:46.346 --> 01:45:05.194]  on ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood and their original investigative reporting because I brought up to Colonel Schaffer yesterday that we know his cousin Odinga has been confirmed to be sending hundreds of millions out of Kenya just north to Egypt to overthrow that government.
[01:45:05.194 --> 01:45:11.836]  That's come out in trials and that they're connected in to the attacks on the shopping malls and stuff.
[01:45:11.836 --> 01:45:15.698]  So as this comes out, it's even more crazy than I thought it could be.
[01:45:17.588 --> 01:45:21.329]  Because usually presidents are puppets, and I've said Obama's a puppet.
[01:45:21.329 --> 01:45:28.710]  What do you think the real strategy is with Obama and his cousin trying to overthrow a U.S.
[01:45:28.710 --> 01:45:32.331]  ally that's done nothing to us like Egypt?
[01:45:32.331 --> 01:45:33.191]  His Skype just dropped.
[01:45:33.191 --> 01:45:36.332]  We're going to get him back and then get Leanne on.
[01:45:36.332 --> 01:45:43.513]  Again, I am just ranting here, ladies and gentlemen, and just going over the different angles of this, trying to figure out exactly what's going on.
[01:45:43.513 --> 01:45:46.294]  That's how we come to the answers and the conclusions that
[01:45:47.794 --> 01:45:49.935]  98% of the time turn out to be accurate.
[01:45:49.935 --> 01:45:52.077]  It's why we've made so many accurate predictions.
[01:45:52.077 --> 01:45:58.903]  It's why Japanese government listens, Russian government listens, Syrian government listens, our government listens.
[01:45:58.903 --> 01:46:04.088]  We're number one with the military, number one with the police now, just across the board.
[01:46:05.208 --> 01:46:07.670]  And it's because we aren't putting on airs.
[01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:09.351]  We're not reading off teleprompters.
[01:46:09.351 --> 01:46:10.872]  We're looking for the truth.
[01:46:10.872 --> 01:46:11.912]  And it's not simple.
[01:46:11.912 --> 01:46:13.313]  It's not a soundbite here.
[01:46:13.313 --> 01:46:14.374]  We get bad men.
[01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:15.915]  We bomb Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:15.915 --> 01:46:17.256]  And it's really Assad.
[01:46:17.256 --> 01:46:19.958]  There are no boots in ground.
[01:46:19.958 --> 01:46:22.900]  ISIS not part of Islam.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:29.404]  Joe, what do you make of him saying it's not part of Islam again and saying there's no boots on the ground as it's announced he's sending ground troops?
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.561]  I mean, that's the funniest part.
[01:46:32.561 --> 01:46:34.541]  Yeah, there's no troops, but we're sending troops.
[01:46:34.541 --> 01:46:37.222]  And we already said a while back that we send some as well.
[01:46:37.222 --> 01:46:44.685]  But yeah, that was one of the most interesting things that Obama said last night, is that ISIS is not of Islam.
[01:46:44.685 --> 01:46:54.168]  He said, because everyone's claiming this is a holy war, and that if that's the case, then Islam would have nothing to do with killing innocent Muslims.
[01:46:54.168 --> 01:46:56.629]  But the funny part is, though, he never once mentioned
[01:46:57.412 --> 01:47:02.738]  The thousands of Christians they, uh, you know, killed in Arabia, Iraq.
[01:47:02.738 --> 01:47:04.299]  He didn't say anything about that at all.
[01:47:04.299 --> 01:47:05.541]  I don't think he really cared about that.
[01:47:05.541 --> 01:47:10.146]  But that was a very interesting point that he's saying that they're not of Islam and they have nothing to do with that.
[01:47:10.146 --> 01:47:12.508]  Why won't our government ever talk about Christians getting killed?
[01:47:12.508 --> 01:47:15.832]  It's like Christians are used cat litter with this government.
[01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:19.351]  I mean, we're the new anti-everything.
[01:47:19.351 --> 01:47:23.812]  Anybody who is a Christian, who is a returning veteran, we're all terrorists.
[01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:25.113]  We're all being watched.
[01:47:25.113 --> 01:47:28.314]  You know, they're hacking into our equipment and our phones, our microwaves.
[01:47:28.314 --> 01:47:29.755]  It's just mind-blowing.
[01:47:29.755 --> 01:47:32.996]  This police state that we live in, and they want another war.
[01:47:32.996 --> 01:47:37.077]  They want to attack on American soil because we saw what happened in Ferguson.
[01:47:37.077 --> 01:47:44.620]  They can make that happen so quick and so intense to where you're told where you can be, where you can't go, what you can do, how you can look at somebody.
[01:47:46.041 --> 01:47:50.509]  It's crazy, and it gives me goosebumps just to think about that.
[01:47:50.509 --> 01:47:52.011]  I hate it.
[01:47:52.011 --> 01:47:56.198]  But the border is wide open, but illegals get to fly without IDs.
[01:47:56.198 --> 01:47:58.001]  That's confirmed three weeks ago.
[01:47:58.001 --> 01:47:59.323]  We already have seen that.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:03.041]  And Reid and Feinstein say that the boards are completely secure.
[01:48:03.041 --> 01:48:04.222]  There's nothing to worry about.
[01:48:04.222 --> 01:48:06.022]  They're the most secure they've ever been.
[01:48:06.022 --> 01:48:11.624]  It's funny though because every time I've been to the border I have literally been able to cross the border if I wanted to.
[01:48:11.624 --> 01:48:14.786]  And let's be very crystal clear about this.
[01:48:14.786 --> 01:48:17.847]  You're not out in the middle of nowhere crossing.
[01:48:17.847 --> 01:48:28.311]  You were in a park by downtown El Paso dressed as an Al Qaeda ISIS with an Al Qaeda flag and a sword and a fake severed head.
[01:48:29.071 --> 01:48:31.513]  Yeah, I saw the Mexican Border Patrol.
[01:48:31.513 --> 01:48:36.357]  They pulled up and they just pulled down a street on the Mexican side.
[01:48:36.357 --> 01:48:37.218]  They turn around and leave.
[01:48:37.218 --> 01:48:38.959]  They don't stop, get out and look around.
[01:48:38.959 --> 01:48:44.624]  You know, so anybody could literally just be sitting there waiting on them to drive up, turn around and then cross like we did.
[01:48:44.624 --> 01:48:47.947]  It's just patience.
[01:48:47.947 --> 01:48:48.787]  They have patience.
[01:48:49.574 --> 01:48:50.836]  And this is in El Paso.
[01:48:50.836 --> 01:48:55.521]  So all I'm saying is, don't take my rights saying you're keeping me safe.
[01:48:55.521 --> 01:48:57.784]  I'll take the threat of Al Qaeda that you armed.
[01:48:57.784 --> 01:48:59.867]  It's now becoming a real threat.
[01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.610]  And because I know the real target is my freedom.
[01:49:02.610 --> 01:49:05.974]  We're going to go to break and come back with two segments with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:49:05.974 --> 01:49:08.277]  And then I'm going to give the number out and take phone calls.
[01:49:08.277 --> 01:49:09.018]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[01:49:12.073 --> 01:49:14.314]  We're gonna go to break and come back with Leanne.
[01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:21.616]  Also, please remember that this hour is brought to you by all of the InfoWars Life products.

[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:44.801]  That has now become the number one bestseller we've ever had.
[01:49:44.801 --> 01:49:47.402]  Because, I mean, the pitch yesterday was so true.
[01:49:47.402 --> 01:49:52.043]  I went on this two weeks ago after them pushing me for months to try it.
[01:49:52.043 --> 01:49:53.983]  I'm like, take oxygen pills?
[01:49:53.983 --> 01:49:56.884]  I finally did and it is incredible.
[01:49:56.884 --> 01:49:59.584]  This will flush you out like nothing you've ever imagined.
[01:49:59.584 --> 01:50:01.785]  I mean, I can just say it will because it does.
[01:50:03.206 --> 01:50:03.546]  I mean, this
[01:50:22.645 --> 01:50:24.987]  Quantum Leap flushing me out.
[01:50:24.987 --> 01:50:35.073]  So Oxy Powder, very simple name, very powerful concept, proprietary, so that it releases in your intestines, not in your stomach, and just pushes everything out.
[01:50:36.001 --> 01:50:38.523]  I mean, you think you've done some kind of other cleanse before?
[01:50:38.523 --> 01:50:40.225]  You've taken a bunch of salad?
[01:50:40.225 --> 01:50:40.785]  No, no.
[01:50:40.785 --> 01:50:41.946]  This is completely different.
[01:50:41.946 --> 01:50:45.649]  The oxygen literally eats through all the garbage.

[01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:01.994]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:52:01.994 --> 01:52:03.636]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:52:03.636 --> 01:52:06.478]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:52:06.478 --> 01:52:08.760]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:13.284]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:52:59.192 --> 01:53:00.573]  I'm 52 years old.
[01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:04.515]  I've tried different protein powders over the years, and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:53:04.515 --> 01:53:06.897]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:53:06.897 --> 01:53:09.378]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented,
[01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:30.952]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:53:30.952 --> 01:53:34.873]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:53:34.873 --> 01:53:36.373]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:53:36.373 --> 01:53:38.234]  One World Whey comes in single serving.

[01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:27.313]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps rollin' On down to San Antonio
[01:54:30.926 --> 01:54:35.107]  Johnny Cash bringing us in.
[01:54:35.107 --> 01:54:38.168]  Leanne McAdoo is in New York City.
[01:54:38.168 --> 01:54:43.390]  Leanne, you guys have been filing a lot of powerful reports for the Nightly News and Infowars.com.
[01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:45.090]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:54:45.090 --> 01:54:50.052]  What hits you 13 years later, being so close to that horrific scene?
[01:54:50.052 --> 01:54:56.094]  I'm just glad there hadn't been a terror attack in the last few days or today, like Homeland Security said was imminent.
[01:54:56.094 --> 01:54:57.334]  Do you think that was more fear-mongering?
[01:54:58.969 --> 01:55:08.793]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com, standing here outside One World Trade Center, the site of where the worst terror attack on the country has ever happened.
[01:55:08.793 --> 01:55:21.417]  And yes, Alex, I am very excited and very happy that we have not been the victims of this latest terror threat that Homeland Security is kind of backtracking, saying, no, there's not a threat, but there is a threat.
[01:55:21.417 --> 01:55:25.619]  Are you feeling safer, though, that we're going to arm the al-Qaeda rebels to fight al-Qaeda?
[01:55:26.681 --> 01:55:28.764]  I think that's an excellent choice by the president.
[01:55:28.764 --> 01:55:35.693]  They're on this weird time loop of every single year arming the very people that they're going to go to war with about a year later.
[01:55:35.693 --> 01:55:36.374]  So it makes sense.
[01:55:36.374 --> 01:55:39.798]  I guess they just want to make sure that they're on even ground with the weaponry.
[01:55:41.144 --> 01:55:43.386]  It's almost like a Rolex-Swiss movement.
[01:55:43.386 --> 01:55:44.947]  It's so exact.
[01:55:44.947 --> 01:55:47.689]  But I don't expect them to actually really attack ISIS.
[01:55:47.689 --> 01:55:55.674]  They'll probably just attack Assad and then have like a South Park-style puppet get up there and say, I'm Assad, I'm Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:55.674 --> 01:55:58.376]  And I guess the American people will buy it, Leigh-Anne.
[01:55:58.376 --> 01:55:59.157]  Right, absolutely.
[01:55:59.157 --> 01:56:03.219]  Well, that's this gaslighting from this administration.
[01:56:03.219 --> 01:56:09.524]  It's infuriating when the president comes out last night and says, one thing I want to be clear on.
[01:56:09.986 --> 01:56:12.970]  Islamic State is not Islam.
[01:56:12.970 --> 01:56:16.154]  I mean, why with all of the political correctness?
[01:56:16.154 --> 01:56:17.676]  What is that helping?
[01:56:17.676 --> 01:56:19.538]  That is going to get people killed.
[01:56:19.538 --> 01:56:23.864]  These people believe that they are the ultimate version of Islam.
[01:56:23.864 --> 01:56:26.788]  They're going to slaughter the blood and spill the blood of
[01:56:27.428 --> 01:56:31.351]  All Americans in the world until they get the world under Sharia law.
[01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:35.335]  So here are people that think that they are the ultimate version of Islam.
[01:56:35.335 --> 01:56:44.322]  So if you have some Muslims out there who are maybe, you know, searching for the truth or they want to take it a step further and then they're hearing these mixed messages of
[01:56:44.782 --> 01:56:51.587]  You know, people converting to Islam and going and joining these jihadi movements because that's the ultimate sacrifice to Allah.
[01:56:51.587 --> 01:56:54.369]  Like, that's a confusing message to send to people.
[01:56:54.369 --> 01:56:59.552]  People are literally going and joining these people and sacrificing their lives.
[01:56:59.552 --> 01:57:02.254]  And the British government lets them fly back and forth.
[01:57:02.254 --> 01:57:03.855]  This is all sanctioned by the West.
[01:57:04.448 --> 01:57:17.732]  And then they're going to use these people when they come back and blow stuff up to take Lee and McAdoo's liberties, Alex Jones's liberties, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs' liberties, you know, John Gonzalez's liberties, that's just John Doe.
[01:57:17.732 --> 01:57:19.772]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:57:19.772 --> 01:57:25.254]  Right, and we're not allowed to talk about it because then that makes us racist, makes us insensitive, or we're bigots.
[01:57:25.254 --> 01:57:30.335]  You know, the only people that we can think of as a terror threat are returning veterans and patriots.
[01:57:31.178 --> 01:57:33.600]  And people that are pro-life.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.781]  These are the real terrorists.
[01:57:35.781 --> 01:57:37.602]  That's what political correctness is.
[01:57:37.602 --> 01:57:38.923]  It's simply amazing.
[01:57:38.923 --> 01:57:40.284]  You guys have filed a bunch of reports.
[01:57:40.284 --> 01:57:42.405]  I saw some of them last night and this morning.
[01:57:42.405 --> 01:57:44.026]  What else have you been working on?
[01:57:44.026 --> 01:57:47.748]  What else is coming up for people that are going to see the nightly news?
[01:57:47.748 --> 01:57:49.810]  Well, we're headed back over to Times Square.
[01:57:49.810 --> 01:57:53.252]  We're supposed to be speaking with the Batman.
[01:57:53.252 --> 01:57:59.936]  He was very heated about the fact that the city is trying to make them remove their masks because
[01:58:00.489 --> 01:58:00.869]  Absolutely.
[01:58:22.276 --> 01:58:29.020]  One World Trade Center, where obviously the symbology is where the two towers fell and then merged into one.
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:31.362]  And they have that new building that looks like a giant pyramid.
[01:58:31.362 --> 01:58:34.163]  If you look at it, the whole face of it's really a big pyramid.
[01:58:34.163 --> 01:58:38.026]  I've never really noticed that in photos, but when you look at the video, you can see it.
[01:58:38.026 --> 01:58:39.647]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:39.647 --> 01:58:41.248]  Look at that, it goes right up.
[01:58:41.248 --> 01:58:44.129]  It's like two pyramids with another pyramid inverted.
[01:58:44.129 --> 01:58:47.251]  Looks like something Amber Palpatine would live in.
[01:58:47.251 --> 01:58:47.972]  You got the new building, 7.
[01:58:49.798 --> 01:58:53.941]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[01:58:53.941 --> 01:58:58.464]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:58:58.464 --> 01:59:04.988]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:59:04.988 --> 01:59:08.991]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:59:08.991 --> 01:59:10.652]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:59:10.652 --> 01:59:14.635]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[01:59:14.795 --> 01:59:23.477]  Infowars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:59:23.477 --> 01:59:31.559]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[01:59:31.559 --> 01:59:35.240]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:41.021]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at
[01:59:41.201 --> 01:59:45.426]  Infowarslight.com, Infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:45.426 --> 01:59:54.956]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.956 --> 01:59:57.780]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.578 --> 02:00:10.421]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.421 --> 02:00:12.002]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.002 --> 02:00:13.542]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.542 --> 02:00:17.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.745 --> 02:00:21.827]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:37.482]  Leanne McAdoo, we're going to write an article about it probably tomorrow or tonight.
[02:00:37.482 --> 02:00:40.603]  The video is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:00:40.603 --> 02:00:47.406]  Retired Lieutenant Colonel reveals secrets of the 28-page 9-11 report.
[02:00:47.406 --> 02:00:56.649]  CIA-trained intelligence officer confirms InfoWars analysis that it's covering up for Saudi Arabia.
[02:00:56.649 --> 02:01:00.931]  That's a great headline, but it should probably be Insider confirms
[02:01:03.562 --> 02:01:06.604]  9-11 report.
[02:01:06.604 --> 02:01:07.745]  Trying to get the exact headline.
[02:01:07.745 --> 02:01:15.811]  See, this broadcast is so transparent that we're actually here on air conducting this behind-the-scenes stuff live because there's no other way to do it.
[02:01:15.811 --> 02:01:23.957]  I mean, how do you take something that big and then put it into a headline?
[02:01:23.957 --> 02:01:29.601]  That an insider who was on Capitol Hill, who's talked to the sources, confirmed that the 28-page report
[02:01:32.312 --> 02:01:42.155]  That's being redacted and suppressed confirms that Saudi Arabia was involved and our government knew.
[02:01:42.155 --> 02:01:43.316]  Insider reveals U.S.
[02:01:43.316 --> 02:01:46.397]  government covering up truth of 9-11 report?
[02:01:46.397 --> 02:01:47.537]  I don't know.
[02:01:47.537 --> 02:01:53.179]  I guess retired Lieutenant Colonel reveals secrets of 28-page 9-11 report is a pretty good headline.
[02:01:54.872 --> 02:01:55.912]  Look at these other articles.
[02:01:55.912 --> 02:02:00.795]  TSA demands to conduct full-body pat-down on man after his plane already landed.
[02:02:00.795 --> 02:02:09.098]  San Diego school police given mine-resistant military vehicle by Pentagon to police the school.
[02:02:09.098 --> 02:02:11.859]  ISIS threat to America a farce.
[02:02:11.859 --> 02:02:18.222]  I don't know if I agree with that headline, but I do agree that it's a threat because they manufactured it, but then it becomes a real threat.
[02:02:20.114 --> 02:02:21.114]  That's a Curt Nemo article.
[02:02:21.114 --> 02:02:22.394]  I haven't read it yet, but I'm going to.
[02:02:22.394 --> 02:02:23.255]  I'm sure I agree with him.
[02:02:23.255 --> 02:02:29.136]  Curt's a pretty smart fellow, but it's lurid propaganda campaign stampede public into accepting another war.
[02:02:29.136 --> 02:02:31.116]  Well, that's certainly accurate.
[02:02:31.116 --> 02:02:34.177]  Let's go ahead and go back to Leanne McAdoo.
[02:02:34.177 --> 02:02:43.979]  Leanne, so you're going to go up and basically just, I guess, show the police state that's been set up since 9-11 that's pointed at cartoon characters, not at ISIS.
[02:02:43.979 --> 02:02:44.399]  Exactly.
[02:02:44.399 --> 02:02:45.619]  But that's kind of the thing.
[02:02:45.619 --> 02:02:48.500]  We don't know if they are ISIS because they've all got masks on.
[02:02:49.179 --> 02:02:50.941]  That's the big problem there.
[02:02:50.941 --> 02:02:54.705]  They're allowed to wear masks, but people at the protests are not.
[02:02:54.705 --> 02:03:00.130]  Because people that have their mind on freedom and liberty, they're terrorists.
[02:03:00.130 --> 02:03:05.876]  So we're actually out here now, and this police state is blatant all around us.
[02:03:05.876 --> 02:03:07.758]  They've got it all blocked off.
[02:03:07.758 --> 02:03:09.820]  And one of the things that's really upsetting to me
[02:03:10.512 --> 02:03:21.475]  Because here on the anniversary of 9-11, the things that have always brought me to tears are seeing men and women in uniform willing to sacrifice their lives for me.
[02:03:21.475 --> 02:03:33.398]  Now granted, we know there are definitely some bad apples in the bunch, but there are some really good... But still, there's the archetypal issue of the warriors defending us, and now they're not allowed in the ceremony.
[02:03:33.398 --> 02:03:35.058]  Except for a few hand-picked for television.
[02:03:35.816 --> 02:03:42.998]  Well, the thing that was just so upsetting, Alex, is you see them and they're just dressed in their finest suits today and...
[02:03:43.999 --> 02:03:57.069]  Down this hallway, tucked in an alleyway, outside of the Ceremonial Plaza, they have a tiny little section where the first responders are having their own ceremony right here.
[02:03:57.069 --> 02:04:01.733]  We tried to see if we could get a little bit of a signal there and we weren't able to, but it was just so touching.
[02:04:01.733 --> 02:04:07.357]  They have all of the doors and the things that were destroyed there, a little bit of a wreckage to just kind of
[02:04:07.777 --> 02:04:09.338]  Give a ceremony for themselves.
[02:04:09.338 --> 02:04:14.420]  Why are the first responders once again this year not allowed inside the ceremony?
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:16.301]  They lost people that day as well.
[02:04:16.301 --> 02:04:20.664]  Well that's because there were nothing but a prop the whole time to sell the end of America.
[02:04:20.664 --> 02:04:24.646]  To sell the police state on the backs of their valiant efforts.
[02:04:24.646 --> 02:04:25.126]  That's why.
[02:04:25.586 --> 02:04:29.328]  And now they want to hide them like the World War I bonus marchers.
[02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:32.049]  They just want to shovel them into their political graves.
[02:04:32.049 --> 02:04:33.349]  That's what's happening.
[02:04:33.349 --> 02:04:47.475]  Leanne, I know you've got more reports coming on the Nightly News, and I know you guys have got more breaking coming up, so we may be talking to you guys coming up in the fourth hour today, a special fourth hour that some stations carry.
[02:04:47.475 --> 02:04:50.456]  It will be live on PrisonPlanet.tv out of the new studio.
[02:04:50.456 --> 02:04:51.517]  Thank you so much, Leanne.
[02:04:52.097 --> 02:04:53.018]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:53.018 --> 02:04:55.481]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:55.481 --> 02:04:56.723]  I'll give the number out.
[02:04:56.723 --> 02:04:58.545]  I'll take your phone calls and get your take.
[02:04:59.969 --> 02:05:01.230]  Another major health threat.
[02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:06.212]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:05:06.212 --> 02:05:08.873]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:05:08.873 --> 02:05:15.916]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:05:15.916 --> 02:05:18.917]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:05:18.917 --> 02:05:21.858]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:05:21.858 --> 02:05:23.879]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:05:23.879 --> 02:05:26.740]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:32.522]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:05:32.522 --> 02:05:36.043]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:05:36.043 --> 02:05:39.124]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:06:34.224 --> 02:06:38.989]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:06:38.989 --> 02:06:39.990]  Talk about the effects.
[02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:41.812]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:06:41.812 --> 02:06:43.734]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:06:43.734 --> 02:06:44.855]  I feel like I look better.
[02:06:44.855 --> 02:06:45.576]  I feel better.
[02:06:45.576 --> 02:06:46.617]  I feel sexier.
[02:06:46.617 --> 02:06:47.599]  I love it.

[02:06:58.130 --> 02:06:59.511]  This is life-changing.
[02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:03.634]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[02:07:03.634 --> 02:07:08.178]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.

[02:07:50.865 --> 02:07:54.166]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:22.819 --> 02:08:40.513]  I'm gonna open the phones up.
[02:08:40.513 --> 02:08:43.715]  I'd specifically like to hear from listeners.
[02:08:43.715 --> 02:08:46.377]  Because this is so open.
[02:08:46.377 --> 02:08:47.118]  So evil.
[02:08:47.118 --> 02:08:47.879]  So bizarre.
[02:08:49.005 --> 02:08:55.148]  That I can't even figure out exactly what's going on.
[02:08:55.148 --> 02:09:06.414]  Al-Qaeda is double-crossing NATO and Obama and attacking Jordan and Kurdistan when they're not supposed to in the deal they have with the Pentagon.
[02:09:06.414 --> 02:09:12.437]  That right there though, that our own government's been arming Al-Qaeda all over the Middle East for four years publicly, they should all be going to prison.
[02:09:18.271 --> 02:09:34.448]  But it's the attempt now to say we're going to fight the rebels by arming the rebels, when 90 plus percent of the rebels, I was saying 65, Colonel Schaffer said no, from classified documents, I can't say the exact number, it's way higher than that.
[02:09:34.448 --> 02:09:38.672]  And then I made some phone calls and things and they say it's about 95 percent.
[02:09:40.498 --> 02:09:41.238]  Which makes sense.
[02:09:41.238 --> 02:09:42.759]  I mean, that's who's out there fighting.
[02:09:42.759 --> 02:09:44.600]  That's what's on all the videos.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.461]  That's who the groups are.
[02:09:46.461 --> 02:09:49.603]  That's what the Muslim Brotherhood is, is a front for them.
[02:09:49.603 --> 02:09:52.064]  Saudi Arabia's involved.
[02:09:52.064 --> 02:09:59.748]  And this is a big deal because if they let them establish a state, they will try to attack Western targets.
[02:09:59.748 --> 02:10:02.489]  And the establishment will then use that to take our freedoms.
[02:10:02.489 --> 02:10:05.051]  That's why this is such a big deal.
[02:10:05.051 --> 02:10:08.492]  Thirteen years later, on the anniversary of 9-11, on the eve of it,
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:16.442]  Last night, Obama says, Islamic State is not Islamic, we will have no boots on the ground, but we're going to start bombing them wherever they are.
[02:10:16.442 --> 02:10:18.342]  That's an excuse to attack any country they want.
[02:10:18.342 --> 02:10:23.463]  In Africa, you name it, where these people, they funded and turned looser running around.
[02:10:23.463 --> 02:10:29.405]  That is such an evil, beyond Machiavellian strategy.
[02:10:29.405 --> 02:10:31.745]  And I don't see how they're going to get away with it.
[02:10:31.745 --> 02:10:32.765]  Here's the toll-free number.
[02:10:32.765 --> 02:10:32.825]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:32.825 --> 02:10:32.865]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:42.028 --> 02:10:44.589]  The story is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:48.071]  It originates from Infowars.com video.
[02:10:48.071 --> 02:10:55.975]  TSA demands to conduct full-body pat-down on man after his plane already landed.
[02:10:55.975 --> 02:11:01.297]  And I'll get to this in the fourth hour today, because I've got Jerome Corsi coming up at some of your phone calls.
[02:11:01.297 --> 02:11:06.920]  Dr. Corsi, who is the expert on what's happening, and who predicted everything now unfolding.
[02:11:07.833 --> 02:11:15.555]  Two years ago, he said Obama's funding some secret jihad takeover of the Middle East and Africa, and that he's going to use the attacks to take freedom here.
[02:11:15.555 --> 02:11:18.336]  And I was just like, man, this is just too much.
[02:11:18.336 --> 02:11:23.897]  Of course, he worked in the State Department and other classified areas.
[02:11:23.897 --> 02:11:26.457]  There's a lot more to Jerome Corsi than meets the eye, I'll just say that.
[02:11:29.991 --> 02:11:36.096]  We're going to be talking to him coming up to get his breakdown on all this, but I can just feel in my gut this is the start of something big.
[02:11:36.096 --> 02:11:41.119]  It's a proxy war against Russia, and I just don't want to destroy the planet.
[02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:49.506]  And even the London Telegraph has an article out today, The West Faced the Russian Wolf and the West Backed Down.
[02:11:49.506 --> 02:11:52.708]  I'm paraphrasing the headline, but I read it this morning.
[02:11:52.708 --> 02:11:53.389]  It's here in the stack.
[02:11:55.418 --> 02:11:55.818]  There it is.
[02:11:55.818 --> 02:11:57.918]  It's time to back away from the Russian wolf.
[02:11:57.918 --> 02:12:07.200]  Russia's President Vladimir Putin won't be thwarted by NATO or economic sanctions and his aim of a neutral Ukraine is acceptable.
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:11.381]  And then it goes on to say we went and faced the wolf and had to back down.
[02:12:11.381 --> 02:12:13.821]  And here's that news today.
[02:12:13.821 --> 02:12:18.582]  Russia successfully tests nuclear missile more planned Navy Chief Reuters.
[02:12:18.582 --> 02:12:21.523]  AP, Russian gas supplies to Poland drop further.
[02:12:23.359 --> 02:12:26.081]  Deliveries have dropped through the pipes 45%.
[02:12:26.081 --> 02:12:29.203]  They sell the cheapest gas in the world.
[02:12:29.203 --> 02:12:35.127]  Western oil companies have openly said they want to cut off their gas because they could then gouge Europe.
[02:12:35.127 --> 02:12:40.231]  I mean, Russia's allowed to sell their gas, folks.
[02:12:40.231 --> 02:12:42.012]  Just like we're allowed to have coal power plants.
[02:12:42.012 --> 02:12:46.075]  Just like we're allowed to have businesses and have kids and raise them like we want.
[02:12:46.075 --> 02:12:49.317]  The globalists want to run everybody's life.
[02:12:49.317 --> 02:12:50.618]  They're as bad as it gets!
[02:12:53.083 --> 02:12:58.044]  They're the ones that run America, not the Russians!
[02:12:58.044 --> 02:13:02.265]  I would hate the Russians if they tried one-tenth of what the globalists do.
[02:13:02.265 --> 02:13:07.526]  Can you imagine if the Russians were trying to take our guns and open our borders and saying our kids didn't belong to us?
[02:13:07.526 --> 02:13:13.547]  Imagine if on Russian TV they were saying, kids belong to the state, not their parents, like MSNBC in official promo.
[02:13:13.547 --> 02:13:17.108]  We'd go, man, those Russians are evil!
[02:13:17.108 --> 02:13:19.128]  Our leadership is a bunch of criminals!
[02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:23.290]  That's an understatement!
[02:13:23.290 --> 02:13:23.771]  Ugh!
[02:13:23.771 --> 02:13:26.751]  Sick of it!
[02:13:26.751 --> 02:13:28.292]  That's why people are starting to freak out.
[02:13:28.292 --> 02:13:30.653]  Russia is not going to back down, folks.
[02:13:30.653 --> 02:13:32.693]  It's not going to happen.
[02:13:32.693 --> 02:13:35.534]  The Russians are double stubborn.
[02:13:35.534 --> 02:13:39.275]  Beyond a mule.
[02:13:39.275 --> 02:13:42.736]  You could call it the Russian Bubba Effect.
[02:13:42.736 --> 02:13:44.576]  The more you push them, the more they dig in.
[02:13:44.576 --> 02:13:48.658]  They don't quit drinking vodka and don't get anything done until you mess with them.
[02:13:48.658 --> 02:13:50.098]  Then it's like an anthill comes out.
[02:13:51.698 --> 02:13:54.519]  They'll develop a bunch of secret weapons and stuff.
[02:13:54.519 --> 02:13:55.619]  Russians are smart folks.
[02:13:55.619 --> 02:13:57.099]  They got very high IQs.
[02:13:57.099 --> 02:14:00.060]  Some of the highest in the world.
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:03.241]  And the globalists just think they're like Syria or Iraq.
[02:14:03.241 --> 02:14:08.722]  They can just kick them around all day and try to overthrow them with George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[02:14:08.722 --> 02:14:10.723]  By the way, the Russians are scared of us.
[02:14:10.723 --> 02:14:13.764]  They know how crazy our leaders are.
[02:14:13.764 --> 02:14:16.364]  They are completely freaked out building bunkers.
[02:14:16.364 --> 02:14:19.165]  And again, I'm not lionizing the Russian predatory state.
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:25.560]  I got a bunch of other news.
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:28.682]  I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[02:14:28.682 --> 02:14:29.943]  There are no boots on the ground.
[02:14:29.943 --> 02:14:41.969]  There will be no boots on the ground when he ordered a thousand cent there two weeks ago and 400 got AP right here 475 today.
[02:14:41.969 --> 02:14:45.411]  Embedded with the rebels.
[02:14:45.411 --> 02:14:50.454]  No boots on the ground.
[02:14:50.454 --> 02:14:51.475]  You didn't build your business.
[02:14:56.212 --> 02:14:58.933]  Obamacare cuts your pro... It's all lies!
[02:14:58.933 --> 02:15:00.294]  It's all lies!
[02:15:00.294 --> 02:15:03.695]  Bloomberg came out a few months ago and said, I'm the biggest Second Amendment supporter in the world.
[02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.816]  I don't want to take your guns.
[02:15:05.816 --> 02:15:07.577]  They banned guns in New York City.
[02:15:07.577 --> 02:15:08.557]  He wants to gun ban.
[02:15:08.557 --> 02:15:09.498]  They're liars!
[02:15:09.498 --> 02:15:15.960]  But I don't understand why they... They lie so much!
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.001]  What is the point of it?
[02:15:17.001 --> 02:15:20.162]  Why do we put up with it?
[02:15:20.162 --> 02:15:22.703]  They have a method of this to just shut us down.
[02:15:22.703 --> 02:15:23.844]  To condition us.
[02:15:25.984 --> 02:15:27.404]  To where we'll put up with anything.
[02:15:27.404 --> 02:15:29.145]  They're getting us ready for something big.
[02:15:29.145 --> 02:15:31.605]  That's why I'm getting freaked out here.
[02:15:31.605 --> 02:15:37.006]  They're acting like they don't care how bad they are, that nothing can stop them.
[02:15:37.006 --> 02:15:46.148]  And I don't know if that's because they're crazy completely and out of their minds like crazy people I've known in business and life.
[02:15:46.148 --> 02:15:49.168]  Or whether they got some trick up their sleeve or both.
[02:15:49.168 --> 02:15:51.409]  I mean, it's just so dangerous, people.
[02:15:54.375 --> 02:15:58.276]  All the top analysts say the world is in the most dangerous position now it's ever been in.
[02:15:58.276 --> 02:15:59.936]  And you can feel it.
[02:15:59.936 --> 02:16:03.377]  Not just intellectually, or militarily, or geopolitically look at it.
[02:16:03.377 --> 02:16:05.057]  You can feel it.
[02:16:05.057 --> 02:16:06.878]  And it's because we got demons in charge.
[02:16:06.878 --> 02:16:08.318]  And it's a lot bigger than Obama.
[02:16:08.318 --> 02:16:10.098]  Let's go to Patrick in Kentucky.
[02:16:10.098 --> 02:16:11.219]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:11.219 --> 02:16:17.120]  Hey Patrick, I don't get any audio from you.
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:17.960]  You gonna talk to us, brother?
[02:16:19.028 --> 02:16:23.533]  Yeah, so as you can talk about the GCHQ program, Squeaky Dolphin.
[02:16:23.533 --> 02:16:25.675]  Yeah, that's the British version of the NSA.
[02:16:25.675 --> 02:16:26.916]  Yep.
[02:16:26.916 --> 02:16:27.417]  Yep.
[02:16:27.417 --> 02:16:35.765]  And then in the NSA, they've got contact training where they can go three hops to see communications amongst people.
[02:16:35.765 --> 02:16:39.089]  So between those two programs, they can keep their
[02:16:40.236 --> 02:16:41.596]  They can understand though.
[02:16:41.596 --> 02:16:46.757]  They know the entire network of all the jihadi groups because they run most of them.
[02:16:46.757 --> 02:16:48.298]  Yes, yes, they know.
[02:16:48.298 --> 02:16:50.238]  They could have stopped 9-11.
[02:16:50.238 --> 02:16:51.298]  All of this stuff.
[02:16:51.298 --> 02:16:52.238]  It's pure bull.
[02:16:52.238 --> 02:16:53.979]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:16:53.979 --> 02:16:56.479]  They also know the opinions of the general public.
[02:16:56.479 --> 02:17:02.120]  So if this seems like a flimsy case for war, they have their finger on the pulse of the planet.
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:05.781]  And they know exactly how to proceed, what messaging to use.
[02:17:06.325 --> 02:17:08.026]  In order to achieve their end goals.
[02:17:32.242 --> 02:17:33.184]  For their lies.
[02:17:33.184 --> 02:17:35.628]  They now have the nuclear option of lies.
[02:17:35.628 --> 02:17:38.392]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:38.392 --> 02:17:39.634]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:39.634 --> 02:17:45.184]  They have, when people talk about metadata and that they downplay that as it's not important.
[02:17:45.891 --> 02:18:09.840]  You can actually map out the interactions of people all over the planet, and you know exactly sentiment and opinions, likes, dislikes, all of that is aggregated, and it's available in simple dashboard formats so that executives can see exactly how their messaging is going, how people are reacting, and if it seems like this is a half-baked strategy,
[02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:17.993]  It might be because it is, because they just have to improvise and react to what their analysts tell them is the attitude.
[02:18:17.993 --> 02:18:24.675]  I was about to say, just because 60% of the American people are in a coma doesn't mean they can start a nuclear war with Russia.
[02:18:24.675 --> 02:18:27.076]  It doesn't suspend the laws of physics.
[02:18:27.076 --> 02:18:31.958]  It doesn't mean that morally it will come out later that they funded Al-Qaeda.
[02:18:31.958 --> 02:18:35.600]  They're not going to get away with this new lie and they lose more credibility.
[02:18:36.713 --> 02:18:38.275]  Each time they do this.
[02:18:38.275 --> 02:18:50.792]  So if they're looking at the algorithms currently, they can see the bigger algorithm that I can look at just analyzing it daily with my electrochemical computer between my ears and see that they're losing credibility
[02:18:51.693 --> 02:18:54.355]  That's why I'm saying it's such a dangerous strategy.
[02:18:54.355 --> 02:18:57.557]  This is how I would destroy Western power.
[02:18:57.557 --> 02:19:01.300]  This is how I would bring down the West, what they're doing right now.
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:05.543]  Just openly losing the moral high ground, bleeding out in front of everyone.
[02:19:05.543 --> 02:19:07.605]  What do you think the grand strategy is?
[02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:18.533]  It's really, in the endgame, to take over the world using Western muscle, then demonize us in the process, bring us down for the formation of the world government on its ashes.
[02:19:20.639 --> 02:19:21.540]  I think so.
[02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:30.844]  I would speculate a more concrete plan underneath that is that the petrodollar has to remain dominant.
[02:19:30.844 --> 02:19:37.987]  And so I think that's part of the end objective here is to make sure that we don't lose the status of the U.S.
[02:19:37.987 --> 02:19:40.988]  dollar as a reserve currency.
[02:19:41.917 --> 02:19:44.478]  And that's why we're in bed with the Middle East, right?
[02:19:44.478 --> 02:19:51.640]  These people over there, that's our ticket to make sure that oil backs up the dollar since it got rid of the gold standard.
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:57.042]  Yes, you're right, but then it's schizophrenic because they carry out policies that actually destroy the dollar.
[02:19:57.042 --> 02:19:57.482]  It's incredible.
[02:19:59.995 --> 02:20:02.717]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:02.717 --> 02:20:07.019]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:07.019 --> 02:20:08.420]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:11.081]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:11.081 --> 02:20:14.083]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:20:14.083 --> 02:20:16.445]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:20:16.445 --> 02:20:18.346]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:18.346 --> 02:20:23.909]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:23.909 --> 02:20:27.171]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:27.691 --> 02:20:29.492]  That's silverlungs.com.
[02:20:29.492 --> 02:20:38.794]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:38.794 --> 02:20:39.595]  This capitalism?
[02:20:39.595 --> 02:20:45.756]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:45.756 --> 02:20:49.438]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:20:49.438 --> 02:20:50.398]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:20:50.398 --> 02:20:51.458]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:20:51.458 --> 02:20:52.098]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:52.098 --> 02:20:52.378]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:59.121 --> 02:21:06.263]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:21:06.263 --> 02:21:08.624]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:21:08.624 --> 02:21:13.886]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:21:13.886 --> 02:21:18.848]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:21:19.068 --> 02:21:22.410]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:26.453]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:21:26.453 --> 02:21:30.755]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:21:30.755 --> 02:21:41.002]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:21:41.002 --> 02:21:47.806]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here.
[02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:51.909]  A convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:21:58.632 --> 02:22:01.534]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[02:22:01.534 --> 02:22:05.076]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:22:05.076 --> 02:22:07.238]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[02:22:07.238 --> 02:22:16.544]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[02:22:16.544 --> 02:22:22.528]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[02:23:28.064 --> 02:23:31.165]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[02:23:31.165 --> 02:23:32.946]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[02:23:32.946 --> 02:23:35.387]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[02:23:35.387 --> 02:23:36.988]  And your rights are at risk.
[02:23:36.988 --> 02:23:38.929]  If passed, H.R.
[02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:41.350]  5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[02:23:41.350 --> 02:23:43.530]  KD Armor is standing up for you.

[02:23:55.996 --> 02:23:56.856]  Come and take it.
[02:24:03.203 --> 02:24:05.624]  I wouldn't even call it being speechless.
[02:24:05.624 --> 02:24:06.444]  It's beyond that.
[02:24:06.444 --> 02:24:08.905]  When I start gibbering, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:08.905 --> 02:24:10.605]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:24:10.605 --> 02:24:26.930]  My brain just can't get around this because I'm informed on the basics that our government is so criminal that the borders are wide open, that citizens are being harassed when they get on airplanes, but the illegals can fly without IDs.
[02:24:28.266 --> 02:24:30.008]  It's clearly a criminal takeover.
[02:24:30.008 --> 02:24:33.230]  Anybody can see that.
[02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:36.853]  And even if people are awake, they just have this attitude of fatalism.
[02:24:36.853 --> 02:24:37.914]  What are you going to do about it?
[02:24:37.914 --> 02:24:41.617]  Let's just go along with it.
[02:24:41.617 --> 02:24:47.982]  But Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny you live under is the exact level you'll put up with.
[02:24:47.982 --> 02:24:53.967]  So you understand the sky is the limit because we don't have any limits.
[02:24:53.967 --> 02:24:55.008]  We'll put up with anything.
[02:24:59.437 --> 02:25:14.163]  And it's seen as abnormal to be freaked out about Obama just up there on TV lying at levels that make Bill Clinton look like a saint.
[02:25:14.163 --> 02:25:15.643]  It's just a wall of lies.
[02:25:15.643 --> 02:25:17.284]  How do you even respond to it?
[02:25:17.284 --> 02:25:18.525]  I see the grand strategy.
[02:25:18.525 --> 02:25:24.047]  It's just completely set the precedent where everything is turned upside down and 2 plus 2 equals 7.
[02:25:25.845 --> 02:25:27.226]  Just whatever they want it to.
[02:25:27.226 --> 02:25:30.087]  I know I keep talking about that and harping on it.
[02:25:30.087 --> 02:25:32.248]  It's because that's what it is.
[02:25:32.248 --> 02:25:34.009]  It's just, we're here.
[02:25:34.009 --> 02:25:36.530]  It's such a joke.
[02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:37.990]  Everyone is in peril.
[02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:40.831]  We're all in danger.
[02:25:40.831 --> 02:25:46.994]  Richard in Arizona, you want to talk about Ebola, the Cali drought, and more, that's fine.
[02:25:46.994 --> 02:25:50.956]  I'm more than happy to do that, but I wanted to, when I open the phones up, I don't really screen calls.
[02:25:51.974 --> 02:25:54.636]  Sorry Alex, I don't mean to be off topic here.
[02:25:54.636 --> 02:25:56.998]  I've been trying to reach you on this for a long time.
[02:25:56.998 --> 02:25:58.519]  Thank you.
[02:25:58.519 --> 02:25:59.861]  I really appreciate you.
[02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:00.761]  Let me just say that
[02:26:19.975 --> 02:26:31.840]  I know you don't need more work to do, more to cover, but I have to mention two stories that are being totally covered up and ignored by all the media that I've seen so far and that are really critical.
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:32.681]  Two topics.
[02:26:32.681 --> 02:26:43.546]  One is Ebola, and the thing about Ebola is that the government has already proven a substance that will kill it in their own studies.
[02:26:43.546 --> 02:26:48.688]  And they're not only covering it up, but they're blocking private shipments of this material to Africa.
[02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:56.516]  And it's clear that the reason they're doing that is so that the planned epidemic can run its course.
[02:26:56.516 --> 02:27:01.260]  Well, I know that it's about 93% death if you don't get the right medical treatment.
[02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:10.228]  What, 50% is fatal, generally, from what I've read, if you don't get proper hospital attention.
[02:27:10.228 --> 02:27:12.149]  So there's a lot of things that mitigate it.
[02:27:12.149 --> 02:27:13.671]  Are you saying there's a cure for Ebola?
[02:27:15.055 --> 02:27:16.417]  Uh, not exactly.
[02:27:16.417 --> 02:27:17.739]  I want to be really precise.
[02:27:17.739 --> 02:27:19.761]  And then there's one other point I want to make real quick.
[02:27:19.761 --> 02:27:21.904]  Alright, well since people don't know what it is, what is it?
[02:27:21.904 --> 02:27:22.425]  What is it?
[02:27:22.425 --> 02:27:29.274]  Yeah, their own study, the government did this study with 10 parts per million nano-sized filter particles.
[02:27:29.904 --> 02:27:30.804]  Oh, I knew that.
[02:27:30.804 --> 02:27:31.184]  Sure, sure.
[02:27:31.184 --> 02:27:37.346]  I've seen the studies that nano-silver and coiled silver period has had a big effect on it.
[02:27:37.346 --> 02:27:43.127]  I mean, look, the old-timers put silver dollars in milk to keep it good down in the root cellar.
[02:27:43.127 --> 02:27:47.167]  People put silver dollars on babies' chests and stomachs when they were born.
[02:27:47.167 --> 02:27:50.728]  Everybody knows silver is an antibiotic and an antiviral.
[02:27:50.728 --> 02:27:52.088]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:27:52.088 --> 02:27:53.009]  What was your other point?
[02:27:53.009 --> 02:27:57.990]  Yeah, this was done within the DOD department and totally silenced.
[02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:59.110]  And the other thing is
[02:28:00.066 --> 02:28:10.599]  The California drought, which threatens the lives of everybody in the country right now, and is part of the overall war that Al-Qaeda is also part of against humanity.
[02:28:10.599 --> 02:28:14.424]  That was entirely engineered, and I have detailed information on that.
[02:28:14.997 --> 02:28:16.859]  Well, you should write an article about it.
[02:28:16.859 --> 02:28:23.425]  I mean, if people write articles with a bibliography, with proof, we'll publish them to InfoWars.com.
[02:28:23.425 --> 02:28:31.632]  Send them to ShowTips, send them to Riders at InfoWars.com, and our great people like Kurt Nemo and others will fact-check it.
[02:28:32.293 --> 02:28:33.474]  Turt's really good about that.
[02:28:33.474 --> 02:28:39.238]  That's really where he excels is proofreading other people's stories and approving them or not approving them.
[02:28:39.238 --> 02:28:42.240]  We'd love for you to point us in that direction.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:49.645]  I'm aware of the studies on silver and Ebola and other issues, bacteria and viruses.
[02:28:49.645 --> 02:28:55.890]  I'm aware of all sorts of information on that front.
[02:28:55.890 --> 02:28:57.231]  And one reason they don't want
[02:28:58.325 --> 02:29:04.833]  To use things like silver on bacteria and viruses is because anybody can put out good silver pretty much.
[02:29:04.833 --> 02:29:10.759]  So you don't get a Bill and Melinda Gates foundation vaccine out of that with Monsanto in a partnership.
[02:29:11.499 --> 02:29:19.626]  You don't get to vaccinate the world, make $100 billion over a decade on it, and then put Lord knows what as a Trojan horse on top of it.
[02:29:19.626 --> 02:29:25.151]  So send us the info, sir, or send us an email with leads, and we will look into it.
[02:29:25.151 --> 02:29:31.557]  We've got a great crew in there, like Kurt Nemo and Mikhail Thelen and Adon Salazar and Kit Daniels.
[02:29:32.691 --> 02:29:48.725]  So many others that it's hard to even get to all the news they've put out, but I'm going to read some of those headlines when we come back from PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and then get your own course now for about 15 minutes, then go back to your calls in the fourth hour from the new studios coming up live.
[02:29:48.725 --> 02:29:52.668]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.668 --> 02:29:55.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.393 --> 02:30:09.080]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:15.605]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:30:15.605 --> 02:30:21.270]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:25.233]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine,
[02:30:25.393 --> 02:30:34.080]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:42.187]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:30:42.187 --> 02:30:45.850]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:30:45.850 --> 02:30:51.655]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at

[02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.506]  Open your eyes.
[02:31:02.506 --> 02:31:05.908]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[02:31:05.908 --> 02:31:12.393]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:31:12.393 --> 02:31:20.758]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[02:31:20.758 --> 02:31:21.819]  Open your eyes.
[02:31:22.139 --> 02:31:37.732]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is the new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[02:31:51.503 --> 02:31:51.944]  Occupower.
[02:31:51.944 --> 02:31:52.685]  Open your eyes.
[02:32:00.393 --> 02:32:04.035]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:04.035 --> 02:32:08.317]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:08.317 --> 02:32:10.098]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:10.098 --> 02:32:17.962]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:19.103]  But for how long?
[02:32:19.103 --> 02:32:25.746]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:32:25.746 --> 02:32:28.548]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:32:30.481 --> 02:32:37.784]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[02:33:11.633 --> 02:33:16.014]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:16.014 --> 02:33:17.614]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.614 --> 02:33:34.118]  Well, I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he's got a Ph.D., doctorate in economics, international relations, and has advised State Department, Pentagon, you name it.
[02:33:34.118 --> 02:33:37.699]  Been involved in a lot of operations around the world.
[02:33:38.877 --> 02:33:52.941]  And he's always proven on so many issues, energy policy, banking policy, geopolitical operations, and breaking news and analysis that just continues to be incredibly accurate over the years.
[02:33:52.941 --> 02:33:55.902]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, on short notice, joins us.
[02:33:55.902 --> 02:34:01.924]  He also is one of the main writers and top researchers at WND.com.
[02:34:01.924 --> 02:34:03.225]  That's WorldNetDaily.com.
[02:34:05.526 --> 02:34:08.887]  Which we now know has been declassified, released by the Clinton Library.
[02:34:08.887 --> 02:34:19.351]  They tried to destroy when it was the Western Journalism Center and WND because they believed it might quote, give the people the idea that they could have a choice in media.
[02:34:19.351 --> 02:34:23.373]  Well, I think that genie's out of the bottle now.
[02:34:23.373 --> 02:34:26.174]  Doc, I've been following your articles at WND.
[02:34:27.668 --> 02:34:41.643]  And I gotta say, we don't have the staff to do it, but I remember a year ago, two years ago, you were on here exposing Odinga, and I went and pulled those articles back up, but you were on the show getting all these hundreds of millions up to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:34:41.643 --> 02:34:43.605]  Now I talked to Colonel Schaefer, who met with the head of
[02:34:45.020 --> 02:35:01.315]  Egyptian intelligence, and was also meeting with Capitol Hill yesterday, where he and other former top experts on Al Qaeda, who fought Al Qaeda, he headed up the anti-Al Qaeda branch, wasn't allowed to kill bin Laden, as people know, in Operation Able Danger and Stratus Ivy.
[02:35:01.315 --> 02:35:04.378]  And he said, undoubtedly, he said 95%.
[02:35:04.378 --> 02:35:09.002]  Well, he said it's classified, but it's way over 65, that another source told me 95%.
[02:35:10.775 --> 02:35:12.316]  Similar source.
[02:35:12.316 --> 02:35:15.038]  A bunch of people braved Congress yesterday.
[02:35:15.038 --> 02:35:17.139]  He was coming out of Congress when he told me this.
[02:35:17.139 --> 02:35:21.501]  That they know 90 plus percent is Al Qaeda.
[02:35:21.501 --> 02:35:25.783]  And that this is actually the arming of Al Qaeda to overthrow Assad, basically.
[02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:27.424]  And that Assad's going to fight back.
[02:35:27.424 --> 02:35:30.946]  I don't know how Obama's going to try to spin all of this.
[02:35:30.946 --> 02:35:33.528]  And I don't know what the grand strategy could be.
[02:35:33.528 --> 02:35:37.350]  Take part of Iraq, take part of Syria, make an ISIS state.
[02:35:37.350 --> 02:35:38.831]  Saudi Arabia's involved.
[02:35:39.651 --> 02:35:41.672]  I mean, this is a very dangerous game.
[02:35:41.672 --> 02:35:46.915]  This has got to be ten times crazier than anything I've ever seen another administration do.
[02:35:46.915 --> 02:35:48.335]  Am I wrong in saying that?
[02:35:48.335 --> 02:35:58.741]  Because you were saying there was an Obama strategy from all your sources around the world, you've been to Kenya, been to Egypt, all these places, that he might be really doing a caliphate double-cross.
[02:35:59.341 --> 02:36:02.903]  And actually trying to turn the world over to radical Islam and Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:02.903 --> 02:36:06.244]  And I thought that might be too far because it was so bold.
[02:36:06.244 --> 02:36:17.270]  But now it really appears like he wants cover for letting this group under the name ISIS take over Africa, the Middle East, you name it.
[02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:19.671]  And then I guess let them attack us and take our liberties.
[02:36:19.671 --> 02:36:22.793]  I mean, what is the grand strategy here, Dr. Jerome Corsi?
[02:36:23.479 --> 02:36:26.662]  Well, I think, Alex, you're on to the right track.
[02:36:26.662 --> 02:36:47.578]  I mean, first of all, you've got to start with the Muslim Brotherhood and the fact that Obama, through the Arab Spring, really supported the destabilization of the Middle East, toppling Gaddafi, toppling Mubarak in Egypt, and knowing, I mean, I was writing at the time, that the Muslim Brotherhood would take over, which they did,
[02:36:48.639 --> 02:36:53.004]  And the Muslim Brotherhood, remember the fundamental here is Sunni Shiite.
[02:36:53.004 --> 02:36:55.746]  Muslim Brotherhood is Sunni.
[02:36:55.746 --> 02:37:01.392]  As is Saudi Arabia and Qatar or Qatar or however you want to say it.
[02:37:01.392 --> 02:37:02.594]  Sunni.
[02:37:02.594 --> 02:37:10.161]  And Obama is backing and has backed the rebels fighting Assad who are also Sunni.
[02:37:11.147 --> 02:37:16.592]  And in fact, those rebels fighting Assad are really interchangeable with ISIS.
[02:37:16.592 --> 02:37:21.037]  And they're interchangeable with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:37:21.037 --> 02:37:21.898]  And that's what he said.
[02:37:21.898 --> 02:37:25.361]  He said clearly the Muslim Brotherhood is the front for Al Qaeda.
[02:37:25.361 --> 02:37:31.187]  They just changed their name to ISIS to confuse everybody because it's making Obama look bad to be aiding them.
[02:37:32.237 --> 02:37:40.103]  And in fact it's the same Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda, ISIS, these are all forms of the same group.
[02:37:40.103 --> 02:37:48.070]  It's Sunni, it's going against Assad, wants to establish with the funding of Saudi Arabia and Qatar
[02:37:48.610 --> 02:37:56.575]  He wants to establish a caliphate, a Sunni caliphate, very much like the Ottoman Empire going back centuries.
[02:37:56.575 --> 02:37:58.356]  This is what the goal is.
[02:37:58.356 --> 02:38:08.802]  And the ultimate enemy here is, first of all, Assad, because he's a friend of Iran, and Iran is a Shiite.
[02:38:09.662 --> 02:38:29.717]  And this is a Shiite-Sunni battle in which Obama has been trying since the Arab Spring to have the United States side with the Saudis, with the Sunnis, to defeat the Shiites that established this caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and ultimately the entire Middle East and the entire world.
[02:38:29.717 --> 02:38:33.239]  I mean, that's the game plan here.
[02:38:33.239 --> 02:38:36.542]  And the lukewarm efforts to say we're going to do a little bit of bombing,
[02:38:37.242 --> 02:38:42.006]  Which, you know, have very minimal chance of success against a group like ISIS.
[02:38:42.006 --> 02:38:46.009]  The way it's operating, well-funded Iraq oil money.
[02:38:46.009 --> 02:38:53.174]  We've now pulled out of Iraq in a way that again was against the advice of George W. Bush.
[02:38:53.174 --> 02:39:01.901]  We're in the inappropriate time when essentially there is no army in Iraq that we could arm to fight against ISIS.
[02:39:01.901 --> 02:39:06.705]  And every military authority of any credibility or knowledge in the world understands that.
[02:39:08.247 --> 02:39:25.056]  Well, the intel we've got is this is just some light bombing of a few little straggling groups, a few trucks, a few cars for PR, so Obama can then give hundreds of millions, if not billions, which the Republican leadership is green-lighting under Boehner today, directly to the so-called good rebels to overthrow Assad.
[02:39:25.056 --> 02:39:36.542]  So this is really taking public sentiment to take out IS or Al-Qaeda, or ISIL as Obama calls it, take that support to go after these horrible people, and then
[02:39:37.625 --> 02:39:40.588]  Go ahead and use it to destabilize and overthrow Assad.
[02:39:40.588 --> 02:39:42.310]  The Russians are going to see through that.
[02:39:42.310 --> 02:39:43.891]  Assad's going to see through that.
[02:39:43.891 --> 02:39:47.835]  What's going to happen if Assad shoots at our aircraft when they're flying over?
[02:39:47.835 --> 02:39:49.337]  This is really getting crazy.
[02:39:49.337 --> 02:39:54.622]  Also, let's make it really clear to everybody that we're funding ISIS through the back door.
[02:39:54.622 --> 02:40:00.468]  In other words, supporting the Syrian rebels against Assad is supporting ISIS.
[02:40:01.289 --> 02:40:17.349]  And this goes back to the same thing we were doing with Ambassador Stevens in Libya when he first, even before Gaddafi was toppled, came in to Benghazi in a cargo ship
[02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:33.910]  and began a CIA operation of funding and providing arms to the rebels opposing Gaddafi, were the same Muslim Brotherhood groups that oppose Mubarak in Egypt and are now behind ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
[02:40:34.591 --> 02:40:43.842]  And Turkey's involved in this as well because Chris Stevens, even the night he died, was having meetings with one of the Turkey ambassadors, Turkey's ambassadors.
[02:40:43.842 --> 02:40:54.734]  And I'm convinced, as you know, we just published a book by Aaron Klein that the entire background of the Benghazi situation was a fast and furious operation that the Obama administration was running.
[02:40:55.615 --> 02:41:06.745]  In the Middle East to provide arms to this Syrian rebel army which in effect is ISIS and it was opposing Assad and it was opposing Iran.
[02:41:06.745 --> 02:41:16.213]  Well the BBC had live feeds of them going into Tripoli and other areas when Qaddafi collapsed waving flags and with signs in English saying Syria's next.
[02:41:16.994 --> 02:41:20.955]  And now they're in Syria, they said Iraq's next, and the next they say Europe and the U.S.
[02:41:20.955 --> 02:41:21.836]  is next.
[02:41:21.836 --> 02:41:28.578]  And never forget that Obama was raised a Sunni Muslim in Indonesia.
[02:41:28.578 --> 02:41:30.258]  He was raised a Sunni.
[02:41:30.258 --> 02:41:31.539]  That's what his stepfather was.
[02:41:32.219 --> 02:41:32.960]  Is that a real intel?
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:35.121]  Was that a deep cover CIA deal with his mom?
[02:41:35.121 --> 02:41:36.242]  We know she was.
[02:41:36.242 --> 02:41:38.944]  Or is he really think he's the Grand Mati?
[02:41:38.944 --> 02:41:40.685]  And is there some kind of deal behind the scenes?
[02:41:40.685 --> 02:41:46.349]  Because I always thought that theory I've been hearing for eight years was crazy, since the start of his election.
[02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:52.073]  But now, I mean, my gosh, if that's not what's going on, it's a triple cross then at some level.
[02:41:52.073 --> 02:41:56.336]  He got his cousin through him, arming the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow Egypt.
[02:41:56.336 --> 02:41:57.597]  You've got, you've got just...
[02:41:58.377 --> 02:42:04.261]  And he looks so emotional when he was up there talking last night about Muslims and stuff.
[02:42:04.261 --> 02:42:07.342]  I mean, if this is true, this is the ultimate double cross.
[02:42:07.342 --> 02:42:17.888]  Remember his brother in Kenya was accused by the Egyptian government of managing money for the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:42:17.888 --> 02:42:20.350]  And that again ties back to the Obama family.
[02:42:20.350 --> 02:42:20.870]  Wasn't it Odinga too?
[02:42:22.731 --> 02:42:23.591]  And Odinga too.
[02:42:23.591 --> 02:42:26.052]  I mean, Odinga was involved in this as well.
[02:42:26.052 --> 02:42:28.912]  You know, you had the entire network.
[02:42:28.912 --> 02:42:30.533]  Remember Odinga?
[02:42:30.533 --> 02:42:35.634]  Going back to Gaddafi, these were all, you know, Sunnis.
[02:42:35.634 --> 02:42:46.056]  But it's the radical Sunnis, the Muslim Brotherhood, the ISIS, the Al Qaeda faction that Obama has really indirectly and under the table backed.
[02:42:46.696 --> 02:42:48.778]  That's the underlying story here.
[02:42:48.778 --> 02:42:51.019]  And what's the grand plan?
[02:42:51.019 --> 02:42:59.706]  Well, the grand plan is ultimately that Sunni Islam triumphs worldwide and defeats every other religion.
[02:42:59.706 --> 02:43:07.372]  That's been the plan since the time of, you know, since the Prophet Muhammad died and the fight began between the Sunnis and the Shiites.
[02:43:07.372 --> 02:43:09.154]  Why has Israel been going along with this?
[02:43:09.154 --> 02:43:10.535]  Because they've got a deal with Saudi Arabia?
[02:43:11.155 --> 02:43:14.658]  Well, Israel in the moment is really just surviving.
[02:43:14.658 --> 02:43:27.267]  It's got so many enemies and so many different fronts that for the moment, you know, the real enemy is Hamas and it's being funded by Iran.
[02:43:27.267 --> 02:43:30.529]  And again, the Muslim Brotherhood is behind Hamas.
[02:43:30.529 --> 02:43:31.389]  So in a sense,
[02:43:32.290 --> 02:43:37.412]  The Sunnis and the ISIS divert some of the attention away from Israel.
[02:43:37.412 --> 02:43:39.893]  But at the same time, these are all extremely dangerous.
[02:43:39.893 --> 02:43:44.035]  There's no way to make a deal with any of these forces.
[02:43:44.035 --> 02:43:45.796]  There's no good forces here.
[02:43:45.796 --> 02:43:52.639]  It's just understanding the conflict, understanding that Obama sides with the radical Sunnis.
[02:43:52.639 --> 02:43:55.961]  Because as a... I've always said two things about Obama.
[02:43:55.961 --> 02:43:58.322]  His background looks like a CIA plant.
[02:43:59.002 --> 02:44:03.224]  And he said himself in Cairo, he's experienced Islam on three continents.
[02:44:03.224 --> 02:44:14.430]  Obama was raised a Sunni, was raised a radical revolutionary Sunni, which is the ideology of the United States as the, you know, the grand devil, the imperialist nation.
[02:44:14.430 --> 02:44:25.756]  And Obama has had this agenda, I've said it from the very beginning, to advance the cause of radical Sunni Islam, as exemplified by the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, and ultimately Al Qaeda.
[02:44:25.756 --> 02:44:27.577]  And we've largely pulled out now
[02:44:28.337 --> 02:44:33.301]  So I said, this bombing that we're going to do is really, you know, pointless.
[02:44:33.301 --> 02:44:44.150]  If we really wanted to go after ISIS, when they were running through Iraq in columns on open desert roads, ISIS could have been easily devastated.
[02:44:45.571 --> 02:44:49.094]  With serious attacks, not just one sortie.
[02:44:49.094 --> 02:44:59.362]  Oh, they were given the weapons up front and allowed in to regroup and then give the pretext to go bomb them in Syria in a way of defeating them, but it's really going to be Assad.
[02:44:59.362 --> 02:45:04.666]  How is Obama going to try to flip this around then and start bombing Assad targets?
[02:45:04.666 --> 02:45:10.511]  Or will they use the so-called money to the non-radical rebels that will really go towards fighting Assad on the ground?
[02:45:10.991 --> 02:45:15.432]  As soon as you get an incident, as soon as we have a flyover that is attacked.
[02:45:15.432 --> 02:45:17.973]  Remember, Obama's already tried this once.
[02:45:17.973 --> 02:45:21.093]  He accused Assad of using chemical weapons.
[02:45:21.093 --> 02:45:22.154]  This was a year ago.
[02:45:22.154 --> 02:45:30.956]  Obama was ramping up to attack Assad and support the Syrian rebels a year ago.
[02:45:31.676 --> 02:45:36.379]  And we all exposed it, that in fact it was the rebels who were using the chemical weapons.
[02:45:36.379 --> 02:45:37.900]  It wasn't Assad.
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:39.201]  We embarrassed the Obamas.
[02:45:39.201 --> 02:45:41.022]  And it's not that we're for Assad!
[02:45:41.022 --> 02:45:42.603]  We just go tell the truth!
[02:45:42.603 --> 02:45:43.083]  Truth.
[02:45:43.083 --> 02:45:43.783]  Just the truth.
[02:45:43.783 --> 02:45:50.968]  I mean, the truth is, we, the United States, is the origin of ISIS.
[02:45:50.968 --> 02:45:55.771]  And indeligibly, with the Saudis and Qatar, who we still continue to work with, both,
[02:45:56.571 --> 02:45:57.832]  Where do you expect this to go now?
[02:45:57.832 --> 02:46:02.634]  I mean, can the political establishment get away with this?
[02:46:17.216 --> 02:46:26.699]  I just think you're going to either have a continuing, Obama's now gone out and given the speech last night and he's told the American people he's going to go after ISIS.
[02:46:26.699 --> 02:46:35.682]  His strategy, all it's going to take is one more beheading by ISIS and anyone who thinks that ISIS is going to be deterred from public relations
[02:46:36.502 --> 02:46:42.045]  And what is Obama going to do when ISIS or ISIS sympathizers blow up a sports stadium when he had the border wide open?
[02:46:42.045 --> 02:46:44.666]  How are they going to get away with that?
[02:46:44.666 --> 02:46:45.007]  They're not.
[02:47:01.375 --> 02:47:08.399]  The whole strategy is, Obama is rapidly losing control of the entire strategy.
[02:47:08.399 --> 02:47:14.203]  Just like I said when, you know, the Arab Spring, we were bound to lose control.
[02:47:14.203 --> 02:47:14.743]  We did.
[02:47:14.743 --> 02:47:19.646]  But look at now, we've got a military government in Egypt.
[02:47:19.646 --> 02:47:22.148]  Obama did not back the military government.
[02:47:22.808 --> 02:47:30.153]  He has not come clean with the number of Muslim Brotherhood that have been criminally prosecuted in Egypt.
[02:47:30.153 --> 02:47:36.717]  We were withdrawing our aid from Egypt at a time when Russia was moving in and supporting Egypt.
[02:47:36.717 --> 02:47:44.783]  We're creating a vacuum here for Russia to move in and to be much more detrimental in their activity in the Middle East.
[02:47:44.783 --> 02:47:49.246]  The United States right now is operating in a confused state.
[02:47:50.006 --> 02:47:58.313]  Where Obama is asking us to back the rebels who are in fact part of ISIS.
[02:47:58.313 --> 02:48:00.695]  So we're attacking ISIS while we're supporting ISIS.
[02:48:01.977 --> 02:48:03.197]  And that's not going to work.
[02:48:03.197 --> 02:48:04.898]  That makes my head hurt.
[02:48:04.898 --> 02:48:05.458]  It does.
[02:48:05.458 --> 02:48:06.458]  It's very confusing.
[02:48:06.458 --> 02:48:09.039]  But remember, it's very simple.
[02:48:09.039 --> 02:48:19.623]  If you go back and say, Sunni versus Shiite, and what we're doing is ISIS and the rebels fighting Assad are both Sunni.
[02:48:20.203 --> 02:48:23.745]  And again, if the Shiites were on the offensive, I would be against them.
[02:48:23.745 --> 02:48:27.126]  Clearly the Shiites are not on the offensive right now.
[02:48:27.126 --> 02:48:31.608]  It's the Sunnis, just like it's the Sunnis on the offensive against Russia.
[02:48:31.608 --> 02:48:41.493]  And Russia, if it keeps getting pushed, this is what Colonel Schaefer said yesterday, is going to start moving in with their anti-tank aircraft and more troops into Syria.
[02:48:41.493 --> 02:48:45.175]  They are not going to let Assad fall and lose their only Mediterranean port.
[02:48:45.715 --> 02:49:03.120]  And none of these forces in the Middle East right now are, there's no good guys in this mix because the Shiites over in Iran have completely made a fool out of John Kerry in Geneva and they are with abandon proceeding to develop nuclear weapons.
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:04.420]  We're doing nothing to stop them.
[02:49:05.367 --> 02:49:13.494]  And that's happening under the radar while we're all worried about... This sounds like the foreign policy the devil would come up with.
[02:49:13.494 --> 02:49:14.275]  It certainly does.
[02:49:14.275 --> 02:49:17.698]  I mean, it is complete chaos.
[02:49:17.698 --> 02:49:23.042]  And as soon as Obama went in and toppled Gaddafi and Mubarak,
[02:49:23.703 --> 02:49:29.827]  He toppled two of the forces, bad guys though they were, they were holding stable regimes.
[02:49:29.827 --> 02:49:33.890]  Now that they're gone, Libya is dominated by Al Qaeda.
[02:49:33.890 --> 02:49:37.172]  It sent a message for Al Qaeda to green light, taking over everything.
[02:49:37.172 --> 02:49:38.373]  Absolutely.
[02:49:38.373 --> 02:49:42.075]  And to do so under a whole variety of different names.
[02:49:42.075 --> 02:49:47.839]  You know, they're not just all calling themselves Al Qaeda anymore, but they are all operating in unison.
[02:49:48.499 --> 02:50:08.311]  Black Wahhabis, radical Islam, Sunni flags, and now they're one-upping each other on who can be the most radical, and I'm seeing a lot of young trendies, I said this first a few months ago, but now even Voice of America said it yesterday, that there's the cool factor in ISIS, and it makes me want to throw up.
[02:50:08.311 --> 02:50:14.394]  It's the new uniform, it's the new cool, the black flag with the white circle, I mean this is the new cool.
[02:50:14.394 --> 02:50:16.936]  It's like the new Che Guevara, one of my crews said.
[02:50:17.256 --> 02:50:19.517]  Yeah, or it's, you know, a new baseball uniform.
[02:50:19.517 --> 02:50:20.517]  They're all running out.
[02:50:20.517 --> 02:50:22.978]  This is the uniform they all want to play under.
[02:50:22.978 --> 02:50:24.539]  But, you know, that'll change, too.
[02:50:24.539 --> 02:50:33.803]  I mean, once the caliphate is established, see, here you've also got the destruction of Iraq and Syria as nation-states.
[02:50:33.803 --> 02:50:34.563]  That's done with.
[02:50:35.455 --> 02:50:37.336]  You know, there is no nation state in Iraq.
[02:50:37.336 --> 02:50:38.017]  There is nothing.
[02:50:38.017 --> 02:50:42.159]  There's just one giant Islamic state run by crazy people.
[02:50:42.159 --> 02:50:43.901]  And civil war going on.
[02:50:43.901 --> 02:50:45.282]  Sunni versus Shiite.
[02:50:45.282 --> 02:50:46.262]  All bad guys.
[02:50:46.262 --> 02:50:49.785]  And we are supporting the bad guys in the process.
[02:50:49.785 --> 02:50:50.885]  And so there's the strategy.
[02:50:50.885 --> 02:50:52.166]  Balkanization.
[02:50:52.166 --> 02:50:53.467]  Deindustrialization.
[02:50:53.467 --> 02:50:58.750]  And then use the new Muslim threat, the radical Muslim threat, to take over the West with a police state.
[02:50:58.750 --> 02:50:59.311]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:59.611 --> 02:51:00.471]  Listen up!

[02:51:34.019 --> 02:51:36.839]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:36.839 --> 02:51:39.120]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:43.640]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:51:58.775 --> 02:52:02.876]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[02:52:02.876 --> 02:52:07.437]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:52:07.437 --> 02:52:13.938]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:52:13.938 --> 02:52:17.939]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:52:17.939 --> 02:52:19.619]  Survival Shield X2.

[02:52:58.749 --> 02:52:59.969]  Our big story.
[02:52:59.969 --> 02:53:04.991]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[02:53:04.991 --> 02:53:08.112]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[02:53:08.112 --> 02:53:10.913]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.

[02:54:05.118 --> 02:54:14.440]  I will be broadcasting for an entire fourth special hour out of the new studio as we begin to segue over into the TV studio for the radio broadcast as well.
[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:20.942]  Coming up in the next little segment, we're going to re-air some of those clips with Colonel Schaefer yesterday, dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[02:54:22.109 --> 02:54:26.393]  For me, the bigger issue here is that this is so openly evil.
[02:54:26.393 --> 02:54:29.516]  This is so openly a war crime.
[02:54:29.516 --> 02:54:32.759]  It's one thing if you're going to have different radical elements of Islam killing each other.
[02:54:32.759 --> 02:54:34.501]  It's sad, but it goes on.
[02:54:34.501 --> 02:54:39.286]  It's another thing for our government to be stirring it up, giving them the weapons, and then acting dumb.
[02:54:39.286 --> 02:54:44.611]  And we're going to ride it and deal with them when it's really about going after Assad, who's been fighting them for four years.
[02:54:46.169 --> 02:54:48.130]  It just makes me really upset.
[02:54:48.130 --> 02:54:49.951]  I want to get final comments from Dr. Corsi.
[02:54:49.951 --> 02:54:58.556]  A few other articles that just broke on Infowars.com illustrating how the police states not to keep us safe but to keep us under the control of the system.
[02:54:58.556 --> 02:55:06.981]  DHS fines Americans $5,000 for crossing the border but not illegals.
[02:55:06.981 --> 02:55:07.922]  This is documented.
[02:55:07.922 --> 02:55:09.322]  DHS will fine Americans $5,000.
[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:18.228]  I've seen them out there writing people tickets in parks, drinking beer, the border patrolling people, but not stopping illegals walking right by them.
[02:55:18.228 --> 02:55:20.031]  I mean, I've shot video of it.
[02:55:20.031 --> 02:55:25.678]  DHS finds American, but nothing for illegals.
[02:55:27.708 --> 02:55:28.028]  I don't know.
[02:55:51.312 --> 02:55:51.593]  I don't.
[02:56:04.876 --> 02:56:14.160]  300 style helmet with the two cross 50 caliber shells under it with Molon Labe above with Info Wars on the back.
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:17.321]  InfoWarsStore.com and it's made in America.
[02:56:17.321 --> 02:56:21.383]  It's part of the Made in 1776.com label.
[02:56:21.383 --> 02:56:28.946]  So all your purchases fund our operation whether it's the oxy powder to flush out your guts, whether it's super metal vitality or the X2 nascent iodine.
[02:56:29.306 --> 02:56:35.171]  Well, Dr. Corsi of WorldNetDaily.com, thank you for joining us on 9-11.
[02:56:35.171 --> 02:56:39.634]  Undoubtedly, these terror groups are not run by the West.
[02:56:39.634 --> 02:56:43.377]  I liken it to dumping black widows in your neighbor's bed.
[02:56:43.377 --> 02:56:49.623]  You know, you don't command the black widows, you just put them in the way of your neighbor.
[02:56:49.623 --> 02:56:51.284]  Undoubtedly, there will be blowback.
[02:56:51.284 --> 02:56:52.305]  We will get attacked.
[02:56:52.805 --> 02:56:59.148]  And I don't see how the governing class won't end up going to prison when our borders are open and they funded this group.
[02:56:59.148 --> 02:57:07.451]  I'm gonna make sure, you're gonna make sure, that if there is a terror attack, that the people involved are brought to justice because our government is aiding and abetting.
[02:57:07.451 --> 02:57:08.052]  Do you agree with that?
[02:57:09.099 --> 02:57:15.921]  Absolutely, and also remember the agenda here is eliminating Christians from the Middle East.
[02:57:15.921 --> 02:57:30.944]  Every one of these countries, going from Libya across through now into Syria and Iraq, Egypt, the war on eliminating Christians from the Middle East is one point on which the Sunnis and the Shiites agree.
[02:57:31.644 --> 02:57:33.345]  And that's going to continue.
[02:57:33.345 --> 02:57:40.267]  The beheadings, the killings, the wiping out of populations by ISIS, it's going to accelerate.
[02:57:40.267 --> 02:57:45.768]  And I don't think the bombing is going to do any good to... Obama's going to be given a chance by the American public.
[02:57:45.768 --> 02:57:52.010]  But when this fails to stop ISIS, Obama's got to explain whose side he's on.
[02:57:52.010 --> 02:57:53.791]  That's why he's already saying it'll take years.
[02:57:54.571 --> 02:57:57.413]  Right, well, the American public doesn't have years.
[02:57:57.413 --> 02:58:00.714]  Not when the threat is about to cross the southern border.
[02:58:00.714 --> 02:58:07.818]  Not about when we're on 9-11 and should be remembering how easily and vulnerable the United States is to attack.
[02:58:07.818 --> 02:58:14.702]  How many ISIS members fighting today in Iraq and Syria with ISIS came from the United States.
[02:58:14.702 --> 02:58:16.543]  Were recruited from here.
[02:58:16.543 --> 02:58:18.604]  With other sympathizers still in the United States.
[02:58:18.604 --> 02:58:20.925]  But Obama said they're not Islamic.
[02:58:20.925 --> 02:58:21.906]  Right, they're not Islamic.
[02:58:22.932 --> 02:58:25.293]  Yeah, well, you know, what are they supposed to be?
[02:58:25.293 --> 02:58:26.753]  It was a ridiculous statement.
[02:58:26.753 --> 02:58:29.034]  It's political correctness has become a total joke.
[02:58:29.034 --> 02:58:29.754]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:29.754 --> 02:58:31.234]  Have a great weekend coming up, sir.
[02:58:31.234 --> 02:58:31.955]  Thank you.
[02:58:31.955 --> 02:58:34.595]  All right, we'll be back with a fourth hour from the new studio.
[02:58:34.595 --> 02:58:38.697]  And right after this one-minute break, Colonel Schaefer highlights its bombshell.
[02:58:38.697 --> 02:58:41.317]  The video's on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:41.317 --> 02:58:44.358]  Some stations don't carry this fourth hour, so InfoWars.com, Forbes Live Show.
[02:58:44.358 --> 02:58:45.819]  You'll find the free feed.
[02:58:50.046 --> 02:58:52.528]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[02:58:52.528 --> 02:58:59.232]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:58:59.232 --> 02:59:02.014]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:59:02.014 --> 02:59:03.955]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:59:03.955 --> 02:59:06.277]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:59:06.277 --> 02:59:10.480]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:11.920]  I say, so what?
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:14.101]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:59:14.101 --> 02:59:17.502]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.502 --> 02:59:21.744]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:21.744 --> 02:59:26.065]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[02:59:26.345 --> 02:59:27.586]  And I'm still fighting.
[02:59:27.586 --> 02:59:30.809]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[02:59:30.809 --> 02:59:32.630]  The InfoWars is worldwide.
[02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:36.974]  Tell your friends about InfoWars and let them know that InfoWars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:36.974 --> 02:59:40.677]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[02:59:40.677 --> 02:59:47.922]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[02:59:47.922 --> 02:59:49.484]  The truth will set them free.
[02:59:50.871 --> 02:59:54.461]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.461 --> 02:59:57.671]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.816 --> 03:00:10.659]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.659 --> 03:00:12.239]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.239 --> 03:00:13.780]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.780 --> 03:00:17.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.963 --> 03:00:22.025]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.894 --> 03:00:33.777]  I know you're not supposed to say, but from my sources, and I know you've got a lot higher level than I do, you're up there at the Capitol, that they have substantive groups here in the U.S.
[03:00:33.777 --> 03:00:45.340]  and that this could be a way to basically blackmail Obama, because Obama now knows if there's terror attacks, and Susan Rice and others helped create this current group, that they're going to get the blame for it.
[03:00:45.340 --> 03:00:46.961]  Couldn't we have
[03:00:48.061 --> 03:00:58.696]  I'm seeing, Alex, the same basic patterns I saw right before 9-11 regarding our work, and you mentioned stratified enabled danger.
[03:00:58.696 --> 03:01:03.102]  I am seeing the same neglect, the same wishful thinking at the policy level.
[03:01:03.643 --> 03:01:04.584]  We're good to go.
[03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:31.610]  Within our border, simply because they think that, well, if we, you know, they leave us alone, we'll leave them alone.
[03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:35.612]  That was the naive thinking that resulted in the 9-11 attacks.
[03:01:35.612 --> 03:01:47.498]  And I'm telling you right now, it may not happen this 9-11, it may not happen the next 9-11, but we are literally allowing the conditions to be created which are going to allow the next 9-11, which I would predict is going to be far more severe,
[03:01:48.118 --> 03:01:51.522]  Far more catastrophic than 9-11 attacks have ever been.
[03:01:51.522 --> 03:02:00.971]  I think those of us who have studied this and recognize the vulnerability understand that the Southwest border, as much as kids coming across are a tug at our heart, Alex, the issue is not the kids.
[03:02:00.971 --> 03:02:07.457]  It's about the fact that other nefarious folks, drug cartels, terrorist groups, are going to use the Southwest border to get their people in here.
[03:02:07.737 --> 03:02:17.867]  I've been critical of Rick Perry on a lot of issues, but they've indicted him for holding back money from a drunk, crazy person while he is covertly trying to secure the border.
[03:02:17.867 --> 03:02:20.329]  I have to commend him and the state police.
[03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:23.532]  He's actually trying to secure the border, and he's been indicted.
[03:02:23.532 --> 03:02:28.557]  I mean, it's almost like the Democrats are secretly allied with Al Qaeda or something.
[03:02:28.917 --> 03:02:32.378]  Well, this goes back to our conversation about the Brotherhood.
[03:02:32.378 --> 03:02:33.779]  Let me be very clear on this.
[03:02:33.779 --> 03:02:37.921]  The Muslim Brotherhood has penetrated every aspect of our governance.
[03:02:37.921 --> 03:02:39.501]  Every aspect, Alex.
[03:02:39.501 --> 03:02:41.102]  They have influence in the media.
[03:02:41.102 --> 03:02:42.983]  They have influence on Capitol Hill.
[03:02:42.983 --> 03:02:53.467]  They have been able to go through in DOD, and basically, the reason we can't call Islamic radicalism Islamic radicalism is because they have done this Orwellian thing.
[03:02:53.467 --> 03:02:55.228]  And I have a friend of mine who told me this.
[03:02:55.228 --> 03:02:57.709]  The DOD was forced to remove all
[03:02:58.649 --> 03:03:06.114]  All references to radical Islam because of brotherhood influence over the FBI and DOD.
[03:03:06.114 --> 03:03:14.140]  While we've been fighting Al Qaeda in the battle for the winning, these folks have been working behind the scenes to subvert all of the governance we hold dear.
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:19.343]  And again, I hope your audience understands, I'm not being over-bumped on this.
[03:03:19.343 --> 03:03:20.844]  Their influence is real.
[03:03:20.844 --> 03:03:28.089]  And again, this is why General Al-Toghini and now President al-Sisi outlawed the Brotherhood in Egypt.
[03:03:28.089 --> 03:03:39.617]  I know you're not supposed to get into this because you can get in trouble because of the Commander-in-Chief, but those same people were interviewed by WorldNet daily and confirmed Obama's cousin Odinga, the Prime Minister down in Kenya, is making all this money
[03:03:40.098 --> 03:03:45.638]  And is reportedly sending hundreds of millions up there financing it, and Obama is directly involved.
[03:03:46.584 --> 03:03:50.948]  Well, I don't know that for a fact, but let me tell you this little tidbit, Alex, that I think your audience needs to understand.
[03:03:50.948 --> 03:03:58.094]  Just a few days before I met with Al-Tuheimi, General Al-Tuheimi, the chief of Egyptian intelligence, John Brennan was there.
[03:03:58.094 --> 03:04:00.215]  John Brennan, our director of CIA.
[03:04:00.215 --> 03:04:07.501]  So, one of the things that General Al-Tuheimi brought up to me is that he had brought up to John Brennan their issue with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:04:07.501 --> 03:04:12.626]  And Al-Tuheimi, the chief of their intelligence, asked John Brennan directly, why don't you help us
[03:04:13.346 --> 03:04:14.708]  Attack the Brotherhood.
[03:04:14.708 --> 03:04:17.510]  Why don't you outlaw the Brotherhood just like we're about to do?
[03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:19.292]  And by the way, they haven't done it.
[03:04:19.292 --> 03:04:28.842]  And so, Al-Daweem didn't really tell us what Brennan said, so I asked him, I said, with all due respect, General, what did John Brennan say to you when you said that, you know, the Brotherhood's an enemy?
[03:04:28.842 --> 03:04:30.624]  What was his reply?
[03:04:30.624 --> 03:04:35.789]  He stiffened up, Alex, in his chair, looked at me sternly and said, John Brennan laughed in my face.
[03:04:37.153 --> 03:04:38.333]  Now think about that.
[03:04:38.333 --> 03:04:45.115]  Our Director of CIA laughed at the Chief of Intelligence of Egypt because he was told that the Brotherhood is a threat.
[03:04:45.115 --> 03:04:55.318]  The Brotherhood was blowing up churches, crucifying people, attacking military bases, trying to blow up the Suez Canal last year that forced the military to go after them.
[03:04:55.318 --> 03:04:58.579]  When they got power, they had a reign of terror in Egypt.
[03:04:59.070 --> 03:04:59.810]  That's correct.
[03:04:59.810 --> 03:05:06.894]  And so, that's... The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.

[03:05:58.272 --> 03:05:59.032]  Affordable.
[03:05:59.032 --> 03:06:00.413]  Effective.
[03:06:00.413 --> 03:06:07.556]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[03:06:07.556 --> 03:06:09.897]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[03:06:09.897 --> 03:06:15.180]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:20.362]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[03:06:20.362 --> 03:06:23.384]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[03:06:23.684 --> 03:06:27.746]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[03:06:27.746 --> 03:06:32.049]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[03:06:32.049 --> 03:06:42.295]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[03:06:42.295 --> 03:06:48.779]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new Infowars Life Lung Cleanse is
[03:06:48.899 --> 03:06:49.299]  We're good.
[03:06:59.963 --> 03:07:02.864]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[03:07:02.864 --> 03:07:06.405]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:07:06.405 --> 03:07:08.566]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[03:07:08.566 --> 03:07:17.868]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[03:07:17.868 --> 03:07:23.870]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[03:07:50.427 --> 03:07:52.128]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[03:08:01.744 --> 03:08:04.486]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.486 --> 03:08:09.530]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.530 --> 03:08:17.637]  You know, I want to start this historic fourth hour first live show broadcast that we've done for the radio.
[03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:19.620]  We're good to go.
[03:08:40.006 --> 03:08:43.170]  And that control room runs two other studios in the building.
[03:08:43.170 --> 03:08:47.897]  Because when I'm done, I plan to have probably three or four TV shows a day out of here.
[03:08:47.897 --> 03:08:52.623]  And of course my main radio show and other specialty transmissions.
[03:08:52.623 --> 03:08:54.285]  That's been my plan all along.
[03:08:55.188 --> 03:09:02.156]  I've been so busy over the years doing the radio show, the films, the nightly news, that I've never really realized all that.
[03:09:02.156 --> 03:09:16.191]  I never had the capital that Glenn Beck did, but I'm glad that Glenn Beck took our new media model that even mainstream media has said was developed by us in the last 15, 16 years since we started doing this and been so successful with it.
[03:09:16.551 --> 03:09:26.078]  I do not intend to have 24-hour shows or 24-hour radio shows to actually challenge Clear Channel and Premier and the old radio platforms itself.
[03:09:26.078 --> 03:09:43.151]  But I do want to have morning, noon, and night live shows, special reports, bulletins, and so much more so that it's not just Alex Jones here on the radio and on television.
[03:09:44.144 --> 03:10:00.160]  Giving you my unique perspective on the world, but that it's other liberty lovers and other great minds, if I could say I have a great mind, other people that love liberty, and that's a great mind to me, that's a beautiful mind, to really be able to challenge the globalist in real time.
[03:10:01.207 --> 03:10:12.335]  So that if there is a big terrorist attack, or a new war starts, or the stock market crashes, or Ebola gets the United States, you're already seeing the nightly news when something big happens.
[03:10:12.335 --> 03:10:15.357]  It won't just be taped to air 7 to 7.30.
[03:10:15.357 --> 03:10:29.487]  Then they'll go live for two more hours, or three more hours, and then I'll drive into the studio and I'll be here, or I'll Skype in from home, or we'll Skype in where we have correspondents all over the country giving us intel, giving us information.
[03:10:30.697 --> 03:10:37.883]  That's my goal, and we have really developed over the years, finally, a team of great, dedicated people who are doing this from the ground up.
[03:10:37.883 --> 03:10:39.905]  We don't have big corporate consultants.
[03:10:39.905 --> 03:10:45.550]  We are literally reinventing the wheel because the old media complex was so incredibly corrupt.
[03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:54.698]  And so, we'll work out the bugs, work out the kinks, but I tell you, so far, the whole crew is just doing a bang-up job, and I'm so honored to be here.
[03:10:54.698 --> 03:10:57.281]  And I love, in the control room, because I came up with this look,
[03:10:58.041 --> 03:11:09.243]  I noticed you've got George Washington there in the middle, and you've got the Don't Tread on Me in Latin, and then you've also got the Spartan helmet, Molon Lambe.
[03:11:09.243 --> 03:11:12.584]  And I think that basically says what we stand for here.
[03:11:12.584 --> 03:11:24.426]  Individual strength, individual liberty, sacrifice for freedom, not backing down, embracing the true Americana ideas that have made this nation so great, in a sea of evil.
[03:11:25.186 --> 03:11:27.991]  America has lots of problems, has done lots of terrible things.
[03:11:27.991 --> 03:11:31.017]  We've also have been exceptional in many other ways.
[03:11:31.017 --> 03:11:38.129]  So many other countries that call us evil and corrupt, they just do that because they're not as good at being evil and corrupt as America has been.
[03:11:38.939 --> 03:11:42.720]  Now, I'm not proud of America being good at being evil and corrupt.
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:52.723]  But what I will tell you is I want to go back to us being honorable, and not that we were perfectly honorable, but known for doing what we'd say we do, for being more chivalrous.
[03:11:52.723 --> 03:11:59.065]  America was kind of the rebirth of chivalry that had died in the last 500, 600 years in Europe.
[03:11:59.065 --> 03:12:00.245]  There was a strain of that.
[03:12:00.785 --> 03:12:09.590]  And so I want to embrace the better angels of humanity, as a statesman once said, and try to strive for something better.
[03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:11.371]  That's our goal here.
[03:12:11.371 --> 03:12:20.876]  And this is our first, again, live transmission out of the TV studio for the radio show since we began building this facility about a year ago.
[03:12:21.972 --> 03:12:30.917]  And really it's just a room to have guests in and to be able to break down over there on the television screen specifics of what are happening with maps and presentations.
[03:12:30.917 --> 03:12:32.939]  This is just to communicate better with you.
[03:12:32.939 --> 03:12:46.287]  It only signifies and is a token of the larger operations that we're going to carry out and much bigger things we're going to build so that we're not just reaching 20 million people a week.
[03:12:47.512 --> 03:12:51.613]  As many as 5 million of those being new listeners who come through.
[03:12:51.613 --> 03:12:56.955]  We have about 15 million that are a staple that tune in at least a few times a week.
[03:12:56.955 --> 03:13:07.259]  But 20 plus million people on all our platforms, podcasts, YouTube, Terrestrial Radio is the biggest chunk, over 170 Aminatum affiliates, Global Shortwave, WWCR.
[03:13:07.259 --> 03:13:13.761]  We were censored off SiriusXM openly because of our political statements and what we have to say.
[03:13:13.761 --> 03:13:16.662]  But so was other mainline libertarians and conservatives as well.
[03:13:17.725 --> 03:13:26.308]  Just like you see the harassment of Breitbart by the IRS now openly, there is an attempt to shut down anything that isn't completely statist.
[03:13:26.308 --> 03:13:46.274]  Not that mainline Republicans are good, not that Breitbart's even perfect, but that for the system that says your children don't belong to you, 2 plus 2 equals 5, it is a threat because it believes in private property, because the libertarian conservative movement is being radicalized by
[03:13:46.394 --> 03:13:47.775]  Patriots like yours truly.
[03:13:47.775 --> 03:13:49.497]  Time Magazine has said that twice.
[03:13:49.497 --> 03:13:52.119]  That I'm the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[03:13:52.119 --> 03:13:52.960]  You can Google it.
[03:13:52.960 --> 03:13:55.061]  Alex Jones is the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[03:13:55.061 --> 03:13:59.986]  Energizing and radicalizing and oh don't radicalize yourself or you'll lose elections.
[03:13:59.986 --> 03:14:03.789]  The truth is you have to be radical to meet a radical threat.
[03:14:03.789 --> 03:14:11.436]  To radicals that think parents aren't parents and that the state is God, for me to believe in free market and liberty, that is like space alien weird.
[03:14:11.436 --> 03:14:12.557]  Like I've got five heads.
[03:14:13.308 --> 03:14:15.069]  That's not really radical, though.
[03:14:15.069 --> 03:14:19.772]  But to these radicals, of course I'm like a fire-breathing demon or something.
[03:14:19.772 --> 03:14:25.796]  Because I don't buy anything they say when Obama says that ISIS isn't Islamic or there's no boots on the ground.
[03:14:25.796 --> 03:14:27.417]  Because there are boots on the ground.
[03:14:27.417 --> 03:14:29.118]  The AP even admits it.
[03:14:29.118 --> 03:14:29.858]  That's the thing.
[03:14:29.858 --> 03:14:34.501]  They don't even care about getting mainstream media in line with their lies anymore.
[03:14:34.501 --> 03:14:37.543]  It has reached a crazy level of proportions.
[03:14:37.543 --> 03:14:40.685]  But what do you expect?
[03:14:40.685 --> 03:14:42.046]  What do you expect
[03:14:43.727 --> 03:15:11.502]  to happen here in this culture and in this society when they were on TV and radio, we've played these clips here before, we'll play them again today, BBC, CNN, they're going to blow that building up, get back, get back, they blow up building seven, we interview the deputy emergency manager, the number two in New York, he dies weeks after he's on, Barry Jennings, I interview the firefighters in person who are getting death threats, who heard the countdown to blow the towers up,
[03:15:12.742 --> 03:15:15.403]  Over the Red Cross was in charge of it.
[03:15:15.403 --> 03:15:18.024]  That's like above CIA for those that don't know.
[03:15:18.024 --> 03:15:21.025]  If you're a novice and don't know and you're laughing, go look it up.
[03:15:21.025 --> 03:15:25.347]  They use, the globalists have used them for 500 years at least.
[03:15:25.347 --> 03:15:29.629]  Literally Red Cross, Rosicrucians, Knights Templar, Illuminati.
[03:15:29.629 --> 03:15:30.909]  That's their front group.
[03:15:30.909 --> 03:15:31.950]  But the Red Cross was there.
[03:15:31.950 --> 03:15:34.831]  I talked to two different cops with the countdown to blow it up.
[03:15:36.158 --> 03:15:43.119]  This is the type of just insane stuff that is going on and unfolding in this society.
[03:15:43.119 --> 03:15:44.800]  The NORAD stand down.
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:16:02.983]  I want to go over some of the smoking guns of 9-11 today, but I wanted to spend a few minutes talking to you about where we're going and what we're building thanks to all of your support out there spreading the word about the transmission and the rest of it.
[03:16:04.867 --> 03:16:15.395]  If I was reaching a million people a week 17 years ago, 20 years ago I was reaching a few thousand people a week.
[03:16:15.395 --> 03:16:17.537]  And 18 years ago I was reaching a million a week.
[03:16:17.537 --> 03:16:21.180]  And 17 years ago I was reaching 3 million a week.
[03:16:21.180 --> 03:16:24.122]  You can see that we're now reaching 20 million a week.
[03:16:24.122 --> 03:16:31.087]  We have a responsibility to try to go to the next level and to really go for it all in the info war.
[03:16:31.087 --> 03:16:32.769]  To really try to defeat the globalist.
[03:16:34.728 --> 03:16:43.556]  And I would encourage all of you out there as well to realize that in your daily life,
[03:16:45.077 --> 03:16:46.657]  You've got to decide you can fight back.
[03:16:46.657 --> 03:16:48.798]  You've got to decide we can win.
[03:16:48.798 --> 03:16:51.418]  You've got to decide that, yeah, we know this bad stuff's happening.
[03:16:51.418 --> 03:16:54.959]  That's a positive thing to be aware of what's unfolding.
[03:16:54.959 --> 03:16:57.820]  That gives us a shot at turning this around.
[03:16:57.820 --> 03:17:06.742]  You've got to realize that the alternative is total slavery and turning the world over to premeditated evil.
[03:17:06.742 --> 03:17:09.282]  The establishment is lockstep.
[03:17:09.282 --> 03:17:12.343]  Boehner and people like
[03:17:14.699 --> 03:17:34.113]  Obama, when it comes to Obamacare, or going after the guns, or open borders, or bombing Syria, and arming Al-Qaeda to fight Al-Qaeda, they're in lockstep, and that's why they're in lockstep going after the Libertarian movement and the Tea Party.
[03:17:34.113 --> 03:17:39.597]  I've never been a supporter of the Tea Party, except when Ron Paul kind of started it, Republicans tried to take it over.
[03:17:39.597 --> 03:17:40.257]  I became a
[03:17:42.819 --> 03:17:46.762]  Supporter of it the last three years because the Republicans were unable to take it over.
[03:17:46.762 --> 03:17:50.185]  It was taking them over and the whole establishment lined up against it.
[03:17:50.185 --> 03:17:52.326]  That's when you know you need to support something.
[03:17:52.326 --> 03:17:53.787]  Whole establishment wants a border?
[03:17:53.787 --> 03:17:54.808]  You got to support it.
[03:17:54.808 --> 03:17:56.950]  Whole establishment supports gun control?
[03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:58.351]  You've got to be against it.
[03:17:58.351 --> 03:18:01.433]  Whole establishment wants to bomb Syria a year ago?
[03:18:01.433 --> 03:18:02.274]  We've got to be against it.
[03:18:03.789 --> 03:18:06.891]  Now the establishment's lining up to attack Al Qaeda?
[03:18:06.891 --> 03:18:17.095]  They have come up with mind control scams so incredible that I want ISIS to be bombed, but I know that'll just be a cover story and it's a fraud, so I've got to agree with Lou Rockwell.
[03:18:17.095 --> 03:18:24.959]  I think it's wrong probably, even though I can get the perspective of Rand Paul saying we need to go after ISIS, but saying don't support the rebels, because they are ISIS.
[03:18:24.959 --> 03:18:28.421]  He knew what Obama was going to do, showing he's a real statesman.
[03:18:28.421 --> 03:18:29.761]  Very, very exciting.
[03:18:32.346 --> 03:18:33.287]  We're going to go to break.
[03:18:33.287 --> 03:18:39.651]  We're going to come back and I'm going to go through an article written by Paul Joseph Watson back in June of 2005.
[03:18:39.651 --> 03:18:43.253]  The 10 Smoking Guns of 9-11.
[03:18:43.253 --> 03:18:44.974]  These are still the big smoking guns.
[03:18:44.974 --> 03:18:48.676]  Then we have 20 other points that tie into this I want to get into.
[03:18:48.676 --> 03:18:52.679]  And a bunch of video clips that have been compiled by the crew.
[03:18:53.786 --> 03:18:58.110]  With Norman Mineta, the Secretary of Transportation, saying Cheney gave stand down order.
[03:18:58.110 --> 03:19:04.495]  Building 7 montage, showing the different angles of it falling at free fall and being blown up.
[03:19:04.495 --> 03:19:08.138]  The 28 pages we video, we already pretty much played that.
[03:19:08.138 --> 03:19:10.460]  But the fact that Schaefer says he's talked to folks that have seen it.
[03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:14.064]  Of course, Congressman Jones has seen it and wants to get it released.
[03:19:14.064 --> 03:19:15.445]  And that it's Saudi Arabia.
[03:19:17.102 --> 03:19:20.265]  Saudi Arabia being involved in our government covering that up.
[03:19:20.265 --> 03:19:27.113]  The guys want to play me predicting that they use bin Laden to take the fall for attacking the World Trade Centers July 25, 2001.
[03:19:27.113 --> 03:19:35.261]  And we will also get into Sybil Edmonds, whistleblower, saying the government worked with al-Qaeda and she was listening to it.
[03:19:36.222 --> 03:19:37.323]  Jennings and Giuliani.
[03:19:37.323 --> 03:19:40.465]  Giuliani talking about bombs in the building and the towers being blown up.
[03:19:40.465 --> 03:19:47.251]  And BBC predicts WTC collapse 7, 30 minutes or 25 minutes before it fell and then trying to deny it.
[03:19:47.251 --> 03:19:53.876]  That's just some of the big smoking guns that tell us the official story is as fake as Santa Claus and a $3 bill.
[03:19:53.876 --> 03:19:57.718]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the InfoWars.com studios.
[03:20:01.192 --> 03:20:03.312]  If you own a business, you need customers, right?
[03:20:03.312 --> 03:20:07.793]  Well, your potential customers are listening to this radio program right now, and I can help you reach them.

[03:20:26.157 --> 03:20:28.477]  That's Mbrauer at GCNlive.com.
[03:20:29.705 --> 03:20:30.826]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:20:30.826 --> 03:20:35.309]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:41.033]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:20:41.033 --> 03:20:43.194]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[03:20:43.194 --> 03:20:44.615]  No word about IRAs.
[03:20:44.615 --> 03:20:47.277]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:47.277 --> 03:20:52.240]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:20:52.240 --> 03:20:52.501]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:52.501 --> 03:20:53.862]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:20:59.065 --> 03:21:01.448]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[03:21:01.448 --> 03:21:14.463]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[03:21:15.504 --> 03:21:17.425]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[03:21:17.425 --> 03:21:19.626]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[03:21:19.626 --> 03:21:23.548]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[03:21:23.548 --> 03:21:26.050]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[03:21:26.050 --> 03:21:34.074]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[03:21:34.634 --> 03:21:40.337]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[03:21:40.337 --> 03:21:47.300]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[03:21:48.280 --> 03:21:50.541]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:21:59.245 --> 03:22:00.786]  Open your eyes.
[03:22:00.786 --> 03:22:04.189]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:10.654]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[03:22:10.654 --> 03:22:19.021]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[03:22:19.021 --> 03:22:20.082]  Open your eyes.
[03:22:20.402 --> 03:22:35.927]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is the new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[03:24:19.131 --> 03:24:28.093]  The problem with something like 9-11 is there's so much proof the official story is a fraud.
[03:24:28.093 --> 03:24:37.755]  But what about the latest evidence that our government would work with Al Qaeda, renaming him ISIS or ISIL or whatever Obama's name to confuse the public is this week.
[03:24:39.309 --> 03:24:45.251]  That they would turn them loose to kill Christians all over the Middle East, and that they would open our border up so they could attack us here.
[03:24:45.251 --> 03:24:46.951]  That is aiding and abetting right there.
[03:24:46.951 --> 03:24:49.252]  That is inside job right there.
[03:24:49.252 --> 03:24:51.712]  That is criminal right there.
[03:24:51.712 --> 03:24:53.493]  So open and shut, boom!
[03:24:53.493 --> 03:25:05.556]  I don't ever want to hear I'm a traitor for pointing out the official story of 9-11 wasn't true, or that they were going to use those attacks to take our freedoms.
[03:25:07.423 --> 03:25:14.388]  Clearly, they now say Homeland Security is for returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, patriots, constitutionalists.
[03:25:14.388 --> 03:25:16.990]  Clearly, I predicted that back at the time.
[03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:26.136]  And there's all these clips to play, but I think we should play first, AJ predicts 9-11 back in July.
[03:25:26.136 --> 03:25:26.937]  This says July 21st.
[03:25:26.937 --> 03:25:35.943]  I think it was July 25th, 2001, in a two and a half hour access show I did, that if somebody's got the whole tape,
[03:25:37.788 --> 03:25:39.950]  I'll put a bounty out, a thousand bucks for it.
[03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:56.698]  I thought I had a copy around here because over the two and a half hours, I mean, I broke down every reason how they transform our society into a police state, the Rand Corporation documents, the National Stabilization Force, how they would use terrorism to do all this.
[03:25:56.698 --> 03:26:03.062]  And we could do like a whole hour special off that two and a half hour live access show I did that Jimmy Vaughn saw live.
[03:26:04.414 --> 03:26:09.736]  And then he saw it when it re-aired later, and everybody got real mad at me, because it aired on 9-11 a few months later.
[03:26:09.736 --> 03:26:19.521]  That night, when I was saying they'll attack the World Trade Center and the government did it, I'd said it two months before, and then I could never find the tape of it again.
[03:26:19.521 --> 03:26:26.083]  Somebody, again, found it and put it on YouTube, a short clip, but this isn't even the really meaty stuff.
[03:26:26.083 --> 03:26:30.245]  AJ predicts 9-11 from AXS TV back in July of 2001.
[03:26:30.245 --> 03:26:30.605]  Here it is.
[03:26:33.339 --> 03:26:44.446]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm so glad that you could join us today for this Wednesday, July 25th, 2001 broadcast.
[03:26:44.446 --> 03:26:52.432]  Tyranny is enveloping the globe, and the United States is a shining jewel the globalists want to bring down, and they will use terrorism as the pretext to get it done.
[03:26:52.432 --> 03:27:00.217]  He said, I'm going to put the call out that you call the White House
[03:27:01.553 --> 03:27:20.199]  And tell them, look, we've seen the news stories that you've wanted to blow things up, that you have blown things up, and that you're saying that four million of us are going to die and we need martial law and the Associated Press, and one of your little drills you had, and that we're aware of who the terrorists are if you pull this.
[03:27:20.199 --> 03:27:23.920]  This can stop this Hitlerian Reichstag event.
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:25.801]  I want to put the toll-free number up for Congress.
[03:27:27.745 --> 03:27:29.927]  And I won't want you to believe Alex Jones.
[03:27:29.927 --> 03:27:32.670]  I want you to go get these news stories off my website.
[03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:34.972]  I want you to call these major newspapers.
[03:27:34.972 --> 03:27:41.479]  I want you to find out these statements were true by the White House about preparing for martial law.
[03:27:41.479 --> 03:27:46.864]  And I want you to let them know that if there is any terrorism, we know who to blame.
[03:27:46.864 --> 03:27:47.405]  The point is,
[03:27:49.045 --> 03:27:51.367]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[03:27:51.367 --> 03:28:08.545]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War, and whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now, and sits on the board of Iridium Satellite, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[03:28:08.545 --> 03:28:10.226]  I want the White House numbers up there now.
[03:28:11.218 --> 03:28:21.085]  A big part of this solution, after you research all the government terrorism and check out what I'm saying is true, call the White House and tell them, we know the government's planning terrorism.
[03:28:21.085 --> 03:28:23.847]  We know Oklahoma City and World Trade Center was terrorism.
[03:28:23.847 --> 03:28:27.570]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun.
[03:28:27.570 --> 03:28:30.912]  If you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[03:28:30.912 --> 03:28:35.255]  Or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[03:28:35.255 --> 03:28:37.497]  And you could save the planet.
[03:28:37.497 --> 03:28:40.359]  I'm calling it Operation Expose the Government Terror.
[03:28:44.651 --> 03:28:45.732]  From the archive.
[03:28:45.732 --> 03:28:50.516]  I had more hair then and it was a little bit skinnier.
[03:28:50.516 --> 03:28:53.898]  I get sick of looking at myself all day but it's part of the job here.
[03:28:53.898 --> 03:28:57.381]  So there you have it from way back in 2001.
[03:28:57.381 --> 03:29:12.493]  Here we are 13 years and two months later and I'm yet again saying they're clearly going to let Al-Qaeda attack us under the name ISIS or they'll do it, the criminal elements that run our government, and use that to launch a bunch of new wars
[03:29:15.362 --> 03:29:20.584]  And have no bid weapons contracts and sell the idea of spying on us and violating our rights.
[03:29:20.584 --> 03:29:22.105]  This is how they take over.
[03:29:22.105 --> 03:29:25.506]  And I know you know that as a regular listener.
[03:29:25.506 --> 03:29:26.947]  Many of you knew it before I was born.
[03:29:26.947 --> 03:29:28.267]  You know how the world worked.
[03:29:28.267 --> 03:29:32.429]  How do we get this information out to everybody else so that we don't keep reliving this?
[03:29:34.226 --> 03:29:35.467]  This is ridiculous.
[03:29:35.467 --> 03:29:42.234]  I predicted last year that they would end up saying we had to go into Syria to stop Al-Qaeda there, but they were openly arming, and now they're doing it.
[03:29:42.234 --> 03:29:46.458]  I mean, it's so predictable, but it's also so over-the-top.
[03:29:46.458 --> 03:29:49.561]  We'll talk to our reporters in New York, coming up, and more smoky things.
[03:29:49.561 --> 03:29:50.822]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.822 --> 03:29:53.365]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.365 --> 03:29:56.028]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.854 --> 03:30:01.874]  I don't know what it is.
[03:30:01.874 --> 03:30:03.675]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[03:30:03.675 --> 03:30:07.796]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[03:30:07.796 --> 03:30:09.396]  It's like I don't even exist.
[03:30:09.396 --> 03:30:11.277]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[03:30:11.277 --> 03:30:12.657]  Does this seem familiar?
[03:30:12.657 --> 03:30:15.398]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[03:30:15.398 --> 03:30:25.761]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies, many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[03:30:25.761 --> 03:30:28.442]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[03:30:28.442 --> 03:30:28.882]  Look it up.
[03:30:29.122 --> 03:30:35.949]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[03:33:02.148 --> 03:33:11.154]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.154 --> 03:33:15.177]  Coming to you from the George Washington Studios.
[03:33:15.177 --> 03:33:17.038]  Only TV viewers know what I'm talking about.
[03:33:18.735 --> 03:33:20.141]  Don't tread on me.
[03:33:20.141 --> 03:33:20.743]  Gotta love it.
[03:33:36.820 --> 03:33:37.581]  That's what's happening.
[03:33:37.581 --> 03:33:43.027]  America was in a trance in 1913 when the private banks took over, the offshore banks.
[03:33:43.027 --> 03:33:44.788]  They slowly got the nation into debt.
[03:33:44.788 --> 03:33:57.141]  They created Hitler and the communists so they would have an outside threat to turn us into a police state and allow those other empires to go around robbing and stealing so they could have culpable, non-culpable deniability.
[03:33:58.257 --> 03:33:58.997]  We're good to go.
[03:34:14.184 --> 03:34:23.333]  But once you provoke the people of this republic, and liberty lovers not just here but worldwide, it is the beginning of the end of the tyranny.
[03:34:23.333 --> 03:34:33.042]  Once the genie's out of the bottle, once people know the manipulation and the full spectrum dominance program that the crime syndicate worldwide is using, it's game over.
[03:34:35.014 --> 03:34:37.215]  And that's now the point we've gotten to.
[03:34:37.215 --> 03:34:56.104]  One reason I also like the new studio setup is that more and more we got good mics in there with the crew, and we are going to be able to then just, hey, I want to hear what Jakari Jackson thinks about what's going on, and then we can literally just talk to Jakari in there and have like a discussion like we're here together.
[03:34:56.104 --> 03:34:58.725]  Like, I didn't tell you guys I was going to do this.
[03:34:58.725 --> 03:35:00.246]  Is he piped through so I can talk to him on air?
[03:35:03.544 --> 03:35:05.825]  Okay, well, that's the plan.
[03:35:05.825 --> 03:35:06.425]  Absolutely.
[03:35:06.425 --> 03:35:07.385]  We'll pipe him through.
[03:35:07.385 --> 03:35:08.686]  Yeah, sure.
[03:35:08.686 --> 03:35:13.467]  But just down the road, then I will be able to sit back and talk to everybody that's in there.
[03:35:13.467 --> 03:35:18.289]  We'll be able to pan over and talk to Rob Doo, also known as Doocifer.
[03:35:18.289 --> 03:35:20.869]  Let's go ahead and pan over to him for TV viewers.
[03:35:20.869 --> 03:35:22.710]  Dun, dun, dun.
[03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:27.271]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen, with Marcos Morales.
[03:35:27.271 --> 03:35:28.232]  There you go.
[03:35:28.232 --> 03:35:28.692]  All right.
[03:35:29.537 --> 03:35:32.980]  See we got a few crew members around here that got names that are so cool sounding.
[03:35:32.980 --> 03:35:37.963]  I just walk around saying them like, Jacari Jackson, Marcos Morales.
[03:35:37.963 --> 03:35:42.066]  Who else am I saying has a really cool sounding name?
[03:35:42.066 --> 03:35:44.428]  I mean Max Keiser's got one, but he doesn't work with us.
[03:35:44.428 --> 03:35:46.109]  Max Keiser.
[03:35:46.109 --> 03:35:52.714]  We can have a vote with the listeners, like not what your favorite color is or fantasy football, but who has a cooler name?
[03:35:52.714 --> 03:35:53.715]  Buckley Hammond.
[03:35:55.267 --> 03:35:57.267]  That's definitely an unusual name.
[03:35:57.267 --> 03:36:05.369]  Uh, or Jakari, you gotta see Buckley Hammond, Jakari Jackson, Marcos Morales.
[03:36:05.369 --> 03:36:06.409]  Uh-huh!
[03:36:06.409 --> 03:36:09.390]  Gonna have the vote on InfoWars?
[03:36:09.390 --> 03:36:12.070]  Or Ducifer?
[03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:15.411]  That is the giant hippie.
[03:36:15.411 --> 03:36:20.732]  Anyways, the whole point is, we're just, alright, I always get dingy by the third hour already.
[03:36:21.804 --> 03:36:23.465]  And I've been up since 6 a.m.
[03:36:23.465 --> 03:36:24.205]  and I'm feeling good.
[03:36:24.205 --> 03:36:25.885]  I am a little bit goofy here.
[03:36:25.885 --> 03:36:28.446]  So let me get serious back to the hardcore subject.
[03:36:28.446 --> 03:36:31.007]  I'm gonna get to some more of the Smoking Guns in some video clips here in a moment.
[03:36:31.007 --> 03:36:31.927]  Building 7.
[03:36:31.927 --> 03:36:34.088]  But first off, who do we have?
[03:36:34.088 --> 03:36:36.549]  Joe Biggs or Lee Ann McAdoo there on the ground in New York?
[03:36:37.639 --> 03:36:43.342]  We're going to talk to him for about five minutes, and then Leanne McAdoo to see what's happened since I talked to him two hours ago.
[03:36:43.342 --> 03:36:44.042]  This is a great thing.
[03:36:44.042 --> 03:36:48.845]  We're here broadcasting worldwide, AM, FM, internet, video streams, podcasts.
[03:36:48.845 --> 03:36:55.368]  They're in New York, just all together bringing you the cutting edge of true analysis here.
[03:36:55.368 --> 03:36:56.949]  Let's go to Joe Biggs.
[03:36:56.949 --> 03:36:59.611]  Joe, you've been sitting there for 10 minutes since I've been ranting.
[03:36:59.611 --> 03:37:02.252]  What do you think for you waking up to 9-11 truth?
[03:37:02.252 --> 03:37:03.393]  When did that begin to happen?
[03:37:04.033 --> 03:37:07.914]  And 9-11 Truth, folks, is just not buying the official ridiculous lie.
[03:37:07.914 --> 03:37:12.456]  Like Obama saying, ISIS isn't Islamic, or there's no boots on the ground.
[03:37:12.456 --> 03:37:15.397]  It just means, listen, I don't believe everything you're telling me.
[03:37:15.397 --> 03:37:16.457]  There's more to this.
[03:37:16.457 --> 03:37:18.578]  What was your 9-11 Truth moment?
[03:37:18.578 --> 03:37:19.698]  Or was it a process?
[03:37:19.698 --> 03:37:23.520]  And what do you think the big smoking gun of 9-11 is, Joe Biggs?
[03:37:23.520 --> 03:37:29.161]  Well, first off, I'd like to throw my name in the hat for the coolest name, Alex, as Joe Biggs.
[03:37:29.161 --> 03:37:33.023]  Then for the waking up part, that happened my first year in Iraq.
[03:37:34.053 --> 03:37:42.456]  I was actually trying to buy a Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie so I could sit down in my little hooch and relax and watch it.
[03:37:42.456 --> 03:37:44.957]  And what it was was a documentary about 9-11.
[03:37:44.957 --> 03:37:53.440]  And instead of watching Jean-Claude Van Damme, I watched this documentary on the facts, the smoking guns, things that happened.
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:38:00.602]  And I began to reevaluate myself and my stance and questioning whether or not
[03:38:01.497 --> 03:38:05.279]  My being in the military and being deployed was for the right reasons.
[03:38:05.279 --> 03:38:11.983]  Because, like I said before, I joined because of the attacks at 9-11 here in New York City, where we're at right now.
[03:38:11.983 --> 03:38:15.685]  We're at the bottom of the new Trade Center.
[03:38:15.685 --> 03:38:17.886]  So that was a defining moment for me.
[03:38:17.886 --> 03:38:22.929]  Like I said, it felt like I was betrayed by someone I love very much, which is my country.
[03:38:22.929 --> 03:38:26.771]  I still do love my country and I'm going to stand up and fight for it as much as I can.
[03:38:26.771 --> 03:38:30.013]  But I am pissed off at the government and, you know,
[03:38:30.646 --> 03:38:33.307]  This entire cover-up, I don't like it whatsoever.
[03:38:33.307 --> 03:38:36.688]  You know, so that documentary woke me up.
[03:38:36.688 --> 03:38:41.109]  I began sharing it with my friends and now I am where I am today.
[03:38:41.109 --> 03:38:46.291]  I can't tell you, Joe, how many of our listeners over the years came to us via documentary films.
[03:38:46.291 --> 03:38:49.852]  That's why Rob Jacobson is always harping, we gotta make films again, we gotta make films again.
[03:38:49.852 --> 03:38:51.512]  Well, we make films every day.
[03:38:51.512 --> 03:38:53.093]  We make many documentaries.
[03:38:53.093 --> 03:38:54.093]  But it is true that
[03:38:54.969 --> 03:39:03.531]  I kind of want to make films that are so powerful, and I produce Loose Change as well, and I'm in Zeitgeist, even though they didn't ask for my permission in the first one that was a big hit.
[03:39:03.531 --> 03:39:10.833]  But the point I'm getting at is the power of film really is revolutionary, and I want to encourage the viewers out there.
[03:39:10.833 --> 03:39:14.314]  You're just as smart as we are, probably smarter in some ways.
[03:39:14.314 --> 03:39:16.154]  Where are you doing a podcast?
[03:39:16.154 --> 03:39:17.855]  Where are you making films?
[03:39:17.855 --> 03:39:20.876]  Where are you taking action?
[03:39:20.876 --> 03:39:22.256]  Together, culturally,
[03:39:23.334 --> 03:39:35.144]  If we promote liberty and if we shop, you know, thinking about where the money's going and support local and support liberty-based media, we will supplant the whole system.
[03:39:35.144 --> 03:39:38.867]  I think 13 years after 9-11, things are so clear.
[03:39:38.867 --> 03:39:46.634]  People don't get mad at you now if you're a quote 9-11 truther because they've been lied to so much they get questioning, even if they believe the official story, Joe.
[03:39:48.212 --> 03:39:56.119]  Uh, yeah, today, I mean, right behind me, there's been quite a large group of people passing out pamphlets, saying, uh, things like that, saying, hey, do you really know what happened?
[03:39:56.119 --> 03:40:01.563]  You know, some people say, you know, you know, screw you, basically, and walk by, and they don't want to hear anything.
[03:40:01.563 --> 03:40:07.168]  You know, and I've actually had one person came up and started cussing at me earlier, but, uh, you know, that's just how it happens.
[03:40:07.168 --> 03:40:10.110]  I told him that he could take his purse and move on.
[03:40:10.110 --> 03:40:15.295]  But, uh, you know, there's a lot of people out here that are smart, that know what happened, they're awake, and, you know, from what I've seen,
[03:40:16.348 --> 03:40:20.349]  Ten years ago, until now, you have a lot more people that are well-informed.
[03:40:20.349 --> 03:40:22.370]  And yes, film is very powerful.
[03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:27.312]  Those documentaries, like I said, changed my life, and I know a lot of my other friends' lives as well.
[03:40:27.312 --> 03:40:32.114]  So, that is a very important tool to help get out that information.
[03:40:32.114 --> 03:40:35.295]  What do you think the biggest smoking gun is?
[03:40:35.295 --> 03:40:37.776]  For me, it's Building 7, because... Oh, yeah, of course.
[03:40:37.776 --> 03:40:39.536]  I mean, that without a doubt right there.
[03:40:39.536 --> 03:40:41.057]  I mean, that's the seller right there.
[03:40:43.068 --> 03:40:47.710]  I mean, that's where I'm standing at right now, the base of, right behind Josh, if you want to see.
[03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:48.811]  This is the new Building 7.
[03:40:48.811 --> 03:40:53.394]  Oh yeah.
[03:40:53.394 --> 03:40:55.735]  So earlier today, it was pretty interesting.
[03:40:55.735 --> 03:41:01.379]  When we first got out here, I actually had a uniformed police officer who didn't want to be on film, so I respected him.
[03:41:01.379 --> 03:41:03.400]  He's about to retire in two months, he said.
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:06.322]  But he came up and he said he was one of the first responders.
[03:41:06.854 --> 03:41:07.094]  I don't
[03:41:29.878 --> 03:41:32.518]  You know, there's people out here that know what really happened.
[03:41:32.518 --> 03:41:48.501]  You have first responders that are passionate about trying to get this information out, and they're not going to sleep knowing that people are trying to cover it up.
[03:41:48.501 --> 03:41:51.502]  OK, so yeah, like I said, we're at right now.
[03:41:51.502 --> 03:41:56.023]  We're right outside of the new One World Center, which is right over here to the right.
[03:41:56.023 --> 03:41:57.263]  Josh is going to pan over and show you.
[03:41:59.241 --> 03:42:01.342]  This is a brand new building.
[03:42:01.342 --> 03:42:05.223]  It's still under construction for the most part, down around the ground levels.
[03:42:05.223 --> 03:42:08.704]  They're still doing some exterior work.
[03:42:08.704 --> 03:42:15.986]  But the police have completely blocked off any chances of getting near the memorial area today until 6 p.m.
[03:42:15.986 --> 03:42:19.087]  This whole area has just been locked down.
[03:42:19.087 --> 03:42:21.828]  Military has had a presence out here as well.
[03:42:21.828 --> 03:42:25.109]  You'll see Army and Air Force paired together.
[03:42:25.109 --> 03:42:27.050]  You'll see one soldier, one airman walking around.
[03:42:31.329 --> 03:42:33.550]  So, that's been pretty crazy.
[03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:43.254]  There's a man over here, he is retired Special Forces, and he's standing in front of the De Oppresa Libre, which means to oppress, to liberate the oppressed.
[03:42:43.254 --> 03:42:51.217]  They have a monument for the, basically the first Special Forces responders who went into Afghanistan to go after the Taliban after the attacks.
[03:42:52.355 --> 03:42:53.716]  So there's a memorial for that.
[03:42:53.716 --> 03:42:58.237]  He stands over there and he's been speaking to people about the missions and things like that.
[03:42:58.237 --> 03:43:00.378]  And I asked him, I said, do you feel betrayed at all?
[03:43:00.378 --> 03:43:05.620]  Do you feel like, like I feel that I have been lied to and betrayed by my country?
[03:43:05.620 --> 03:43:11.883]  And that, you know, in essence, all the lives we lost were for the global elites to make more money.
[03:43:11.883 --> 03:43:17.365]  I mean, Feinstein made so much money off of this incident that it's just mind blowing.
[03:43:17.365 --> 03:43:19.366]  You know, what was it?
[03:43:19.366 --> 03:43:20.987]  Billions of dollars probably.
[03:43:20.987 --> 03:43:21.627]  Her husband.
[03:43:21.627 --> 03:43:21.767]  Yeah.
[03:43:23.666 --> 03:43:26.647]  The insurance, I mean, it's just, it's mind-blowing.
[03:43:26.647 --> 03:43:35.549]  Well, Larry Silverstein had double insurance on it, only got it two months before it happened, and we just have so much evidence.
[03:43:35.549 --> 03:43:41.030]  Joe, we're going to come back to you guys in just a moment and get Leanne McAdoo's top smoking gun.
[03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:43.690]  Thank you so much, Joe, and we've got a lot more coming up tonight.
[03:43:43.690 --> 03:43:49.792]  You guys have done a fantastic job, and for myself, the whole crew, and the viewers, thank you for your dedication, because, hey,
[03:43:50.894 --> 03:43:53.895]  I don't see it as bad that you went and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:43:53.895 --> 03:43:56.855]  You meant well, even though you were manipulated into it.
[03:43:56.855 --> 03:43:59.296]  It takes even more courage to admit you were scammed.
[03:43:59.296 --> 03:44:01.437]  We've all been scammed at one time or another.
[03:44:01.437 --> 03:44:18.120]  What matters is admitting we were wrong later, and then now truly fighting for the Republic, really fighting for the truth, and now it's not you getting a DVD that, you know, somebody was selling in Iraq, just like in the movie Hurt Locker with little kids selling them.
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:19.821]  You are now reaching out to the people.
[03:44:20.876 --> 03:44:21.657]  in the info war.
[03:44:34.241 --> 03:44:34.822]  I don't know.
[03:44:55.151 --> 03:44:56.673]  And here you are doing a great job now.
[03:44:56.673 --> 03:44:58.094]  People love what you're doing.
[03:44:58.094 --> 03:45:05.503]  And it's all about people that don't think of themselves as journalists or as info warriors doing it because you don't have a choice.
[03:45:05.503 --> 03:45:12.410]  And it's going to be the rank-and-file people like you and others getting involved, engaging, that will bring down the new world order.
[03:45:12.410 --> 03:45:13.552]  So thank you so much, Joe.
[03:45:13.552 --> 03:45:15.574]  We'll go talk to Leanne McAdoo here in just a moment.
[03:45:16.340 --> 03:45:17.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:17.981]  Thank you.
[03:45:17.981 --> 03:45:20.782]  So excited to be working with Joe Biggs.
[03:45:20.782 --> 03:45:23.262]  And again, we're here in the new studio working out the bugs.
[03:45:23.262 --> 03:45:25.463]  Haven't seen hardly any bugs today.
[03:45:25.463 --> 03:45:27.324]  I was expecting a whole bunch of train wreck stuff.
[03:45:27.324 --> 03:45:30.025]  In fact, it would have been better for ratings.
[03:45:30.025 --> 03:45:34.446]  We'd have a light fall on my head or something like Hillary Clinton on 60 Minutes.
[03:45:34.446 --> 03:45:38.768]  Though there was an extra light panel on, which was even cooler.
[03:45:38.768 --> 03:45:41.329]  Made me look like one of those giant Martian eggheads.
[03:45:41.329 --> 03:45:43.430]  Because I already kind of look like that.
[03:45:43.430 --> 03:45:44.310]  If people didn't realize,
[03:45:45.848 --> 03:45:47.549]  My dad's a dentist and he thinks it's interesting.
[03:45:47.549 --> 03:45:48.970]  I talked to an oral surgeon once, it's true.
[03:45:48.970 --> 03:45:52.192]  I have an incredibly wide jaw, like a pit bull.
[03:45:52.192 --> 03:45:58.256]  So it's not that I even have a weak chin, it's that this part of the cranium is very big and this is wide as well.
[03:45:58.256 --> 03:45:59.877]  So I'm kind of a freak, folks.
[03:45:59.877 --> 03:46:02.219]  Maybe I'm a genetic mutation, huh?
[03:46:02.219 --> 03:46:03.239]  I mean, look at that.
[03:46:03.239 --> 03:46:05.481]  I mean, look at the size of that head on those shoulders.
[03:46:05.481 --> 03:46:06.422]  Look at the size of that head!
[03:46:06.422 --> 03:46:08.123]  It has its own weather systems!
[03:46:09.312 --> 03:46:11.453]  Who's the guy that... Alright, that's enough.
[03:46:11.453 --> 03:46:12.273]  That's enough, guys.
[03:46:12.273 --> 03:46:13.454]  That's even blurred.
[03:46:13.454 --> 03:46:15.234]  I need to quit screwing around here.
[03:46:15.234 --> 03:46:15.894]  Sorry.
[03:46:15.894 --> 03:46:19.076]  Like, I start screwing around and then I tell them to stop screwing around.
[03:46:19.076 --> 03:46:23.517]  Who's the guy that does the Secret Agent comedy movies?
[03:46:23.517 --> 03:46:25.238]  And he's Fat Bastard on it as well.
[03:46:25.238 --> 03:46:27.579]  He plays himself.
[03:46:27.579 --> 03:46:30.760]  Austin Powers, but what's the name of the actor?
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:31.960]  Mike Myers.
[03:46:31.960 --> 03:46:33.521]  Yeah, he did some funnier movies.
[03:46:34.668 --> 03:46:39.891]  Uh, where he's sitting there talking about his kid's head and, look at the size of that head!
[03:46:39.891 --> 03:46:42.013]  Has its own weather systems!
[03:46:42.013 --> 03:46:45.595]  So that's all part of our Scottish, Scottish independence this week.
[03:46:45.595 --> 03:46:51.179]  We have Scottish John who's been out picketing and promoting the Second Amendment for ten years that I've known him here in Austin.
[03:46:51.179 --> 03:46:54.000]  And he's a Scott, got the thick Scott accent.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:57.643]  He's gonna be in studio with us tomorrow to talk about, uh, the
[03:47:00.296 --> 03:47:06.299]  Scottish independence vote that is coming up and more teleprompter free radio and television right now.
[03:47:06.299 --> 03:47:12.642]  Let's take you live to Klandathu where our forces have just engaged the main bug fleet on their home world.
[03:47:12.642 --> 03:47:15.363]  Excuse me, that's Starship Troopers.
[03:47:15.363 --> 03:47:24.068]  I take you now live to New York City on the edge of the barricades to keep the slaves away, hence any of our ideas get out.
[03:47:24.648 --> 03:47:26.630]  I think I see a Tyranny Response Team shirt over there.
[03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:28.031]  That guy might be a listener.
[03:47:28.031 --> 03:47:34.816]  Leanne McAdoo, what is your take 13 years later there at Ground Zero?
[03:47:34.816 --> 03:47:36.157]  Hi Alex, Leanne McAdoo.
[03:47:36.157 --> 03:47:43.082]  I am very happy to be here and I am standing outside one of what I think is one of the smoking guns of 9-11.
[03:47:44.605 --> 03:47:48.548]  The brand new and improved World Trade Center building number seven.
[03:47:48.548 --> 03:47:56.193]  It's right behind us and I think there's a consensus around here that anyone, just look at the physics, just look at the physics.
[03:47:56.193 --> 03:48:00.056]  They keep saying two planes, three buildings, do the math.
[03:48:00.496 --> 03:48:02.938]  That's a huge smoking gun.
[03:48:02.938 --> 03:48:04.799]  Larry Silverstein profited.
[03:48:04.799 --> 03:48:10.143]  He got more than double what he owed on the building back in blood money and insurance money.
[03:48:10.143 --> 03:48:12.125]  So quite the payout there.
[03:48:12.125 --> 03:48:18.289]  But if I had to say another smoking gun, I'm sorry, but it's the invisible plane that hit the Pentagon.
[03:48:18.289 --> 03:48:19.350]  I mean, I've looked at the pictures.
[03:48:19.350 --> 03:48:21.191]  Why are you being racist?
[03:48:21.191 --> 03:48:23.893]  Yeah, you know, I like to educate myself.
[03:48:23.893 --> 03:48:28.617]  I know a lot of people would prefer to just, you know, watch the game and that was something we noticed.
[03:48:29.042 --> 03:48:32.103]  We were talking about that last night at dinner before the president came on to speak.
[03:48:32.103 --> 03:48:36.644]  Just how much patriotism has been lost in this country.
[03:48:36.644 --> 03:48:50.328]  There was a time when people, even if they were at a bar, out to dinner, hanging out, if they knew the president was coming on to speak about something like what he was talking about last night, basically bringing us into a new war with Syria that's going to extend beyond his presidency.
[03:48:51.008 --> 03:48:53.068]  People would have stopped to pay attention.
[03:48:53.068 --> 03:48:54.109]  But nobody even cared.
[03:48:54.109 --> 03:49:00.250]  And in fact, they were pretty upset that we asked them to change the channel so that we could listen to what the president had to say.
[03:49:00.250 --> 03:49:01.630]  We've become a total joke.
[03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:02.850]  Our country's become a joke.
[03:49:02.850 --> 03:49:04.330]  The presidency has become a joke.
[03:49:04.330 --> 03:49:08.031]  And we're not bashing, because I know you, personally, your view on this.
[03:49:08.031 --> 03:49:08.931]  I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[03:49:08.931 --> 03:49:09.811]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[03:49:09.811 --> 03:49:11.732]  It's not that we like bashing America.
[03:49:11.732 --> 03:49:13.732]  There's still a lot of great people here.
[03:49:13.732 --> 03:49:16.333]  It's that you've just got so many entitled.
[03:49:16.333 --> 03:49:17.133]  Here's an example.
[03:49:17.133 --> 03:49:18.533]  I went to a local community pool.
[03:49:19.946 --> 03:49:25.408]  With my children yesterday, and there were some yuppies in the shallow end, two lovebirds kissing.
[03:49:25.408 --> 03:49:28.389]  They were both about 25 college students.
[03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:34.331]  And my daughters were splashing and racing, and a little bit of water, a little bit, because I happened to be watching them.
[03:49:34.331 --> 03:49:36.512]  I was sitting on the side drying off.
[03:49:36.512 --> 03:49:38.533]  Happened to hit the lady in the face.
[03:49:38.533 --> 03:49:40.353]  And she was like, oh, oh, what are you?
[03:49:40.353 --> 03:49:41.134]  Oh, is this?
[03:49:41.134 --> 03:49:41.514]  I mean, what?
[03:49:42.774 --> 03:49:58.539]  And all these so-called yuppies get so mad by families with kids, like they're revolted by it or something, and it's this entitlement, it's this decadence, it's this, I don't want to know, I want to play fantasy football, that the system is banking on.
[03:49:58.539 --> 03:50:00.280]  It's scary.
[03:50:00.280 --> 03:50:01.380]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:50:01.380 --> 03:50:07.162]  Right, and that's how they know it's going to be so easy to control this narrative, and the kids that are, you know, just tomorrow,
[03:50:07.694 --> 03:50:13.281]  They're going to be teenagers for the first time, first time teenagers that didn't actually experience 9-11.
[03:50:13.281 --> 03:50:14.122]  They weren't alive.
[03:50:14.122 --> 03:50:26.917]  And so they're counting on to just continue regurgitating this, their narrative of how things happened and hoping that the rest of the people who were there, who could see with their own eyes, will just buy their story.
[03:50:26.917 --> 03:50:27.598]  They're just hoping.
[03:50:28.118 --> 03:50:32.220]  But that's the problem is that a lot of those kids are, you know, they're the internet generation.
[03:50:32.220 --> 03:50:34.262]  So they're going to look at these pictures.
[03:50:34.262 --> 03:50:39.024]  Hold on, we're going to skip this network break so we can have time to get into some of the smoking guns.
[03:50:39.024 --> 03:50:40.885]  But Leigh-Anne, I'm going to come back to you in a moment.
[03:50:40.885 --> 03:50:45.848]  Let's cut to the studio shot right now of Nico and Buckley.
[03:50:45.848 --> 03:50:48.570]  Look, Buckley looks like a Russian gangster sitting there.
[03:50:49.341 --> 03:50:53.644]  And so people are always trying to claim that we work for Putin, the Vatican, Israel, or something.
[03:50:53.644 --> 03:50:55.545]  I want to say it's all true, folks.
[03:50:55.545 --> 03:50:57.086]  There is Buckley.
[03:50:57.086 --> 03:51:03.009]  His real name is Vladimir Bogunovsky.
[03:51:03.009 --> 03:51:07.972]  He's also codenamed the Wolf.
[03:51:07.972 --> 03:51:15.097]  And his top henchman beside him, Niko, the jiu-jitsu master.
[03:51:15.097 --> 03:51:16.618]  He grew up east in Russia.
[03:51:19.308 --> 03:51:22.469]  I shouldn't even joke around, it'll be a whole new conspiracy theory.
[03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:26.070]  Actually, folks, Nico is Bill Hicks.
[03:51:26.070 --> 03:51:32.193]  It's true.
[03:51:32.193 --> 03:51:32.653]  I'm sorry.
[03:51:32.653 --> 03:51:35.454]  This is supposed to be a serious fourth hour.
[03:51:35.454 --> 03:51:38.695]  Everybody knows that that's probably not a good idea.
[03:51:38.695 --> 03:51:39.916]  That's why I quit doing the fourth hour.
[03:51:39.916 --> 03:51:44.217]  Because I'm just, after three hours being so serious, I can't handle it anymore.
[03:51:44.217 --> 03:51:45.198]  It is incredibly serious.
[03:51:46.963 --> 03:51:51.285]  They could stage a new 9-11 and blame it on ISIS or let ISIS in to do it.
[03:51:51.285 --> 03:51:57.027]  And they're so arrogant, and the TV heads don't seem to care, and we see all the preparations for it.
[03:51:57.027 --> 03:52:05.430]  I see them getting ready for a nuclear 9-11, and Obama says the number one threat he sees is a mushroom cloud in New York.
[03:52:05.430 --> 03:52:13.873]  So, that's what my gut tells me, is something really huge is on the horizon, and that we're seen as such chumps by the globalists, that they're going to pull something big.
[03:52:13.873 --> 03:52:14.373]  What do you think?
[03:52:15.333 --> 03:52:17.034]  Well, and that's exactly right.
[03:52:17.034 --> 03:52:29.663]  He says that's his biggest fear, and then they go around poking the nuclear bear, trying to provoke Putin, and one of the only countries that is basically saying, yay, we've got nukes and we're going to use them if you make us.
[03:52:29.663 --> 03:52:31.564]  But, I mean, why be closed-minded?
[03:52:31.564 --> 03:52:35.227]  I mean, they're trying to promote, you know, all sorts of stuff now.
[03:52:35.227 --> 03:52:37.828]  So what's wrong with poking the bear?
[03:52:37.828 --> 03:52:42.312]  Hey, apparently, as long as he's got nukes, that's what the kids want to do these days.
[03:52:43.871 --> 03:52:45.334]  I don't want to give him any ideas now.
[03:52:45.334 --> 03:52:46.777]  That'll be a whole new term out there.
[03:52:46.777 --> 03:52:53.713]  I guess nuclear war will be like a new fetish, you know, where you destroy... I guess nihilists are kind of into that.
[03:52:53.713 --> 03:52:54.374]  What do you think, Leon?
[03:52:55.185 --> 03:53:01.233]  Well, I mean, they clearly bathe in the blood of all these deaths that they've committed.
[03:53:01.233 --> 03:53:02.414]  They revel in it.
[03:53:02.414 --> 03:53:03.395]  They celebrate it.
[03:53:03.395 --> 03:53:05.318]  So why not just see?
[03:53:05.318 --> 03:53:06.639]  Why are you being close-minded?
[03:53:06.639 --> 03:53:08.782]  I mean, you haven't tried bathing in blood.
[03:53:08.782 --> 03:53:09.783]  You're right, you know.
[03:53:09.783 --> 03:53:11.486]  Maybe it's magnificent.
[03:53:11.486 --> 03:53:11.866]  Who knows?
[03:53:11.866 --> 03:53:13.809]  There's actually a fountain over here with a big...
[03:53:14.369 --> 03:53:20.092]  Looks like kind of blood platelets here in Larry Silverstein's fountain to commemorate those who survived.
[03:53:20.092 --> 03:53:23.254]  He probably comes out at midnight like Nosferatu.
[03:53:23.254 --> 03:53:24.615]  Actually, can we pull up Nosferatu?
[03:53:24.615 --> 03:53:29.178]  Because Larry Silverstein starred in the 1927 original Nosferatu.
[03:53:29.178 --> 03:53:37.943]  We've actually got a shot of him right after he filed the insurance policy on 9-11 a few months before he went out and had a celebratory snack.
[03:53:37.943 --> 03:53:39.804]  Let's see if we can put Nosferatu behind me.
[03:53:39.804 --> 03:53:40.784]  There you go.
[03:53:40.784 --> 03:53:43.526]  We can actually get a video clip of Larry Silverstein.
[03:53:47.203 --> 03:53:49.444]  Pardon me.
[03:53:49.444 --> 03:53:57.547]  So what I'm curious too is like you see the people celebrating when they actually see all the rioting and things going on in Ferguson.
[03:53:57.547 --> 03:54:00.268]  You saw how that affected people around the world.
[03:54:00.268 --> 03:54:02.969]  People were saying, yay, the Americans are finally waking up.
[03:54:02.969 --> 03:54:04.170]  They're finally fighting back.
[03:54:04.170 --> 03:54:08.311]  They finally realized that they're living in a police state and they're rooting for us.
[03:54:08.311 --> 03:54:14.674]  They're rooting for the American people to wake up and to realize that we are, our government is occupied.
[03:54:15.134 --> 03:54:20.755]  Exactly, but again, it's fine to start with going out and demonstrating for the First Amendment.
[03:54:20.755 --> 03:54:24.856]  But we need to go out and talk to the cops when they're not in riot gear to wake them up to what's happening.
[03:54:24.856 --> 03:54:29.917]  Just like that police officer came over to Biggs earlier and said he's awake.
[03:54:29.917 --> 03:54:37.179]  Only reason I'm saying let's make friends with the police is because compared to the general public, I'm actually able to wake police up or they're already awake.
[03:54:38.467 --> 03:54:39.690]  Because they're in the system.
[03:54:39.690 --> 03:54:41.355]  They know something's wrong, most of them.
[03:54:41.355 --> 03:54:43.641]  Most of them aren't just bullies for no reason.
[03:54:43.641 --> 03:54:45.787]  They're all under peer pressure and compartmentalized.
[03:54:46.843 --> 03:54:54.226]  From doing this 20 years, I've just discovered the military is just so awake, and then the police are the second best group.
[03:54:54.226 --> 03:55:00.009]  In my experience, that's why they want us fighting with them, because the system absolutely hates them.
[03:55:00.009 --> 03:55:07.372]  That's why they demonize the veterans and things, is because they're worried about anybody that could stop the takeover when it becomes incredibly obvious.
[03:55:07.372 --> 03:55:08.533]  Who went after Hitler?
[03:55:08.533 --> 03:55:09.333]  His own military.
[03:55:10.472 --> 03:55:13.815]  Who went after Stalin and probably killed him, his own military?
[03:55:13.815 --> 03:55:16.718]  Who ends up going after the really bad guys?
[03:55:16.718 --> 03:55:19.001]  It's usually the military or the police.
[03:55:19.001 --> 03:55:27.849]  That's why the system keeps them on such a short leash and right close to them, and then Homeland Security gives them all this federal training, sends them out to do this.
[03:55:28.775 --> 03:55:33.157]  And it gives them all the equipment and then comes in, oh, it's terrible what you did!
[03:55:33.157 --> 03:55:35.038]  Even though they set him up for it.
[03:55:35.038 --> 03:55:37.319]  Very sophisticated manipulation.
[03:55:37.319 --> 03:55:42.941]  So just like we're played off against the Muslims, we need to be more sophisticated and realize the larger plan.
[03:55:42.941 --> 03:55:44.282]  Don't you agree, Leanne?
[03:55:44.282 --> 03:55:45.242]  Absolutely.
[03:55:45.242 --> 03:55:53.046]  And you can see that separation here evident just today in the fact that we had the first responders, once again, weren't allowed to join in the ceremony.
[03:55:54.025 --> 03:56:00.791]  Because they know, first of all, of course the families are going to want to hug these people that risked their lives to save their family.
[03:56:00.791 --> 03:56:04.314]  Saved a whole lot more lives that day than what was lost.
[03:56:04.314 --> 03:56:06.796]  But maybe they have some questions for the first responders.
[03:56:06.796 --> 03:56:08.297]  But see how reality's flipped?
[03:56:08.297 --> 03:56:09.899]  We're arming Al-Qaeda publicly?
[03:56:10.854 --> 03:56:13.496]  And then meanwhile, the first responders can't get medical care.
[03:56:13.496 --> 03:56:16.519]  Leanne McAdouga, you have more reports coming up with the nightly news.
[03:56:16.519 --> 03:56:17.980]  Great job, you and Joe.
[03:56:17.980 --> 03:56:25.346]  Take a break, get something to eat, kick your feet back for a while, and then go out and get some more great reports, and then it's Miller time!
[03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:29.050]  My favorite time, the magic hour.
[03:56:29.050 --> 03:56:32.372]  We'll be out at Times Square reporting, bringing you the info.
[03:56:32.372 --> 03:56:33.533]  Hey, I just had an idea.
[03:56:33.533 --> 03:56:44.140]  How about we get a bunch of info warriors to go to Times Square, say at 7 o'clock tonight, in front of some landmark, and we'll put a tweet out and a Facebook out.
[03:56:44.140 --> 03:56:46.242]  There's hardly any promotion, but I bet a hundred people show up.
[03:56:46.242 --> 03:56:50.204]  Do you want to call for a liberty mob to show up in Times Square, Leanne?
[03:56:50.204 --> 03:56:50.985]  Or do you want them to meet you?
[03:56:51.627 --> 03:56:53.028]  Liberty Mob in Times Square.
[03:56:53.028 --> 03:57:06.278]  What we're hearing is that the architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth have paid to get one of the billboards there to have a revolving loop of World Trade Center 7 going down.
[03:57:06.278 --> 03:57:09.160]  Yeah, they've done that before, but where do you want people to meet you?
[03:57:09.160 --> 03:57:11.642]  That's at 42nd and 6th Street.
[03:57:11.642 --> 03:57:12.403]  We'll be there.
[03:57:12.403 --> 03:57:14.584]  I think it's like the magic steps or something.
[03:57:14.584 --> 03:57:16.045]  The steps to infinity.
[03:57:16.045 --> 03:57:18.147]  Right in the center, right in the heart of everything.
[03:57:18.147 --> 03:57:19.168]  We will be there.
[03:57:19.879 --> 03:57:21.340]  47th and 6th Street.
[03:57:21.340 --> 03:57:25.042]  We just had that idea.
[03:57:25.042 --> 03:57:27.323]  42nd and 6th.
[03:57:27.323 --> 03:57:28.003]  42nd and 6th.
[03:57:28.003 --> 03:57:30.865]  We'll tweak that out at the Magic Steps.
[03:57:30.865 --> 03:57:33.246]  Everybody will see Leanne and Joe Biggs out there.
[03:57:33.246 --> 03:57:35.127]  Great job, Leanne.
[03:57:35.127 --> 03:57:35.627]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:57:36.124 --> 03:57:37.325]  Alright folks, we're out of time.
[03:57:37.325 --> 03:57:39.507]  I didn't get to most of the smoking guns.
[03:57:39.507 --> 03:57:43.531]  There's hundreds of them, but we have ten on Infowars.com, the top ten.
[03:57:43.531 --> 03:57:52.539]  Cheney recalls taking charge from Bunker, the stand-down, 15 of the 19 hijackers let into the country, hijackers trained in the U.S., Obama.
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:57:55.481]  Uh, Obama.
[03:57:55.481 --> 03:57:56.741]  It says Obama.
[03:57:56.741 --> 03:58:00.162]  Uh, Osama not wanted by FBI for 9-11.
[03:58:00.162 --> 03:58:00.942]  Prior warnings.
[03:58:00.942 --> 03:58:02.563]  Willie Brown warned not to fly.
[03:58:02.563 --> 03:58:04.863]  McConnellisa Rice.
[03:58:04.863 --> 03:58:05.923]  Uh, it just goes on and on.
[03:58:05.923 --> 03:58:11.525]  The 28 pages, people that have seen them, says that there was basically a stand-down ordered with Saudi Arabia involved.
[03:58:11.525 --> 03:58:13.645]  That's just some of the major issues.
[03:58:13.645 --> 03:58:15.966]  Uh, the cell phone's working from impossible heights.
[03:58:15.966 --> 03:58:17.567]  The FBI admitting it was fake.
[03:58:17.567 --> 03:58:20.187]  Let's thank God there wasn't a terror attack yet today.
[03:58:20.187 --> 03:58:21.107]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[03:58:21.107 --> 03:58:22.848]  I hope it was just Homeland Security fear-mongering.
[03:58:23.228 --> 03:58:27.133]  Thank you to all the InfoWars out there making this possible, and great job to the crew.
[03:58:27.133 --> 03:58:31.999]  Until 7 o'clock tonight, with InfoWars Nightly News, you are the resistance!
