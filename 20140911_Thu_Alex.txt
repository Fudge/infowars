[00:35.560 --> 00:39.960]  literally wage war against the Bill of Rights and Constitution and launch a
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.120]  raft of fraudulent black hole wars that have destroyed America's faith and
[00:46.120 --> 00:53.560]  credit around the world and is a collective scar on our conscience thank

[01:21.840 --> 01:26.480]  speech which I'm sure he'll be given another peace prize because why not
[01:26.480 --> 01:31.480]  it's all about being ironic it's all about being absurdist it's all about
[01:31.480 --> 01:40.480]  being total oxymoron hypocrisy so that is coming up as well today the latest on
[01:40.480 --> 01:46.960]  Ebola the latest on Obamacare every week I see headlines were a million people

[02:08.960 --> 02:13.640]  sparing independence taught from Texas to Kurdistan that's in the New York
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.040]  Times and it is sparing it Reuters says that Russia has successfully tested
[02:20.040 --> 02:26.520]  nuclear missile more plans as their Navy Russia's now turned off 45% of the gas to
[02:26.520 --> 02:31.720]  Poland as the colder weather begins to set in and it's setting in all over the
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.920]  world a little early this year earliest snowfall on record in South Dakota that
[02:37.920 --> 02:45.360]  story is out of the Argus leader it's a cool name Argus now the Argus leader
[02:45.360 --> 02:51.960]  it's up on drudgereport.com it's all part of the earth cooling now well it
[02:51.960 --> 02:55.960]  stopped heating 19 years ago and then it's been cooling for about five to six
[02:55.960 --> 02:59.560]  depending on what numbers you look at and it has nothing to do with humans it's
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.000]  that ball of gas up there in the sky a couple years ago it started cooling down
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.800]  and not it being as active in overall heat it's putting off generally and so
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.480]  the earth cooled I I'm not a physicist an astrophysicist though I do interview
[03:16.480 --> 03:19.680]  them here and I do read the publications but I don't need to be an
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.120]  astrophysicist to know that when you live closer to the equator it's hotter
[03:24.120 --> 03:29.600]  because the Sun hits you more and the Sun hits the Arctic and Antarctic
[03:29.600 --> 03:38.520]  obliquely sometimes not for months so it's 50 60 70 below I I mean if I stuck
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.680]  my head in an oven that was on it would burn me if I turned it off it won't be
[03:42.680 --> 03:47.400]  hot but the UN five years ago when everybody was pointing out it was the
[03:47.400 --> 03:52.760]  Sun they said no and they had a vote and they voted and said the Sun this quote
[03:52.760 --> 03:56.880]  does not affect climate which is another statement like two plus two equals
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.000]  whatever the government says no it equals four and that's what we've
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.280]  reached here this is all on purpose and I now I'm sure of that and I've read
[04:04.280 --> 04:07.720]  publications where they admit that they're throwing it in our face you
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.480]  guys get me the Carl Rove we're history's actors now full quote it's
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.120]  typing Carl Rove we're history's actors quote it's all over the place where he
[04:16.120 --> 04:20.400]  told the New York Times and Washington Post we can tell you that the moon is
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.240]  made of cheese you will buy it it's just like when O'Brien is torturing Winston
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.920]  and Brian you know says I'm gonna keep torturing it so you say what I want he
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.800]  goes I've already said that four plus four equals a million and two plus two
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.280]  equals 10 he goes I want you to see every number and and not be able to make
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.080]  a decision and believe whatever I say I'll say it's four I'll say it's 10 I'll
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.000]  say it's 20 and finally Winston gets it and is mentally broken that's what's
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.640]  happening here with the open arming of Al Qaeda I mean that will teach ISIS and
[04:51.640 --> 04:56.080]  Al Qaeda to give them unlimited funds and boy he's a war president he's gonna
[04:56.080 --> 04:59.800]  get tough on them they're gonna overthrow Assad folks after consulting top

[07:06.560 --> 07:10.480]  air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[07:10.480 --> 07:14.340]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[07:14.340 --> 07:18.720]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there
[07:18.720 --> 07:22.960]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[07:22.960 --> 07:26.760]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[07:26.760 --> 07:30.120]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[07:30.120 --> 07:33.840]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[08:21.320 --> 08:26.240]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we return Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[08:26.240 --> 08:32.360]  central standard time I am your host Alex Jones here we are 13 years later
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.840]  after the tragic attacks that killed 3,000 plus people in New York and
[08:37.840 --> 08:43.320]  Washington DC the wars that were then triggered in Afghanistan and Iraq have
[08:43.320 --> 08:49.520]  killed over a million and a half people almost all of them civilians and how
[08:49.520 --> 08:56.520]  many thousands of US troops five plus thousand dead in Iraq that many dead in
[08:56.520 --> 09:02.800]  Afghanistan tens of thousands of wounded I don't so many veterans I mean a lot of
[09:02.800 --> 09:08.600]  them and they've almost all got brain injuries or their organs are messed up
[09:08.600 --> 09:14.560]  because the armor is really good and so they'll survive getting blown up in a
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.000]  tank or an armored vehicle or in a Humvee but the shock wave still just goes
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.840]  right through them screws up their eyes screws up their liver their heart their
[09:22.840 --> 09:30.480]  brain so let's let's be clear nobody got out of this cheap I don't think ten
[09:30.480 --> 09:34.120]  thousand plus dead troops is cheap but compared to some wars where you have 20
[09:34.120 --> 09:40.120]  million Russians dying in World War two 20 plus million Germans what 300
[09:40.120 --> 09:44.280]  something thousand Americans hundreds of thousands of Brits I'm going off memory
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.880]  guys I know it's 22 million Germany 21 million Russia look up number of US
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.240]  casualties World War two please of course that didn't just fact-checking
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.240]  myself here so my memory is almost always right on but sometimes it gets
[09:57.240 --> 10:00.560]  off we was we check that and I I want to challenge everybody here to check me as
[10:00.560 --> 10:07.240]  well okay where do we start whoa it's crazy okay so I was wrong it's four
[10:07.240 --> 10:19.000]  hundred and five thousand US military chivalrous 625,000 World War two 405,000
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.360]  World War one 116,000 Vietnam War 58,000 does anybody believe that's a lot more
[10:24.360 --> 10:32.080]  than that Korea war 36,000 war on terror 6,717 I think that's an old number it's
[10:32.080 --> 10:39.000]  over 10,000 now it's just like the number I've seen a 340 350,000 I guess
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.840]  they updated it or they changed the actual where he's the numbers of
[10:42.840 --> 10:48.400]  between 350,000 400,000 see I was being conservative my brain also does that it
[10:48.400 --> 10:51.960]  always kind of downgrades things I'm always getting accused of exaggerating
[10:51.960 --> 10:58.200]  nine times out of ten literally it's worse than I'm saying in fact the only
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.000]  disinformation on this show if somebody wants to accuse me of something is I
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.960]  don't try to lie on purpose my brain though tends to dial stuff back but for
[11:07.960 --> 11:11.560]  people that aren't aware of what's going on it just sounds completely crazy
[11:11.560 --> 11:20.760]  what's happening and I don't blame people truth is stranger than fiction the
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.280]  reality of what's happening in our world is so much over the top than what
[11:25.280 --> 11:32.200]  anybody could come up with in fiction now that said obviously the big news is
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.400]  9-11 and President Obama's speech last night it's over the top brainwashing
[11:37.400 --> 11:43.360]  over the top arrogance over the top confusing the public and I don't know
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.000]  how they can get away with this it's just so transparent and I guess they just
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.760]  don't care it's like Congress has a six or seven percent approval rating
[11:51.760 --> 12:00.960]  depending on what poll the highest is 10 whether it's a Zogby poll or a Gallup
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.560]  poll or a whole bunch of them they're between six and ten percent so let's
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.160]  just say Congress to err on the side of conservatism has a 10% approval rating
[12:11.160 --> 12:16.640]  that's a pretty illegitimate government that's about as popular as you know Kim
[12:16.640 --> 12:23.560]  Jung on in South Korea fact I saw a poll he's more popular than that I'm 20
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.640]  something percent of the South Koreans are crazy enough to want to be merged
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.000]  with the North and like the communist policy so I just answered my question I
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.120]  was saying I think our government is more unpopular with the American people
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.080]  than North Korea is in South Korea even though North Korea is constantly
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.840]  promising to blow up and kill everyone and shell seol and attack South Korea
[12:47.840 --> 12:54.640]  they have 20 something percent of people that support it that's pretty amazing
[12:54.640 --> 12:59.680]  when you think about it so when I say the public's gullible the public's dumb
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.120]  the public you know why are they going along with this I think I've answered my
[13:04.120 --> 13:12.040]  question we're being drugged by our hair by the crazy special interest in the
[13:12.040 --> 13:22.320]  establishment into crazy town and it's like any unstable crazy person you've
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.760]  ever run into or worked around or known they just doesn't make sense what
[13:26.760 --> 13:31.400]  they're doing short-term or long-term and you see them digging their own hole
[13:31.400 --> 13:36.080]  in front of you and you can't stop them it's a very powerless feeling well I
[13:36.080 --> 13:42.880]  want to empower people because if we've got 90% or more knowing the
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.920]  government's totally illegitimate at the federal level there's got to be a way
[13:45.920 --> 13:52.040]  we can work together to not go along with it and say no to it and the first
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.000]  thing we can do is laugh at the system and and really let them know that we're
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.880]  laughing at them and stop complying and get our state governments that are much
[14:00.880 --> 14:06.880]  more popular in the polls because they are on average much better and that's the
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.680]  check and balance we have we need to move forward with not what I'd call
[14:10.680 --> 14:15.320]  succession but the right to reform the government under the Declaration of
[14:15.320 --> 14:19.800]  Independence Bill of Rights Constitution okay we reform it we've been hijacked
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.760]  we've been taken over we want the Republic back and then under the
[14:23.760 --> 14:30.880]  Republican form of government small are we could then set about to completely
[14:30.880 --> 14:35.160]  dismantle government if we think that will actually work but can we just at
[14:35.160 --> 14:41.800]  least go back to limited government first I mean there are the solutions
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.800]  instead things are going to get so bad historically that you're going to see
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.400]  Texas break away the Pentagon's already predicted that 20 years ago the Russians
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.960]  are predicting that a decade ago their top Academy
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.640]  Russia has said they either deliver to all their satellites that are part of
[15:02.640 --> 15:05.880]  Russia still or they will lose them I mean Russia understands that I'm not
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.560]  again saying Russia is wonderful Russia has a policy to try to enrich their
[15:10.560 --> 15:14.680]  population because they realize that's good policy for everybody to build a
[15:14.680 --> 15:17.520]  better civilization doesn't mean they're not corrupt and have problems
[15:17.520 --> 15:22.200]  Russia is more like a boss hog corruption like we used to be which is
[15:22.200 --> 15:27.000]  terrible but wonderful compared to eugenics scientifically applied
[15:27.000 --> 15:36.120]  anti-human exterminist UN world government technocracy garbage and the
[15:36.120 --> 15:46.080]  big tool of the technocracy is to get reality in such shambles that people
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.440]  just turn away and say I give up that's why Obama comes out and says I never
[15:51.440 --> 15:54.680]  said you could keep your doctor I never said it would cut your your medical
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.360]  bill I never said I wouldn't come after your guns you have a business you didn't
[15:58.360 --> 16:01.840]  build that if you raise the debt it doesn't raise the debt it's meant to
[16:01.840 --> 16:07.560]  condition you to accept any level of lying because in the information age
[16:07.560 --> 16:11.960]  they can't hide stuff anymore even short-term so instead they just want to
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.880]  overwhelm everybody where we just short-circuit like Robbie the robot with
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.080]  too much information cannot compute cannot compute and smoke comes out our
[16:21.080 --> 16:27.000]  ears that's what's going on here and I have some clips here that illustrate
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.560]  this Obama came out and said ISIS but to confuse people it's been ISIS IS
[16:33.560 --> 16:39.040]  ISIL it's really al-Qaeda it's been al-Qaeda the whole time but to confuse it
[16:39.040 --> 16:41.960]  because it's so embarrassing that our government got caught by the military
[16:41.960 --> 16:46.760]  and everybody was a military mainly last year openly running al-Qaeda the
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.160]  military freaked out decompartmentalized there was almost a total mutiny the
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.040]  secretary of defense got all freaked out when the chairman of the joint chiefs
[16:56.040 --> 16:59.960]  went to him and said this is not gonna fly and so they figured out a new
[16:59.960 --> 17:04.680]  strategy changed the name have them invade Iraq and then say we've got a
[17:04.680 --> 17:09.640]  fund the main Syrian rebels that are al-Qaeda by the way they just keep
[17:09.640 --> 17:13.360]  calling the moderate group the main group who admits all over the news they
[17:13.360 --> 17:20.880]  work with IS al-Qaeda whatever you want to call it to then attack Syria you
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.840]  understand the rebels aren't turning to beat al-Qaeda they're going to be armed
[17:24.840 --> 17:32.080]  and give an air support to go and overthrow Assad watch within a month to
[17:32.080 --> 17:37.600]  two months they'll be bombing in Damascus and saying well to be able to
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.560]  take out al-Qaeda we've got to take control of the whole government to clean
[17:41.560 --> 17:45.160]  the country out and then they're gonna kill every Christian in the country just
[17:45.160 --> 17:48.680]  like Libya just like I told you they do three years ago it's now a failed state
[17:48.680 --> 17:53.800]  with over 50,000 people confirmed dead and if you're black you're dead if you're
[17:53.800 --> 17:57.760]  Christian you're dead they were all living there freely the super racist
[17:57.760 --> 18:03.440]  Wahhabist Arabs are basically like hillbilly brown clan people or something
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.800]  I'm telling you folks that just the same they find black people dead they find
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.720]  Christians dead they find Jews dead you can pull up the New York Times
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.840]  admitting jihadi's war on black Libyans I mean they I mean they just find
[18:16.840 --> 18:21.560]  whole whole warehouses full of them dead and burned or dead and dead out in the
[18:21.560 --> 18:25.360]  desert where they just take men women and shows videos of them the bullets are
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.280]  too expensive to use they use machetes and just hacking up black women and
[18:30.280 --> 18:36.400]  children you're not gonna hear jack squat out of just the Reverend Jackson and
[18:36.400 --> 18:45.040]  then Al Sharpton and all these other idiots and you're going to see that
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.720]  that's what this is and then Obama will play the clip when we come back he said
[18:48.720 --> 18:52.880]  in the speech we're gonna play a bunch of these clips they're not Islamic well
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.880]  they are funded by Saudi Arabia the dominant Islamic State 80% or Sunni
[18:57.880 --> 19:05.000]  this is the group radicalizing the Sunnis this is 10% of the 80% do the math
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.960]  this is the driving sector of Islam right now to say it's not Islamic I know
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.200]  Obama's an Islamic scholar and did go to Islamic schools and when the Arabs heard
[19:16.200 --> 19:19.440]  him speak in Cairo they fell down and cried saying his Arabic is more perfect
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.160]  than an Imam because I mean he was raised a Muslim it is true I'm not
[19:23.160 --> 19:27.720]  Islamophobic I'm not starting a war with anybody I wondered why they would say
[19:27.720 --> 19:31.600]  on the news Obama true squads will arrest anyone in Missouri that says he's a
[19:31.600 --> 19:35.960]  Muslim remember that when he was running in 2008 we played the clips I was like
[19:35.960 --> 19:41.240]  why are they saying that because because he's he's whatever he is he was raised a
[19:41.240 --> 19:50.480]  Muslim and so he's up there is the Grand Imam the body saying that you know
[19:50.480 --> 19:55.120]  this is an Islamic and in a way he is the Grand Monty he is turning radicalism
[19:55.120 --> 19:58.160]  loose to take over the world while claiming he's fighting it and fooling

[23:53.800 --> 24:13.800]  before it's time to survive it's time to prepare
[24:13.800 --> 24:24.360]  well the speaker of the house is giving a press conference right now and he's
[24:24.360 --> 24:31.320]  endorsed Obama's request to not give 500 million dollars no no not to give 500
[24:31.320 --> 24:36.680]  million to the Syrian rebels to give basically unlimited amounts of money
[24:36.680 --> 24:43.760]  speaking now at 12 24 Eastern time that's enough just get him off the screen
[24:43.760 --> 24:47.560]  again if you're a radio listener we're somalcasting on television as well and we
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.400]  track and chronicle what the mainstream media and the politicians are up to a
[24:51.400 --> 24:55.960]  banner is the guy that supports obama care banner is the guy that helps work
[24:55.960 --> 24:59.800]  with the democrats try to stop the tea party and the libertarians taking over
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.040]  the party banners the guy that keeps protecting Obama on fast and furious
[25:05.040 --> 25:12.080]  and everything else and I supported senator Paul saying we should bomb ISIS
[25:12.080 --> 25:19.120]  but we started arming them to begin with as the rebels so we've got to figure
[25:19.120 --> 25:25.400]  that out first how they don't get weapons and how we then don't give them a
[25:25.400 --> 25:31.640]  new foothold the Middle East instead it's just I'm going to give weapons to the
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.880]  rebels and there'll be no boots on the ground even though he just sent an
[25:36.880 --> 25:44.280]  additional 475 US troops that's associated press everything he says is
[25:44.280 --> 25:53.360]  a line everything he says ends up being a fraud and I know politicians do this
[25:53.360 --> 25:56.640]  and we just get to the point we accept it that's them again breaking our will
[25:56.640 --> 26:00.840]  that's what the TSA is all about checking your baby's diaper but the
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.400]  border is wide open any any legals can fly without an ID it's about things being
[26:05.400 --> 26:08.080]  upside down
[26:11.360 --> 26:19.320]  let's go ahead and go to this first clip Obama says ISIL to confuse you more
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.320]  is not Islamic well it is Islamic it does come out of that talk about
[26:26.320 --> 26:32.720]  political correctness though it is not Islamic and then he goes on to call it
[26:32.720 --> 26:37.320]  by another name to confuse people let's go ahead and play that clip at this
[26:37.320 --> 26:41.240]  moment the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa where
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.520]  radical groups exploit grievances for their own game and one of those groups
[26:45.520 --> 26:52.480]  is ISIL which calls itself the Islamic State now let's make two things clear
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.480]  ISIL is not Islamic no religion condones the killing of innocents oh my god
[26:58.480 --> 27:03.960]  the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim and ISIL is certainly not a
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.800]  state it was formerly al-Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq and has taken advantage
[27:08.800 --> 27:15.200]  of sectarian strife and Syria's civil war to gain territory on both sides of the
[27:15.200 --> 27:20.560]  Iraq that's enough we told you four years ago the plan a year ago six months
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.840]  ago it's all on record at m4.com not because we're rocket scientists it's a
[27:24.840 --> 27:27.880]  public plan Wesley Clark talked about it we can play those clips again if you
[27:27.880 --> 27:33.360]  like us to to use radical Islamist to destabilize the whole Middle East it is
[27:33.360 --> 27:38.240]  our government and NATO that put these people calling themselves Islamic State
[27:38.240 --> 27:43.000]  calling themselves the caliphate al-Qaeda told just names of the same thing the
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.140]  stupid black flag is the al-Qaeda flag the same one bin Laden gave speeches in
[27:47.140 --> 27:53.240]  front of okay that's how dumb they think you are and that's how dumb they think I
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.680]  am and now they admit Libya is a failed state and we've got to invade there
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.840]  because the very group they put in charge is blowing up the airfields and
[28:01.840 --> 28:06.320]  murdering the Christians and the non-radical Muslims the only thing
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.060]  Obama said that was true in that statement is that the main victims are
[28:10.060 --> 28:17.600]  Muslims in Libya and in Iraq not in Syria they've gone into mainly Christian
[28:17.600 --> 28:22.520]  areas and killed everybody 300 plus thousand dead in Syria you can look
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.200]  that number up most of them Christians so I don't even know if he's telling the
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.400]  truth there but it is true that if you're not a radical Muslim and you just
[28:30.400 --> 28:33.520]  want prosperity and take care of your family and you don't want to eat hearts
[28:33.520 --> 28:39.640]  on television or blow up everything or blow up the shrine of Jonah I mean
[28:39.640 --> 28:44.640]  they're running around blowing up churches and Shiite mosque the Shiites
[28:44.640 --> 28:49.680]  don't do that to the Sunnis folks and I'm not picking sides there either I just
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.720]  study it these Wahhabist are nuts that you just look at them craze-eyed they
[28:56.720 --> 29:00.440]  rape and kill everybody they like sodomized men they grab they're a
[29:00.440 --> 29:06.640]  bunch of perverts they are just a bunch of lunatics and so it's easy to hate
[29:06.640 --> 29:12.040]  them I've got ISIS threatening us on Facebook and Twitter real groups I'm
[29:12.040 --> 29:16.000]  most scary you scum I got the second amendment but I feel sorry for people
[29:16.000 --> 29:23.600]  that don't and if our government has our way and gets our guns they're blowing up
[29:23.600 --> 29:28.200]  old old stuff from the Babylonian Empire and architecture they're just they
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.520]  are a bunch of demons so when we come back I'm gonna play the next big lie he

[29:37.600 --> 29:45.480]  been in the news for two years covertly helping the quote non radical rebels who

[34:41.520 --> 34:46.320]  already been given more than four billion dollars by coalition of nato and others in the last four
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.280]  years they were given nerve gas by saudi arabia to launch attacks that got tested and proven by
[34:51.280 --> 34:56.960]  the u.n. and others i had colonel schaefer on yesterday who ran black ops against al qaeda for the army
[34:57.840 --> 35:04.320]  famous whistleblower from able danger and all these other secret operations they were ordered
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.640]  not to kill al qaeda commanders including someone bin laden even the week before 9 11 they confirmed
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.800]  could have killed him with drones wouldn't let him he said exactly what i said yesterday
[35:17.360 --> 35:19.680]  we're getting some clips of that together for later in the broadcast
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.400]  in the third hour of the show and he'd been on capitol hill that day met with intelligence people
[35:28.400 --> 35:32.080]  and they told him bottom line it's well known
[35:35.440 --> 35:43.680]  that indeed all of this is happening all of this is unfolding and our government is basically
[35:43.680 --> 35:50.320]  protecting and working with isis and that we should not do this and not give them weapons
[35:50.320 --> 35:55.760]  and they're giving money to any of the rebels will go directly to al qaeda directly to the most radical
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.400]  i said the public number is 65 percent of the radicals are al qaeda jihadis and he said it's
[36:00.400 --> 36:07.280]  way higher it's classified i can't tell you from the info i have they're all ultra radical and they
[36:07.280 --> 36:14.880]  have a few fake fronts for the media i mean john mccain met with the radical ones and so basically
[36:14.880 --> 36:20.880]  it's 95 al qaeda and i talked to him some off air and i'm just gonna leave it at that undoubtedly
[36:20.880 --> 36:26.480]  the phone was tapped undoubtedly the system knows what was said but but they know what's going on
[36:26.480 --> 36:34.880]  our government knows and was told by al qaeda experts on the hill briefing bainer and others
[36:34.880 --> 36:41.040]  yesterday that's all i can say in fact there's the headline right there i should take that
[36:41.040 --> 36:45.760]  interview and my and my other info and we should have an article that republican democratic leaders
[36:45.760 --> 36:52.720]  were briefed by al qaeda experts from the army and other areas yesterday that this is al qaeda
[36:52.720 --> 36:59.040]  and that almost all the rebels are al qaeda and that the military the pentagon has told them
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.600]  it is not smart to do this in fact the pentagon is on the news today saying
[37:03.600 --> 37:07.680]  there could be some real challenges to this oh really this is the cover
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.160]  to arm al qaeda again who the syrian government and army had defeated and our government was
[37:16.160 --> 37:21.280]  behind the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda groups attacking the military and christians and others
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.840]  until the egyptians finally crushed them the egyptian military and i'm not even endorsing the
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.360]  military coup but they were just running around murdering everybody in a reign of terror
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.240]  and we're trying to fully overthrow all the institutions so they could run everything
[37:42.320 --> 37:46.960]  so 20 million people hit the streets instead of two million hit in the streets that put al qaeda
[37:46.960 --> 37:53.600]  in charge of egypt this is very sophisticated what's going on you got to ask yourself why is
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.960]  obama teamed up with his kenyan cousin odinga pipelining money we need to get drum coursing on
[37:58.960 --> 38:05.360]  quick maybe even the day of you can do it pipelining that on record and core and and and
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.600]  colonel shaffer and others have met with the head of intelligence from egypt and confirmed all this
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.400]  this is in the egyptian papers egyptian trials are brought it out they're using kenya and trying
[38:16.400 --> 38:22.160]  to have a muslim uprising there to overthrow the christian government i mean this is getting crazy
[38:22.160 --> 38:28.800]  folks what is the president doing arming al qaeda changed the name to isle isis islamic state to
[38:28.800 --> 38:34.960]  confuse people and now he's going to get tough on him by arming the good rebels that is them
[38:36.880 --> 38:44.720]  that is so naked so two plus two equals five so ridiculous of course we built our businesses
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.000]  of course raising the debt limit raises the debt limit of course they're coming after our guns of
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.840]  course the nsa is spying on us i can hardly breathe i'm having like an anxiety attack over this this
[38:57.840 --> 39:04.160]  is incredible when you know the players you know the facts and i was hoping colonel shaffer who i
[39:04.160 --> 39:10.560]  know for a long time and who i trust would come on and correct me but instead he came on and
[39:10.560 --> 39:20.400]  confirmed everything i already knew and i wanted to throw up is it possible to arm non radical
[39:20.400 --> 39:27.840]  rebels and uh have them kick al qaeda out no across the border in syria we have ramped up
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.960]  our military assistance to the syrian opposition tonight i call on congress again to give us
[39:34.960 --> 39:42.400]  additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters in the fight against isle
[39:42.400 --> 39:48.400]  we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its own people a regime that will never regain
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.800]  the legitimacy it has lost instead we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight
[39:54.800 --> 40:00.880]  to extremists like isle while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve syria's crisis
[40:00.880 --> 40:10.560]  once and for all third that's enough to shut him up when you're informed he he's telling you that
[40:11.360 --> 40:18.480]  green is red that white is black that down is up that left is right that hot is cold i mean
[40:18.480 --> 40:27.680]  it's just the most bizarre off the chart over the top weirdness i literally think i'm living
[40:27.680 --> 40:33.280]  on the twilight zone at this point islamic state is not islamic boy that's a whopper
[40:36.640 --> 40:40.160]  we're not putting boots on the ground the boots are already on the ground mbc news
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.240]  was reporting they were already on the ground yesterday ap's reporting publicly
[40:45.440 --> 40:49.280]  a thousand are already there and they're sending four hundred and seventy five more
[40:49.280 --> 40:59.920]  more there's the cia with us and nato commandos and qatari commandos for four years have been
[40:59.920 --> 41:11.360]  in eastern syria western iraq training the jihadis and we know about it because our
[41:11.360 --> 41:20.480]  military cia pilots nato people i mean i have guessed on that get subpoenaed by congress i mean
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.760]  do you understand we're really breaking reality here we're not speculating well i've interviewed
[41:25.760 --> 41:33.760]  the people that offloaded the anti tank and anti helicopter missiles to al qaeda i'm going to say
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.480]  that again and you and they're sitting there getting off there's people with black flags
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.200]  laughing at them saying we're going to come kill you next these people are so arrogant and crazy
[41:43.200 --> 41:52.160]  folks narcissistic just not balls on cartoon level they're basically like hallucinating
[41:52.160 --> 41:57.440]  or something that's how these al qaeda people act is like people on drugs they're that whacked out
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.360]  and can you imagine our military has been told to go to secret bases in jordan and turkey turkey
[42:03.360 --> 42:10.000]  has given hundreds of times artillery support to al qaeda brigades infiltrating syria
[42:12.160 --> 42:16.640]  they go into secular people's houses and in non radical muslim houses and christian houses
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.760]  and line up the family and tell the father get in this truck and drive it to the army checkpoint
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.800]  a mile away and blow it up or we're going to kill your whole family this has been in mainstream
[42:26.800 --> 42:33.840]  news we've covered it and when they say no they take the littlest daughter and shoot them right in
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.640]  the head and you know what the dad does every time he goes all right he gets in the truck
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.760]  and he drives it right into the police and blows the whole thing up and i'll be honest that's the
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.480]  only way you could get me to do really evil stuff if somebody had a gun to my daughter's head and
[42:48.480 --> 42:52.960]  said you drive this truck of explosives you know most suicide bombers have their kids held captive
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.120]  right i mean you know that right you don't think these islamic state people actually
[42:57.120 --> 43:03.280]  blow themselves up do you most of the time they're holding hostages other times they go find weird
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.400]  brainwashed goat farmers who don't even know what planets are on literally don't know where the us
[43:08.400 --> 43:14.080]  is on maps they've done studies in afghanistan's in place who've grown up in dirt floor shacks on
[43:14.080 --> 43:24.000]  mountain tops and they have them they'll pay them 25 thousand dollars 50 thousand dollars
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.080]  you go blow themselves up but why do you need to do that you just go into a house down the street
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.640]  you line up the family that just wants to live and you say i'm going to start shooting your kids
[43:32.640 --> 43:38.160]  one after another until you get in that truck and you drive it in there and blow that up
[43:38.160 --> 43:44.480]  and you know whose houses they rob this has come out in the news or they do that too they'll go to a
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.080]  house that has a truck parked out front why do you think that they'll load that truck knowing the
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.720]  driver knows how to drive the truck they even get it down to that they profile i was reading an
[43:54.720 --> 44:00.080]  article where truck drivers in afghanistan and syria and places will park their truck down the
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.880]  street you don't park your truck at your house because you know what happens your doors get
[44:04.880 --> 44:09.840]  kicked in at night and a bunch of crazy guys run in and they start raping your wife and daughters in
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.560]  front of you because you know they they're allowed to because they're on a jihad and because you
[44:14.560 --> 44:18.480]  know you don't have a big beard like they do and you know you're a she-eyed or you don't or you're
[44:18.480 --> 44:24.720]  an all-white or you're a christian and they say i'm i mean i mean this is what's going on and obama
[44:24.720 --> 44:30.960]  is going to give billions of us taxpayer money not 500 million you read the fine parrents in the news
[44:30.960 --> 44:39.120]  it's unlimited to these people let's go ahead and play the next clip obama vows no u.s ground troops
[44:40.560 --> 44:47.280]  versus isis uh here is nbc reporter boots already on the ground in iraq they are embedded with local
[44:47.280 --> 44:52.880]  fighters this came out about four o'clock in the morning today info wars dot com and then after that
[44:52.880 --> 45:02.320]  here came out at nine o'clock a few hours later obama to send 475 additional troops to iraq to aid
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.600]  in the fight against isis i'm going to say that again when he said there wouldn't be troops that
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.520]  means a huge escalation because what do you do to your enemy you lie to your enemy and who are the
[45:11.520 --> 45:15.440]  american people and who are those troops going to fight oh there are a bunch of other weird jihadi
[45:15.440 --> 45:20.400]  groups fighting against isis so i guarantee our troops won't know who they're attacking they'll
[45:20.400 --> 45:26.160]  be designated who to kill who to bomb it will be the enemies of isis and then isis working with
[45:26.160 --> 45:31.120]  obama and the globalist publicly will come out and say how dare you bomb us obama we will now
[45:31.120 --> 45:37.440]  blow up america because you do that and laugh working with saudi arabia it is all theater
[45:37.440 --> 45:47.680]  this is september 11th 13 years later the grand choke of paying al-qaeda publicly
[45:50.240 --> 45:56.160]  but here it is obama vows no ground troops versus isis or isle or whatever the name is this hour
[45:56.800 --> 46:02.960]  now it will take time to eradicate a cancer like isis and anytime we take military action
[46:02.960 --> 46:09.040]  there are risks involved oh yeah especially to the service men and women who carry out these
[46:09.040 --> 46:13.760]  missions but i want the american people to understand how this effort will be different
[46:14.320 --> 46:20.720]  from the wars in iraq and afghanistan oh it will not involve american combat troops fighting on
[46:20.720 --> 46:27.680]  foreign soil this counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady relentless effort to
[46:27.680 --> 46:33.920]  take out isle wherever they exist using our air power and our support for partners forces on the
[46:33.920 --> 46:39.760]  ground this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front
[46:39.760 --> 46:45.280]  lines is one that we have successfully pursued in yemen and somalia for years oh and it is
[46:45.280 --> 46:50.080]  consistent with the approach i outlined earlier this year and in living is forced against anyone
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.040]  who threatens america's core interests but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address
[46:55.040 --> 47:00.880]  broader challenges to international by the way all lies uh the Assad regime knows my fellow americans
[47:00.880 --> 47:06.640]  knows that this is an attack on syria and then it will next be used to overthrow them and the
[47:06.640 --> 47:11.920]  weapons being given to the rebels are to be used against Assad this is us advisors weapons and air
[47:11.920 --> 47:18.400]  support inside syria to topple Assad period and now the russians are going to escalate they're
[47:18.400 --> 47:22.720]  going to send in russian troops and they're already there and you're going to have just like you've
[47:22.720 --> 47:28.880]  got u.s advisors and quote non-combat trips advising with the skirmish stuff going on
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.160]  in eastern ukraine you're now going to have and this is really about russia folks this is
[47:34.720 --> 47:41.360]  our government using a jihad army against russian interest and i'm not lionizing russia
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.360]  i'm saying the criminals that run our country the ones that gave us obama care and open borders
[47:47.360 --> 47:53.120]  and and fast and furious and Benghazi are messing with russia and there's an article out today
[47:54.800 --> 48:02.080]  out of the london telegraph that says do not mess with the russian wolf and it's an excellent
[48:02.080 --> 48:07.360]  story admitting that the west is bullying and trying to start a war with russia and russia
[48:07.360 --> 48:14.960]  is not backing down and so that it's escalating into a serious crisis i have more clips i have a
[48:14.960 --> 48:22.640]  uh a report filed by uh our reporters on the ground in new york with a combat veteran who knows
[48:22.640 --> 48:28.160]  what he's talking about former staff sergeant joe biggs of iraq and afghanistan with the headline
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.760]  obama vows to fight isis by arming isis this is joe responding in in new york city last night
[48:33.760 --> 48:39.680]  after he saw the speech it's pretty powerful it's coming up after the break and we've got a bunch
[48:39.680 --> 48:45.200]  other news uh on the economy on the environment it's just there's a lot of it ladies and gentlemen
[48:45.200 --> 48:54.000]  it's just if i keep harping on this it's because i'm pretty shook up by having colonel shaffer on
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.600]  who fought al-qaeda for a decade actually took out a lot of their bases and people say well
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.520]  wait a minute i thought al-qaeda works for the west no no no no they stir them up they turn
[49:03.520 --> 49:08.720]  them loose like pudding rattlesnakes in somebody's bed okay and then when they attack us they take
[49:08.720 --> 49:14.320]  our rights that's what i'm saying and he was stopped from taking out al-qaeda leadership and i got him
[49:14.320 --> 49:20.160]  on yesterday and he said everything i said in five minutes that it's horrible to arm them
[49:20.160 --> 49:24.880]  they will attack us they're coming after us next they these are people that have killed our troops
[49:24.880 --> 49:31.600]  we should join with the side see that would be a moral position and rand paul should articulate that
[49:31.600 --> 49:41.360]  basically say okay we were wrong to try to back these rebels against the side admit we're wrong
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.640]  let's see they they're not wrong they did on purpose we will now openly say that we'd like
[49:48.640 --> 49:55.600]  to help you aside bomb the rebels period and drive them out of your country because you are a hundred
[49:55.600 --> 49:59.760]  times better than al-qaeda and christians could live in peace and you were working with the west
[49:59.760 --> 50:03.920]  and we used that to try to overthrow you and double cross you we stuck our hand out to shake
[50:03.920 --> 50:08.960]  your hand and tried to basically stab you in the heart that policy was wrong and so we want to
[50:08.960 --> 50:13.360]  help you destroy isis in iraq and syria and they could stabilize the middle east that is not what
[50:13.360 --> 50:20.080]  they're going to do they're going to break syria and iraq into a new country they're going to break
[50:20.080 --> 50:24.320]  iraq into three pieces they're going to break syria into at least two and take piece of syria and a
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.240]  piece of iraq and put it together that's been the plan the whole time and they said they're talking
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.600]  to us like we're idiots i'm gonna say it again this is not debatable and colonel schaffer
[50:33.600 --> 50:40.960]  agreed with me this is our government funding al-qaeda to overthrow syrian government and the
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.800]  syrian government knows that they've not been consulted and it's an act of war for us aircraft
[50:46.800 --> 50:52.480]  to go in there and start bombing and with syria shoots at the airplanes that's a total escalation
[50:52.480 --> 50:58.160]  what are they supposed to do you got air support for al-qaeda coming in there that's what it is

[54:47.200 --> 54:54.200]  Our hearts still go out to all those that lost loved ones and lost limbs and got poisoned by the deadly dust that the government lied about on purpose.
[54:54.200 --> 54:59.200]  That was declassified, that the EPA head was ordered to lie. That's all coming up.
[54:59.200 --> 55:06.200]  We're going to play Joe Biggs report, one of many he's filed, he and Leigh Ann doing a great job there in New York City.

[56:33.200 --> 56:43.200]  Here's Joe Biggs' report, Obama vows to fight ISIS, or ISIL, by arming ISIL.
[56:43.200 --> 56:50.200]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com at the 9-Eleven Memorial in downtown New York City.
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.200]  Now today, DefenseNews.com put out an article saying,
[56:54.200 --> 57:10.200]  Former U.S. intel chief military force won't beat Islamic State in war of ideas. Now the former director is convinced that force alone is not the key to a U.S. strategy for defeating Islamic State militants in the Middle East
[57:10.200 --> 57:15.200]  or winning the war of ideas with extremism worldwide. He said,
[57:15.200 --> 57:26.200]  There are sufficient numbers of believers in their ideas, and so we can kill all day long, but until we understand why there are sufficient numbers of believers globally, the group will not be defeated.
[57:26.200 --> 57:35.200]  Now tonight, President Obama will be speaking once again on the eve of the 9-Eleven tragedy that happened 13 years ago.
[57:35.200 --> 57:45.200]  This exact same day, one year ago, President Obama wanted to arm the Syrian rebels once again, and then have us attack the Assad regime.
[57:45.200 --> 57:52.200]  Now tonight, he will be asking for support once again in arming the Free Syrian Army.
[57:52.200 --> 57:57.200]  Now Breitbart just came out with an article as well, not too long ago, and it says,
[57:57.200 --> 58:05.200]  U.S.-backed moderate Free Syrian Army factions join ISIS terrorist group. Now the funny thing is right here, it goes,
[58:05.200 --> 58:12.200]  Sources and eyewitnesses said that the FSA has handed over its weapons to the ISIS group in large numbers.
[58:12.200 --> 58:22.200]  So once again, our president is going to stand up here tonight in front of the American people and promise that it will defeat ISIS,
[58:22.200 --> 58:32.200]  says that he has the clearance to shoot at targets, but at the same time, he is going to give weapons to the FSA, which is then going to be given back to ISIS.
[58:32.200 --> 58:57.200]  And that's what Colonel Shaffer said, full report at infowars.com, second hour straight ahead, it's 9-Eleven.

[59:46.200 --> 01:00:00.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:17.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:29.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:36.200]  Our reporters are going to be joining us from New York City coming up in the next segment. I should have been plugging in the first hour.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.200]  You're in for four hours of old Alex Jones today, old Alejandra.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:57.200]  We're doing the fourth hour overdrive. I did three hours from about 1997 until about 2012.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.200]  So for a while, I did three hours. Then for a couple of years, I don't remember.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.200]  I did three hours from about 1997, teleprompter free. So sometimes I have to go back in memory.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:22.200]  I did three hours from about 1997 to about 2004. Then I did four hours from 2004 to about 2012.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:31.200]  And then I went back to three hours. But so many stations were carrying second, third, and fourth hour that a lot of them kept carrying the fourth hour.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:37.200]  So we'd re-air the first hour in the fourth hour. So that's why that happens for the stations that wanted it out there.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:46.200]  Nowadays, it doesn't even matter. The stations can program the satellites like a T-vo to play the hours however they want.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.200]  But we still have that fourth hour open sometimes. That's why we call it overdrive.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.200]  Sometimes I do five minutes. Sometimes I do 20 minutes. Sometimes I do the whole hour.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:08.200]  I will be doing an entire hour from the new studio live today with our great crew who's always busy running this show and other shows, The Nightly News.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.200]  And so we've kind of been, I've been procrastinating moving into the new studio.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.200]  I don't expect any train wreck stuff to happen, but it does. It's kind of fun to be doing that.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:23.200]  So I'm looking forward to it. We're going to have other fourth hours in the future where I walk around the studio with a headset on.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.200]  We're going to do stuff where I walk around on the streets doing live shows.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:35.200]  I mean, I've done that for eight years, but we're going to really start doing that a lot where I'll have reporters back here at home base hosting the show.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:51.200]  And then I'll be walking around New York or London or Austin, interviewing people, talking to folks, really making it man on the street, really immersing myself in a teleprompter free, talking point free mindset.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:03:01.200]  Because I find when I'm sitting around at a restaurant talking to friends or having a cigar once every couple months or something, you know, out by a pool or something with friends,
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:07.200]  that that's where the real discussions happen. That's where the real in depth truth comes out.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:15.200]  And I'll be quite frank with you. I enjoy doing live feeds from home. I enjoy doing YouTube's. I upload. I tend to get so busy. I don't.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:29.200]  I'm going to focus on making that a focus more and more where I might even once a week invite friends over to a pool location or to a restaurant or wherever where we're authorized to have it
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:38.200]  and just sit around and have dinner and broadcast live and maybe go out and smoke a cigar afterwards and just really have real discussions.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:48.200]  Maybe maybe fly people into Austin to just to hang out once a week and do a live feed so it doesn't get all caught up in the production.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:59.200]  And myself included worried about what's coming up or a bill I've got a sign or a sponsor I've got to talk to because that's what goes on here behind the scenes during the breaks.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:05.200]  The guys try to keep me from doing it, but I'm just running around putting out fires dealing with this dealing with that.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:14.200]  I want to bring some real purity to this. And I also want to bring some positivity and try to inject. Hey, we're covering negative stuff.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:21.200]  That's because it's positive to admit what's wrong and not just sweep it under the rug. But here are some open solutions as well.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:32.200]  And I know we already do that, but I want to focus on being positive and on really realizing that we can seize our destiny, seize the day.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:40.200]  Fortune favors the bold and my fortune is not a pile of diamonds. My fortune is having a future for my children to grow up in a world with your children.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:48.200]  Don't we love our children? For our head kids, I got so sick of that. For the children, for the children, you biologically get it once you have children.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:55.200]  That it's about that human continuum and building a better world. We'll be right back with our reporters on the 9-11 anniversary.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:21.200]  13 years later on Alex Jones.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:37.200]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time, the restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:44.200]  Can you put two and two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:54.200]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal. But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.

[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:23.200]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:37.200]  Well, it's hard to believe 13 years has passed since the tragic attacks of 9-11. And the mainstream media is replaying the airplanes and the towers falling and people jumping out and government coming to save us.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:52.200]  Meanwhile, I knew at the time, because I studied history, that under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and I'm not blaming Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan. When we say that, the intelligence agencies.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:09:01.200]  Knowingly armed and helped create what is al-Qaeda today. And I knew that they'd been protecting him. I knew Saudi Arabia was in bed with him.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:12.200]  I was told by intelligence assets like Steve Pachinik, who ran basically Army Psychological Warfare out of the State Department. He ran the Camp David Accords on record.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:22.200]  Okay, I mean, that's the kind of stuff we're talking about. I was told by him that bin Laden already died and what hospital he was at. And then it came out in CBS News months later.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:31.200]  Okay. And they would roll out his dead body later in a fake assassination thing. Might be a year, might be 10 years. Well, it was more than 10 years.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:43.200]  I know Norad stood down. I know there were bombs in the buildings. I know that 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. I interviewed the head of the visa section of the main Saudi Arabian US Embassy, Springman.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:52.200]  I saw him in the Toronto Star and in the Daily Mail up there, the national newspaper, and I got him on.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:10:01.200]  And he said, we were ordered to let 15 of the hijackers in, even though they had Al-Qaeda designations, that they were maximum level terrorists.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.200]  And we were called by the CIA when we refused to give them visas. They said, that's their cover. They work for us.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:18.200]  So to see bare minimum, the CIA protected 15 of the 19 hijackers. Boom. Right there. Where is the real investigation in Congress?
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:25.200]  Well, the bombshell was dropped by Colonel Tony Shaffer yesterday, who ran the Army Black Ops program against Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:35.200]  And it was blocked twice under Stratus Ivey and Abel Danger from killing of some of bin Laden in the month before 9-11.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:45.200]  Famous whistleblower testified to Congress on yesterday, works for different intelligence groups and the Army War College. I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:52.200]  He is in there briefing Congress yesterday, explaining to them that basically this entire group is Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:59.200]  And he dropped the bombshell on what is in the 28 pages that I've talked to different members of Congress that have been allowed to see it.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:07.200]  The FBI is in the room when you go in. That's the tail wagging the dog. The Intelligence Committee cannot release it. They want it released.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:20.200]  It exposes both Obama. It exposes even though it happened before Obama got in. The same Democrats under Clinton that are running Obama today and the neocons under Bush
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:33.200]  knew Saudi Arabia was in charge of the hijackers and covered it up and wouldn't let other agencies stop 9-11, if you believe the official story, even at that limited hangout level,
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.200]  because it would embarrass the Saudis. So bare minimum, prior knowledge that Connolly Siris already got caught in.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.200]  Remember she got warned by Mayor Willie Brown the day before 9-11 not to fly to New York that day?
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  The San Francisco Chronicle on September 11th reported that in their Internet version, September 12th in print.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:56.200]  She was warned by Mayor Willie Brown or she warned Mayor Willie Brown. Excuse me.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:07.200]  I mean, that is just incredible. Absolutely incredible. You can look that up in the San Francisco Chronicle that she warned Mayor Willie Brown.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:15.200]  I flipped it to not fly the day before. The Joint Chiefs were going to be in New York that day and canceled a week before.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:32.200]  Until 9-11, there was a shoot-down order the generals had to shoot down aircraft that were going into populated areas. That power for generals to do that was taken away one month before 9-11 and given back to them one week after 9-11.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:43.200]  There was a stand-down order. A coup with Saudi Arabia and criminal globalist forces bipartisanly inside our government letting that take place bare minimum.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:59.200]  That's 9-11 truth. That's what we know. I can go on for hour after hour. I will in the fourth hour today do a special fourth hour special live out of the new studio that's about 30 yards away from where I shit.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.200]  You've seen us through the nightly news out of there. You've seen us do live specials out of there.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:13.200]  It's the first time we're going to merge the radio side with the TV side. It should be fun. I'm looking forward to some train wrecks. That is coming up today.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:21.200]  Over the next few weeks, we're going to be in there at least once or twice a week doing the show live out of there until we segue entirely into that studio.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:34.200]  And then I can cut from in there into here with our reporters whenever they're ready to cover news and events as well. So it's pretty exciting. The facilities that we built up thanks to all your support out there.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:44.200]  There it is. San Francisco Chronicle. Willie Brown got low key early warning about air travel. By the way, they changed that headline later. That was September 12.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:53.200]  It was Mayor Willie Brown got warning not to fly September 10 was the original headline was warned not to fly September 10 to New York.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:59.200]  But then they spun it went low key low key because it was such a big deal.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:05.200]  Getting back to a Colonel Schaefer said that we're going to Joe Biggs and Leanne Macadoo in New York City.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:17.200]  He said that he's not allowed to tell us what's in the the 28 pages. But Walter Jones is a frequent guest of this show, who a few years ago started the initiative to have those 28 pages relief.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.200]  He's a hero. We need to get him back on next week if we can.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:35.200]  Now that I think about it, he'd have been perfect to have on 911. Ron Paul has come out and said, yes, the 28 pages. He's talked to members of Congress that have now seen it. And it shows clearly that there was prior knowledge and it was allowed to happen.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:50.200]  Ron Paul came out last week. We're going to cover that in the fourth hour as well. So Schaefer gets called in literally and screamed at repeatedly when he comes on the show and says too much because this show has such a big effect.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:15:01.200]  He says some of the stuff on Fox News he says here and doesn't even get in trouble. He's told me he gets in trouble. I'm not going to even say with who, but there's good people in the government.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:15.200]  But at the same time, if they say too much, then obviously it could get a lot of people in trouble. But at the same time, if we don't expose this, we're going to lose everything anyways.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:29.200]  I mean, it's gotten to that point. But how bombshell is that to have Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer, not just some average Lieutenant Colonel over supply, not that that's bad, but a Lieutenant Colonel over black operations against Al Qaeda for a decade.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:39.200]  And he got into that because previously he was involved going in and killing him himself in caves and facilities all over the Middle East, saying our government's arming Al Qaeda, all the Syrian rebels are Al Qaeda.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:47.200]  ISIS is Al Qaeda. And that memo says that Saudi Arabia was involved and our government covered it up and knew beforehand.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:53.200]  Exactly what C. Bell Edmonds, the FBI NSA translator, whistleblower said.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.200]  It's criminal elements of our government running kids, drugs, weapons, you name it, with Al Qaeda.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:12.200]  Joe Biggs reporting from New York City. What is it like for you now to know that Colonel Schaefer went public here yesterday, that he'd been on the Hill yesterday briefing Congress in a closed door briefing,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:20.200]  and that he and others brief them at a higher level than he is, that indeed this is Al Qaeda said, don't do it, work with Assad to take him out if you're going to do it, like Rand Paul said.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.200]  They're not going to do that. They're going to go against Assad's wishes and actually give them weapons and money.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:34.200]  And now we know what the 28 pages shows, as Rand Paul said, clear evidence of a stand down. This is incredible.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:38.200]  What is it like for you getting wounded, losing so many buddies over there to know this?
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.200]  Quite frankly, Alex, it pisses me off to hear something like that.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:50.200]  You know, Obama's even coming out last night in a speech saying that he wants to, once again, on the same anniversary as last year, on the eve of 9-11,
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:55.200]  he goes and he tries to say that, you know, we want to go after Syria. We want to attack Assad.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:01.200]  We're going to, you know, weaponize basically and fund more of these FSA troops over the Free Syrian Army guys.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:10.200]  But we already know from many reports that the FSA gives the weapons over to ISIS, and it's just this huge circle.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:19.200]  They've changed the weapons. They're just a little happy face on Al Qaeda shows that the Pentagon can, you know, not get a rebellion of the troops learning that we're funding Al Qaeda.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:24.200]  Yeah, it's just another way to clear their name. They're trying to, they're cleaning their hands.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.200]  They're laundering them. They wander the weapons through FSA.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:37.200]  Yes, that's exactly what is happening. You know, today we got out here, Alex, and this is a day that breaks my heart.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:45.200]  You know, that the country that I believed in, I loved, betrayed me, you know, the people that died on this day,
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.200]  and then the many people who died because they thought like myself we were fighting a just thing.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.200]  We were trying to stand up for our country because our country had been attacked.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.200]  You know, I wanted to do something that I thought at the time was very pure and for selfless reasons.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.200]  I wasn't doing it for benefits, for college, anything like that. I didn't care about that.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:11.200]  I wanted to come out here and I was willing to put my life on the line because I thought terrorists came over here and they attacked us and they killed thousands of people.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:18.200]  And here I am now 13 years later and I know the truth. You know, I joined the military basically for no reason now.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:25.200]  You know, everything that I thought that I fought for was a complete and total lie and I lose sleep over that. It's a nightmare.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:33.200]  And one thing that I hate is disrespect and the fact that I passed a federal building, the flag is not a half mass.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:42.200]  I went inside that federal building and I asked him, why is a flag not a half mass? When Nelson Mandela died, you guys had the flag at half mass.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:52.200]  When Whitney Houston died, you had the flag at half mass. Why is the flag not a half mass on the 13th anniversary of the worst attacks on American soil?
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.200]  Well, they're done with it now. They won't let the first responders or their families in to the event.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.200]  It's all about Bloomberg to raise money for gun control. Yes, folks, his gun control foundation runs it.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.200]  He gave it to his private foundation. What a pig.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:16.200]  Yeah, they're charging the families to come in. Like Leanne said yesterday, it's like going to your son or daughter's funeral and being told you have to go pay to see the grave.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.200]  It is the most ridiculous thing ever.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:25.200]  Don't give them ideas. They'll actually put parking meters on the gravesites. Joe, don't give them ideas.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.200]  I predict within one year they're going to put parking meters on graves at Arlington. I'm not kidding.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:35.200]  Because, see, everything's over the top now, Joe. Have you heard Obama says? I'm not even joking now.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:41.200]  Have you heard Obama says no boots on the ground even though trips were officially sent? And he says ISIS is not Islamic.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:48.200]  Yeah, that was a huge joke. I got into a really big rant last night when I heard that.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:53.200]  You guys have been filing some powerful reports. They're all up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.200]  I'm going to come back and talk to you more. They're going to talk to the lovely and talented Leanne McAdoo as well.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200]  Then we're going to open the phones up.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:34.200]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical. Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.200]  It's happening now right here in the United States and your rights are at risk.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:42.200]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:48.200]  Katie Armor is standing up for you. We offer the most affordable level 3 body armor on the market.

[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.200]  What good is a big Berkey water filter?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.200]  We get that question a lot here at bigberkeywaterfilters.com and in a word the answer is protection.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:11.200]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.200]  pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.200]  Plus big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:28.200]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.

[01:22:53.200 --> 01:23:20.200]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.200]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:33.200]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable foods from my patriot supply.

[01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:16.200]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:25.200]  You want to be able to establish a police state and attack any country you wanted.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.200]  You would make a secret partnership with Saudi Arabia, who's been working with the West for over 100 years.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:39.200]  And you would have them create laundered, black-op, crazy armies that didn't even know who they were working for.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.200]  To run around and pillage Africa, the Middle East, Asia, you name it.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.200]  So then they pull out, the West gets to come in and take over.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.200]  And our troops get to die fighting them.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:56.200]  Oh, it's a real war. They're real radical Islamists, but they were turned loose.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:02.200]  And now they've done it publicly in Libya and in Syria and in Egypt.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:12.200]  And they think we're so dumb that we're now going to openly fund what Congress wouldn't fund last year.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:17.200]  Senator Cruz and Senator Paul spoke out against after we and others fought it.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.200]  The military came out and said, we're not going to be the Air Force for al-Qaeda.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:25.200]  Now, okay, you'll be the Air Force for the rebels fighting al-Qaeda.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.200]  And you'll bomb any targets, we say.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:31.200]  And they know Assad will start shooting on our aircraft because they're in their country.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.200]  And then they'll go, oh, we're going to bomb Assad now, too.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.200]  So I would advise Syria, and I know they're not stupid.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:43.200]  I'm against war and I'm against al-Qaeda, so I will openly tell Syria what I think they should do.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:52.200]  And as a stranger than fiction, came out on the one in Telegraph that the Syrian government does listen to the show and Assad listens and does actually base policy on this show.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.200]  That sounds completely arrogant and crazy, but it is news, so I might as well just say it.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.200]  I don't say that a lot because it sounds so crazy, but it's been in the British newspapers.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.200]  They hacked Assad's computers and published a bunch of it.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.200]  I've never been to Syria, I've never talked to Assad.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  I'd like to go see the Roman and Greek ruins there.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.200]  They're better than what's in Rome and Greece, they say.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:18.200]  Just total intact cities of stuff that, by the way, ISIS is blowing up when they get to it.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.200]  But I just don't know.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:27.200]  We articulate things so accurately from different angles that the Syrians listen to us take the bombing.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.200]  They'll probably false flag and shoot missiles at our aircraft anyways and blame it on you.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.200]  Announce you're not going to shoot at the forces and then just sit there and say,
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.200]  we don't know why America's bombing us.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:43.200]  Because if you fight back, they're going to invade and they're going to murder everybody in the country who is in al-Qaeda.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:49.200]  You know they want to sack the country and blow it up and tear everything to pieces like the globalists like to do.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:55.200]  And that's exactly basically what Lieutenant Colonel Shaffer said.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.200]  If we really wanted to get rid of al-Qaeda, Joe Beggs, former staff sergeant in Iraq, in Afghanistan,
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.200]  you know the region well, wouldn't we go to Assad and team up to take them out?
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:15.200]  I mean, how do you bomb the bad rebels working with the good rebels when it's well known publicly that 65% are al-Qaeda, Joe?
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.200]  And then I've been told it's over 95%.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:26.200]  Shaffer wouldn't say it on air, but little birds told me that the Pentagon knows full well they're basically all al-Qaeda, Joe.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:32.200]  Yeah, I mean, they've completely taken up arms with ISIS. I mean, they have ditched out all that.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:39.200]  They are on ISIS side. Our government wants this war with Syria so bad it's mind-blowing.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.200]  They're so thirsty for blood. They want to topple that regime just like they did in Libya.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:49.200]  They want to go, they want to start something with Russia. They're trying to get under Putin's skin, but he's not having it.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.200]  These guys are out looking for a fight. They want another war.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.200]  That's how we get those contract groups to get out there, make billions of dollars.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:03.200]  That's all this is about at the end of the day. They want more, more money. They're just evil, blood-sucking vampires.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.200]  And these globalist contractors and big banks that own them, there's not going to be anywhere to spend your money if you blow the earth up.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:18.200]  Yeah, but they don't understand that. Right now, they're just so high on this power trip that they have that they don't even think about the results of what they're doing.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:27.200]  I see that in personal life. We've all seen it, but when government acts like that, you get 20 million Germans killed thanks to Hitler.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:34.200]  This time, it'll be everybody, Joe. The London Telegraph says we've got to stop messing with Russia. It's going to cause nuclear war.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:44.200]  That's usually a hawkish right-wing publication. Why are they saying that today? Because they're not insane. That's why.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:53.200]  It's just mind-blowing. Like I said, how long have we been saying that the ISIS threat, although funded by CIA, is a very real threat?
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:29:02.200]  You sent us El Paso. We had to go and pull a stunt, crossing the border, showing you that an ISIS Jihad is indeed coming through our southern borders.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.200]  Everyone said that that was fear-mongering. They were crazy. Something like that cannot happen.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:14.200]  Yesterday, they're finally coming out. Mainstream media is saying it. The Department of Homeland Security is saying that there's a legitimate ISIS threat at our southern borders.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:21.200]  If we can't take a fight, Alex, with another country, with Syria, with Russia, what are we going to do?
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:29.200]  We're going to fund a group ourselves, and we're going to have them come into the country and open up and activate these terror sleeper cells.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.200]  That's the only way they can get their war, then, within our own country.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.200]  And take our rights away.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.200]  Exactly, just like we saw in Ferguson.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.200]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean. Between the two, they licked the bladder clean.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.200]  You get to take over the whole world with a skeleton key, magic wand that is al-Qaeda.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.200]  I'm going to come back and finish up with you and go to Leigh Ann. I want to get the mood down there when we come back with you.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:30:08.200]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:19.200]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.200]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:31.200]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:41.200]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.200]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:52.200]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenience spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:13.200]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security, alert, this is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:18.200]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.200]  Prime Directed, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.200]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.200]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:30.200]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.200]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.200]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:39.200]  They are never going to stop. They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.200]  Imperatives destroying Britain's planet TV.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.200]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:56.200]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out, intellectually it's begun. You can fail it.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.200]  Radio Network
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.200]  Black Ops to then turn that country that was just beautiful.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:58.200]  The infrastructure, the education.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:05.200]  I'm not for socialism because it's the only time it works if there's one dictator and they actually distribute the money, but then people get decked in it.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.200]  But it actually worked in Libya.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.200]  I'm a total capitalist.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.200]  But compared to the rest of Africa, it became a safe haven.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.200]  That place is an admitted failed state, worst place in the world.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200]  50,000 people dead conservatively.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.200]  Most of them being chopped up by Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:33.200]  Then our government tried to overthrow the second most populous country in Africa, Egypt, to put Al-Qaeda basically in.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  And what's crazy is when they put the Muslim Brotherhood in, they let Al-Qaeda in to just run around and just start murdering people and blowing up military bases.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:53.200]  I've got so much family that's fought these folks in Afghanistan, mainly in Iraq.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.200]  And they go, man, listen, these people will take their kid, pour gasoline all over them.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.200]  I was talking to my cousin about this.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.200]  And then call in a MedVac saying they've been burned in a car fire.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.200]  And then when you land, the guy's dad will come out and try to blow himself up.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.200]  And again, I'm not defending the West and the wars and the invasions.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.200]  I understand that.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:22.200]  Our government goes, stirs them up, funds the most radical people, and then lets us have a war with them to take our liberties.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.200]  It's so sick.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.200]  And now they're doing it in Syria and Iraq.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:37.200]  And Obama says, I'm going to ask Congress for funding to the rebels to take out Al-Qaeda when the rebels are 90-plus percent Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:44.200]  And to confuse people, Obama says ISIL, ISIS, IS, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  In any military journal, it is not debatable that ISIS is made up of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.200]  They call themselves Al-Qaeda in Libya.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.200]  This is Al-Qaeda, funded by Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.200]  It's in mainstream German, Dutch, British newspapers.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  Just type it in.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.200]  Saudi Arabia armed ISIS.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.200]  They gave them armored vehicles, rocket launchers.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.200]  It's all U.S. stuff Saudi Arabia bought.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:30.200]  But our government's so arrogant, they have C-130s landing in Jordan and Turkey, and they go to bases.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:42.200]  And the Al-Qaeda people come up to the airplanes as 45-year-old, 65-year-old CIA people sit there with their mouths hanging open.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.200]  I mean, normally they would send a truck with some troops or something to then deliver it to Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.200]  They make our troops and CIA people actually go meet with Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:37:04.200]  I mean, you imagine being in the CIA and pulling up, landing on a plane and getting off, and there's guys with beards, with Al-Qaeda patches, and you're giving them stinger missiles.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.200]  That's what Tosh Plumley talked about here.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.200]  It's all been confirmed.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:13.200]  I'm going to go back to Joe Biggs and Leanne McAddy, because you guys have a lot of reports to follow from the nightly news tonight.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200]  You're doing a great job.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.200]  Joe, I just keep marveling.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.200]  It's not even about arming Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.200]  The story's bigger than that.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.200]  It's the mind games of changing the names to confuse us, and what do you think they're planning there?
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.200]  Because, I mean, how are they going to...
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.200]  You know this is to overthrow Assad.
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.200]  How are they going to spin this back when they armed him to attack Assad?
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.200]  Now they claim they're attacking him, but it's really an attack on Assad.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:45.200]  Do you think they're planning some new big terror attack that will be so emotional that people will forget and will say blow up Assad and maybe blame him or something?
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.200]  Kind of like they blame Saddam when it was Saudi Arabia?
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.200]  I mean, what do you think is happening here, Joe?
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200]  You fought these people?
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.200]  You fought Al-Qaeda?
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.200]  Well, the biggest thing is the hearts and minds.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.200]  They want you to feel like the bad guy that they want you to...
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  Whoever they...you know, Assad.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.200]  That's our bad guy.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.200]  So we paint that picture.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:12.200]  Now the only way to get the hearts and minds of the American people to back a war with them is to feel like there's some kind of humanitarian crisis happening in that area.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.200]  That's what happened a year ago.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.200]  They said there were these chemical attacks, all this stuff is bad, Assad's bad, bad, bad, bad.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.200]  Let's go fund the Free Syrian Army.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:27.200]  Bitch, by the way, are a lot of the same rebels in Libya who also admit that Al-Qaeda is with them, which is now ISIS.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.200]  You know, a lot of people forget...
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.200]  And they launched the chemical attack?
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:31.200]  Exactly.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.200]  They want you to feel like there's a humanitarian crisis involved.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.200]  That's how you get 90% of the hearts and minds of Americans, the people who are asleep, not paying attention.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.200]  They flip on CNN Fox News and they see the kids sitting in a cell somewhere.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.200]  They see little kids running around crying.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.200]  That's all they see.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  They see that one area where that camera is pointing.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:52.200]  Meanwhile, while the rest of it's going on, the people are like, this isn't even happening here.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.200]  They just want you to see that right there.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.200]  That's all they care about.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:06.200]  It's always going to be a humanitarian crisis to get these people here amped up to back the president to go on some bogus war again so we lose more Americans and a stupid war.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.200]  Exactly, but this time it's not even flimsy.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.200]  It's totally transparent.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.200]  You've got Rand Paul and others saying, don't arm Al Qaeda.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:17.200]  We're about to give money to the same people we fought.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.200]  You've got generals saying it.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:28.200]  And then the Republican leadership has lined up saluting Obama, Boehner, going, yes, we're going to back arming the rebels to stop Al Qaeda when it's the same people.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.200]  What are they going to do when Al Qaeda attacks the United States and Europe with these weapons?
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:40.200]  Well, ISIS was very disorganized until a few months ago where they have ramped up and gotten a lot more leadership.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:45.200]  I don't know if you remember, we gave them the leadership with a deserter named Bo Bergdahl.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:52.200]  We traded him for five top leaders who are now back in the mix leading these men.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.200]  I'm guarantee you they've got their hands in there.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  That leadership is in play and they're helping these guys get structured and learn how to game plan the right way.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:11.200]  And of course, while these leaders were held for years, they were being told the real game plan at the highest level that, oh, you're going to go out and do this.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.200]  You're going to destabilize, but you don't go into Kurdistan.
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.200]  You don't go into Iran.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.200]  This is the deal.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200]  We're breaking Iraq in three parts.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.200]  You're going to get a piece of it and a piece of Syria.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:27.200]  Now go play dumb, but then they're so out of control and they're always turning on each other as well that they went outside the lines.
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.200]  They painted outside the numbers and went into Kurdistan and they even attacked Jordan a few weeks ago.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:39.200]  And so it may be they're really getting ready to attack ISIS because they've double crossed the West.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.200]  My point is, what are you doing working with Al Qaeda publicly?
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.200]  I mean, it's just, that's what I'm saying, Joe.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.200]  How do they get away with this?
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  I don't see the establishment pulling this off this time and they better know that if they let Al Qaeda attack the United States,
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.200]  I don't care how many times they change the name.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.200]  They can change the name of Toucan Sam Demarra.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.200]  We know who's behind this.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.200]  9-Eleven Truth will totally expose them this time.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.200]  The thing is though, the people have been dumbed down so much that truly,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:18.200]  Obama can be so transparent and throw things in our face that most people won't even pay attention or see it.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.200]  They won't even care.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.200]  I mean, you could see Obama in a video going,
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.200]  all right, I want you guys to attack the southern borders and people will turn on the TV and watch.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.200]  I go, nah, that's not, he didn't do that.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.200]  You know, that's how transparent they've been able to be.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.200]  Every plan that they've wanted up until now has worked.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.200]  Sure.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:43.200]  And when we say inside job, the media always spun that down to dumb down propaganda that that means the police blew up the towers or
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.200]  that means there are no Muslim extremists.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.200]  No, that's not what we ever said.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.200]  He said, wow, the head of the embassy says they were ordered to let the hijackers in.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.200]  They were CIA.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:56.200]  Hey, the head of the defense language school in Monterey says he trained Muhammad out on others.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200]  They were US government agents.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]  Hey, Norad stood down.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.200]  Hey, they're using this to take our liberties.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.200]  Hey, they're using this to attack countries had nothing to do with it.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:11.200]  This is a pretext by criminal groups inside the country double crossing us with Saudi Arabia and others.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200]  Period.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.200]  There's no way that many coincidences happen on a one sided assault.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:23.200]  The only way for that many coincidences to happen for both parties to be involved, the US and the terrorists as well.
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.200]  Not always.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.200]  I agree.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.200]  Not once, not twice, not 10 times, more than 15 times.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:29.200]  I want to get him back on.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.200]  He speaks good English.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:33.200]  Andres von Mulo was the German defense minister.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.200]  Then he was the head of their CIA.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.200]  He wrote a 300 page book.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.200]  I have had him on the show and the headline is the CIA executed 9 11.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200]  That's what it translates into English.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:49.200]  This is the head of the German CIA highly respected Andres von Mulo.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:58.200]  And here's this quote to hijack four huge airplanes within a few minutes and within one hour to drive them into their targets with complicated flight maneuvers.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:03.200]  This is unthinkable without years long support from secret apparatus of the state and industry.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:09.200]  Andres von Mulo, former secretary of state in the German federal ministry of defense.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.200]  And that is up on info wars dot com.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:23.200]  And he actually in the book breaks down and he said on the air the entire German defense command and the entire German intelligence knew instantly.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.200]  There were bombs instantly.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.200]  I mean, these aren't morons.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.200]  They were all just standing there with their mouths hanging open.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  Then they saw the insider trading by the executive director of the CIA.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.200]  Buzzy Crongard even came out in their spiegel because Germans went public.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.200]  They went, this is a rice tag event.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:46.200]  I mean, Andres von Mulo folks guys like 170 IQ.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:51.200]  He wrote a book proving that it was an inside job bare minimum.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:56.200]  They we know they put the hijackers on and the few air calls that actually got out said we can't breathe.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:57.200]  There's gas.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.200]  There's smoke.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.200]  They nerve gas the people remote control took over flew the planes into buildings.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:09.200]  The hijackers were trained for drills to test airport security in a CIA Defense Department program.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.200]  That's why you're a cop or anybody else.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:17.200]  Don't be part of secret drills because they're getting ready to say cops and military are going to blow stuff up.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:23.200]  That's the next deal nine times out of a, you know, one time out of 100 one time out of 200.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:26.200]  It'll be a real, you know, terror attack.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:29.200]  So most of the time it's, it's, it's, it's a real drill.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.200]  But this is how they set people up.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.200]  I want to go to Leanne McAdoo Joe Biggs.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.200]  We're going to get more from you.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:41.200]  Probably if you've got more to report coming up during the special fourth hour, we're going to focus in on 9 11 today.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.200]  I'm going to have open phones next hour.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:53.200]  We're also going to get Jerome Corsi to pop in on Isis and the Muslim Brotherhood and their original investigative reporting because I brought up to Colonel Shaffer yesterday.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:45:04.200]  That we know his cousin Odinga has been confirmed to be sending hundreds of millions out of Kenya just north to Egypt to overthrow that government.
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:11.200]  That's come out in trials and that they're connected into the attacks on the shopping malls and stuff.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:20.200]  So as this comes out, it's even more crazy than I thought it could be because usually presidents are puppets and I've said Obama's a puppet.
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:31.200]  What do you think the real strategy is with Obama and his cousin trying to overthrow a U.S. ally that's done nothing to us like Egypt?
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.200]  His Skype just dropped.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.200]  We're going to get him back and then get Leanne on.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:43.200]  Again, I am just ranting here, ladies and gentlemen, and just going over the different angles of this, trying to figure out exactly what's going on.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:49.200]  That's how we come to the answers and the conclusions that 98% of the time turned out to be accurate.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:51.200]  It's why we've made so many accurate predictions.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:58.200]  It's why Japanese government listens, Russian government listens, Syrian government listens, our government listens.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:04.200]  We're number one with the military, number one with the police now just across the board.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.200]  And it's because we aren't putting on airs.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.200]  We're not reading off teleprompters.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:10.200]  We're looking for the truth.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.200]  And it's not simple.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.200]  It's not a sound bite here.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  We get bad men.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.200]  We bomb Al Qaeda and it's really a sod.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.200]  There are no boots in ground.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.200]  ISIS not part of Islam.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:30.200]  Joe, what do you make of him saying it's not part of Islam again and saying there's no boots on the ground as it's announced he's sending ground troops?
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.200]  That's the funniest part.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.200]  Yeah, there's no troops, but we're sending troops.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.200]  And we already said a while back that we sent some as well.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:44.200]  But yeah, that was one of the most interesting things that Obama said last night is that ISIS is not of Islam.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:54.200]  He said because everyone's claiming this is a holy war and that if that's the case, then Islam would have nothing to do with killing innocent Muslims.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:47:02.200]  But the funny part is though, he never once mentioned the thousands of Christians they killed in Arabia, Iraq.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.200]  He didn't say anything about that at all.
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.200]  I don't think he really cared about that.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:10.200]  But that was a very interesting point that he's saying that they're not of Islam and they have nothing to do with that.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.200]  Why won't our government ever talk about Christians getting killed?
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:16.200]  It's like Christians are used cat litter with this government.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.200]  Yeah, I mean, we're the new anti-everything.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.200]  Anybody who is a Christian, who is a returning veteran, we're all terrorists, we're all being watched.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.200]  You know, they're hacking into our equipment and our phones or microwaves.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.200]  It's just mind-blowing.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.200]  This police state that we live in and they want another war.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.200]  They want to attack on American soil because we saw what happened in Ferguson.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:45.200]  They can make that happen so quick and so intense to where you're told where you can be, where you can't go, what you can do, how you can look at somebody.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.200]  It's crazy and it gives me goosebumps just to think about that.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:51.200]  I hate it.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:56.200]  But the border is wide open but illegals get to fly without IDs.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:58.200]  That's confirmed three weeks ago.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.200]  We already have seen that.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.200]  And Reed and Feinstein say that the boards are completely secure.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.200]  There's nothing to worry about.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200]  They're the most secure they've ever been.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:11.200]  It's funny, though, because every time I've been to the border, I have literally been able to cross the border if I wanted to.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.200]  And let's be very crystal clear about this.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.200]  You're not out in the middle of nowhere crossing.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:28.200]  You were in a park by downtown El Paso dressed as an al-Qaeda ISIS with an al-Qaeda flag and a sword and a fake severed head.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:36.200]  Yeah, I saw the Mexican border patrol, they pulled up and they just pulled down the street on the Mexican side.
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.200]  They turn around and leave.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.200]  They don't stop, get out and look around.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:45.200]  So anybody could literally just be sitting there waiting on them to drive up, turn around and then cross like we did.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.200]  It's just patience.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.200]  They have patience.
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.200]  And this is in El Paso.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.200]  So all I'm saying is don't take my rights saying you're keeping me safe.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.200]  I'll take the threat of al-Qaeda that you armed.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.200]  It's now becoming a real threat.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.200]  And because I know the real target is my freedom.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  We're going to go to break and come back with two segments with Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.200]  And then I'm going to give the number out and take phone calls.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.200]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.200]  We're going to go to break and come back with Leigh Ann.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:21.200]  Also, please remember that this hour is brought to you by all of the M4's Life products.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.200]  You can find them online at infowarslife.com.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:34.200]  I seek out the most cutting edge supplements that are in development and are brand new or are staple products known to be the very best.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.200]  They're all available at infowarslife.com.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  We have the oxy powder that has now become the number one best seller we've ever had.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:47.200]  Because, I mean, the pitch yesterday was so true.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:52.200]  I went on this two weeks ago after them pushing me for months to try it.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.200]  I'm going to take oxygen pills.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.200]  I finally did and it is incredible.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  This will flush you out like nothing you've ever imagined.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:03.200]  I mean, I can just say it will because it does.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  I mean, this is incredible and it is such a detoxifying effect.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.200]  I mean, I was so toxic over the years, so full of stress.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:13.200]  I'm still in the process, but of all the things I've done,
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:19.200]  the high quality X2 proprietary nascent iodine, the colloidal silver, the super male vitality that's incredible,
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  all of it at infowarslife.com.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.200]  This was just a quantum leap flushing me out.
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  So oxy powder, very simple name, very powerful concept proprietary so that it releases in your intestines,
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:35.200]  not in your stomach, and just pushes everything out.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.200]  I mean, you think you've done some kind of other cleanse before.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.200]  You've taken a bunch of salad.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.200]  No, no, this is completely different.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.200]  The oxygen literally eats through all the garbage.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:54.200]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and your purchase makes the entire broadcast possible.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:51:16.200]  888-253-3139. It's a win-win. Try it, folks.
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.200]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:34.200]  This is an alert. If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:38.200]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church or warehouse.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:44.200]  A general steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:47.200]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.200]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:59.200]  Call 866-91-Steel. 866-91-Steel. That's 866-917-8335.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:03.200]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:06.200]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.200]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:13.200]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:17.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.200]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:47.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:53:04.200]  My name's Bruno. I'm 52 years old. I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.200]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.200]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented,
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.200]  You have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.200]  My body has changed dramatically.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:18.200]  I'm a cyclist. Normally I'll ride 2 days on and take 2 days off.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:23.200]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:28.200]  And then I take another 2 servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:30.200]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:34.200]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:39.200]  Don't take my word for it. One World Way comes in single serving. Just give it a try.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:45.200]  One World Way is derived from Amish, grass-pastured cows and is newly reformulated to be higher in protein.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:57.200]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit www.oneworldway.com
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:21.200]  And time keeps dragging on
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.200]  But that strain keeps rolling
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:28.200]  All down the sad and cold
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.200]  When I was just a baby
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.200]  Johnny Cash bringing us in
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.200]  Always be a good man
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.200]  Leanne McAdoo is in New York City.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:43.200]  Leanne, you guys have been filing a lot of powerful reports for the nightly news and infowars.com.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:50.200]  There's so much to talk about. What hits you 13 years later being so close to that horrific scene?
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:54.200]  I'm just glad there hadn't been a terror attack in the last few days or today.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:58.200]  Like Homeland Security said, it was imminent. Do you think that was more fair-mongering?
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.200]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for infowars.com
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:09.200]  Standing here outside One World Trade Center, the site of where the worst terror attack on the country has ever happened.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:16.200]  Yes, Alex, I am very excited and very happy that we have not been the victims of this latest terror threat that we've...
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:21.200]  Homeland Security is kind of backtracking saying, no, there's not a threat, but there is a threat.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.200]  Are you feeling safer, though, that we're going to arm the Al Qaeda rebels to fight Al Qaeda?
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.200]  I think that's an excellent choice by the president.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:35.200]  They're on this weird time loop of every single year, arming the very people that they're going to go to war with about a year later.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.200]  So it makes sense. I guess they just want to make sure that they're on even ground with the weaponry.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.200]  It's almost like a Rolex swish movement. It's so exact.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.200]  But I don't expect them to actually really attack ISIS.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:53.200]  They'll probably just attack Assad and then have like a South Park-style puppet get up there and say,
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.200]  I'm Assad, I'm Al Qaeda, and I guess the American people will buy it, Leanne.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.200]  Right, absolutely. Well, that's this gaslighting from this administration.
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.200]  It's just, it's infuriating when the president comes out last night and says,
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  one thing I want to be clear on, Islamic State is not Islam.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  I mean, why, with all of the political correctness, what is that helping?
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:23.200]  That is going to get people killed. These people believe that they are the ultimate version of Islam.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  They're going to slaughter the blood and spill the blood of all Americans in the world until they get the world under Sharia law.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:35.200]  So here are people that think that they are the ultimate version of Islam.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:42.200]  So if you have some Muslims out there who are maybe, you know, searching for the truth or they want to take it a step further,
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:48.200]  and then they're hearing these mixed messages of, you know, people converting to Islam and going and joining these jihadi movements,
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  because that's the ultimate sacrifice to Allah.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  Like, that's a confusing message to send to people.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:59.200]  People are literally going and joining these people and sacrificing their lives.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:04.200]  And the British government lets them fly back and forth. This is all sanctioned by the West.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  And then they're going to use these people and they come back and blow stuff up to take Lee and McAdoo's liberties, Alex Jones's liberties,
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.200]  Staff Sergeant Joe Big's liberties, you know, John Gonzalez's liberties, that's just John Doe.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.200]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:25.200]  Right. And we're not allowed to talk about it because then that makes us racist, makes us insensitive or we're bigots.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  You know, the only people that we can think of as a terror threat are returning veterans and patriots and people that are pro-life.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.200]  These are the real terrorists.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.200]  That's what political correctness is. It's simply amazing. You guys have filed a bunch of reports.
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.200]  I saw some of them last night and this morning, what else have you been working on?
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.200]  What else is coming up for people that are going to see the nightly news?
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.200]  Well, we're headed back over to Times Square.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:59.200]  We're supposed to be speaking with the Batman. He was very heated about the fact that the city is trying to make them remove their masks
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:09.200]  because of terrorism and he was saying in a very thick foreign accent, this is America and the Constitution and there's a reason why it's here
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:14.200]  and we have the freedom to do what we want and to wear what we want. This is America.
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:19.200]  That's right. In fact, you're down close to ground zero right now, aren't you?
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:28.200]  Yes, absolutely. Right here. One World Trade Center where obviously this symbology is where the two towers fell and then merged into one.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:34.200]  And they have that new building that looks like a giant pyramid. If you look at it, the whole face of it's really a big pyramid.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:39.200]  I've never really noticed that in photos. When you look at the video, you can see it. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:44.200]  Look at that. It's right up. It's like two pyramids with another pyramid inverted.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:49.200]  Looks like something Emperor Palpatine would live in. You have a new building, seven.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:23.200]  Info Wars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions found more than 7000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:30.200]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients,
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:38.200]  and completely vegan. We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation, pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:47.200]  X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at infowarslife.com, infowarstore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:13.200]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:22.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:37.200]  Leon McAdoo. We're going to write an article about it probably tomorrow or tonight.
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:40.200]  The video is up on infowars.com right now.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:47.200]  Retired Lieutenant Colonel reveals secrets of the 28-page 9-11 report.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:56.200]  CIA trained intelligence officer confirms infowars analysis that it's covering up for Saudi Arabia.
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:08.200]  That's a great headline, but it should probably be Insider confirms 9-11 report trying to get an exact headline.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:16.200]  So this broadcast is so transparent that we're actually here on air conducting just behind the scene stuff live because there's no other way to do it.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:27.200]  I mean, how do you take something that big and then put it into a headline that a Insider who was on Capitol Hill who's talked to the sources
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:41.200]  confirmed that the 28-page report that's being redacted and suppressed confirms that Saudi Arabia was involved and our government knew.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:47.200]  Insider reveals US government covering up truth of 9-11 report. I don't know.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:54.200]  I guess retired Lieutenant Colonel reveals secrets of 28-page 9-11 report is a pretty good headline.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:02:00.200]  Look at these other articles. TSA demands to conduct full body pat down on man after his plane already landed.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:11.200]  San Diego school police given mine resistant military vehicle by Pentagon, the police, the school, ISIS threat to America, a farce.
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:19.200]  I don't know if I agree with that headline, but I do agree that it's a threat because they manufactured it, but then it becomes a real threat.
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  That's a Kurt Nemo article. I haven't read it yet, but I'm going to. I'm sure I agree with him. Kurt's a pretty smart fellow.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:30.200]  But it's lurid propaganda campaign, Stampede's public into accepting another war. Well, that's certainly accurate.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:43.200]  Let's go ahead and go back to Leanne McAdoo. Leanne, so you're going to go up and basically just, I guess, show the police state that's been set up since 9-11 that's pointed at cartoon characters, not at ISIS?
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:50.200]  Exactly. But that's kind of the thing. We don't know if they are ISIS because they've all got masks on. That's the big problem there.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:59.200]  They're allowed to wear masks, but people with the protests are not because people that have their mind on freedom and liberty, they're terrorists.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:07.200]  So we're actually out here now and this police state is blatant all around us. They've got it all locked off.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:17.200]  And one of the things that's really upsetting to me, because here on the anniversary of 9-11, the things that have always brought me to tears are seeing men and women in uniform
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:25.200]  willing to sacrifice their lives for me. Now, granted, we know there are definitely some bad apples in the bunch, but there are some really...
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:35.200]  But still, there's the archetypal issue of the warriors defending us and now they're not allowed in the ceremony, except for a few handpicked for television.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:42.200]  Well, the thing that was just so upsetting, Alex, is you see them and they're just dressed in their finest suits today.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:56.200]  And down this hallway, tucked in an alleyway outside of the ceremonial plaza, they have a tiny little section where the first responders are having their own ceremony right here.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:01.200]  We tried to see if we could get a little bit of a signal there and we weren't able to, but it was just so touching.
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:09.200]  They have all of the doors and the things that were destroyed there, a little bit of a wreckage to just kind of give a ceremony for themselves.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:16.200]  Why are the first responders, once again this year, not allowed inside the ceremony? They lost people that day as well.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:24.200]  Well, that's because there were nothing but a prop the whole time to sell the end of America, to sell the police state on the backs of their valiant efforts.
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:31.200]  That's why. And now they want to hide them like the World War I bonus marchers. They just want to shovel them into their political graves.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:39.200]  That's what's happening. Leanne, I know you've got more reports coming on the nightly news and I know you guys have got more breaking coming up.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:47.200]  So we may be talking to you guys coming up in the fourth hour today, a special fourth hour that some stations carry.
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:52.200]  It will be live on PrismPlanet.tv out of the new studio. Thank you so much, Leanne.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.200]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:59.200]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. I'll give the number out. I'll take your phone calls and get your take.
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:06.200]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:09.200]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:16.200]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:19.200]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.200]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:27.200]  Well, here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:32.200]  To be safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:36.200]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:39.200]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:46.200]  The Pro Pure Pro One G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently minded household.

[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:33.200]  Survival Shield X2. Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, Infowars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions found more than 7000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:48.200]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan. We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation, pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth.

[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:15.200]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:39.200]  The Lonely Sea. The Lonely Sea. It never stops for you.
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:55.200]  I'm going to open the phones up. I'd specifically like to hear from listeners, because this is so open, so evil, so bizarre, that I can't even figure out exactly what's going on.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:18.200]  Al Qaeda is double-crossing NATO and Obama and attacking Jordan and Kurdistan when they're not supposed to in the deal they have with the Pentagon. That right there, though, that our own government's been arming Al Qaeda all over the Middle East for four years publicly, they should all be going to prison.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:30.200]  But it's the attempt. Now, to say we're going to fight the rebels by arming the rebels, when 90-plus percent of the rebels, I was saying 65, Colonel Shaffer said no.
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:41.200]  From classified documents, I can't say the exact number. It's way higher than that. And then I made some phone calls and things, and they say it's about 95 percent, which makes sense.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:51.200]  I mean, that's who's out there fighting. That's what's on all the videos. That's who the groups are. That's what the Muslim Brotherhood is, is a front forum. Saudi Arabia's involved.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:10:04.200]  And this is a big deal, because if they let them establish a state, they will try to attack Western targets. And the establishment will then use that to take our freedoms. That's why this is such a big deal.
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:16.200]  13 years later, on the anniversary of 9-11, on the eve of it, last night, Obama says, Islamic State is not Islamic. We will have no boots on the ground, but we're going to start bombing them wherever they are.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:23.200]  That's an excuse to attack any country they want. In Africa, you name it, where these people, they funded and turned loose or running around.
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:41.200]  That is such an evil beyond Machiavellian strategy. And I don't see how they're going to get away with it. Here's the toll-free number, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:54.200]  This story is up on DrudgeReport.com. It originates from Infowars.com video. TSA demands to conduct full-body pat-down on man after his plane already landed.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:11:01.200]  And I'll get to this in the fourth hour today, because I've got Jerome Corsi coming up at some of your phone calls.
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:13.200]  Dr. Corsi, who is the expert on what's happening and who predicted everything now unfolding. Two years ago, he said Obama's funding some secret Jihad takeover in the Middle East and Africa.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:23.200]  And then he's going to use the attacks to take freedom here. And I was just like, man, this is just too much. Of course, he worked in the State Department and other classified areas.
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:33.200]  There's a lot more to Jerome Corsi than meets the eye. I'll just say that. And we're going to be talking to him coming up to get his breakdown and all this.
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:40.200]  But I could just feel in my gut, this is the start of something big. It's a proxy war against Russia. And I just don't want to destroy the planet.
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:49.200]  And even the London Telegraph has an article out today, the West faced the Russian Wolf and the West back down.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:55.200]  I'm paraphrasing the headline, but I read it this morning. It's here on the stack.
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:07.200]  There it is. It's time to back away from the Russian Wolf. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, won't be thwarted by NATO or economic sanctions and his aim of a neutral Ukraine is acceptable.
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:13.200]  And then it goes on to say we went and faced the wolf and had to back down. And here's that news today.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:23.200]  Russia successfully test nuclear missile more planned Navy chief Reuters AP Russian gas supplies to Poland drop further.
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:29.200]  Deliveries have dropped through the pipes 45%. They sell the cheapest gas in the world.
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:35.200]  Western oil companies have openly said they want to cut off their gas because they could then gouge Europe.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:46.200]  I mean, Russia's allowed to sell their gas, folks, just like we're allowed to have coal power plants, just like we're allowed to have businesses and have kids and raise them like we want.
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:53.200]  The globalists want to run everybody's life. They're as bad as it gets.
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:13:02.200]  They're the ones that run America, not the Russians. I would hate the Russians if they tried one-tenth of what the globalists do.
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:07.200]  Can you imagine if the Russians were trying to take our guns and open our borders and saying our kids didn't belong to us?
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:13.200]  Imagine if on Russian TV they were saying kids belong to the state, not their parents like MSNBC in official promo.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:23.200]  We go, man, those Russians are evil. Our leadership is a bunch of criminals. That's an understatement.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:32.200]  That's why people are starting to freak out. Russia is not going to back down, folks. It's not going to happen.
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:42.200]  The Russians are double-stubborn, beyond a mule. You could call it the Russian Bubba effect.
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:48.200]  The more you push them, the more they dig in. They don't quit drinking vodka and don't get anything done until you mess with them.
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:55.200]  It's like an ant hill comes out. They develop a bunch of secret weapons and stuff. Russians are smart, folks.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:03.200]  They've got very high IQs, some of the highest in the world. The globalists just think they're like Syria or Iraq.
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:08.200]  They can just kick them around all day and try to overthrow them with George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:13.200]  By the way, the Russians are scared of us. They know how crazy our leaders are.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:20.200]  They're completely freaked out building bunkers. Again, I'm not lionizing the Russian predatory state.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:28.200]  Oh, I got a bunch of other news. I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:34.200]  There are no boots on the ground. There will be no boots on the ground when he ordered 1,000 cents there two weeks ago.
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:45.200]  There are 400 that AP right here, 475 today embedded with the rebels.
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:56.200]  No boots on the ground. You didn't build your business.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  Obamacare cuts your price. It's all lies. It's all lies.
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:05.200]  Bloomberg came out a few months ago and said, I'm the biggest second member supporter in the world. I don't want to take your guns.
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:15.200]  They banned guns in New York City. He wants a gun ban. They're liars, but I don't understand why they lie so much.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.200]  What is the point of it? Why do we put up with it?
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:27.200]  They have a method of this to just shut us down, to condition us to where we'll put up with anything.
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:31.200]  They're getting us ready for something big. That's why I'm getting freaked out here.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:36.200]  They're acting like they don't care how bad they are that nothing can stop them.
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:45.200]  And I don't know if that's because they're crazy completely and out of their minds like crazy people I've known in business and life.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:54.200]  Or whether they got some trick up their sleeve or both. I mean, it's just so dangerous people.
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:59.200]  All the top analysts say the world is the most dangerous position now it's ever been in and you can feel it.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  Not just intellectually or militarily or geopolitically look at it. You can feel it.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:08.200]  And it's because we got demons in charge and it's a lot bigger than Obama.
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:14.200]  Let's go to Patrick in Kentucky. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:18.200]  Hey, Patrick, I don't get any audio from you. You going to talk to us, brother?
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:24.200]  Yeah, so I was going to talk about the GCHQ program, Squeaky Dolphin.
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:27.200]  Yeah, that's the British version of the NSA.
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:36.200]  Yep. And then in the NSA, they've got contact training where they can go three hops to see communications amongst people.
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.200]  So between those two programs, they can keep their, they can understand those.
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:50.200]  The entire network of all the jihadi groups because they run most of them. Yes, yes, they know they could have stopped 9-11.
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:54.200]  All of this stuff. It's pure bull. Is that what you're getting at?
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:17:02.200]  They also know the opinions of the general public. So if this seems like a fluency case for war, they have their finger on the pulse of the planet.
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:08.200]  And they know exactly how to perceive what messaging to use in order to achieve their end goals.
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:14.200]  That's right. That's the key to the NSA crystal ball, Palantir program.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:18.200]  And I don't mean that in the Palantir NSA program itself, even though it's Palantir, the pun is intended.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:24.200]  It's a literal Palantir because they can then practice their lies and see what's working.
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:33.200]  And it's the equivalent of missile guidance in a sidewinder versus a Welsh longbow for their lies.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:38.200]  They now have the nuclear option of lies. Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:50.200]  Yeah, exactly. They have, when people talk about metadata and that they downplay that as it's not important, you can actually map out the interactions of people all over the planet.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:18:06.200]  And you'd know exactly sentiment and opinions, likes, dislikes, all of that is aggregated and it's available in simple dashboard formats so that executives can see exactly how their messaging is going, how people are reacting.
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  And if it seems like this is a half-baked strategy, it might be because it is because they just have to improvise and react to what their analysts tell them is the attitude.
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  What am I about to say? Just because 60% of the American people are in a coma doesn't mean they can start a nuclear war with Russia.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:32.200]  It doesn't suspend the laws of physics. It doesn't mean that morally it will come out later that they funded Al Qaeda.
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:38.200]  They're not going to get away with this new lie and they lose more credibility each time they do this.
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:51.200]  So if they're looking at the algorithms currently, they could see the bigger algorithm that I can look at just analyzing it daily with my electrochemical computer between my ears and see that they're losing credibility.
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:19:05.200]  That's why I'm saying it's such a dangerous strategy. This is how I would destroy Western power. This is how I would bring down the West, what they're doing right now, just openly losing the moral high ground, bleeding out in front of everyone.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:19.200]  What do you think the grand strategy is? It's really in the end game to take over the world using Western muscle, then demonize us in the process, bring us down for the formation of the world government on its ashes.
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:41.200]  I think so. I would speculate a more concrete plan underneath that is that the petrodollar has to remain dominant. And so I think that's part of the same objectives here is to make sure that we don't lose the status of the US dollar as a reserve currency.
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:51.200]  And that's why we're in bed with the Middle East, right? These people over there, that's our ticket to make sure that oil backs up the dollar since we got rid of the gold standard.
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:20:14.200]  Yes, you're right, but then it's schizophrenic because they carry out policies that actually destroy the dollar. It's incredible.
[02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:39.200]  We, the people, grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:46.200]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:59.200]  And I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:19.200]  From the water table to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:31.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:41.200]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:51.200]  With organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A., the new InfoWarsLive Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:28.200]  Citizens are being harassed when they get on airplanes, but the illegals can fly without IDs.
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:33.200]  It's clearly a criminal takeover. Anybody can see that.
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:41.200]  And even if people are awake, they just have this attitude of fatalism. What are you going to do about it? Let's just go along with it.
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:48.200]  But Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny you live under is the exact level you'll put up with.
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:59.200]  You understand the sky is the limit because we don't have any limits. We'll put up with anything.
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:14.200]  And it's seen as abnormal to be freaked out about Obama just up there on TV lying at levels that make Bill Clinton look like a saint.
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:25.200]  It's just a wall of lies. How do you even respond to it? I see the grand strategy. It's just completely set the precedent where everything is turned upside down in 2 plus 2 equals 7.
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:32.200]  Just whatever they want it to. I know I keep talking about that and harping on it. It's because that's what it is.
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:40.200]  It's just we're here. It's such a joke. Everyone is in peril. We're all in danger.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:48.200]  Richard in Arizona. You want to talk about Ebola, the Cali drought and more? That's fine. I'm more than happy to do that.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  But I wanted to open the phones up. I don't really screen calls, but I said I want to get your take on funding Al Qaeda and Obama's speech.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:07.200]  So really nobody even called in about that. But that's okay. Richard, you want to talk about Ebola? That's pretty darn important. It is becoming a really bad epidemic. Go ahead.
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:12.200]  Sorry, Alex. I don't mean to be off topic here. I've been trying to reach you on this for a long time.
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.200]  It's all right, brother. You're on the air. Go ahead. I just noticed nobody's calling in on it. Go ahead.
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:31.200]  Thank you. I really appreciate you. Let me just say that I know you don't need more work to do, more to cover, but I have to mention two stories that are being totally covered up and ignored by all media that I've seen so far and that are really critical.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:43.200]  Two topics. One is Ebola and the thing about Ebola is that the government has already proven a substance that will kill it in their own studies.
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:56.200]  And they're not only covering it up, but they're blocking private shipments of this material to Africa. And it's clear that the reason they're doing that is so that the planned epidemic can run its course.
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:10.200]  Well, I know that it's about 93% death if you don't get the right medical treatment. But 50% is fatal, generally, from what I've read, if you don't get proper hospital attention.
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:15.200]  So there's a lot of things that mitigate it. Are you saying there's a cure for Ebola?
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:20.200]  Not exactly. I want to be really precise. And then there's one other point I want to make real quick.
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:26.200]  People don't know what it is. What is it?
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:30.200]  Yeah, their own study, the government did this study with 10 part per million nano sized silver particles.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:37.200]  Oh, I knew that. Sure, sure. I've seen the studies that nano silver and colloidal silver period has had a big effect on it.
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:47.200]  I mean, look, the old timers put silver dollars in milk to keep it good down in the root cellar. People put silver dollars on babies, chest and stomachs when they were born.
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:53.200]  Everybody knows silver is an antibiotic and an antiviral. And you're absolutely right. What was your other point?
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.200]  Yeah, this was done within the DOD department and totally silenced.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:10.200]  And the other thing is the California drought, which threatens the lives of everybody in the country right now and is part of the overall war that al-Qaeda is also part of against humanity.
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.200]  That was entirely engineered and I have detailed information on that.
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  You should write an article about it. I mean, if people write articles with a bibliography with proof, we'll publish them to infowars.com.
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:32.200]  Send them to showtips, send them to writers at infowars.com and our great people like Kurt Nemo and others will fact check it.
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:39.200]  Kurt's really good about that. That's really where he excels is proof reading other people's stories and approving them or not approving them.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:49.200]  We'd love for you to point us in that direction. I'm aware of the studies on silver and Ebola and other issues, bacteria and viruses.
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  I'm aware of all sorts of information on that front.
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:04.200]  And one reason they don't want to use things like silver on bacteria and viruses is because anybody can put out good silver pretty much.
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:11.200]  So you don't get a Bill of Melinda Gates Foundation vaccine out of that with Monsanto in a partnership.
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:19.200]  You don't get to vaccinate the world and make $100 billion over a decade on it and then put Lord knows what as a Trojan horse on top of it.
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:24.200]  So send us the info, sir, or send us an email with leads and we will look into it.
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:34.200]  We've got a great crew in there like Kurt Nemo and Michael Thalen and Don Salazar and Kit Daniels and so many others.
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:42.200]  That it's hard to even get to all the news they've put out, but I'm going to read some of those headlines when we come back from prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:48.200]  and then get your own course about 15 minutes to go back to your calls in the fourth hour from the new studios coming up live.
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:55.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:29.200]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he's got a PhD doctorate in economics and international relations.
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:38.200]  And his advised State Department Pentagon, you name it, been involved in a lot of operations around the world.
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:52.200]  And he's always proven on so many issues, energy policy, banking policy, geopolitical operations, and breaking news and analysis that just continues to be incredibly accurate over the years.
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:34:08.200]  Dr. Jerome Corsi on short notice joins us. He also is one of the main writers and top researchers at WND.com. That's worldnetdaily.com, which we now know has been declassified, released by the Clinton Library.
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:18.200]  They tried to destroy when it was the Western Journalism Center and WND because they believed it might, quote, give the people the idea that they could have a choice in media.
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:34.200]  Well, I think that genie's out of the bottle now. Doc, I've been following your articles at WND, and I got to say, we don't have the staff to do it, but I remember a year ago, two years ago, you were on here exposing Odinga,
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:41.200]  and I went and pulled those articles back up, but you were on the show, getting all these hundreds of millions up to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  Now, I talked to Colonel Schaefer, who met with the head of Egyptian intelligence, and it was also meeting with Capitol Hill yesterday, where he and other former top experts on al-Qaeda who fought al-Qaeda.
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:35:01.200]  He headed up the anti-Al-Qaeda branch, wasn't allowed to kill, been laudan as people know, in Operation Abel Danger and Stratocive.
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:12.200]  And he said, undoubtedly, he said 95 percent. Well, he said it's classified, but it's way over 65 that another source told me 95 percent, similar source.
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:21.200]  A bunch of people, Brave Congress yesterday, he was coming out of Congress when he told me this, that they know 90 plus percent is al-Qaeda.
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:31.200]  And that this is actually the arming of al-Qaeda to overthrow Assad, basically, and that Assad's going to fight back. I don't know how Obama's going to try to spin all of this.
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:39.200]  And I don't know what the grand strategy could be. Take part of Iraq, take part of Syria, make a nice estate, Saudi Arabia's involved.
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:47.200]  I mean, this is a very dangerous game. This has got to be ten times crazier than anything I've ever seen another administration do.
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:53.200]  You're wrong in saying that because you were saying there was an Obama strategy from all your sources around the world.
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:36:02.200]  You've been to Kenya, been to Egypt, all these places, that he might be really doing a caliphate double-cross and actually trying to turn the world over to radical Islam and Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.200]  And I thought that might be too far because it was so bold.
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:19.200]  But now it really appears like he wants cover for letting this group under the name ISIS take over Africa, the Middle East, you name it, and then I guess let them attack us and take our liberties.
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  I mean, what is the grand strategy here, Dr. Jerome Corsi?
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:42.200]  Well, I think, Alex, you're on to the right track. I mean, first of all, you've got to start with the Muslim Brotherhood and the fact that Obama, through the Arab Spring, really supported the destabilization of the Middle East, toppling Gaddafi, toppling Mubarak and Egypt.
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:48.200]  And knowing, I mean, I was writing at the time that the Muslim Brotherhood would take over, which they did.
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:53.200]  And the Muslim Brotherhood, remember, the fundamental here is Sunni Shiite.
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:37:02.200]  Muslim Brotherhood is Sunni, as is Saudi Arabia and Qatar or Qatar or however you want to say it, Sunni.
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:11.200]  And Obama is backing and has backed the rebels fighting Assad, who are also Sunni.
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  And in fact, those rebels fighting Assad are really interchangeable with ISIS and they're interchangeable with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:32.200]  And that's what he said. He said, clearly, the Muslim Brotherhood is the front for al-Qaeda. They just changed their name to ISIS to confuse everybody because it's making Obama look bad to be aiding them.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:40.200]  And in fact, it's the same. The Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda, ISIS, these are all forms of the same group.
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:56.200]  And Sunni, it's going against Assad, wants to establish with the funding of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, wants to establish a caliphate, a Sunni caliphate, very much like the Ottoman Empire going back centuries.
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  This is what the goal is. And the ultimate enemy here is, first of all, Assad because he's a friend of Iran and Iran is a Shiite.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:26.200]  And this is a Shiite-Sunni battle in which Obama has been trying since the Arab Spring to have the United States side with the Saudis, with the Sunnis to defeat the Shiites that established this caliphate in Iraq and Syria,
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:32.200]  and ultimately the entire Middle East and the entire world. I mean, that's the game plan here.
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  And the lukewarm efforts to say we're going to do a little bit of bombing, which, you know, have very minimal chances of success against a group like ISIS, the way it's operating well-funded, Iraq oil money.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:39:01.200]  We've now pulled out of Iraq in a way that, again, was against the advice of George W. Bush with the inappropriate time when, essentially, there is no army in Iraq that we could arm to fight against ISIS.
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  And every military authority of any credibility or knowledge in the world understands that.
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:18.200]  Well, the intel we've got is this is just some light bombing of a few little straggling groups, a few trucks, a few cars for PR, so Obama can then give hundreds of millions, if not billions,
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  which the Republican leadership is greenlighting under Boehner today, directly to the so-called good rebels to overthrow Assad.
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  This is really taking public sentiment to take out IS or al-Qaeda or ISIL, as Obama calls it.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:40.200]  Take that support to go after these horrible people and then go ahead and use it to destabilize and overthrow Assad.
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:44.200]  The Russians are going to see through that. Assad's going to see through that.
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  What's going to happen if Assad shoots at our aircraft when they're flying over? This is really getting crazy.
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:40:01.200]  Also, let's make it really clear to everybody that we're funding ISIS through the back door. In other words, supporting the Syrian rebels against Assad is supporting ISIS.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  And this goes back to the same thing we were doing with Ambassador Stevens in Libya, when he first, even before Qaddafi was toppled, came in to Benghazi in a cargo ship
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:28.200]  and began a CIA operation of funding and providing arms to the rebels opposing Qaddafi with the same Muslim Brotherhood groups that opposed Mubarak in Egypt
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:34.200]  and are now behind ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:42.200]  And Turkey's involved in this as well because Chris Stevens, even though he died, was having meetings with one of the Turkish ambassadors.
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:52.200]  And I'm convinced, as you know, we just published a book by Aaron Klein that the entire background of the Benghazi situation was a fast and furious operation.
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:41:02.200]  The Obama administration was running in the Middle East to provide arms to this Syrian rebel army, which in effect is ISIS.
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:06.200]  And it was opposing Assad and it was opposing Iran.
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:16.200]  Well, the BBC had live feeds of them going into Tripoli and other areas when Qaddafi collapsed, waving flags and with signs in English saying Syria's next.
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:21.200]  And now they're in Syria, they said Iraq's next, and the next they say Europe and the US is next.
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:31.200]  And never forget that Obama was raised a Sunni Muslim in Indonesia. He was raised a Sunni. That's what his stepfather was.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:36.200]  So what's the real intel? Was that a deep cover CIA deal with his mom? We know she was.
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  Or is he really think he's the Grand Madi? And is there some kind of deal behind the scenes?
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:46.200]  Because I always thought that theory I've been hearing for eight years was crazy since the start of his election.
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:52.200]  But now, I mean, my gosh, if that's not what's going on, it's a triple cross then at some level.
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:56.200]  You got his cousin through him arming the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow Egypt.
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:03.200]  You've got you've got just and he he looks so emotional when he was up there talking last night about Muslims and stuff.
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  I mean, if this is true, this is the ultimate double cross.
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  Remember his brother in Kenya is, you know, was accused by the Egyptian government of managing money for the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:21.200]  And that's again ties back to the Obama family. I've said for the very wasn't it.
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  Odinga to an Odinga to me. Odinga was involved in this as well. You know, you had the entire network.
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  Remember Odinga going back to Gaddafi. These were all, you know, Sunnis.
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:46.200]  But it's it's the radical Sunnis, the Muslim Brotherhood, the ISIS, the Al-Qaeda faction that Obama has really indirectly and under the table backed.
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:50.200]  That's that's the underlying story here and that and what's the grand plan?
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:59.200]  Well, the grand plan is ultimately that Sunni Islam triumphs worldwide and defeats every other religion.
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  That's been the plan since the time of, you know, since the Prophet Muhammad died and the fight began between the Sunnis and the Shiites.
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:10.200]  Why has Israel been going along with this because they got to deal with Saudi Arabia?
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:14.200]  Well, Israel in the moment is really just surviving.
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:26.200]  It's got so many enemies and so many different fronts that for the for the moment, you know, the real enemy is Hamas and it's being funded by Iran.
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:30.200]  And again, the Muslim Brotherhood is behind Hamas.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:37.200]  So in a sense, the Sunnis and the ISIS divert some of the attention away from Israel.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:40.200]  But at the same time, these are all extremely dangerous.
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:44.200]  You know, there's no way to make a deal with any of these forces.
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:46.200]  There's no good forces here.
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:52.200]  It's just understanding the conflict, understanding that Obama sides with the radical Sunnis.
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:58.200]  Because as a, I've always said two things about Obama, his background looks like a CIA plant.
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:03.200]  And he said himself in Cairo, he's experienced Islam on three continents.
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:14.200]  Obama was raised a Sunni, was raised a radical revolutionary Sunni, which is the ideology that the United States is the, the grand devil, the imperialist nation.
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:25.200]  And Obama has had this agenda, I've said it from the very beginning, to advance the cause of radical Sunni Islam as exemplified by the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS and all of it, the al-Qaeda.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:33.200]  And we've largely pulled out now such that this bombing that we're going to do is really, you know, pointless.
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:49.200]  If we really wanted to go after ISIS, when they were running through Iraq in columns on open desert roads, ISIS could have been easily devastated with serious attacks, not just one sortie.
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:59.200]  Well, they were given the weapons up front and allowed in to regroup and then give the pretext to go bomb them in Syria in a way of defeating them, but it's really going to be Assad.
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:04.200]  How is Obama going to try to flip this around then and start bombing Assad targets?
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:10.200]  Or will they use the so-called money to the non-radical rebels that'll really go towards fighting Assad on the ground?
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:17.200]  As soon as you get an incident, as soon as we have a flyover that is attacked, remember, Obama's already tried this once.
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:22.200]  He accused Assad of using chemical weapons. This was a year ago.
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:31.200]  Obama was ramping up to attack Assad and support the Syrian rebels a year ago.
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:39.200]  And we all exposed it that in fact it was the rebels that were using the chemical weapons. It wasn't Assad. We embarrassed the Obama.
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:42.200]  And it's not that we're for Assad. We just go tell the truth.
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:50.200]  Truth. Just the truth. I mean, the truth is the United States is the origin of ISIS.
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  And, intelligibly, with the Saudis and Qatar, who we still continue to work with, both, knowing that ISIS was being funded, we armed ISIS.
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:11.200]  Not only with the weapons through Christopher Stevens and the CIA, but ISIS is operating now with all the military equipment that the United States provided, the Iraqi Army.
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:16.200]  Where do you expect this to go now? I mean, can the political establishment get away with this?
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:22.200]  I just think you're going to either have a continuing, you know, Obama's now gone out and given the speech last night.
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:26.200]  And he's told the American people he's going to, you know, go after ISIS.
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  His strategy, all it's going to take is one more beheading by ISIS.
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:38.200]  And anyone who thinks that ISIS is going to be deterred from public relations reasons doesn't understand ISIS.
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:44.200]  They want to terrorize the world. They have every intention of continuing to beheadings.
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:47.200]  They can do acts of terror if they can get away with it.
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:52.200]  They are going to do everything they can to provoke a, you know, a fighting gun.
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:58.200]  And what is Obama going to do when ISIS or ISIS sympathizers blow up a sports stadium when he had the border wide open?
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:01.200]  How are they going to get away with that? They're not.
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:08.200]  The whole strategy is Obama is rapidly losing control of the entire strategy.
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:14.200]  Just like I said, when, you know, the Arabs frame, we were bound to lose control.
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:19.200]  We did. But look at now where you've got a military government in Egypt.
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:22.200]  Obama did not back the military government.
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:30.200]  He has not come clean with the number of Muslim brotherhood that have been criminally prosecuted in Egypt.
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:36.200]  We were withdrawing our aid from Egypt at a time when Russia was moving in and supporting Egypt.
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:44.200]  We're creating a vacuum here for Russia to move in and to be much more detrimental in their activity in the Middle East.
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:58.200]  But the United States right now is operating in a confused state where Obama is asking us to back the rebels who are in fact part of ISIS.
[02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:03.200]  So we're attacking ISIS while we're supporting ISIS and that's not going to work.
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  That makes my head hurt.
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:09.200]  It does. It's very confusing. But remember, it's very simple.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:20.200]  If you go back and say Sunni versus Shiite and what we're doing is ISIS and the rebels fighting Assad are both Sunni.
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:24.200]  And again, if the Shiites were on the offensive, I would be against them.
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:28.200]  Maybe the Shiites are not on the offensive right now. It's the Sunnis.
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:31.200]  Just like it's the Sunnis on the offensive against Russia.
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:35.200]  And Russia, if it keeps getting pushed, this is what Colonel Shaper said yesterday,
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  is going to start moving in with their anti-tank aircraft and more troops into Syria.
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:45.200]  They are not going to let Assad fall and lose their only Mediterranean port.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  And none of these forces in the Middle East right now are.
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  There's no good guys in this mix because the Shiites over in Iran have completely made a fool out of John Kerry and Geneva.
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  And they are with abandon proceeding to develop nuclear weapons.
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.200]  We're doing nothing to stop them.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:09.200]  And that's happening under the radar. Well, we're all worried about.
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:13.200]  This sounds like the foreign policy the devil would come up with.
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  It certainly does.
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:23.200]  It is complete chaos. And as soon as Obama went in and toppled Gaddafi and Mubarak,
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:30.200]  he toppled two of the forces. Bad guys, though they were, they were holding stable regimes.
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:34.200]  Now that they're gone, Libya is dominated by al-Qaeda.
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.200]  It sent a message for al-Qaeda to green light taking over everything.
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:42.200]  Absolutely. And to do so under a whole variety of different names.
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:48.200]  So they're not just all calling themselves al-Qaeda anymore, but they are all operating in unison.
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:54.200]  They all got black, Wahhabist, radical Islam, Sunni flags.
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:58.200]  And now they're one upping each other on who can be the most radical.
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:00.200]  And I'm seeing a lot of young trendies.
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:04.200]  I said this first few months ago, but now your voice of America said it yesterday,
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:08.200]  that there's a cool factor in ISIS and it makes me want to throw up.
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:12.200]  It's the new uniform. It's the new cool, the black flag with the white circle.
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:14.200]  I mean, this is the new cool.
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  And so they're all-
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  It's like the new Sheikh Wavar, one of my crews said.
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:20.200]  Or it's a new baseball uniform. They're all running out.
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:22.200]  This is the uniform they all want to play under.
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:24.200]  But that'll change too.
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  I mean, once the caliphate is established, see here you've also got the destruction of Iraq and Syria as nation states.
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  That's done with.
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  There is no nation state in Iraq.
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:38.200]  There is nothing-
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:42.200]  There's just one giant Islamic state run by crazy people.
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:44.200]  And civil war going on.
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.200]  Sunni versus Shiite. All bad guys.
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  And we are supporting the bad guys in the process.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.200]  And so there's the strategy.
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:53.200]  Balkanization, deindustrialization.
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:56.200]  And then use the new Muslim threat, the radical Muslim threat,
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:50:58.200]  to take over the West with a police state.
[02:50:58.200 --> 02:50:59.200]  We'll be right back.

[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:26.200]  For me, the bigger issue here is that this is so openly evil.
[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:29.200]  This is so openly a war crime.
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:32.200]  It's one thing if you're going to have different radical elements of Islam killing each other.
[02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:34.200]  It's sad, but it goes on.
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:37.200]  It's another thing for our government to be stirring it up, giving them the weapons,
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.200]  and then acting dumb.
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:42.200]  And we're going to ride it and deal with them when it's really about going after Assad,
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  who's been fighting him for four years.
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:48.200]  It just makes me really upset.
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:50.200]  I want to get final comments from Dr. Corsi.
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:55.200]  A few other articles that just broke on infoawards.com illustrating how the police state's not to keep us safe,
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:58.200]  but to keep us under the control of the system.
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:06.200]  DHS finds Americans $5,000 for crossing the border, but not illegals.
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:08.200]  This is documented.
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  DHS will find Americans $5,000.
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:14.200]  I've seen them out there writing people tickets in parks, drinking beer.
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:18.200]  The border patrol in people, but not stopping illegals walking right by them.
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:20.200]  I mean, I've shot video of it.
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:27.200]  DHS finds Americans, but nothing for illegals.
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:30.200]  $5,000 fine for crossing the border.
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:35.200]  DHS finds Americans $5,000 for crossing the border, but not illegals.
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:36.200]  So incredible.
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  That's up on infoawards.com right now.
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:42.200]  Please don't forget this entire transmission is listener supported.
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  We sell the very best products out there.
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:48.200]  We have a new Molon Labe t-shirt out.
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:50.200]  The last one is our best seller.
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  I designed it.
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  Came up with the design, the concept.
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.200]  The new design is out.
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  And again, I developed it.
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:14.200]  It's even more powerful with an American flag on the shoulder special op style with these 300 style helmet with the two cross 50 caliber shells under it with Molon Labe above with infoawards on the back.
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:16.200]  And it's made in America.
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:20.200]  It's part of the made in 1776.com label.
[02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:28.200]  So all your purchases funder operation, whether it's the oxy powder to flush out your guts, whether it's super mill vitality or the X2 nasa 999.
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:30.200]  Well, Dr. Corsi of worldnetdaily.com.
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:34.200]  Thank you for joining us on 9 11.
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.200]  Undoubtedly, these terror groups are not run by the West.
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:44.200]  I liken it to dumping black widows in your neighbor's bed.
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:46.200]  You know, you don't command the black widows.
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:49.200]  You just put them in the way of your neighbor.
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  Undoubtedly, there will be blowback.
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:52.200]  We will get attacked.
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  And I don't see how the governing class won't end up going to prison when our borders are open and they funded this group.
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  I'm going to make sure you're going to make sure that if there is a terror attack that the people involved are brought to justice because our government is aiding and abetting.
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:08.200]  Do you agree with that?
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:09.200]  Absolutely.
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:15.200]  And also, remember the agenda here is eliminating Christians from the Middle East.
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:31.200]  Every one of these countries going from Libya across through now and do Syria and Iraq, Egypt, the war on eliminating Christians from the Middle East is one point on which the Sunnis and the Shiites agree.
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:38.200]  And that's going to continue to be headings, the killings, the wiping out of populations by ISIS.
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:40.200]  It's going to accelerate.
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:43.200]  And I don't think the bombing is going to do any good to Obama.
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:45.200]  It's going to be given a chance by the American public.
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:51.200]  But when this fails to stop ISIS, Obama's got to explain whose side he's on.
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:54.200]  That's why he's already saying it'll take years.
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:55.200]  Right.
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.200]  Well, American public doesn't have years.
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:07.200]  Not when the threat is about to cross the southern border, not about when we're on 9-11 and should be remembering how easily and vulnerable the United States is to attack.
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:18.200]  How many ISIS members fighting today in Iraq and Syria with ISIS came from the United States were recruited from here with other sympathizers still in the-
[02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:20.200]  But Obama said they're not Islamic.
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:21.200]  Right.
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:22.200]  They're not Islamic.
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:23.200]  Yeah.
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:25.200]  Well, you know, what are they supposed to be?
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:27.200]  It was a ridiculous statement.
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.200]  It's political correctness has become a total joke.
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:30.200]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:31.200]  Have a great weekend coming up, sir.
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.200]  Thank you.
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:33.200]  All right.
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:34.200]  We'll be back with a fourth hour from the new studio.
[02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:40.200]  And right after this one minute break, Colonel Shaffer highlights its bombshell, the videos on infowars.com.
[02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:41.200]  You are listening.
[02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:43.200]  Some stations don't care about this fourth hour.
[02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:59.200]  This is Scotys John for infowars.com. I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:02.200]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:04.200]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:06.200]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:09.200]  They might call you names or they just want to talk about sports.
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:14.200]  I say, so what? There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:17.200]  The ammunition is information and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:21.200]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:26.200]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[02:59:26.200 --> 02:59:27.200]  And I'm still fighting.
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:30.200]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:32.200]  The info war is worldwide.
[02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:36.200]  Tell your friends about info wars and let them know that info wars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:36.200 --> 02:59:40.200]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:47.200]  Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, and planetinfowars.com.
[02:59:47.200 --> 03:00:10.200]  The truth will set them free.
[03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:23.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:28.200]  I know you're not supposed to say, but from my sources, and I know you've got a lot higher level than I do,
[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:33.200]  you're up there at the Capitol, that they have substantive groups here in the U.S.
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:40.200]  and that this could be a way to basically blackmail Obama because Obama now knows that there's terror attacks
[03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:45.200]  and Susan Rice and others help create this current group that they're going to get the blame for it.
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:50.200]  Couldn't we have a high level blackmail already going on?
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:54.200]  I'm seeing, Alex, the same basic patterns.
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:59.200]  I saw right before 9-11 regarding our work, and you mentioned the stress I've enabled danger.
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:04.200]  I am seeing the same neglect, the same wishful thinking at the policy level where,
[03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:08.200]  you know, they may have tell us there, but they won't really do anything to hurt us.
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:10.200]  That is what we're hearing.
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:12.200]  And I think you have to believe.
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:16.200]  I don't know this for a fact, but you have to believe that there may be something like that going on
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:22.200]  because what president, what policy-making body would ever allow known adversaries to act,
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:27.200]  to walk freely within our border simply because they think that,
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:31.200]  well, if we, you know, we'll leave, you know, we'll leave us alone, we'll leave them alone.
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:35.200]  That's what, that was the naive thinking that resulted into the 9-11 attacks.
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:39.200]  And I'm telling you right now, it may not happen this 9-11, it may not happen the next 9-11,
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:43.200]  but we are, we are literally allowing the conditions to be created,
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:47.200]  which are going to allow the next 9-11, which I would predict is going to be far more severe,
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:51.200]  far more catastrophic than 9-11 attacks could have ever been.
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:55.200]  I think those of us who have studied this recognize that the vulnerability understands that the Southwest border,
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:02:00.200]  as much as kids coming across are tugging our heart, Alex, the issue is not the kids.
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:06.200]  It's about the fact that other nefarious folks, drug cartels, terrorist groups are going to use the Southwest border
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:07.200]  to get their people in here.
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:14.200]  I've been critical of Rick Perry on a lot of issues, but they've indicted him for holding back money from a drunk, crazy person
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:17.200]  while he is covertly trying to secure the border.
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:20.200]  I have to commend him and the state police.
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:23.200]  He's actually trying to secure the border and he's been indicted.
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:28.200]  I mean, it's almost like the Democrats are secretly allied with Al Qaeda or something.
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:32.200]  Well, this goes back to our conversation about the brotherhood.
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:37.200]  Let me be very clear on this, that the Muslim Brotherhood has penetrated every aspect of our governance,
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:39.200]  every aspect, Alex.
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:41.200]  They have influence in the media.
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:43.200]  They have influence on Capitol Hill.
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:45.200]  They have been able to go through a DOD.
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:50.200]  And basically, the reason we can't call Islamic radicalism, Islamic radicalism,
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:53.200]  is because they have done this Orwellian thing.
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:03:01.200]  And I am a friend of mine who told me this, that the DOD was forced to remove all references to radical Islam
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:06.200]  because of brotherhood influence over the FBI and DOD.
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:09.200]  While we've been fighting Al Qaeda in the battle for the winning,
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:14.200]  these folks have been working behind the scenes to subvert all of the governance we hold dear.
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:19.200]  And again, I hope your audience understands I'm not being overwhelmed on this.
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:20.200]  Their influence is real.
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:28.200]  And again, this is why General Al Tauhini and now President Al Faisi outlawed the brotherhood in Egypt.
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:31.200]  I know you're not supposed to get into this because you can get in trouble because of the Commander-in-Chief,
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:34.200]  but those same people were interviewed by WorldNet Daily and confirmed.
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:39.200]  Obama's cousin, Odinga, the Prime Minister down in Kenya, is making all this money
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:46.200]  and is reportedly sending hundreds of millions up there financing it, and Obama is directly involved.
[03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:49.200]  Well, I don't know that for a fact, but let me tell you this little tidbit, Alex,
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:51.200]  that I think your audience needs to understand.
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:54.200]  Just a few days before I met with Al Tauhini,
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:58.200]  the Chief of the Egyptian Intelligence, John Brennan was there.
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:00.200]  John Brennan, our Director of CIA.
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:04.200]  So one of the things that John Tauhini brought up to me is that he had brought up to John Brennan
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:07.200]  their issue with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:10.200]  And Al Tauhini, the Chief of their Intelligence, asked John Brennan directly,
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:14.200]  why don't you help us attack the Brotherhood?
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:17.200]  Why don't you outlaw the Brotherhood just like we're about to do?
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:19.200]  And by the way, they haven't done it.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:22.200]  And so Al Tauhini didn't really tell us what Brennan said.
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:24.200]  And so I asked him, I said, with all due respect, General,
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:29.200]  what did John Brennan say to you when you said that, you know, the Brotherhood's an enemy?
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:31.200]  What was his reply?
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:34.200]  He stiffened up, Alex, in his chair, looked at me sternly and said,
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:37.200]  John Brennan laughed in my face.
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:39.200]  Now, think about that.
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:42.200]  Our Director of CIA laughed at the Chief of Intelligence of Egypt
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:45.200]  because he was told that the Brotherhood is a threat.
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:46.200]  And that tells you—
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:48.200]  Well, the Brotherhood was blowing up churches,
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:53.200]  electrifying people, attacking military bases, trying to blow up the Suez Canal last year
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:55.200]  that forced the military to go after them.
[03:04:55.200 --> 03:04:59.200]  When they got power, they had a reign of terror in Egypt.
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:01.200]  That's correct. And so that's—
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:07.200]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.
[03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:08.200]  We thank you for listening.

[03:06:00.200 --> 03:06:07.200]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:09.200]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[03:06:09.200 --> 03:06:14.200]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[03:06:14.200 --> 03:06:20.200]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[03:06:20.200 --> 03:06:23.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:27.200]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:31.200]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:37.200]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:42.200]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.

[03:07:00.200 --> 03:07:03.200]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:08.200]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com and in a word the answer is protection.
[03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:12.200]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills,
[03:07:12.200 --> 03:07:17.200]  pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell and all forms of fluoride.

[03:08:24.200 --> 03:08:34.200]  Let's start it by giving people watching on television a shot of the new control room that I wanted to be basically a TV set in and of itself
[03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:40.200]  so that we can have round table discussions and meetings and special broadcasts in the control room.
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:48.200]  And that control room runs two other studios in the building because when I'm done I plan to have probably three or four TV shows a day out of here
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:54.200]  and of course my main radio show and other specialty transmissions. That's been my plan all along.
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:09:02.200]  I've been so busy over the years doing the radio show, the films, the nightly news that I've never really realized all that.
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:10.200]  I never had the capital that Glenn Beck did, but I'm glad that Glenn Beck took our new media model that even mainstream media has said was developed by us
[03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:16.200]  in the last 15, 16 years since we started doing this and been so successful with it.
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:25.200]  I do not intend to have 24-hour shows or 24-hour radio shows to actually challenge Clear Channel and Premiere and the old radio platforms itself,
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:37.200]  but I do want to have morning, noon, and night live shows, special reports, bulletins, and so much more
[03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:46.200]  so that it's not just Alex Jones here on the radio and on television giving you my unique perspective on the world,
[03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:54.200]  but that it's other Liberty lovers and other great minds, if I could say I have a great mind, other people that love Liberty,
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:10:00.200]  that's a great mind to me, that's a beautiful mind, to really be able to challenge the globalist in real time
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:08.200]  so that if there is a big terrorist attack or a new war starts or the stock market crashes or Ebola gets to the United States,
[03:10:08.200 --> 03:10:15.200]  you're already seeing the nightly news when something big happens, it won't just be taped to air 7-7-30,
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:22.200]  then they'll go live for two more hours or three more hours and then I'll drive into the studio and I'll be here
[03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:30.200]  or I'll Skype in from home or we'll Skype in where we have correspondence all over the country giving us intel, giving us information.
[03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:37.200]  That's my goal and we have really developed over the years finally a team of great dedicated people who are doing this from the ground up,
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:45.200]  we don't have big corporate consultants, we are literally reinventing the wheel because the old media complex was so incredibly corrupt
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:53.200]  and so we'll work out the bugs, work out the kinks, but I tell you so far the whole crew is just doing a bang up job
[03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:57.200]  and I'm so honored to be here and I love in the control room because I came up with this look,
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:03.200]  I noticed you've got George Washington there in the middle and you've got the Don't Tread on me in Latin
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:12.200]  and then you've also got the Spartan helmet Molan Lambe and I think that basically says what we stand for here.
[03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:23.200]  Individual strength, individual liberty, sacrifice for freedom, not backing down, embracing the true Americana ideas that have made this nation so great.
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:30.200]  In a sea of evil, America has lots of problems, has done lots of terrible things, but we've also have been exceptional in many other ways.
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:38.200]  So many other countries that call us evil and corrupt, they just do that because they're not as good at being evil and corrupt as America has been.
[03:11:38.200 --> 03:11:46.200]  Now, I'm not proud of America being good at being evil and corrupt, but what I will tell you is I want to go back to us being honorable
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:52.200]  and not that we were perfectly honorable, but known for doing what we'd say we do for being more chivalrous.
[03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:59.200]  America was kind of the rebirth of chivalry that had died in the last 500, 600 years in Europe.
[03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:06.200]  There was a strain of that and so I want to embrace the better angels of humanity as a statesman once said
[03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:09.200]  and try to strive for something better.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:21.200]  That's our goal here and this is our first, again, live transmission out of the TV studio for the radio show since we began building this facility about a year ago.
[03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:30.200]  And really, it's just a room to have guests in and to be able to break down over there on the television screen, specifics of what are happening with maps and presentations.
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:32.200]  This is just to communicate better with you.
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:46.200]  It only signifies and is a token of the larger operations that we're going to carry out and much bigger things we're going to build so that we're not just reaching 20 million people a week.
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:52.200]  As many as 5 million of those being new listeners who come through.
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:13:05.200]  We have about 15 million that are a staple that tune in at least a few times a week, but 20 plus million people on all our platforms, podcasts, YouTube, terrestrial radios, the biggest chunk over 170 AM and FM affiliates,
[03:13:05.200 --> 03:13:13.200]  global shortwave WWCR, we were censored off serious XM openly because of our political statements and what we have to say.
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:17.200]  But so was other mainline libertarians and conservatives as well.
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:26.200]  Just like you see the harassment of Breitbart by the IRS now openly, there is an attempt to shut down anything that isn't completely statist.
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:38.200]  Not that mainline Republicans are good, not that Breitbart's even perfect, but that for the system that says your children don't belong to you two plus two equals five.
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:48.200]  I think it is a threat because it believes in private property, you know, because the libertarian conservative movement is being radicalized by patriots like yours truly.
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:52.200]  Time magazine has said that twice that I'm the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[03:13:52.200 --> 03:13:53.200]  You can Google it.
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:14:00.200]  Alex Jones is the mad prophet of the Tea Party energizing and radicalizing and oh, don't radicalize yourself or you'll lose elections.
[03:14:00.200 --> 03:14:07.200]  The truth is you have to be radical to meet a radical threat to radicals that think parents aren't parents and that the state is God.
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:11.200]  For me to believe in free market and liberty, that is like space alien weird.
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:13.200]  Like I've got five heads.
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:15.200]  That's not really radical though.
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:19.200]  But to these radicals, of course, I'm like a fire breathing demon or something.
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:27.200]  Because I don't buy anything they say when Obama says that ISIS is an Islamic or there's no boots on the ground because there are boots on the ground.
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:29.200]  The AP even admits it.
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:30.200]  That's the thing.
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:34.200]  They don't even care about getting mainstream media in line with their lives anymore.
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:37.200]  It has reached a crazy level of proportions.
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:40.200]  But what do you expect?
[03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:53.200]  What do you expect to happen here in this culture and in this society when they were on TV and radio?
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:55.200]  We've played these clips here before.
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:56.200]  We'll play them again today.
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:15:00.200]  BBC CNN, they're going to blow that building up, get back, get back.
[03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:02.200]  They blow up building seven.
[03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:06.200]  Deputy emergency manager, the number two in New York, he dies weeks after he's on.
[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:07.200]  Barry Jennings.
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:12.200]  I remember you, the firefighters in person are getting death threats who heard the countdown to blow the towers up.
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:15.200]  Over the red cross was in charge of it.
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:18.200]  That's like above CIA for those that don't know.
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.200]  If you're a novice and don't know and you're laughing, go look it up.
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:25.200]  They use, the globalists have used them for 500 years at least.
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:29.200]  Literally, Red Cross, Rosa Crucians, Knights Templar, Illuminati.
[03:15:29.200 --> 03:15:31.200]  That's their front group.
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:32.200]  Red Cross was there.
[03:15:32.200 --> 03:15:35.200]  I talked to two different cops with the countdown to blow it up.
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:44.200]  This is the type of just insane stuff that is going on and unfolding in this society, the NORAD stand down.
[03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:58.200]  I want to go over some of the smoking guns of 9-11 today, but I wanted to spend a few minutes talking to you about where we're going and what we're building.
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:03.200]  Thanks to all of your support out there spreading the word about the transmission and the rest of it.
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:15.200]  Because if I was reaching a million people a week, 17 years ago, 20 years ago, I was reaching a few thousand people a week.
[03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:18.200]  And 18 years ago, I was reaching a million a week.
[03:16:18.200 --> 03:16:21.200]  And 17 years ago, I was reaching 3 million a week.
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:24.200]  You can see that we're now reaching 20 million a week.
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:34.200]  We have a responsibility to try to go to the next level and to really go for it all in the Info War, to really try to defeat the globalist.
[03:16:34.200 --> 03:16:46.200]  And I would encourage all of you out there as well to realize that in your daily life, you've got to decide you can fight back.
[03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:48.200]  You've got to decide we can win.
[03:16:48.200 --> 03:16:51.200]  You've got to decide that, yeah, we know this bad stuff is happening.
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:54.200]  That's a positive thing to be aware of what's unfolding.
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:57.200]  That gives us a shot at turning this around.
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:05.200]  You've got to realize that the alternative is total slavery and turning the world over to premeditated evil.
[03:17:05.200 --> 03:17:08.200]  The establishment is lockstep.
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:29.200]  Banner and people like Obama, when it comes to Obamacare or going after the guns or open borders or bombing Syria and an arming al-Qaeda to fight al-Qaeda, they're in lockstep.
[03:17:29.200 --> 03:17:33.200]  And that's why they're in lockstep going after the libertarian movement and the Tea Party.
[03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:39.200]  I've never been a supporter of the Tea Party except when Ron Paul kind of started it, Republicans tried to take it over.
[03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:46.200]  I became a supporter of it the last three years because the Republicans were unable to take it over.
[03:17:46.200 --> 03:17:50.200]  It was taking them over and the whole establishment lined up against it.
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:52.200]  That's when you know you need to support something.
[03:17:52.200 --> 03:17:54.200]  Whole establishment wants a border, you've got to support it.
[03:17:54.200 --> 03:17:58.200]  Whole establishment supports gun control, you've got to be against it.
[03:17:58.200 --> 03:18:02.200]  Whole establishment wants to bomb Syria a year ago, we've got to be against it.
[03:18:02.200 --> 03:18:06.200]  Now the establishment's lining up to attack al-Qaeda.
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:11.200]  They have come up with mind control scams so incredible that I want ISIS to be bombed.
[03:18:11.200 --> 03:18:16.200]  But I know that'll just be a cover story and it's a fraud, so I've got to agree with Lou Rockwell.
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:24.200]  I think it's wrong probably, even though I can get the perspective of Ron Paul saying we need to go after ISIS, but saying don't support the rebels because they are ISIS.
[03:18:24.200 --> 03:18:29.200]  He knew what Obama was going to do, showing he's a real statesman, very, very exciting.
[03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:43.200]  Now, we're going to go break, we're going to come back and I'm going to go through an article written by Paul Joseph Watson back in June of 2005, the 10 smoking guns of 9-11.
[03:18:43.200 --> 03:18:44.200]  These are still the big smoking guns.
[03:18:44.200 --> 03:18:53.200]  Then we have 20 other points that tie to this I want to get into and a bunch of video clips that have been compiled by the crew.
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:19:04.200]  With Norman Manetta, the Secretariat of Transportation saying Shanieh gave stand-down order, building seven montage, showing the different angles of it falling at freefall and being blown up.
[03:19:04.200 --> 03:19:11.200]  The 28 pages we video, we already pretty much played that, but the fact that Schaefer says he's talked to folks that have seen it.
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:17.200]  Of course Congressman Jones has seen it and wants to get it released and that it's Saudi Arabia.
[03:19:17.200 --> 03:19:20.200]  Saudi Arabia being involved in our government covering that up.
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:28.200]  The guys want to play me predicting that they use bin Laden to take the fall for attacking the World Trade Centers July 25th, 2001.
[03:19:28.200 --> 03:19:36.200]  And we will also get into Sibyl Edmunds whistleblower saying the government worked with Al Qaeda and she was listening to it.
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:40.200]  Jennings and Giuliani, Giuliani talking about bombs in the building and the towers being blown up.
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:47.200]  And BBC predicts WTC collapse seven, 30 minutes or 25 minutes before it fell and then trying to deny it.
[03:19:47.200 --> 03:19:54.200]  That's just some of the big smoking guns that tell us the official story is his fake the Santa Claus and a $3 bill.
[03:19:54.200 --> 03:20:19.200]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from themfullwars.com studio.
[03:20:19.200 --> 03:20:29.200]  Contact me to learn how radio advertising can make your business more profitable.
[03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:35.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:20:35.200 --> 03:20:41.200]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[03:21:01.200 --> 03:21:09.200]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away?

[03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:26.200]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[03:21:26.200 --> 03:21:34.200]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:40.200]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.

[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:38.200]  The problem with something like 9-11 is there's so much proof the official story isn't fraud, but what about the latest evidence that our government would work with Al-Qaeda renaming him ISIS or ISIL or whatever Obama's name to confuse the public is this week,
[03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:51.200]  that they would turn them loose to kill Christians all over the Middle East and then they would open our border up so they could attack us here. That is aiding and abetting right there. That is inside job right there. That is criminal right there.
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:25:06.200]  So open and shut. Boom. I don't ever want to hear I'm a traitor for pointing out the official story of 9-11 wasn't true or that they were going to use those attacks to take our freedoms.
[03:25:06.200 --> 03:25:16.200]  Clearly they now say Homeland Security is for returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, patriots, constitutionalists. Clearly I predicted that back at the time.
[03:25:16.200 --> 03:25:33.200]  And there's all these clips to play, but I think we should play first. A.J. predicts 9-11 back in July. This says July 21st. I think it was July 25th, 2001, in a two and a half hour access show I did,
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:48.200]  that if somebody's got the whole tape, I'll put a bounty out a thousand bucks for it. I thought I had a copy around here because over the two and a half hours, I mean, I broke down every reason how they transform our society into a police state,
[03:25:48.200 --> 03:26:02.200]  the Rand Corporation documents, the National Stabilization Force, how they would use terrorism to do all this. And we could do like a whole hour special off that two and a half hour live access show I did that Jimmy Vaughn saw live.
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:13.200]  And then he saw it when it reared later. Everybody got real mad at me because it aired on 9-11 a few months later that night when I was saying they'll attack the World Trade Center and the government did it.
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:25.200]  I'd said it two months before and then I could never find the tape of it again. Somebody again found it and put it on YouTube, a short clip, but this isn't even the really meaty stuff.
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:33.200]  AJ predicts 9-11 from Access TV back in July of 2001. Here it is.
[03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:44.200]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I'm so glad that you could join us today for this Wednesday, July 25th, 2001 broadcast.
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:57.200]  Tyranny is enveloping the globe and the United States is shining jewel the globalists want to bring down and they will use terrorism as the pretext to get it done.
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:27:16.200]  I'm going to put the call out that you call the White House and tell them, look, we've seen the news stories that you've wanted to blow things up, that you have blown things up and that you're saying that four million of us are going to die and we need martial law and the Associated Press, one of your little drills you had,
[03:27:16.200 --> 03:27:23.200]  and that we're aware of who the terrorists are if you pull this. This can stop the hitlerian Reichstag event.
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:32.200]  I want to put the toll free number up for Congress and I won't want you to believe Alex Jones. I want you to go get these news stories off my website.
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:46.200]  I want you to call these major newspapers. I want you to find out these statements were true by the White House about preparing for martial law and I want you to let them know that if there is any terrorism, we know who to blame.
[03:27:46.200 --> 03:28:01.200]  The point is, if any terrorism comes, it's from this government. And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen war, whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now,
[03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:08.200]  as this is the board of Iridium satellite, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[03:28:08.200 --> 03:28:16.200]  I want the White House numbers up there now. A big part of this solution, after you research all the government terrorism and check out what I'm saying is true,
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:23.200]  call the White House and tell them we know the government's planning terrorism. We know Oklahoma City and World Trade Center was terrorism.
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:30.200]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun. If you do it, we're going to blame you because we know who's up to it.
[03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:40.200]  Or if you let some terrorist group drew it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame. And you could save the planet. I'm calling an operation expose the government terrorism.
[03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:53.200]  From the archive, I had more hair than it was a little bit skinnier. I get sick of looking at myself all day, but it's part of the job here.
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:29:01.200]  So there you have it from way back in 2001. Here we are 13 years and two months later.
[03:29:01.200 --> 03:29:08.200]  And I'm yet again saying they're clearly going to let Al Qaeda attack us under the name ISIS or they'll do it.
[03:29:08.200 --> 03:29:20.200]  The criminal elements are on our government and use that to launch a bunch of new wars and have no bid weapons contracts and sell the idea of spying on us and violating our rights.
[03:29:20.200 --> 03:29:26.200]  This is how they take over. And I know you know that as a regular listener. Many of you knew it before I was born.
[03:29:26.200 --> 03:29:32.200]  You know how the world worked. How do we get this information out to everybody else so that we don't keep reliving this?
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:41.200]  I mean, this is ridiculous. I predicted last year that they would end up saying we had to go into Syria to stop Al Qaeda there, where they were openly arming.
[03:29:41.200 --> 03:29:46.200]  And now they're doing it. I mean, it's so predictable, but it's also so over the top.
[03:29:46.200 --> 03:29:50.200]  We'll talk to our reporters in New York, coming up, and more stuff.
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:30:16.200]  I don't know what it is. Ralph just won't pay any attention to me when he comes home from work.
[03:30:16.200 --> 03:30:24.200]  We'll talk to our reporters in New York, coming up, and more stuff.
[03:30:46.200 --> 03:31:08.200]  A few of the IRS back taxes. Listen carefully. Sweeping changes to IRS policies will help more people than ever eliminate their tax debts once and for all.

[03:33:02.200 --> 03:33:08.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.200 --> 03:33:14.200]  Come and hear you from the George Washington studios.
[03:33:14.200 --> 03:33:21.200]  Only TV viewers know what I'm talking about. Don't tread on me. Gotta love it.
[03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:35.200]  Don't tread on me. Living to your doubt, what we so proudly hail, once you provoke her, rattling over tail.
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:42.200]  That's what's happening. America was in a trance in 1913 when the private banks took over the offshore banks.
[03:33:42.200 --> 03:33:49.200]  They slowly got the nation into debt. They created Hitler and the communists, so they would have an outside threat to turn us into a police state
[03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:59.200]  and allow those other empires to go around robbing and stealing so they could have culpable, non-culpable deniability, plausible denial.
[03:33:59.200 --> 03:34:08.200]  And then now they're here opportunistically funding a giant global hardcore jihad against Christians in any stable sovereign secular government.
[03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:13.200]  To overthrow, they'll use that jihad threat to then take all Western freedoms as well.
[03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:22.200]  But once you provoke the people of this republic and Liberty Lever is not just here but worldwide, it is the beginning of the end of the tyranny.
[03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:33.200]  Once the genie's out of the bottle, once people know the manipulation and the full spectrum dominance program that the crime syndicate worldwide is using, it's game over.
[03:34:33.200 --> 03:34:36.200]  And that's now the point we've gotten to.
[03:34:36.200 --> 03:34:47.200]  One reason I also like the new studio setup is that more and more we got good mics in there with the crew and we are going to be able to then just, hey,
[03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:50.200]  I want to hear what Jakari Jackson thinks about what's going on.
[03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:56.200]  And then we can literally just talk to Jakari in there and have like a discussion like we're here together.
[03:34:56.200 --> 03:35:03.200]  But I didn't tell you guys I was going to do this. Is he piped through? Is I going to talk to him on air?
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:08.200]  Okay, well, that's the plan. Absolutely. We'll pipe him through. Yeah, sure.
[03:35:08.200 --> 03:35:13.200]  But just down the road, then I will be able to sit back and talk to everybody that's in there.
[03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:18.200]  We'll be able to pan over and talk to Rob Do. Also known as Deucifer.
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:20.200]  Let's go ahead and pan over to him for TV viewers.
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:22.200]  Dun, dun, dun.
[03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:27.200]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen with Marcos Morales.
[03:35:27.200 --> 03:35:29.200]  There you go. All right.
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:33.200]  See, we got a few crew members around here that got names that are so cool sounding.
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:37.200]  I just walk around saying I'm like, Jakari Jackson, Marcos Morales.
[03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:41.200]  Who else in my stands got really cool sounding name?
[03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:46.200]  I mean, Max Kaiser's got one, but he didn't work with us. Max Kaiser.
[03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:50.200]  We can have a vote with the listeners, like not what your favorite color is or fantasy football,
[03:35:50.200 --> 03:35:55.200]  but who has a cooler name? Buckley Hammond.
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:36:00.200]  That's definitely unusual name or Jakari. You got to see Buckley Hammond.
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:05.200]  Jakari Jackson, Marcos Morales.
[03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:12.200]  Can I have the vote on Info Wars or Deucifer?
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:15.200]  That is the giant hippie.
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:21.200]  Anyways, the whole point is we're just, all right, I always get dingy by the third hour already.
[03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:25.200]  And I've been up since 6am and I'm feeling good. I am a little bit goofy here.
[03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:28.200]  So let me get serious back to the hardcore subject.
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:31.200]  I'm going to get to some more of the smoking guns as a video clips here in a moment building seven.
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:35.200]  But first off, who do we have? Joe Biggs or Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:36:35.200 --> 03:36:37.200]  They're on the ground in New York.
[03:36:37.200 --> 03:36:41.200]  We're going to talk to him for about five minutes and then Leigh Ann McAdoo to see what's happened
[03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:43.200]  since I talked to him two hours ago.
[03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:45.200]  This is a great thing. We're here broadcasting worldwide.
[03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:55.200]  AMFM, internet, video streams, podcasts. They're in New York just all together bringing you the cutting edge of a true analysis here.
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:36:59.200]  Let's go to Joe Biggs. Joe, you've been sitting there for 10 minutes since I've been ranting.
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:03.200]  What do you think for you waking up to 9-11 Truth? When did that begin to happen?
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:07.200]  And 9-11 Truth, folks, is just not buying the official ridiculous lie.
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:12.200]  Like Obama saying ISIS isn't Islamic. Well, there's no boots on the ground.
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:16.200]  It just means, listen, I don't believe everything you're telling me. There's more to this.
[03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:19.200]  What was your 9-11 Truth moment or was it a process?
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:23.200]  And what do you think the big smoking gun of 9-11 is, Joe Biggs?
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:28.200]  Well, first off, I'd like to throw my name in the hat for the coolest name, Alex, as Joe Biggs.
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:33.200]  Then for the waking up part, that happened my first year in Iraq.
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:42.200]  I was actually trying to buy a Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie so I could sit down in my little hooch and relax and watch it.
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:45.200]  And what it was was a documentary about 9-11.
[03:37:45.200 --> 03:37:53.200]  And instead of watching Jean-Claude Van Damme, I watched this documentary on the facts, the smoking guns, things that happened.
[03:37:53.200 --> 03:38:05.200]  And I began to reevaluate myself and my stance and questioning whether or not my being in the military and being deployed was for the right reasons.
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:12.200]  Because, like I said before, I joined because of the attacks at 9-11 here in New York City where we're at right now.
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:15.200]  We're at the bottom of the new Trade Center.
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:18.200]  So that was a defining moment for me.
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:22.200]  Like I said, it felt like I was betrayed by someone I loved very much, which is my country.
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:26.200]  I still do love my country and I'm going to stand up and fight for it as much as I can.
[03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:31.200]  But I am pissed off at the government and, you know, this entire cover-up.
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:33.200]  I don't like it whatsoever, you know.
[03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:36.200]  So that documentary woke me up.
[03:38:36.200 --> 03:38:40.200]  I began sharing with my friends and now I am where I am today.
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:46.200]  I can't tell you, Joe, how many of our listeners over the years came to us via documentary films.
[03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:48.200]  That's why Rob Jacobson is always harping.
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:50.200]  We got to make films again, we got to make films again.
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:53.200]  We make films every day. We make many documentaries.
[03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:58.200]  But it is true that I kind of want to make films that are so powerful and I produce loose change as well.
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:01.200]  And I'm in zeitgeist even though they didn't ask for my permission.
[03:39:01.200 --> 03:39:03.200]  And the first one that was a big hit.
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:08.200]  But the point I'm getting at is the power of film really is revolutionary.
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:11.200]  And I want to encourage the viewers out there.
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:14.200]  You're just as smart as we are, probably smarter in some ways.
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:16.200]  Where are you doing a podcast?
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:18.200]  Where are you making films?
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:21.200]  Where are you taking action?
[03:39:21.200 --> 03:39:35.200]  Together, culturally, if we promote liberty and if we shop, you know, thinking about where the money is going and support local and support liberty based media, we will supplant the whole system.
[03:39:35.200 --> 03:39:39.200]  I think 13 years after 9-11, things are so clear.
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:47.200]  People don't get mad at you now if you're a quote 9-11 truth or because they've been lied to so much they get questioning even if they believe the official story, Joe.
[03:39:47.200 --> 03:39:55.200]  Yeah, today, I mean, right behind me, there's been quite a large group of people passing out pamphlets, things like that saying, hey, do you really know what happened?
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:01.200]  You know, some people say, you know, screw you basically and walk by and they don't want to hear anything.
[03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:05.200]  You know, I've actually had one person came up and started cussing at me earlier.
[03:40:05.200 --> 03:40:07.200]  But you know, that's just how it happens.
[03:40:07.200 --> 03:40:09.200]  I told him that he could take his purse and move on.
[03:40:09.200 --> 03:40:13.200]  But you know, there's a lot of people out here that are smart that know what happened.
[03:40:13.200 --> 03:40:20.200]  They're awake and you know, from what I've seen 10 years ago until now, you have a lot more people that are well informed.
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:22.200]  And yes, film is very powerful.
[03:40:22.200 --> 03:40:27.200]  Those documentaries, like I said, changed my life and I know a lot of my other friends' lives as well.
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:33.200]  So that is a very important tool to help get out that information.
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:35.200]  What do you think the biggest smoking gun is?
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:37.200]  For me, it's building seven because...
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:38.200]  Oh yeah, of course.
[03:40:38.200 --> 03:40:39.200]  I mean, that without a doubt right there.
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:41.200]  I mean, that's the seller right there.
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:46.200]  I mean, I mean, that's where I'm standing at right now, the base of right behind Josh.
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:49.200]  If you want to see, this is the new building seven.
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:53.200]  Oh yeah.
[03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:56.200]  So earlier today, it was pretty interesting when we first got out here.
[03:40:56.200 --> 03:41:00.200]  I actually had a uniformed police officer who didn't want to be on film.
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:01.200]  So I respected him.
[03:41:01.200 --> 03:41:03.200]  He's about to retire in two months, he said.
[03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:07.200]  But he came up and he said he was one of the first responders on 9-11.
[03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:13.200]  And he said he saw an explosion come out and shoot debris out the bottom out of the second tower before it ever collapsed.
[03:41:13.200 --> 03:41:17.200]  So he came over and he's like, I don't know if you know this or you've heard stuff.
[03:41:17.200 --> 03:41:18.200]  I was like, I've heard about explosions.
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:20.200]  He's like, yeah, he's like, I just want to confirm with you.
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:24.200]  He's like, if I wasn't, you know, if I was already retired, I would have no problem going on camera.
[03:41:24.200 --> 03:41:28.200]  He's like, I just can't, I can't have gone this far and then throw everything away.
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:32.200]  So, you know, there's people out here that know what really happened.
[03:41:32.200 --> 03:41:37.200]  You have first responders that are passionate about trying to get this information out,
[03:41:37.200 --> 03:41:40.200]  and they're not going to sleep knowing that people are trying to cover it up.
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:54.200]  Okay, so, yeah, like I said, we're at right now, we're right outside of the new One World Center,
[03:41:54.200 --> 03:41:56.200]  which is right over here to the right.
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:41:58.200]  Josh is going to pan over and show you.
[03:41:58.200 --> 03:42:03.200]  This is the brand new building, it's still under construction for the most part,
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:08.200]  down around the ground levels, they're still doing some exterior work.
[03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:14.200]  But the police have completely blocked off any chances of getting near the memorial area today
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:18.200]  until 6 p.m. This whole area has just been locked down.
[03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:21.200]  Military has had a presence out here as well.
[03:42:21.200 --> 03:42:25.200]  You'll see Army and Air Force paired together.
[03:42:25.200 --> 03:42:28.200]  You'll see one soldier, one airman walking around.
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:33.200]  So, that's been pretty crazy.
[03:42:33.200 --> 03:42:37.200]  There's a man over here, he has retired Special Forces,
[03:42:37.200 --> 03:42:40.200]  and he's standing in front of the Deopresta Libre,
[03:42:40.200 --> 03:42:43.200]  which means to liberate the oppressed.
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:48.200]  They have a monument for basically the first Special Forces responders
[03:42:48.200 --> 03:42:52.200]  who went into Afghanistan to go after the Taliban after the attacks.
[03:42:52.200 --> 03:42:56.200]  So, there's a memorial for that, he stands over there and he's been speaking to people
[03:42:56.200 --> 03:42:58.200]  about the missions and things like that.
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:00.200]  And I asked him, I said, do you feel betrayed at all?
[03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:05.200]  Do you feel like I feel that I have been lied to and betrayed by my country
[03:43:05.200 --> 03:43:12.200]  and that, you know, in essence all the lives we lost were for the global elites to make more money?
[03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:17.200]  I mean, Feinstein made so much money off of this incident that it's just mind-blowing.
[03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:21.200]  You know, what was it? Billions of dollars, probably.
[03:43:21.200 --> 03:43:23.200]  The husband, you know.
[03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:26.200]  The insurance, I mean, it's just mind-blowing.
[03:43:26.200 --> 03:43:32.200]  Larry Silverstein had double insurance on it, only got it two months before it happened,
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:35.200]  and we just have so much evidence.
[03:43:35.200 --> 03:43:38.200]  Joe, we're going to come back to you guys in just a moment
[03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:40.200]  and get Leanne McAdoo's top smoking gun.
[03:43:40.200 --> 03:43:43.200]  Thank you so much, Joe, and you've got a lot more coming up tonight.
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:45.200]  You guys have done a fantastic job.
[03:43:45.200 --> 03:43:48.200]  And for myself, the whole crew and the viewers, thank you for your dedication,
[03:43:48.200 --> 03:43:53.200]  because, hey, I don't see it as bad that you went and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:43:53.200 --> 03:43:56.200]  You meant well, even though you were manipulated into it.
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:43:59.200]  It takes even more courage to admit you were scammed.
[03:43:59.200 --> 03:44:01.200]  We've all been scammed at one time or another.
[03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:06.200]  What matters is admitting we were wrong later and then now truly fighting for the Republic,
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:11.200]  really fighting for the truth, and now it's not you getting a DVD that, you know,
[03:44:11.200 --> 03:44:17.200]  somebody was selling in Iraq, just like in the movie Hurt Locker with little kids selling them.
[03:44:17.200 --> 03:44:21.200]  You are now reaching out to the people in the Info War,
[03:44:21.200 --> 03:44:27.200]  and it all started with you going out and saying, hey, Joe, you know, Joe Biggs here,
[03:44:27.200 --> 03:44:38.200]  my friend who was, you know, clearly killed Michael Hastings for speaking out and telling the truth,
[03:44:38.200 --> 03:44:40.200]  he was set up, Homeland Security was coming after him.
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:43.200]  Everybody else in his family, friends, they all knew that.
[03:44:43.200 --> 03:44:45.200]  They knew Homeland Security had gone to his house,
[03:44:45.200 --> 03:44:47.200]  but they were all so scared they shut up.
[03:44:47.200 --> 03:44:51.200]  You were willing to come out when there were threats flying and talk to us and talk to Fox News.
[03:44:51.200 --> 03:44:54.200]  I said, that's the kind of guy I want to be a reporter.
[03:44:54.200 --> 03:44:57.200]  And here you are doing a great job now. People love what you're doing.
[03:44:57.200 --> 03:45:03.200]  And it's all about people that don't think of themselves as journalists or as Info Warriors doing it
[03:45:03.200 --> 03:45:05.200]  because you don't have a choice.
[03:45:05.200 --> 03:45:09.200]  And it's going to be the rank and file people like you and others getting involved,
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:12.200]  engaging, that will bring down the New World Order.
[03:45:12.200 --> 03:45:16.200]  So thank you so much, Joe. We'll go talk to Leigh Ann McAdoo here in just a moment.
[03:45:16.200 --> 03:45:17.200]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:45:17.200 --> 03:45:18.200]  Thank you.
[03:45:18.200 --> 03:45:20.200]  So excited to be working with Joe Biggs.
[03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:23.200]  And again, we're here in the new studio working out the bugs.
[03:45:23.200 --> 03:45:25.200]  Haven't seen hardly any bugs today.
[03:45:25.200 --> 03:45:27.200]  I was expecting a whole bunch of train wreck stuff.
[03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:29.200]  In fact, was it been better for ratings?
[03:45:29.200 --> 03:45:34.200]  We'd have a light fall on my head or something like Hillary Clinton on 60 Minutes.
[03:45:34.200 --> 03:45:38.200]  Though there was an extra light panel on, which was even cooler,
[03:45:38.200 --> 03:45:43.200]  made me look like one of those giant Martian eggheads because I already kind of look like that.
[03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:47.200]  If people didn't realize my dad's a dentist and he thinks it's interesting,
[03:45:47.200 --> 03:45:49.200]  I talked to a neurosurgeon once, it's true.
[03:45:49.200 --> 03:45:52.200]  I have an incredibly wide jaw like a pit bull.
[03:45:52.200 --> 03:45:54.200]  So it's not that I even have a weak chin.
[03:45:54.200 --> 03:45:58.200]  It's that this part of the cranium is very big and this is wide as well.
[03:45:58.200 --> 03:46:00.200]  So I'm kind of a freak, folks.
[03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:02.200]  Maybe I'm a genetic mutation, huh?
[03:46:02.200 --> 03:46:03.200]  I mean, look at that.
[03:46:03.200 --> 03:46:05.200]  I mean, look at the size of that head on those shoulders.
[03:46:05.200 --> 03:46:09.200]  Look at the size of that head has its own weather systems.
[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:10.200]  Who's the guy that?
[03:46:10.200 --> 03:46:11.200]  All right, that's enough.
[03:46:11.200 --> 03:46:12.200]  That's enough guys.
[03:46:12.200 --> 03:46:13.200]  It's even blurred.
[03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:15.200]  I need to quit screwing around here.
[03:46:15.200 --> 03:46:16.200]  Sorry.
[03:46:16.200 --> 03:46:19.200]  Like I start screwing around and then I tell them to stop screwing around.
[03:46:19.200 --> 03:46:23.200]  Who's the guy that does the secret agent comedy movies?
[03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:25.200]  And he's fat bastard on it as well.
[03:46:25.200 --> 03:46:27.200]  He plays himself.
[03:46:27.200 --> 03:46:28.200]  Awesome powers.
[03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:30.200]  But what's the name of the actor?
[03:46:30.200 --> 03:46:31.200]  Mike Myers.
[03:46:31.200 --> 03:46:32.200]  Yeah.
[03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:38.200]  He did some funnier movies where he's sitting there talking about his kids head and look
[03:46:38.200 --> 03:46:39.200]  at the size of that.
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:41.200]  He has its own weather systems.
[03:46:41.200 --> 03:46:45.200]  So that's all part of our Scottish Scottish independence this week.
[03:46:45.200 --> 03:46:49.200]  We have Scottish John who's been out picketing and promoting the second amendment for 10
[03:46:49.200 --> 03:46:51.200]  years that I've known him here in Austin.
[03:46:51.200 --> 03:46:53.200]  And he's a Scott at the thick Scott accent.
[03:46:53.200 --> 03:47:01.200]  He's going to be in studio with us tomorrow to talk about the Scottish independence vote
[03:47:01.200 --> 03:47:06.200]  that is coming up and more teleprompter free radio and television right now.
[03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:11.200]  Let's take you live to Klandathu where our forces have just engaged the main bug fleet
[03:47:11.200 --> 03:47:12.200]  on their home world.
[03:47:12.200 --> 03:47:13.200]  Excuse me.
[03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:15.200]  That's Starship Troopers.
[03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:21.200]  I take you now live to New York City on the edge of the barricades to keep the slaves
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:22.200]  away.
[03:47:22.200 --> 03:47:24.200]  Hence any of our ideas get out.
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:26.200]  I think I see a tourney response team shirt over there.
[03:47:26.200 --> 03:47:27.200]  That might be a listener.
[03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:34.200]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, what is your take 13 years later there at ground zero?
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:35.200]  Hi Alex.
[03:47:35.200 --> 03:47:36.200]  Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:47:36.200 --> 03:47:42.200]  I am very happy to be here and I am standing outside one of what I think is one of the
[03:47:42.200 --> 03:47:44.200]  smoking guns of 9-11.
[03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:48.200]  The brand new and improved World Trade Center building number seven.
[03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:54.200]  It's right behind us and I think there's a consensus around here that anyone just look
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:55.200]  at the physics.
[03:47:55.200 --> 03:48:00.200]  They keep saying two planes, three buildings, do the math.
[03:48:00.200 --> 03:48:02.200]  That's a huge smoking gun.
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:04.200]  Larry Silverstein profited.
[03:48:04.200 --> 03:48:09.200]  He got more than double what he owed on the building back in blood money and insurance
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:10.200]  money.
[03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:11.200]  So quite the pay out there.
[03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:16.200]  But if I had to say another smoking gun, I'm sorry, but it's the invisible plane that hit
[03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:17.200]  the Pentagon.
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:19.200]  I mean I've looked at the pictures.
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:21.200]  Why are you being racist?
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:25.200]  Yeah, you know, I like to educate myself.
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:28.200]  I know a lot of people would prefer to just, you know, watch the game and that was something
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:29.200]  we noticed.
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:32.200]  We were talking about that last night at dinner before the president came on to speak.
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:36.200]  Just how much patriotism has been lost in this country.
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:42.200]  There was a time when people, even if they were at a bar out to dinner or hanging out,
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:45.200]  if they knew the president was coming on to speak about something like what he was talking
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:49.200]  about last night, basically bringing us into a new war with Syria that's going to extend
[03:48:49.200 --> 03:48:50.200]  beyond his presidency.
[03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:54.200]  People would have stopped to pay attention, but nobody even cared.
[03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:58.200]  And in fact, they were pretty upset that we asked them to change the channel so that we
[03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:00.200]  could listen to what the president had to say.
[03:49:00.200 --> 03:49:01.200]  We become a total joke.
[03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:03.200]  Our country has become a joke.
[03:49:03.200 --> 03:49:04.200]  The presidency has become a joke.
[03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:08.200]  And we're not bashing, because I know you personally, your view on this.
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:09.200]  Am I putting words in your mouth?
[03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:10.200]  Am I wrong?
[03:49:10.200 --> 03:49:11.200]  It's not that we like bashing America.
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:13.200]  There's still a lot of great people here.
[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:16.200]  It's that you've just got so many entitled.
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:17.200]  Here's an example.
[03:49:17.200 --> 03:49:21.200]  I went to a local community pool with my children yesterday.
[03:49:21.200 --> 03:49:25.200]  And there were some yuppies in the shallow end, two lovebirds kissing.
[03:49:25.200 --> 03:49:28.200]  Look, they were both about 25 college students.
[03:49:28.200 --> 03:49:33.200]  And my daughters were splashing and racing and a little bit of water, a little bit, because
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:34.200]  I happened to be watching them.
[03:49:34.200 --> 03:49:38.200]  I was sitting down on the side, drying off, happened to hit the lady in the face.
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:40.200]  And she was like, oh, oh, what are you?
[03:49:40.200 --> 03:49:41.200]  Oh, I mean, what?
[03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:46.200]  And they got, and all these so-called yuppies get so mad by families with kids, like they're
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:49.200]  revolted by it or something.
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:51.200]  And it's this entitlement.
[03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:52.200]  It's this decadence.
[03:49:52.200 --> 03:49:58.200]  It's this, I don't want to know, want to play fantasy football that the system is banking
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:49:59.200]  on.
[03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:00.200]  It's scary.
[03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:01.200]  Go ahead.
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:02.200]  Sorry.
[03:50:02.200 --> 03:50:03.200]  Right.
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:04.200]  Well, and that's how they know it's going to be so easy to control this narrative.
[03:50:04.200 --> 03:50:09.200]  And the kids that are, you know, just tomorrow, they're going to be teenagers for the first
[03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:13.200]  time, first time teenagers that didn't actually experience 9-11.
[03:50:13.200 --> 03:50:14.200]  They weren't alive.
[03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:19.200]  So they're counting on to just continue regurgitating this, their narrative of how things happened
[03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:25.200]  and hoping that the rest of the people who were there, who could see with their own eyes,
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:27.200]  will just buy their story.
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:28.200]  They're just hoping.
[03:50:28.200 --> 03:50:32.200]  But that's the problem is that a lot of those kids are, you know, they're the internet generation.
[03:50:32.200 --> 03:50:34.200]  So let's go over these pictures.
[03:50:34.200 --> 03:50:35.200]  Hold on.
[03:50:35.200 --> 03:50:38.200]  We're going to skip this network break so we can have time to get into some of the smoking
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:39.200]  guns.
[03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:41.200]  But Leigh Ann, I'm going to come back to you in a moment.
[03:50:41.200 --> 03:50:45.200]  We're cut to the studio shot right now of Nico and Buckley.
[03:50:45.200 --> 03:50:49.200]  But Buckley looks like a Russian gangster sitting there.
[03:50:49.200 --> 03:50:53.200]  And so people are always trying to claim that we work for Putin, the Vatican, Israel or
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:54.200]  something.
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:56.200]  I want to say it's all true, folks.
[03:50:56.200 --> 03:50:57.200]  There is Buckley.
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:51:02.200]  His real name is Vladimir Bogolnum Skagasov.
[03:51:02.200 --> 03:51:06.200]  And he also called him the wolf.
[03:51:06.200 --> 03:51:12.200]  And his top henchman beside the Nico and deal with you.
[03:51:12.200 --> 03:51:14.200]  Jiu Jitsu master.
[03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:19.200]  He grew up east in Russia.
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:20.200]  I shouldn't even joke around.
[03:51:20.200 --> 03:51:22.200]  It'll be a whole new conspiracy theory.
[03:51:22.200 --> 03:51:26.200]  Actually, folks, Nico is Bill Hicks.
[03:51:26.200 --> 03:51:29.200]  It's true.
[03:51:29.200 --> 03:51:33.200]  I'm sorry.
[03:51:33.200 --> 03:51:35.200]  It's supposed to be a serious fourth hour.
[03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:38.200]  Everybody knows that that's probably not a good idea.
[03:51:38.200 --> 03:51:40.200]  That's why I quit doing the fourth hour.
[03:51:40.200 --> 03:51:43.200]  Because I'm just after three hours being so serious I can't handle it anymore.
[03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:45.200]  It is incredibly serious.
[03:51:45.200 --> 03:51:50.200]  Leigh Ann, they could stage a new 9-11 and blame it on ISIS or let ISIS in to do it.
[03:51:50.200 --> 03:51:54.200]  And they're so arrogant and then the TV heads don't seem to care.
[03:51:54.200 --> 03:51:56.200]  And we see all the preparations for it.
[03:51:56.200 --> 03:51:59.200]  I see them getting ready for a nuclear 9-11.
[03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:04.200]  And Obama says the number one threat he sees is a mushroom cloud in New York.
[03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:09.200]  So that's what my gut tells me is something really huge is on the horizon.
[03:52:09.200 --> 03:52:14.200]  And that we're seeing as such chumps by the globalist that they're going to pull something big.
[03:52:14.200 --> 03:52:15.200]  What do you think?
[03:52:15.200 --> 03:52:17.200]  Well, and that's exactly right.
[03:52:17.200 --> 03:52:19.200]  He says that's his biggest fear.
[03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:23.200]  And then they go around poking the nuclear bear trying to provoke Putin.
[03:52:23.200 --> 03:52:26.200]  And one of the only countries that is basically saying,
[03:52:26.200 --> 03:52:29.200]  yay, we've got nukes and we're going to use them if you make us.
[03:52:29.200 --> 03:52:31.200]  But I mean, why be closed-minded?
[03:52:31.200 --> 03:52:34.200]  I mean, they're trying to promote, you know, all sorts of stuff now.
[03:52:34.200 --> 03:52:37.200]  So what's wrong with poking the bear?
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:42.200]  Hey, apparently as long as he's got nukes, that's that's what the kids want to do these days.
[03:52:42.200 --> 03:52:45.200]  I don't want to give them any ideas now.
[03:52:45.200 --> 03:52:47.200]  That'll be a whole new term out there.
[03:52:47.200 --> 03:52:51.200]  I guess nuclear war will be like a new fetish, you know, where you destroy.
[03:52:51.200 --> 03:52:53.200]  I guess nihilists are kind of into that.
[03:52:53.200 --> 03:52:54.200]  What do you think Leigh Ann?
[03:52:54.200 --> 03:52:59.200]  Well, I mean, they clearly bathe in the blood of all these deaths
[03:52:59.200 --> 03:53:01.200]  that they've committed.
[03:53:01.200 --> 03:53:02.200]  They revel in it.
[03:53:02.200 --> 03:53:03.200]  They celebrate it.
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:05.200]  So why not just see?
[03:53:05.200 --> 03:53:06.200]  Why are you being closed-minded?
[03:53:06.200 --> 03:53:08.200]  I mean, you haven't tried bathing in blood.
[03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:09.200]  You're right.
[03:53:09.200 --> 03:53:11.200]  You know, maybe it's magnificent.
[03:53:11.200 --> 03:53:12.200]  Who knows?
[03:53:12.200 --> 03:53:14.200]  There's actually a fountain over here with a big,
[03:53:14.200 --> 03:53:18.200]  looks like kind of blood platelets here in Larry Silverstein's fountain
[03:53:18.200 --> 03:53:20.200]  to commemorate those who survived.
[03:53:20.200 --> 03:53:22.200]  He probably comes out at midnight like Nosferatu.
[03:53:22.200 --> 03:53:24.200]  And actually we pull up Nosferatu.
[03:53:24.200 --> 03:53:29.200]  Because Larry Silverstein starred in the 1927 original Nosferatu.
[03:53:29.200 --> 03:53:32.200]  We've actually got a shot of him right after he filed the insurance policy
[03:53:32.200 --> 03:53:37.200]  on 9-11 a few months before he went out and had a celebratory snack.
[03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:39.200]  Let's see if we can put Nosferatu behind me.
[03:53:39.200 --> 03:53:40.200]  There you go.
[03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:43.200]  We can actually get a video clip of Larry Silverstein.
[03:53:46.200 --> 03:53:47.200]  Pardon me.
[03:53:47.200 --> 03:53:48.200]  Had some.
[03:53:48.200 --> 03:53:54.200]  So what I'm curious too is like, you see the people celebrating,
[03:53:54.200 --> 03:53:57.200]  when they actually see all the rioting and things going on in Ferguson,
[03:53:57.200 --> 03:54:00.200]  you saw how that affected people around the world.
[03:54:00.200 --> 03:54:01.200]  People were saying,
[03:54:01.200 --> 03:54:03.200]  yay, the Americans are finally waking up.
[03:54:03.200 --> 03:54:04.200]  They're finally fighting back.
[03:54:04.200 --> 03:54:06.200]  They finally realized that they're living in a police state.
[03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:08.200]  And they're rooting for us.
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:11.200]  They're rooting for the American people to wake up and to realize
[03:54:11.200 --> 03:54:14.200]  that we are, our government is occupied.
[03:54:14.200 --> 03:54:15.200]  Exactly.
[03:54:15.200 --> 03:54:20.200]  But again, it's fine to start with going out and demonstrating for the First Amendment.
[03:54:20.200 --> 03:54:23.200]  But we need to go out and talk to the cops when they're not in riot gear
[03:54:23.200 --> 03:54:24.200]  to wake them up to what's happening.
[03:54:24.200 --> 03:54:29.200]  Just like that police officer came over to Biggs earlier and said he's awake.
[03:54:29.200 --> 03:54:31.200]  The only reason I'm saying let's make friends with the police
[03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:33.200]  is because compared to the general public,
[03:54:33.200 --> 03:54:37.200]  I'm actually able to wake police up or they're already awake.
[03:54:37.200 --> 03:54:39.200]  Because they're in the system.
[03:54:39.200 --> 03:54:41.200]  They know something's wrong, most of them.
[03:54:41.200 --> 03:54:43.200]  Most of them aren't just bullies for no reason.
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:46.200]  They're all under peer pressure and compartmentalized.
[03:54:46.200 --> 03:54:51.200]  From doing this 20 years, I've just discovered the military is just so awake.
[03:54:51.200 --> 03:54:55.200]  And then the police are the second best group in my experience.
[03:54:55.200 --> 03:54:57.200]  That's why they want us fighting with them,
[03:54:57.200 --> 03:54:59.200]  because the system absolutely hates them.
[03:54:59.200 --> 03:55:02.200]  That's why they demonize the veterans and things,
[03:55:02.200 --> 03:55:05.200]  is because they're worried about anybody that could stop the takeover
[03:55:05.200 --> 03:55:07.200]  when it becomes incredibly obvious.
[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:10.200]  Who went after Hitler, his own military?
[03:55:10.200 --> 03:55:13.200]  Who went after Stalin and probably killed him, his own military?
[03:55:13.200 --> 03:55:16.200]  Who ends up going after the really bad guys?
[03:55:16.200 --> 03:55:18.200]  It's usually the military or the police.
[03:55:18.200 --> 03:55:23.200]  That's why the system keeps them on such a short leash and right close to them.
[03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:26.200]  And then Homeland Security gives them all this federal training,
[03:55:26.200 --> 03:55:29.200]  sends them out to do this, and it gives them all the equipment,
[03:55:29.200 --> 03:55:32.200]  and then comes in, oh, it's terrible what you did,
[03:55:32.200 --> 03:55:34.200]  even though they set them up for it.
[03:55:34.200 --> 03:55:36.200]  Very sophisticated manipulation.
[03:55:36.200 --> 03:55:39.200]  So just like we're played off against the Muslims,
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:42.200]  we need to be more sophisticated and realize the larger plan.
[03:55:42.200 --> 03:55:44.200]  Don't you agree, Leigh Ann?
[03:55:44.200 --> 03:55:45.200]  Absolutely.
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:48.200]  And you can see that separation here evident just today
[03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:50.200]  in the fact that we had the first responders,
[03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:53.200]  once again weren't allowed to join in the ceremony,
[03:55:53.200 --> 03:55:55.200]  because they know, first of all,
[03:55:55.200 --> 03:55:57.200]  of course the families are going to want to hug these people
[03:55:57.200 --> 03:56:00.200]  that risked their lives to save their family,
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:03.200]  saved a whole lot more lives that day than what was lost,
[03:56:03.200 --> 03:56:06.200]  but maybe they have some questions for the first responders.
[03:56:06.200 --> 03:56:10.200]  But see how realities flipped, we're arming Al Qaeda publicly,
[03:56:10.200 --> 03:56:13.200]  and then meanwhile the first responders can't get medical care.
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:15.200]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, you have more reports coming up
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:17.200]  at the Nightly News, great job you and Joe.
[03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:19.200]  Take a break, get something to eat,
[03:56:19.200 --> 03:56:21.200]  kick your feet back for a while,
[03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:23.200]  and then go out and get some more great reports,
[03:56:23.200 --> 03:56:25.200]  and then it's Miller time.
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:28.200]  My favorite time, the magic hour,
[03:56:28.200 --> 03:56:32.200]  will be out at Times Square reporting bringing you the info.
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:33.200]  Hey, I just had an idea.
[03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:35.200]  How about we get a bunch of info warriors
[03:56:35.200 --> 03:56:38.200]  to go to Times Square, say it's 7 o'clock tonight,
[03:56:38.200 --> 03:56:40.200]  in front of some landmark,
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:43.200]  and we'll put a tweet out and a Facebook out.
[03:56:43.200 --> 03:56:46.200]  There's hardly any promotion, but I bet 100 people show up.
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:49.200]  You want to call for a Liberty Mob to show up in Times Square, Leigh Ann?
[03:56:49.200 --> 03:56:51.200]  Or do you want them to meet you?
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:54.200]  Liberty Mob in Times Square, what we're hearing is that
[03:56:54.200 --> 03:56:57.200]  the architects and engineers for 9-Eleven Truth
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:01.200]  have paid to get one of the billboards there
[03:57:01.200 --> 03:57:06.200]  to have a revolving loop of World Trade Center 7 going down.
[03:57:06.200 --> 03:57:09.200]  Yeah, they've done that before, but where do you want people to meet you?
[03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:11.200]  That's at 42nd and 6th Street.
[03:57:11.200 --> 03:57:12.200]  We'll be there.
[03:57:12.200 --> 03:57:14.200]  I think it's like the magic steps or something,
[03:57:14.200 --> 03:57:15.200]  the steps to infinity.
[03:57:15.200 --> 03:57:18.200]  Right in the center, right in the heart of everything,
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:19.200]  we will be there.
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:21.200]  47th and 6th Street.
[03:57:21.200 --> 03:57:22.200]  We just had that idea?
[03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:24.200]  42nd, 42nd.
[03:57:24.200 --> 03:57:26.200]  42nd and 6th.
[03:57:26.200 --> 03:57:28.200]  42nd and 6th.
[03:57:28.200 --> 03:57:30.200]  We'll tweet that out at the magic steps.
[03:57:30.200 --> 03:57:33.200]  Everybody will see Leigh Ann and Joe Biggs out there.
[03:57:33.200 --> 03:57:35.200]  Great job, Leigh Ann.
[03:57:35.200 --> 03:57:36.200]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:57:36.200 --> 03:57:37.200]  All right, folks, we're out of time.
[03:57:37.200 --> 03:57:39.200]  I didn't get to most of the smoking guns.
[03:57:39.200 --> 03:57:43.200]  There's hundreds of them, but we have 10 on infowars.com, the top 10.
[03:57:43.200 --> 03:57:47.200]  Cheney recalls taking charge from Bunker, the stand down.
[03:57:47.200 --> 03:57:50.200]  15 of the 19 hijackers led into the country.
[03:57:50.200 --> 03:57:56.200]  Hijacker's train in the U.S., Obama, it says Obama.
[03:57:56.200 --> 03:57:59.200]  Osama not wanted by FBI for 9-Eleven.
[03:57:59.200 --> 03:58:02.200]  Prior warnings, Willie Brown warned not to fly.
[03:58:02.200 --> 03:58:04.200]  Mcconnelly's to rise.
[03:58:04.200 --> 03:58:05.200]  It just goes on and on.
[03:58:05.200 --> 03:58:07.200]  The 28 pages, people that have seen them,
[03:58:07.200 --> 03:58:09.200]  says that it was basically a stand down ordered
[03:58:09.200 --> 03:58:11.200]  when Saudi Arabia involved.
[03:58:11.200 --> 03:58:13.200]  That's just some of the major issues.
[03:58:13.200 --> 03:58:15.200]  The cell phones working from impossible heights.
[03:58:15.200 --> 03:58:17.200]  The FBI admitting it was fake.
[03:58:17.200 --> 03:58:19.200]  Let's thank God there wasn't a terror attack yet today.
[03:58:19.200 --> 03:58:20.200]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[03:58:20.200 --> 03:58:22.200]  I hope it was just Homeland Security fear mongering.
[03:58:22.200 --> 03:58:25.200]  Thank you to all the infowars out there taking this possible
[03:58:25.200 --> 03:58:28.200]  and great job with the crew until 7 o'clock tonight
[03:58:28.200 --> 03:58:32.200]  with infowars and nightly news, you are the resistance.
