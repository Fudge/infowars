[00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:07.711]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.697]  It is time for you to choose a side.
[00:00:10.697 --> 00:00:13.062]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:19.533]  Michael Graves was in my studio!
[00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.613]  There he is!
[00:00:48.263 --> 00:00:51.764]  Hey, I actually bought your, uh, your, uh, 50s album.
[00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:52.324]  What's the name of that?
[00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:53.965]  I love it.
[00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.325]  Ah, the, uh, 1950s.
[00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:56.845]  It was called the Project 1950s.
[00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:00.446]  I love the punk variant on that.
[00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:02.707]  I got a couple of songs that kind of go between the original and the new ones.
[00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.627]  There's a little effect.
[00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:05.788]  Um, I gotta go to call.
[00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:06.548]  You guys are awesome.
[00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:07.668]  I apologize for making you hold.
[00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:11.069]  We got the former head of the Misfits, his own super popular band right here.
[00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.170]  But I wanted to say something briefly about Ted Nugent.
[00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:24.119]  And, but I said I'd go to your calls, we'll go to them now, but I'm going to briefly say at the start of the deal, because I admire renegades, and I admire people that have paid a serious price for what they've done.
[00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:34.087]  And you know it's cost him over a hundred million dollars since Obama got in, where he was banned in the major sports stadiums everywhere by three cartels that run it.
[00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:35.448]  And he's happy to do that.
[00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:36.049]  He feels better.
[00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.112]  But I don't want to hear people say you can't make sacrifices.
[00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:46.356]  And on this road to liberty and freedom, people made a lot of sacrifices.
[00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.038]  A lot of folks go, well I better put my head down and kiss ass.
[00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:49.918]  Well then you'll sell everything.
[00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:51.139]  So we'll talk about it next segment.
[00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:55.361]  But right now, Jim in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:57.062]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:01:57.062 --> 00:01:58.583]  I love you Jim, I won't hold it against you.
[00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.044]  You got the same first name as Jim Acosta.
[00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:03.559]  Oh, it's, um, yeah, unfortunate.
[00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:04.880]  It's a joke!
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.322]  I got the same name as Alexander Soros!
[00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:13.926]  I'm going to have to congratulate you guys on getting that deep fake into the C-SPAN video feed there.
[00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:15.446]  How you managed to pull that off.
[00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:20.629]  Well, my God, I have no idea, but... We're better than Industrial Light and Mad Gadget.
[00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.011]  We hijack satellite feeds and edit them in live time.
[00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.448]  Yeah, that's going to be the talk news tonight.
[00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:31.792]  Canadian conspires with Alex Jones to hijack video feeds.
[00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:32.872]  That's it.
[00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:34.113]  New topic, new headline.
[00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:36.675]  Canada's going to come hunting for me now, I'm sure.
[00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:37.595]  So what's on your mind?
[00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:38.716]  Is it migrant caravan?
[00:02:40.042 --> 00:03:03.386]  Migrant caravan, yeah, I was thinking that, and then I started thinking a bunch of other things, but now I'm thinking about how words and violence, and wasn't World War I started over a apparent besmirching of a woman's honor, which allegedly never happened, but wasn't found out until after the husband... And it started with a false flag on a Lusitania, and a British intelligence assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
[00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:04.681]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:06.423]  So it started with a bunch of fake BS.
[00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:11.827]  The big line of BS is to push a narrative so that they could go out and do crazy stuff.
[00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:16.690]  And then they did the same thing repeatedly over and over and over again.
[00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.972]  So that's why they don't quit, because it's been working!
[00:03:19.952 --> 00:03:30.597]  Well, it's because people lack critical thinking and common sense, and I think that's why the media is so terrified of you and the work that all of your employees do, is you guys think critically about it.
[00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:31.958]  Does this make sense?
[00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:32.938]  Is it rational?
[00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:34.359]  What are the alternatives?
[00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.321]  How could it play out if this was the case, if that was the case?
[00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.901]  That's why they hate you about Sandy Hook.
[00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.102]  You played devil's advocate, my friend.
[00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:42.983]  You can't do that.
[00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:47.446]  Arguing both sides of the coin and saying, hey, there's an edge here.
[00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:48.767]  You can't do that.
[00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:51.308]  That violates people's thoughts of right and left.
[00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:53.268]  Well, you sound like a smart hombre.
[00:03:53.268 --> 00:03:55.089]  Let me ask you this, Jim.
[00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.610]  Soros has overthrown a bunch of governments with Antifa-type scum.
[00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.691]  He used Nazis in Ukraine.
[00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:01.371]  They're clearly launching all these attacks.
[00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:02.812]  I think it's a smokescreen for real attacks.
[00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:04.713]  What do you think?
[00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:09.194]  If I knew where he was and I had the ability, I would go claim that reward.
[00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:14.800]  That's what I would do.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.600]  I wouldn't hesitate.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.083]  I know it's chump change and Western money, but I'd go out and I'd collect it in a heartbeat.
[00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:20.703]  I wouldn't hesitate.
[00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:24.746]  Well, I hear... I don't want to turn him into a martyr, because now his little demon son is actually in command.
[00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:30.029]  But let me tell you, George Soros is a... I'm thoroughly anti-violence, but evil should be purged.
[00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:34.651]  And when you see the pure... the true evil that that guy is, he's overthrowing nations for profit.
[00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:35.372]  For profit.
[00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:37.701]  And the left worship seat.
[00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:38.342]  Interesting points.
[00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:39.102]  God bless, Jim.
[00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:40.062]  Smart cookie.
[00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:40.922]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:42.023]  Matt Bracken will be taking over.
[00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:43.223]  He'll ride shotgun.
[00:04:43.223 --> 00:04:46.304]  We got Michael Graves of the Misfits and so much more.
[00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:48.344]  And we've got, riding the shotgun, Owen Schroyer.
[00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:49.525]  Calls straight ahead.
[00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:51.185]  We're in the thick of the battle now.
[00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:52.566]  Trump just dropped the hammer.
[00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:54.806]  He's got a bulldog AGN.
[00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:56.347]  He's only got two months to execute.
[00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:57.707]  We'll tell you how on the other side.
[00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:02.930]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:07.736]  Not when we do something to them, but if the globalists pull out their assassination plans against major conservatives and they're hung out to dry, they're gonna be in supermax prisons.
[00:07:07.736 --> 00:07:08.877]  Crank it up!
[00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:10.658]  I wanna hear you!
[00:07:10.658 --> 00:07:12.499]  I wanna hear you scream!
[00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.240]  Cause you're gonna be, you morons!
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.561]  What a group of idiots!
[00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:27.852]  You know that my car's going about 180 miles an hour, listen to this.
[00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:29.932]  Get you a BMW.
[00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:29.973]  176.
[00:07:29.973 --> 00:07:34.894]  Here's the best part right here at the end of the song.
[00:07:34.894 --> 00:07:37.174]  I just want to hear you!
[00:07:37.174 --> 00:07:38.634]  I just want to hear you!
[00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:45.016]  Maybe you'll sing it for us, Michael.
[00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:45.456]  Yeah!
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.422]  Although you try to fight, you're dragged from the silence where you hide.
[00:07:54.422 --> 00:07:56.763]  Until you scream.
[00:07:56.763 --> 00:08:01.104]  I just want to hear you.
[00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:01.684]  Exactly.
[00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:03.545]  Stop screaming out against the tyranny.
[00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:04.425]  Right.
[00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:07.406]  I just want to hear you!
[00:08:07.406 --> 00:08:12.108]  I can't wait to hear you!
[00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:12.468]  Crank it up.
[00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:23.991]  Great build up, man.
[00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:26.493]  And so what are you talking about there?
[00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:27.453]  It's what you're saying here.
[00:08:27.453 --> 00:08:28.714]  I can't wait to hear you.
[00:08:28.714 --> 00:08:29.374]  I can't wait to hear you.
[00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:30.254]  Get out of that silence.
[00:08:30.254 --> 00:08:30.995]  Quit lying to yourself.
[00:08:30.995 --> 00:08:31.855]  Get out of your box.
[00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:32.135]  Right.
[00:08:32.135 --> 00:08:33.196]  Get out of that apathy.
[00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.717]  That silence where you hide.
[00:08:35.717 --> 00:08:36.718]  You have to come out.
[00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:37.738]  You have to scream.
[00:08:37.738 --> 00:08:39.119]  You have to scream it from the rooftops.
[00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:40.679]  You have to stand up.
[00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.240]  And you have to...
[00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:47.463]  That's how you claim your life and your soul.
[00:08:47.463 --> 00:08:48.604]  You can't hide.
[00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:49.925]  Especially not now.
[00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:50.685]  It's over.
[00:08:50.685 --> 00:08:52.106]  The hiding is over.
[00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:53.147]  The weakness is over.
[00:08:53.147 --> 00:08:55.068]  I'm going to go to Matt Brackett on these calls.
[00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.909]  We're going to ride shotgun for the rest of the hour if you want to.
[00:08:56.909 --> 00:08:57.830]  And we're going to continue on.
[00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.111]  This is the most epic moment ever, what's happening right now.
[00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:00.771]  It's so insane.
[00:09:00.771 --> 00:09:02.573]  I can't believe we're even on air during this period.
[00:09:02.573 --> 00:09:03.493]  The Civil War is on.
[00:09:03.493 --> 00:09:04.834]  The Deep State is making its move.
[00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:05.674]  There's no doubt.
[00:09:05.674 --> 00:09:06.815]  It's all on.
[00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:08.056]  I've talked to high-level folks.
[00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:09.657]  It's all just Pentagon's going.
[00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:12.280]  They've got the CENTCOM, the Marines.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.942]  I mean, it's insane right now, folks.
[00:09:14.942 --> 00:09:16.464]  There's a deep state war going on.
[00:09:16.464 --> 00:09:19.327]  It is on like Donkey Kong with this new announcement.
[00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:22.951]  But just remember, you don't want me to tell the story.
[00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.113]  He told me the story.
[00:09:24.113 --> 00:09:26.555]  I later learned it from some other executives.
[00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:27.877]  So I'll tell the story, briefly.
[00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:34.884]  I was out like six months ago at Ted Nugent's house here in Texas and hanging out with him and doing a great interview.
[00:09:34.884 --> 00:09:37.885]  It got tens of millions of views until YouTube took it down.
[00:09:37.885 --> 00:09:43.326]  And he was talking about Americana and why he loved America and loved his mom, his dad, everything else and the spirit of Ted Nugent.
[00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:45.887]  He was doing this in the 60s when nobody else was.
[00:09:45.887 --> 00:09:48.748]  And he talked about how it didn't hurt him to lose the $10 million a year.
[00:09:50.024 --> 00:10:00.406]  Uh, because he can sell out stuff everywhere in all these big stadiums, but it's three main leftist companies that control it, so he can only play at, like, city-owned arenas and things that they don't control.
[00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:05.587]  But then he doesn't have access to the marketing, all of it, and they even told him, leave the Second Amendment.
[00:10:05.587 --> 00:10:07.387]  You can be Anto Obama.
[00:10:07.387 --> 00:10:09.168]  We've been told.
[00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:13.048]  Stop being pro-Second Amendment, and you can go earn your own money.
[00:10:13.048 --> 00:10:14.209]  It's not like they're giving him money.
[00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:15.669]  They're going to let him go be successful.
[00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.053]  And you know what?
[00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:21.495]  Ted Nugent, like nine years ago, eight years ago, told him F off.
[00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:22.855]  And I knew that story.
[00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:23.915]  He told me.
[00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.116]  It was a confidence.
[00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:25.996]  I didn't break the confidence.
[00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:27.697]  I learned it from other people separately.
[00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:29.237]  And that's what everybody's going through here.
[00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:31.818]  You know how much more that makes me admire Ted Nugent?
[00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:34.279]  That he's lost over a hundred million dollars.
[00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.688]  To just say he believes in the Second Amendment.
[00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:43.989]  So when I get persecuted and they take our bank accounts, they lie about me and say I'm putting fake video out and all this other crap?
[00:10:43.989 --> 00:10:46.209]  That's what it takes to do this, folks.
[00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:48.170]  So let's not be wimps about this.
[00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.370]  A lot of folks go, we better kiss ass and belong with the system.
[00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.190]  No!
[00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:56.932]  Everything we've got is because men like Ted Nugent and people who got their arms and legs blown off gave them more for basic freedom.
[00:10:56.932 --> 00:10:57.792]  Gentlemen, comments on that?
[00:10:57.892 --> 00:11:06.595]  Well, I just think that Ted Nugent understands and has the spirit of liberty, and part of that means you know you don't cooperate with tyrants.
[00:11:06.595 --> 00:11:07.736]  You have to stand against tyrants.
[00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:08.816]  You don't negotiate with terrorists.
[00:11:08.816 --> 00:11:18.600]  And I keep, I was actually talking to Michael during the break, I keep thinking about the scene at the beginning of The Patriot, Alex, where the Redcoats come to his house, and he thinks, oh, I'm just going to cooperate, everything will be fine.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.381]  They kill his son.
[00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.122]  Then they kill his kids, and then what time is it?
[00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:23.382]  Time to kill.
[00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:25.043]  So... Well, he'd been a Redcoat.
[00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:28.392]  But the point is, you cannot cooperate.
[00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:30.413]  There is no agreeing with these people.
[00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:34.515]  They are full-blown authoritarians.
[00:11:34.515 --> 00:11:35.816]  So Ted Nugent understands.
[00:11:35.816 --> 00:11:38.837]  Oh, well, if I just cooperate, you know, I just won't go with the Second Amendment.
[00:11:38.837 --> 00:11:40.698]  They'll let me live and everything will be cool.
[00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:41.919]  No, Ted Nugent has a spirit of liberty.
[00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:44.860]  He says, no, there's no quarter with the tyrant.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.281]  No, they're not going to give me a quarter as soon as I get in.
[00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:47.701]  That's what he said.
[00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:48.822]  It wasn't even a decision.
[00:11:48.822 --> 00:11:49.782]  That's a man.
[00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:52.784]  There wasn't even like, oh, the money or the Second Amendment.
[00:11:52.784 --> 00:11:54.625]  And if we had that spirit again, it'd all be over.
[00:11:55.478 --> 00:11:56.739]  That's what created the prosperity.
[00:11:56.739 --> 00:11:58.100]  Michael?
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:10.110]  My mind is going to epigenetics and when we stand up and you take a stand and what's inside of us then comes alive and we're able to then expand our minds, expand our experience, expand our souls.
[00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.291]  We get closer together.
[00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:11.771]  Us.
[00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:12.772]  That's the real wealth.
[00:12:12.772 --> 00:12:14.113]  We get closer to God.
[00:12:14.113 --> 00:12:14.874]  Yes.
[00:12:14.874 --> 00:12:16.495]  Yes and it's worth it.
[00:12:16.495 --> 00:12:18.257]  That's one of the things that separates us
[00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:31.085]  From the other side is that connection to spirit, that connection to that force and that energy that brings us closer to God and in the end saves us.
[00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:31.645]  We know that.
[00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:33.606]  Can you not feel that force rising?
[00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:37.669]  But that's the sad thing is that people are consciously leaving that force.
[00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.210]  We're getting more in tune with it.
[00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.090]  We're feeling it.
[00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.311]  We're in it.
[00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:43.733]  And people are consciously trying to get away from it, get away from God.
[00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:46.775]  And they're saying, they're fake, they're fake, they're not real, they're not real, they're not real.
[00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.016]  Matt Bracken, we're going to get into these calls.
[00:12:49.016 --> 00:12:50.016]  We're going to have you take over.
[00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:51.357]  I want you back tonight, too.
[00:12:51.357 --> 00:12:52.578]  Former Navy SEAL, best selling author.
[00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.819]  You predicted the season of the false flags.
[00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:59.881]  This new AG, the way they're crapping their britches now, the establishment's so scared.
[00:12:59.881 --> 00:13:12.607]  Activating the 900 Antifa groups, which I've been told by high-level folks, I'm going to leave it at that, that when you start seeing Antifa doxing a bunch of locations, that's the smoke screen for real attacks coming, not by them, but the real teams, Matt.
[00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:14.268]  What's your intel on the situation we're in right now?
[00:13:16.443 --> 00:13:23.146]  I think that nobody should be eager for this because it can turn into a bloodbath very quickly.
[00:13:23.146 --> 00:13:37.652]  It's not just formal groups, but when invasions happen throughout history, when civil wars break out throughout history, private actors use that period as a smokescreen.
[00:13:37.652 --> 00:13:39.073]  There'll be bank robberies.
[00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:40.033]  It'll be like the Purge.
[00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:51.401]  Or old vendettas, just people that have a grudge will know that there's no way the police are going to be able to CSI every murder.
[00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:55.142]  People get sniped at or shot in an intersection.
[00:13:55.142 --> 00:13:58.623]  It's just going to be put down to the general mayhem.
[00:13:58.623 --> 00:14:05.965]  So people with their own personal grudges will be able to do things and just figure there's no way it's going to be examined.
[00:14:05.965 --> 00:14:06.665]  Then now's the time to do it.
[00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:08.406]  No, I agree, but what do you call this period?
[00:14:08.406 --> 00:14:09.706]  How big is the Attorney General move?
[00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:22.926]  Well, it's this lame duck period is a period of super high danger because for the next couple months, Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes and the heroes of the Freedom Caucus still control the committees.
[00:14:22.926 --> 00:14:31.948]  Now, the Democrats may boycott and say, we're not even going to sit-sit, but the eight members on the Republican side can do a lot in the next two months.
[00:14:31.948 --> 00:14:34.789]  This is the window now to put out the FISA.
[00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:36.649]  And so what should Trump do in the next two months?
[00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:53.973]  Well, this is their window, for example, to put out all the information about the FISA document and the deep state coup, all the information tying Fusion, the DNC, all these CIA spies, like the Australian diplomat,
[00:14:54.754 --> 00:14:59.856]  Halper, the CIA academic that set up Papadopoulos.
[00:14:59.856 --> 00:15:01.576]  It's time to put all of this stuff out.
[00:15:01.576 --> 00:15:06.018]  And I'm really glad that Trump preemptively put the military at the border.
[00:15:06.018 --> 00:15:10.940]  He would be so back on his heels if he waited until the caravans were approaching the border.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:17.982]  Now, effectively, this puts the military in charge, which is constitutional, has nothing to do with posse comitatus when you're at the border.
[00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:22.405]  It's right in the Constitution.
[00:15:22.405 --> 00:15:27.869]  Let's look at the triangulation of the attacks and the fact they're making their move.
[00:15:27.869 --> 00:15:33.013]  This is definitely a period where we're going to see the deep state counter-strike.
[00:15:33.013 --> 00:15:36.236]  And what do we know about this new Attorney General and what he's about to do?
[00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:41.280]  From the behavior of the deep state and the globalists, it appears that they are stricken with fear.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.202]  We're going to come back with Pastor Sam, and Ryan, and others at Matt Bracken.
[00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:49.883]  Michael Graves is here as well, and Owen Froyer.
[00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:53.885]  It's a big roundtable for the future, and we're all in it.
[00:15:53.885 --> 00:15:56.526]  Stay with us, spread those links, and break the census control.
[00:15:59.853 --> 00:16:01.054]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.054 --> 00:16:06.437]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:09.339]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:12.921]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:00.872]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:17:00.872 --> 00:17:04.794]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:04.794 --> 00:17:06.335]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:06.335 --> 00:17:09.297]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:09.297 --> 00:17:14.861]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:16.062]  I can help you, too.
[00:17:16.062 --> 00:17:19.004]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:21.225]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:17:21.225 --> 00:17:25.668]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:17:25.668 --> 00:17:27.949]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.153]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:38.157]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:42.981]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:44.322]  Don't just take my word for it.

[00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:50.006]  HBExtract.com.
[00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:52.308]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:09.576]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:18:09.576 --> 00:18:12.459]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:18.505]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:25.410]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:31.716]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:38.641]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:18:39.782 --> 00:18:52.812]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:18:52.812 --> 00:18:57.075]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:59.777]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:06.761]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:13.585]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:29.114]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:19:30.273 --> 00:19:34.114]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:19:34.114 --> 00:19:39.356]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[00:19:55.781 --> 00:19:59.902]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:20:03.354 --> 00:20:24.869]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:28.792]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:45.539]  Well, that's the previous misfit singer, Glenn Danzig.
[00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:48.121]  Hollywood Babylon!
[00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:49.603]  The evil Elvis.
[00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:52.866]  Matt, I want to take calls for a couple of segments and let you take over here at the end.
[00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:59.352]  You've always got a lot of great points to add, but I'm sitting up here all cheerful about them firing the bad AG, obviously.
[00:20:59.352 --> 00:21:01.213]  So there goes the whole QAnon thing down the toilet.
[00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:17.126]  But the activation of Antifa and the calls for violence and them saying we're putting fake videos out that aren't fake, there's suddenly a new level or several levels of desperate lying, of threats.
[00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:20.749]  Now The View is saying that the woman at the White House attacked Acosta.
[00:21:20.749 --> 00:21:22.951]  It's not about Acosta.
[00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:25.152]  It's about the level of lying.
[00:21:25.152 --> 00:21:28.335]  What is the tactic here and what would you call this period we're in right now?
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:42.224]  I think this is like the kickoff or the interim period where we're going to see actions happening so fast that there's not time in between to sort them out and get to the truth.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.185]  You know, one false flag will go out and its lie will stand as truth.
[00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:54.569]  And before the aggrieved party, the party that's actually being set up, can figure it out, another one happens.
[00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:57.329]  And this will take on a life of its own.
[00:21:57.329 --> 00:22:03.171]  It's going to accelerate into a feedback mechanism that basically has no breaks.
[00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:08.593]  And there could even be a, depending on who becomes a target.
[00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:11.834]  This thing with Tucker Carlson is very significant.
[00:22:11.834 --> 00:22:14.175]  When guys like Tucker Carlson have a mob outside,
[00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:27.684]  It's very small, a very small step to Molotov cocktails through windows at night, and then to down the street rifle sniping when you're walking down your driveway.
[00:22:27.684 --> 00:22:30.326]  That's the thing, they block the street off, the guy that leads it.
[00:22:31.147 --> 00:22:38.274]  Out of New York, this professor is the same one that sent him after Cruz, and he's made fun of this saying it's a great thing.
[00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:40.736]  He's the guy protected, funded by Soros.
[00:22:40.736 --> 00:22:41.817]  He's in charge of this.
[00:22:41.817 --> 00:22:44.579]  He says kill cops, kill all white people.
[00:22:44.579 --> 00:22:45.280]  He's white, of course.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.003]  You know, they're an effing white male, and the guy's saying it's white.
[00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:49.944]  So this is their plan.
[00:22:49.944 --> 00:22:51.946]  This, we call him Pez Dispenser Neck.
[00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:53.247]  You know who he is.
[00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:54.509]  This NYC professor
[00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:59.192]  He is literally calling for war and death.
[00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:03.995]  So they're sending a mob out under the command of a guy that says our mission is to kill.
[00:23:03.995 --> 00:23:18.625]  So if I said, my mission, which I'm not saying, it's hypothetical, is to go down and attack the Austin Police Department, and I believe they should all be killed, which I'm not saying, I'm saying in his stead, and then I show up with a mob of people, the cops have got their safeties off, Matt.
[00:23:20.239 --> 00:23:25.982]  Yeah, this is pretty close to where you read the Riot Act and you demand people disperse or else.
[00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:33.847]  You know, if somebody's holding a Molotov cocktail on your lawn, that's one of the exceptions where you can shoot somebody outside your house.
[00:23:33.847 --> 00:23:36.969]  You don't have to, you know, so it becomes more and more of a gray line.
[00:23:36.969 --> 00:23:45.133]  What if somebody else gets their house Molotov'd and now a mob shows up at your house and you hear them talking about Molotov cocktails?
[00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:46.574]  It's a clear and present danger.
[00:23:46.574 --> 00:23:47.775]  They've showed their intent.
[00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:52.635]  Matt, don't you agree, though, that the police need to stop this now?
[00:23:52.635 --> 00:23:55.936]  Everyone that showed up at Tucker Carlson's house should have been arrested and detained for 40 hours.
[00:23:55.936 --> 00:23:57.597]  They're part of a terroristic threat.
[00:23:57.597 --> 00:23:58.818]  They're part of an organized racket.
[00:23:58.818 --> 00:24:06.721]  Because when I told Tucker's family on video, move out, get out, that's like the Klan coming to black people's house in Alabama and saying, move out of our town.
[00:24:06.721 --> 00:24:09.083]  If this is literal KKK crap.
[00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:09.783]  Sorry, Matt, go ahead.
[00:24:11.238 --> 00:24:13.279]  Yeah, this is absolutely right.
[00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.601]  That riot act point is very true.
[00:24:15.601 --> 00:24:25.606]  And if Tucker came out on the front courts with a shotgun and fired over their heads, I mean, it didn't happen last night, but that's going to be something that happens soon.
[00:24:25.606 --> 00:24:28.387]  They're lucky I didn't show up at my house, man.
[00:24:28.387 --> 00:24:30.168]  Something's important to understand.
[00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:37.452]  When a free, first world, affluent country rolls into a civil war, it's much different than, say, it happening in El Salvador.
[00:24:37.452 --> 00:24:38.253]  In El Salvador,
[00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:47.622]  Tucker Carlson and Jim Acosta and everybody up the food chain, political media, they already live in a gated community, fortified in a condo behind a wall.
[00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:49.886]  We're in a free society, so we're wide open.
[00:24:50.663 --> 00:24:51.944]  We're all wide open.
[00:24:51.944 --> 00:25:03.077]  We have generals and CIA officials living in Falls Church and in Maryland suburbs and they've just got a house you can drive up on the lawn if you want.
[00:25:03.077 --> 00:25:06.661]  You can take a truck and drive it across the lawn straight into his front door.
[00:25:06.661 --> 00:25:09.004]  So America is a soft target to asymmetrical warfare?
[00:25:10.423 --> 00:25:12.985]  And it's going to be impossible to unwind.
[00:25:12.985 --> 00:25:19.089]  Like, let's say the next guy, instead of a mob, it's a sniping, but it's a right winger that sniped.
[00:25:19.089 --> 00:25:21.811]  Will you assume that it's a left winger that shot him?
[00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:28.475]  Or, you know, we have a lot of really crazy people out here, and it's coming unraveled after Pittsburgh, we know now.
[00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:32.865]  It's not just Antifa's, you know, the Communists.
[00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:46.138]  There are, and I know that everybody to the right of Lenin is called a Nazi and I get that, but there are swastika wearing swastika flag, hard, cold, National Socialists.
[00:25:46.138 --> 00:25:50.502]  No, no, so the crazy beehive is open and this is a crazy time to be alive.
[00:25:52.644 --> 00:25:53.385]  False flags.
[00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.307]  It's a time when false flags can be extremely prevalent.
[00:25:56.307 --> 00:26:02.172]  Because you have people who are very violent, willing to use the by any means necessary tactic.
[00:26:02.172 --> 00:26:02.893]  No, I get it.
[00:26:02.893 --> 00:26:06.055]  Once hell breaks loose, hell breaks loose.
[00:26:06.055 --> 00:26:12.381]  Once the veneer of civilization is peeled back, everybody starts killing because it's open season.
[00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:17.245]  Let me tell you, if civil war starts, I'm going to be very upset because I didn't stop it.
[00:26:17.245 --> 00:26:18.526]  But then once it starts, well...
[00:26:20.168 --> 00:26:39.317]  I'm having anxiety over here because when you, you know, you listen to Matt talk and taking in all of the information that you have, that we have, that we know, when you put all those pieces together and you think forward to where we've come.
[00:26:40.385 --> 00:26:52.536]  And I see the pictures that you're putting up outside Tucker Carlson's house, and that anxiety, because that spirit, knowing where we're headed, is terrible.
[00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:58.160]  And this is a group run by a guy that says he wants to kill Trump's family, he wants to kill police.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.924]  Right, it's not, it's not, we're just, you know, this is what we think is gonna happen.
[00:27:02.264 --> 00:27:04.105]  No, a group's coming that wants to kill me.
[00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:05.425]  They're saying it.
[00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:09.506]  They're saying that they're coming to take out conservatives.
[00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:10.887]  And you're not safe.
[00:27:10.887 --> 00:27:11.827]  That's the truth.
[00:27:11.827 --> 00:27:12.587]  Let's not forget.
[00:27:12.587 --> 00:27:13.607]  That's true.
[00:27:13.607 --> 00:27:14.308]  Let's not forget.
[00:27:14.308 --> 00:27:18.489]  This all stems from the biggest lies ever told.
[00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:20.149]  That Trump colluded with Russia.
[00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:21.350]  That Trump's a Nazi.
[00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.610]  That Trump's a KKK member.
[00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.851]  That's the background of this entire thing that justifies their violence.
[00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:34.493]  All perpetuated by CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:27:34.493 --> 00:27:38.533]  If this civil war pops up, those are the news outlets responsible for it 100%.
[00:27:38.533 --> 00:27:39.334]  Amen to that.
[00:27:39.334 --> 00:27:41.654]  They're going to be military tribunals.
[00:27:41.654 --> 00:27:45.015]  We're going to come back with phone calls with Matt Bragg and I promise we're going to everybody.
[00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:46.475]  We'll come back in three minutes.
[00:27:46.475 --> 00:27:47.495]  Michael, stay here.
[00:27:47.495 --> 00:27:48.356]  Michael Graves.
[00:27:48.356 --> 00:27:50.276]  Michael, plug your website for folks that haven't visited it.
[00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:52.178]  Officialmichaelgraves.com.
[00:27:52.178 --> 00:27:53.358]  Officialmichaelgraves.com.
[00:27:53.358 --> 00:27:59.363]  All right, and you guys, briefly, you have a pro-life demonstration and a flag laying event this weekend in Austin.
[00:27:59.363 --> 00:28:00.344]  Tell folks about that.
[00:28:00.344 --> 00:28:08.571]  This Saturday at 10 a.m., we're meeting at a Texas State Cemetery, 909 Nova Soda Street in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:08.571 --> 00:28:09.852]  It's the Marines' birthday.
[00:28:09.852 --> 00:28:15.577]  We're gonna lay, we got hundreds of flags, we're gonna lay them at the Veterans' Cemetery to honor our veterans.
[00:28:15.577 --> 00:28:17.058]  Then after that, at 1 o'clock,
[00:28:17.358 --> 00:28:24.667]  We have the Stop Government Funding of Abortion Rally, which is going to be at the South Austin Planned Parenthood on Ben White Boulevard.
[00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:25.668]  We're going to have signs.
[00:28:25.668 --> 00:28:26.729]  Bring your own signs.
[00:28:26.729 --> 00:28:27.430]  Heck, bring your family.
[00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.652]  Honestly, it's going to be a really fun event.
[00:28:28.652 --> 00:28:29.653]  A lot of great people coming.
[00:28:29.653 --> 00:28:30.654]  Going to be a lot of camaraderie.
[00:28:30.654 --> 00:28:32.016]  A lot of parking around there.
[00:28:32.016 --> 00:28:33.057]  There should be plenty of parking.
[00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:34.838]  290 and I-35, you can't miss it.
[00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:38.699]  People coming from all over the states, Marines coming out, I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:28:38.699 --> 00:28:44.462]  So, 1 o'clock Saturday, stop government funding of Planned Parenthood protests at the South Austin Planned Parenthood.
[00:28:44.462 --> 00:28:49.444]  10 o'clock that morning, we're celebrating the Marines' birthday, honoring the veterans by doing a flag lay at Texas State Senate.
[00:28:49.444 --> 00:28:51.005]  And if you missed it, get your pen and paper ready.
[00:28:51.005 --> 00:28:52.345]  We'll tell you about it again when we come back.
[00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:55.266]  On the other side of this quick break, Matt Brackett, your calls and more.
[00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:55.967]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:33.224]  You know, if you want to know why they did the whole Jim Acosta thing and he had bumped, bumped on the lady and grabbed her, then they simply put out a fake video.
[00:33:34.562 --> 00:33:43.088]  It's to change the subject from Ginsburg breaking through her ribs and looking like the Crypt Keeper and another Supreme Court Justice getting racked up for Trump in America.
[00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:46.950]  It's to change the subject from the corrupt AG being removed.
[00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:52.094]  It's to change the subject of the left lazing all the right-wing and patriot targets right now.
[00:33:52.094 --> 00:33:52.574]  That's what it is.
[00:33:52.574 --> 00:33:54.295]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:55.256]  Everybody's welcome here.
[00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:57.558]  There's our four-person roundtable and the caller.
[00:33:57.558 --> 00:34:00.560]  That makes five pop in on these topics here.
[00:34:02.048 --> 00:34:06.349]  It's really hard to overstate how amazing it is.
[00:34:06.349 --> 00:34:09.710]  So I want to just get each of you for one minute before we go to calls.
[00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:20.752]  What it's like to finally see Sessions, everything we wanted out, and then now it's here and we're kind of just moved on past it and there's a fire-breathing guy that sees what's going on and it's got them so scared.
[00:34:20.752 --> 00:34:23.693]  Let's go to Michael Graves and then Owen Schroer and then Matt Bracken.
[00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:34.305]  Well, I just pulled up an article that says, you know, Rachel Maddow is one of the people behind these protests that's happening.
[00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:35.525]  Oh yeah.
[00:34:35.525 --> 00:34:40.206]  This is a break the glass in case of emergency plan to protect the Mueller investigation.
[00:34:40.206 --> 00:34:41.647]  Yeah, that's Holder, it runs that.
[00:34:41.647 --> 00:34:43.627]  To protect the lies.
[00:34:43.627 --> 00:34:45.527]  We've got to go out, go to your house and threaten you.
[00:34:50.202 --> 00:34:58.145]  Yeah, the marches are being sponsored by Indivisible.org, which is a liberal activist group made up of former congressional staffers.
[00:34:58.145 --> 00:35:00.306]  So you know that's on the up and up.
[00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:04.688]  Now what it means is a bunch of leftist spooks are going out run by Holder to people's houses.
[00:35:06.308 --> 00:35:07.269]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:35:07.269 --> 00:35:09.552]  Guys, print that for me because Soros is involved.
[00:35:09.552 --> 00:35:10.513]  Move On's involved.
[00:35:10.513 --> 00:35:11.634]  Read that article, Michael Graves.
[00:35:11.634 --> 00:35:12.816]  That's so key.
[00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:18.383]  It's from Gravy News.
[00:35:18.383 --> 00:35:24.830]  The group is demanding Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker disclaim any authority over the Robert Mueller Russia probe.
[00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.691]  Which he's already refused.
[00:35:26.933 --> 00:35:35.344]  Matt, I was MSNBC colleague Matt Miller earlier Wednesday called for taking the streets in response to Sessions' fire.
[00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:39.128]  Because this was all a hoax, setting up this group, doing it.
[00:35:39.128 --> 00:35:42.893]  Now the new Attorney General, the acting Attorney General is saying he's not going to do this.
[00:35:42.893 --> 00:35:43.814]  Owen, what do you expect him to do?
[00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:47.562]  I think we know what they're going to do.
[00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:49.003]  Eventually they're going to get even more violent.
[00:35:49.003 --> 00:35:50.103]  They'll start doing marches.
[00:35:50.103 --> 00:35:54.346]  But Alex, I kind of want to just zoom out and talk about the larger picture here for a second.
[00:35:54.346 --> 00:36:00.890]  You know, this society has become so perverted and so corrupt that it's just inevitable.
[00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.992]  We have more perversion, corruption, criminal activity.
[00:36:04.472 --> 00:36:13.261]  And we're just totally inept for many morals, we're totally inept from God, and greed and lust and perversion and deception rue the day.
[00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:16.144]  So this is the spiritual battle that eventually had to be here.
[00:36:16.144 --> 00:36:21.230]  Humanity, the West, had become so corrupt, had become so sick, so deceived,
[00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:27.292]  And so just inept of morals or God that this is the culmination of all of it, Alex.
[00:36:27.292 --> 00:36:31.174]  This is humanity finally deciding we're done living in a perverse society.
[00:36:31.174 --> 00:36:35.076]  We're done living in a West that's so corrupt where we don't even know what freedom is anymore.
[00:36:35.076 --> 00:36:37.036]  We're done having tyrants run our country.
[00:36:37.036 --> 00:36:38.437]  We're done with the lies.
[00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:39.858]  And it's a spiritual battle.
[00:36:39.858 --> 00:36:40.878]  It's not going to be fun.
[00:36:40.878 --> 00:36:42.038]  It's not going to be easy.
[00:36:42.038 --> 00:36:45.960]  But humanity has finally reached this point where we've seen what would become in the mirror.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.141]  And some of us reject it and get violent.
[00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:49.101]  Others want to fix it.
[00:36:49.101 --> 00:36:50.082]  And let's expand on that.
[00:36:50.862 --> 00:36:57.645]  The left went, oh, party, do whatever you want, anything goes, except my free speech, or raising my kids the way I want, or living my life.
[00:36:57.645 --> 00:37:00.307]  And now they've really shown themselves as the authoritarians.
[00:37:00.307 --> 00:37:03.288]  Matt Bracken?
[00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:11.652]  Whether you are a believer in God or in natural law, which could, you know, in a sense, be on the same side.
[00:37:12.369 --> 00:37:20.895]  This level of perversion and taking humanity towards areas that are so far out of bounds.
[00:37:20.895 --> 00:37:22.416]  The snapback was inevitable.
[00:37:22.416 --> 00:37:24.458]  The pendulum returning is inevitable.
[00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:28.341]  What's different though is that we have such a technologically complex society.
[00:37:28.971 --> 00:37:45.917]  That if there are, you know, massive riots that lead to looting, the whole thing can go down the tubes because, you know, it'll be impossible to sustain this type of an economy if there are, you know, highways being blocked, you know, railroads being sabotaged, things like that.
[00:37:45.917 --> 00:37:50.079]  Sure, no one believes you can have a world war until 50 million die.
[00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:52.840]  Everybody thinks it goes on forever until you realize how fragile it is.
[00:37:53.988 --> 00:37:57.431]  Yeah, I want to make a point about what you said, lazing, the left lazing.
[00:37:57.431 --> 00:37:59.833]  That's exactly right.
[00:37:59.833 --> 00:38:11.202]  The Kavanaugh hearings showed that the Democrats and the media were willing to participate in an all-out character assassination and totally lie about it.
[00:38:11.202 --> 00:38:16.967]  And even as the false witnesses are revealed, they don't care.
[00:38:16.967 --> 00:38:17.707]  It's a tactic.
[00:38:17.707 --> 00:38:20.830]  It's like what Harry Reid said, you know, well, it worked, didn't it?
[00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.691]  You're lying about tax returns.
[00:38:24.244 --> 00:38:29.130]  What we're seeing is that the left and the media will absolutely lie.
[00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:34.436]  They will point at the sky and say that it's green or purple and with a straight face.
[00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:41.424]  But, and I wrote about this in a short story called What I Saw at the Coup, at a certain point the media will become targeted.
[00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:56.096]  And, you know, that when they become an active participant in this civil war, when they become, you know, virtually the Goebbels of the left, then they become part of, you know, one of the soldiers.
[00:38:56.096 --> 00:39:00.438]  And they can't then expect to be in some sacrosanct bubble.
[00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:01.539]  You know, look at what happens.
[00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:02.199]  Well, they know that.
[00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:03.360]  That's why they're preemptively doing it.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:03.740]  You're right.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.841]  Pastor Sam in Texas.
[00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:06.341]  Pastor Sam, thanks for holding.
[00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:06.842]  You're a trooper.
[00:39:06.842 --> 00:39:07.242]  You're on the air.
[00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.813]  I will go up to the land of unwalled villages.
[00:39:11.813 --> 00:39:24.245]  I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates, to take a spoil and to take a prey, to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited.
[00:39:24.747 --> 00:39:27.848]  I've been pounding the pavement pretty hard, Alex, and I've got 20 things to say.
[00:39:27.848 --> 00:39:29.048]  I'd like to just pick one or two.
[00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:53.053]  We have some elected representatives that have gone on the warpath and they're being suppressed.
[00:39:53.053 --> 00:39:55.534]  We need to get in and really call them.
[00:39:55.534 --> 00:39:55.715]  Rep.
[00:39:55.715 --> 00:39:57.956]  Steve King out of Iowa.
[00:39:57.956 --> 00:40:00.717]  Senator Jim Inhofe out of Oklahoma.
[00:40:00.717 --> 00:40:06.640]  He just laid out his funding plan for the border wall and it's almost nowhere in the news.
[00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:09.365]  I was at that conference.
[00:40:09.365 --> 00:40:17.548]  I asked some questions to the Senator, and we had a good talk about that, which can be found if you bing up PastorSam-Inhofe.
[00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:25.291]  You won't find it anywhere else on the net, what was really discussed in his press conference, because this is what the news is trying to do.
[00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:33.654]  But it's time for us, as a land of unwalled villages, to fortify our defenses and to really strengthen ourselves and be ready for battle.
[00:40:34.395 --> 00:40:41.343]  I appreciate you, Alex, as a battlefield commander going out to each foxhole and saying, okay, no more 50% alert.
[00:40:41.343 --> 00:40:46.569]  Everybody's got to be awake all the time, all night long, because now's the time that the attack's coming.
[00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:51.675]  That's always a shock to the young soldier, but the grizzled veterans know it, and you're 100% right.
[00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:57.700]  One more thing, Austin PD, it's time for you to be on the side of right.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.805]  We know, the Patriots know all about Dr. Terry Allen's organ trafficking ring.
[00:41:02.805 --> 00:41:09.951]  We know how many exchange students have disappeared and walked out of his house in 15 igloo coolers.
[00:41:09.951 --> 00:41:16.798]  It is time for you to stand up to the wicked powers that are right here in this capital city and to take them down.
[00:41:16.798 --> 00:41:18.299]  Hold them accountable to the law.
[00:41:19.068 --> 00:41:19.949]  To the law.
[00:41:19.949 --> 00:41:21.532]  That's all we ask, is patriotism.
[00:41:35.273 --> 00:41:37.134]  Hi Alex, thank you for having me on.
[00:41:37.134 --> 00:41:44.898]  So this whole Jim Acosta thing, we're all talking about how he's touching a woman's arm and talking about video editing.
[00:41:44.898 --> 00:41:46.759]  We're missing the big point.
[00:41:46.759 --> 00:41:50.921]  He doesn't follow direction in these press briefing rooms.
[00:41:50.921 --> 00:41:52.702]  That itself is a form of violence.
[00:41:52.702 --> 00:42:04.709]  When I was watching him, you know, kind of challenging the president, getting rough, he was less than two feet away from the president not following direction.
[00:42:05.501 --> 00:42:08.443]  Not listening to people, you know, fighting this lady.
[00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:20.749]  I think that the reason why they want him in that press briefing room and all these journalists are there is to kind of be a Trojan horse or inspire some sort of crazy to actually attack the president.
[00:42:20.749 --> 00:42:24.851]  I don't think... You're saying Acosta could be used at a later point as a distraction instead of a foil?
[00:42:25.925 --> 00:42:26.305]  Right.
[00:42:26.305 --> 00:42:30.427]  I think what's really happening is they're all part of the resistance.
[00:42:30.427 --> 00:42:33.428]  CNN actually supports Antifa.
[00:42:33.428 --> 00:42:33.688]  Right?
[00:42:33.688 --> 00:42:38.049]  CNN is a dedicated foreign offshore criminal institution.
[00:42:38.049 --> 00:42:38.530]  Great points.
[00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:42.071]  Let me get Matt Bracken and our other guests' take on that in a few more calls.
[00:42:42.071 --> 00:42:44.112]  And then, you've got to get suited up.
[00:42:44.112 --> 00:42:46.332]  The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:42:46.332 --> 00:42:48.813]  I'll take all these callers on the War Room that don't make it here, Alex.
[00:42:48.813 --> 00:42:49.874]  They can transfer those over.
[00:42:49.874 --> 00:42:50.454]  All right.
[00:42:50.454 --> 00:42:51.394]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:53.315]  But the big news is we've got a new Attorney General.
[00:42:53.615 --> 00:42:55.877]  We'll eat your takes on that too when we come back.
[00:42:55.877 --> 00:42:59.460]  All hell's breaking loose and we're covering it.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:08.747]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.747 --> 00:43:11.629]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.629 --> 00:43:17.654]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.334 --> 00:43:24.579]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:30.883]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.883 --> 00:43:37.808]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:51.980]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:56.224 --> 00:43:58.185]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[00:43:59.346 --> 00:44:03.470]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:10.537]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:44:10.537 --> 00:44:15.361]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:22.248]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four-stage compact filtration system

[00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:08.959]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:10.420]  Believe me, I know.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:15.125]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:20.110]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:40.502]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:45:41.002 --> 00:45:44.984]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.292]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.

[00:46:35.661 --> 00:46:37.522]  Never gone this low.
[00:46:37.522 --> 00:46:40.004]  67% off to blow it all out.
[00:46:40.384 --> 00:46:42.065]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:16.588 --> 00:47:22.153]  Live, uncensored, and really hated by the globalists.
[00:47:22.153 --> 00:47:25.095]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[00:47:25.095 --> 00:47:27.598]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.598 --> 00:47:28.959]  Thank you, sir.
[00:47:28.959 --> 00:47:30.280]  We got a great crew here, you know?
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:37.266]  You know, a lot of our crew are former members of the Legion of Doom.
[00:47:37.266 --> 00:47:39.388]  No, seriously, let's get serious.
[00:47:39.388 --> 00:47:41.530]  Ginsburg hospitalized with broken ribs.
[00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:44.768]  Man, more bad news, I tell ya.
[00:47:44.768 --> 00:47:48.592]  Texas judge releases juvenile defendants after losing election.
[00:47:48.592 --> 00:47:49.512]  South Africa...
[00:47:50.859 --> 00:47:55.384]  South African whites barred from registering on government jobs website.
[00:47:55.384 --> 00:47:58.567]  Now, see, if I'm against whites being discriminated against, I'm a white supremacist.
[00:47:58.567 --> 00:48:06.274]  But I wouldn't want to hear that blacks anywhere were barred, because, you know, I believe in Martin Luther King and common sense.
[00:48:06.274 --> 00:48:10.499]  But over there, ZeroHedge.com and SublimeForce.com, they're taking the land.
[00:48:10.499 --> 00:48:11.800]  They're saying you can't register.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.321]  Whites can't have jobs.
[00:48:14.281 --> 00:48:16.362]  Wow, that's what Hitler did to the Jews.
[00:48:16.362 --> 00:48:19.484]  Baby trafficking ring busted in massive raid.
[00:48:19.484 --> 00:48:20.925]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:20.925 --> 00:48:22.726]  Five-month-old baby rescued.
[00:48:22.726 --> 00:48:23.766]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:48:23.766 --> 00:48:25.807]  A multi-thousand percent increase.
[00:48:25.807 --> 00:48:27.648]  Even NPR has a report on it.
[00:48:27.648 --> 00:48:29.970]  But they say Trump's not doing anything.
[00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:35.793]  That's what's scary to me, is to watch national news go, Jones claims there's pedophile rings.
[00:48:35.793 --> 00:48:37.934]  The Pope's about to step down because of it.
[00:48:39.471 --> 00:48:45.255]  Matt Bracken, EnemiesForeignDomestic.com, former Navy SEAL terrorism expert.
[00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:53.040]  I almost feel guilty that I haven't been more chicken with the head cut off today with Antifa activating 900 events, harassing people.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.622]  Like you said, they're creating the atmosphere.
[00:48:56.622 --> 00:48:58.263]  They don't even know why they've been sent.
[00:48:58.263 --> 00:49:01.105]  I know why from my own research and sources.
[00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:01.625]  I was told
[00:49:02.666 --> 00:49:08.674]  Six months ago, if you see Antifa start going to people's houses all over, they don't know they're being set up.
[00:49:08.674 --> 00:49:16.323]  That means that the deep state criminal elements are preparing a coup against the entire nationalist resistance.
[00:49:16.323 --> 00:49:19.728]  And when I did a video on that, they flipped out, lied about what I said.
[00:49:21.089 --> 00:49:25.851]  Well, we're going to see it turn the corner when it goes from mobs outside of houses to targeted assassination.
[00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:28.733]  And the targeted assassinations will be just as likely to be a false flag as not.
[00:49:28.733 --> 00:49:30.154]  And another factor is the weaponized lunatics.
[00:49:51.122 --> 00:50:00.871]  Especially in the internet era, it's particularly easy to find somebody who's labile and susceptible and then spin them up and turn them into a human weapon.
[00:50:00.871 --> 00:50:07.097]  I'm not saying that any of the recent ones like the fake bomber in his van, he was practically a walking advertisement.
[00:50:07.097 --> 00:50:09.099]  Please weaponize me for some purpose.
[00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:11.241]  I'm an idiot and I'll do anything.
[00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:16.626]  But another factor in here that we're seeing in the California case, the Thousand Oaks case,
[00:50:17.267 --> 00:50:29.415]  We're going to see, especially with the new Democratic Congress, a really harsh crackdown on anybody that's ever visited a shrink or taken any kind of a psychotropic drug being forbidden to own firearms.
[00:50:29.415 --> 00:50:32.897]  And this will be another way to ratchet the pressure on conservatives.
[00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:45.126]  We saw in Maryland a couple days ago the first red flag fatality where the police went to somebody's house to confiscate his weapons because, I forget what the issue was, a restraining order or something.
[00:50:45.126 --> 00:50:46.987]  It was a divorce, yeah.
[00:50:47.884 --> 00:50:51.486]  But the guy, you know, got into a tussle with the cops and he's dead.
[00:50:51.486 --> 00:50:58.869]  So you want to get the conservatives spun up to get the overall speed of this thing moving faster and faster.
[00:50:58.869 --> 00:51:01.970]  Find ways, backdoor ways, to threaten to take away conservatives.
[00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:02.310]  No, I get it.
[00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:07.333]  That's why I'm not really covering those is because I get it's an attempt to provocate.
[00:51:07.333 --> 00:51:08.513]  You're absolutely right, Matt Bracken.
[00:51:08.513 --> 00:51:08.913]  Great job.
[00:51:08.913 --> 00:51:09.774]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:51:10.814 --> 00:51:12.635]  Michael Graves, Owen Schroyer.
[00:51:12.635 --> 00:51:14.435]  Owen, you got the war room coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:51:14.435 --> 00:51:17.177]  You guys got an event, two events, a flag-laying event.
[00:51:17.177 --> 00:51:18.517]  People say, oh, big flag-laying.
[00:51:18.517 --> 00:51:19.437]  They hate our veterans.
[00:51:19.437 --> 00:51:20.238]  They hate our dead.
[00:51:20.238 --> 00:51:24.819]  Nothing triggers them like the veneration of sacrifice.
[00:51:24.819 --> 00:51:25.840]  Very important ritual.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.760]  And then the unborn.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.162]  You're going to honor the dead that stood up for freedom, and you're going to honor the unborn.
[00:51:32.042 --> 00:51:43.212]  Yeah, and again Alex, this is mass genocide happening in America, and I mean, if you want to do the identity politics, millions and millions of black babies in New York are aborted.
[00:51:43.212 --> 00:51:45.393]  It's like 70% of the blacks are aborted in New York.
[00:51:45.393 --> 00:51:46.174]  That are even born.
[00:51:46.174 --> 00:51:48.876]  So it's a really sad story, so we're raising issue to this, and you know...
[00:51:50.043 --> 00:51:54.729]  There's so many great veterans that have done so much for this country, even after they serve.
[00:51:54.729 --> 00:52:05.261]  You know, the least I can do, I mean, my grandfather served as well, the least I can do is go out and lay a flag and honor their sacrifice on the Marines' birthday, and I'm going to be honored to be joined by a bunch of Marines who are joining me.
[00:52:05.261 --> 00:52:07.484]  So that's at Texas State Cemetery.
[00:52:07.484 --> 00:52:08.305]  What was it, guys?
[00:52:08.305 --> 00:52:09.246]  Navasota Street.
[00:52:09.947 --> 00:52:11.930]  Navasota Street here in Austin, Texas.
[00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:15.254]  That's at 10 o'clock in the morning if you want to join us there.
[00:52:15.254 --> 00:52:19.720]  And then at 1 o'clock at the Planned Parenthood in South Austin on Ben White Boulevard.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.462]  That's the Stop the Government Funding of Abortion.
[00:52:21.462 --> 00:52:22.383]  Because here's the thing, Alex.
[00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:24.852]  There's nothing I can do, personally.
[00:52:24.852 --> 00:52:25.693]  No, I agree.
[00:52:25.693 --> 00:52:29.455]  If you want a nose job or to have your balls chopped off, I shouldn't have to pay for the sex change.
[00:52:29.455 --> 00:52:31.116]  And don't make me pay or you're going to kill your baby.
[00:52:31.116 --> 00:52:31.697]  Exactly.
[00:52:31.697 --> 00:52:38.661]  So right now it's legal to abort your baby and that's fine, but it should be totally illegal to take government funds to pay for it.
[00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:41.583]  Which Travis County is the only one in Texas that makes you pay.
[00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:42.183]  And also...
[00:52:43.103 --> 00:52:45.345]  They fund the Democrat Party, so it's totally illegal.
[00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:47.387]  So we're going to raise some awareness there.
[00:52:47.387 --> 00:52:49.148]  And it's going to be a great event, just with great people.
[00:52:49.148 --> 00:52:50.029]  Yeah, folks, be there.
[00:52:50.029 --> 00:52:52.812]  We appreciate you spending an hour and a half with us.
[00:52:52.812 --> 00:52:59.318]  Michael Graves, again, officialmichaelgraves.com, former head of the Misfits, great band of your own, a lot of courage to promote freedom.
[00:52:59.318 --> 00:53:01.500]  Closing comments about this amazing, epic transmission.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:15.129]  Well, we talked a lot today about energy, and I think, I guess my message is to the patriots and the believers out there is to remember that Lucifer, Satan, is not the opposite of God.
[00:53:15.129 --> 00:53:17.031]  It's not God's equal on the other side.
[00:53:17.771 --> 00:53:25.076]  Lucifer, Satan, the accuser, the spirit of false... He's a con artist.
[00:53:25.076 --> 00:53:26.617]  He's our adversary.
[00:53:26.617 --> 00:53:28.918]  He's ours, not God's.
[00:53:28.918 --> 00:53:29.759]  Not God's.
[00:53:29.759 --> 00:53:31.320]  God has control over everything.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.080]  He's ours.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.882]  And we have to continue to fight and push back.
[00:53:34.882 --> 00:53:40.526]  And it is my honor to be here and to be on the team.
[00:53:40.526 --> 00:53:41.226]  But you're right.
[00:53:41.226 --> 00:53:42.807]  I mean, he's our tester.
[00:53:42.807 --> 00:53:44.528]  He's not equal with God.
[00:53:44.528 --> 00:53:45.629]  He's a joke to God.
[00:53:45.629 --> 00:53:46.870]  He's at our level.
[00:53:48.342 --> 00:53:51.164]  Yes, yes, and he is running rampant.
[00:53:51.164 --> 00:54:00.972]  Remember, be vigilant, right, and sober-minded, because the devil roams the earth looking for souls to devour, roaring like a lion.
[00:54:00.972 --> 00:54:13.622]  And Alex, I think the big news of the day here, as we're about to conclude here, I'm going to take all your calls in the war room, by the way, so callers who didn't get in, you can... Marshall and Tim and Chris and Jeff and Dre and Jacob and Ryan, and we'll plug it to Ryan here in a minute, but go ahead.
[00:54:14.474 --> 00:54:16.915]  I think, Alex, it's clear what's happening right now.
[00:54:16.915 --> 00:54:24.939]  The deep state, the globalists, believed they had Jeff Sessions under control, so they didn't, you know, pull the plug, they didn't light the dynamite.
[00:54:24.939 --> 00:54:26.360]  Now... Well, Trump was getting ready.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:34.184]  Now that Sessions is out, they don't think they have control over Whitaker, and they're totally afraid, so now they have to pull that cork, they have to let the flood... The race is on!
[00:54:34.744 --> 00:54:37.226]  All right, pull that back up, because they want me to plug, but I'm not.

[00:54:52.458 --> 00:54:53.779]  We've gone down the slide.
[00:54:53.779 --> 00:54:54.740]  It's here.

[00:55:00.925 --> 00:55:02.046]  Check that out.
[00:55:02.046 --> 00:55:03.627]  Real quick here, let's jam in another caller.
[00:55:04.648 --> 00:55:08.869]  Sean, in Florida, you say censorship dims, violence turning up, civility.
[00:55:08.869 --> 00:55:10.550]  What do you think's going on?
[00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:16.671]  Hey, AJ, Owen, Destroyer, Matt, you guys, I love you guys, you're patriots, man.
[00:55:16.671 --> 00:55:18.232]  Absolute patriots.
[00:55:18.232 --> 00:55:22.313]  I'm totally disgusted, me and my wife, with the politics now.
[00:55:22.313 --> 00:55:26.094]  They say more civility after they won some of the, you know, the House.
[00:55:26.094 --> 00:55:27.854]  It's absolutely absurd.
[00:55:27.854 --> 00:55:28.974]  I can't believe it.
[00:55:28.974 --> 00:55:30.815]  I talked to you when you were on Clyde Lewis.
[00:55:31.475 --> 00:55:42.263]  And on his program, and you know, what kind of a patriot you were, and all the facts that you come out with, all the people you've had on your program, everybody.
[00:55:42.263 --> 00:55:48.728]  I mean, you had senators, congressmen, people, you know, of valor and distinction on your program.
[00:55:48.728 --> 00:55:52.011]  Everything you say is pretty much always spot on.
[00:55:52.011 --> 00:55:54.032]  These people are lunatics.
[00:55:54.032 --> 00:55:55.653]  I can't even talk to my mother.
[00:55:55.653 --> 00:55:57.735]  My mother is like an atheist.
[00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:03.396]  And, you know, I'm a libertarian Christian, and I can't even talk to my mother.
[00:56:03.396 --> 00:56:04.256]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:04.256 --> 00:56:05.517]  Well, it's not her fault.
[00:56:05.517 --> 00:56:06.357]  She's in a trance.
[00:56:06.357 --> 00:56:07.077]  She's in a trance.
[00:56:07.077 --> 00:56:07.557]  But I hear you.
[00:56:07.557 --> 00:56:08.257]  What do we do?
[00:56:08.257 --> 00:56:09.618]  I can't break her out of it, man.
[00:56:09.618 --> 00:56:10.978]  I can't break her, you know.
[00:56:10.978 --> 00:56:12.498]  And I'm not going to try.
[00:56:12.498 --> 00:56:13.079]  She's older.
[00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:14.359]  She's 80 years old.
[00:56:14.359 --> 00:56:19.060]  But still, the whole thing is, the bottom line is, how can you threaten the president with death?
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:26.726]  You know, and not be, and not... Acosta pushed that woman on that family call this morning and said, why'd you fake a video?
[00:56:26.726 --> 00:56:32.891]  Alex, you get banned from social media for just making a comment that's all about free speech, second amendment.
[00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:34.032]  They ban you from social media?
[00:56:34.032 --> 00:56:35.293]  I said, you little jerk.
[00:56:35.293 --> 00:56:37.115]  You've gotten me banned and you brag.
[00:56:37.115 --> 00:56:37.995]  You little twerp.
[00:56:37.995 --> 00:56:39.397]  In public, and I'm banned.
[00:56:39.397 --> 00:56:41.598]  And then they're like, oh, go to people's houses and threaten them.
[00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:45.682]  They're doxing people, they're inciting violence, they're doing all this, and they're perfectly allowed to.
[00:56:45.682 --> 00:56:47.663]  I mean, I don't know, man.
[00:56:48.857 --> 00:56:51.079]  Well listen, they got the system on their side and it's all rigged.
[00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:53.580]  The good news is their time's coming to an end.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.241]  Sean, epic times.
[00:56:54.241 --> 00:56:56.262]  What do you think of this new Attorney General?
[00:56:56.262 --> 00:56:58.264]  I think by the response we've seen that he's real.
[00:56:58.264 --> 00:56:59.545]  I think it's awesome.
[00:56:59.545 --> 00:57:00.245]  I think it's awesome.
[00:57:00.245 --> 00:57:03.207]  I think we need a clean house once and for all.
[00:57:03.207 --> 00:57:04.568]  I'm so pissed off.
[00:57:04.568 --> 00:57:07.410]  You know, I'm a registered Democrat for 34 years.
[00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:08.271]  I swear to God.
[00:57:08.271 --> 00:57:10.032]  I mean, I have my registration still.
[00:57:10.032 --> 00:57:14.455]  I vote Republican all the way down the line because of the situation that we're in.
[00:57:14.455 --> 00:57:15.436]  Attorney General?
[00:57:15.436 --> 00:57:15.736]  Awesome.
[00:57:16.176 --> 00:57:16.796]  Awesome.
[00:57:16.796 --> 00:57:18.437]  I mean, I want this guy to clean.
[00:57:18.437 --> 00:57:19.717]  They need a clean house.
[00:57:19.717 --> 00:57:29.959]  We love the president, me and my wife, my son, my family, you know, besides my mom, you know, but we, we, we, this guy, we need to clean up now.
[00:57:29.959 --> 00:57:30.699]  Well, I agree.
[00:57:30.699 --> 00:57:31.379]  I'm out of time.
[00:57:31.379 --> 00:57:32.679]  Other callers coming up.

[00:59:54.102 --> 00:59:56.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.965 --> 01:00:21.469]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:26.952]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.952 --> 01:00:34.077]  You know, I'm almost embarrassed to focus on news that's about InfoWars if it's a distraction.
[01:00:36.474 --> 01:00:49.285]  There's a form of alchemy where you can take their distraction and use it not as a teaching moment, but just as an example of what congenital liars these people are and how their tactics work, and then have it boomerang back on them.
[01:00:49.285 --> 01:00:56.651]  Plus, if we don't defeat each lie as it comes at us, it scores and then we fall.
[01:00:56.651 --> 01:00:58.713]  And I kind of have this attitude of not caring what they do to me,
[01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:08.743]  And that's a balance, but man, now they're saying that the woman, that when he wouldn't give the microphone back, that Jim Acosta was assaulted by the woman.
[01:01:08.743 --> 01:01:16.334]  First they said he didn't grab it away and push her and grab it away, because he pushes her away, then grabs it away, then grabs it away again.
[01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:21.464]  Now they're saying she assaulted him is what the video shows, and they show the exact video.
[01:01:21.464 --> 01:01:22.345]  It's like, it's like this.
[01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.747]  It's like in 1984.
[01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:29.956]  O'Brien, the inner party member, is torturing one of their propagandists, Winston Smith, just because they're jealous of him and he's smart.
[01:01:29.956 --> 01:01:31.718]  He's actually a smart guy, so they want to kill him.
[01:01:31.718 --> 01:01:33.861]  It's a form of human sacrifice.
[01:01:34.642 --> 01:01:38.545]  He explains it to Winston, he's like, it's because you are smart and really cool that we're going to torch the hell out of you.
[01:01:38.545 --> 01:01:39.887]  Make you brain dead.
[01:01:39.887 --> 01:01:41.048]  We're sick people.
[01:01:41.048 --> 01:01:42.389]  We're not making a world that's better, Winston.
[01:01:42.389 --> 01:01:44.170]  We're making a world that's worse.
[01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:46.452]  That's the whole eugenicist globalist operation.
[01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:52.437]  So he holds up two fingers after torturing him for like six months, and he finally sees whatever O'Brien wants.
[01:01:52.437 --> 01:01:55.119]  You see 10, you see 20, and he goes, oh, I get it now.
[01:01:55.119 --> 01:01:56.020]  I'm totally insane.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.342]  He goes, yes, now your mission is complete.
[01:01:58.342 --> 01:02:01.204]  We'll let you drink some gin and watch TV for a while.
[01:02:01.204 --> 01:02:02.826]  Then we're going to burn you up and kill you.
[01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:05.819]  He says, thank you.
[01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:06.659]  And that's what this is.
[01:02:06.659 --> 01:02:13.002]  This is all an exercise of, he pushes her away, he pulls back.
[01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:16.203]  We're not saying it's assault, according to Democrats it is.
[01:02:16.203 --> 01:02:20.785]  We show the footage, and they say it's fake!
[01:02:20.785 --> 01:02:24.126]  Well now they've gone, oh my God, the public hasn't bought that.
[01:02:24.126 --> 01:02:28.468]  So it's not just the view, it's coming in that, okay, she assaulted him!
[01:02:28.468 --> 01:02:29.969]  And then they show the exact footage,
[01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:35.637]  Thinking you have no memory, minute to minute to minute.
[01:02:35.637 --> 01:02:50.101]  And with five women on the scene, they create this artificial consensus idea that all five women, they're authority figures, they're on TV.
[01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:53.462]  They say now he, she should be fired.
[01:02:53.462 --> 01:02:54.883]  She assaulted him.
[01:02:54.883 --> 01:02:56.723]  It costs us making a big scene, won't go away.
[01:02:56.723 --> 01:02:58.103]  It's her job to get the mic.
[01:02:58.103 --> 01:02:59.944]  She reaches for it, he grabs it away, pushes her back.
[01:03:00.899 --> 01:03:05.023]  I mean, according to Democrats, this is like gang raping, what he did.
[01:03:05.023 --> 01:03:06.625]  This is like murdering.
[01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:11.109]  I'm not saying it is, it's still uncouth and unorderly and bad.
[01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:16.695]  But this is how they operate, and this is the subject we're talking about, so the new Attorney General and all the huge things that are happening.
[01:03:16.695 --> 01:03:21.279]  Let's go ahead and play the clip of The View here in a moment, because this is ridiculous.
[01:03:21.279 --> 01:03:21.560]  Here it is.
[01:03:23.823 --> 01:03:33.091]  When I saw that, I mean, I learned very early on that what I saw was a battery, not by Jim Acosta, but by the young White House aide.
[01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:41.318]  When you are holding something, if I may, if you're holding something and you snatch this from me, this cup is now an extension of me.
[01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:42.999]  And that means you've battered me.
[01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:43.900]  You've assaulted me.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.721]  So you're blaming the woman in this situation?
[01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:46.542]  You're blaming the woman?
[01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:46.622]  Wow.
[01:03:50.492 --> 01:03:51.412]  So the footage isn't fake now?
[01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:51.993]  No, it's her attacking.
[01:03:51.993 --> 01:03:52.233]  Oh, mom!
[01:03:52.233 --> 01:03:53.433]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:03:53.433 --> 01:03:54.514]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:03:54.514 --> 01:03:55.995]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:03:55.995 --> 01:03:57.455]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:03:57.455 --> 01:03:58.416]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:03:58.416 --> 01:03:59.296]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:03:59.296 --> 01:04:00.157]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:00.157 --> 01:04:01.197]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:01.197 --> 01:04:02.018]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:02.018 --> 01:04:02.798]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:03.738]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:03.738 --> 01:04:04.559]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:04.559 --> 01:04:05.659]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:06.740]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.580]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.581]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:08.581 --> 01:04:09.841]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:10.822]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:10.822 --> 01:04:11.622]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:11.622 --> 01:04:12.563]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:12.563 --> 01:04:14.163]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:14.163 --> 01:04:17.545]  I'm telling you what the law is.
[01:04:17.545 --> 01:04:18.946]  I'm telling you what the law
[01:04:20.051 --> 01:04:23.272]  So, ABC The View calls... That's your real headline.
[01:04:23.272 --> 01:04:30.095]  ABC News The View calls for the arrest of woman manhandled by a costume.
[01:04:30.095 --> 01:04:32.596]  Change the headline, please.
[01:04:32.596 --> 01:04:43.400]  ABC News The View, ABC's The View calls for arrest of White House aide manhandled by creepy Jim Acosta.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.042]  So now the footage is real, not fake, but
[01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:52.073]  It's an assault by her.
[01:04:52.073 --> 01:04:54.594]  Yeah, these women really care about women's rights, just like Hillary does.
[01:04:54.594 --> 01:04:58.656]  That's why she represented rapists and pedophiles.
[01:04:58.656 --> 01:05:02.619]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:05:02.619 --> 01:05:05.900]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:12.164]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:05:12.164 --> 01:05:14.946]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:19.490]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:25.977]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:05:25.977 --> 01:05:30.923]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:05:31.673 --> 01:05:35.595]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:05:35.595 --> 01:05:42.799]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:47.501]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:53.705]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:05:53.705 --> 01:05:57.687]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:06:16.283 --> 01:06:23.446]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:28.047]  We have pulled Excalibur!
[01:06:28.047 --> 01:06:34.510]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.671]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:37.671 --> 01:06:40.532]  Born and bred to take on tyranny.
[01:06:40.532 --> 01:06:42.713]  Sworn to avenge.
[01:06:42.713 --> 01:06:43.353]  Hell to pay.
[01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:44.847]  Committed!
[01:06:44.847 --> 01:06:46.808]  Ready!
[01:06:46.808 --> 01:06:47.589]  100%!
[01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:50.051]  Thankful!
[01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:51.272]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:06:51.272 --> 01:06:54.075]  We've got great, amazing guests in the studio coming up.
[01:06:54.075 --> 01:06:55.396]  You don't want to miss.
[01:06:55.396 --> 01:06:59.920]  So much more is going on, but if you just joined us, I just played The View.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.041]  And other channels are saying this.
[01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:06.465]  They're not saying that Jim Acosta didn't assault the White House aide when she tried to get the microphone back.
[01:07:06.465 --> 01:07:10.269]  They're now saying she assaulted him and are calling for her arrest.
[01:07:11.914 --> 01:07:16.818]  Man, these people have reached next level BS.
[01:07:16.818 --> 01:07:19.520]  That's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.883]  Let's talk to a caller on this subject.
[01:07:22.883 --> 01:07:25.064]  Let's talk to Brandon in Georgia.
[01:07:25.064 --> 01:07:39.596]  Again, we got all this huge stuff happening, but so illustrative that we show HD video, we zoom in on it to show it up close, and they say that's hoaxing when everyone in the world could see 10 different camera angles of the same thing.
[01:07:39.596 --> 01:07:40.877]  What are they thinking, Brandon?
[01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:53.263]  Hey, so I don't know what they're thinking, but I know Jim Acosta is the reason that I do the InfoWars Army.
[01:07:54.927 --> 01:07:56.489]  And, uh, oh, it's my first time calling.
[01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.670]  I'm a little... It's alright, Brad.
[01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:00.312]  It's cause I'm nervous.
[01:08:00.312 --> 01:08:03.795]  No, I was on this subject, and I saw you want to talk about Jim Acosta and CNN.
[01:08:03.795 --> 01:08:05.676]  But, I mean, why do they tell lies like this?
[01:08:05.676 --> 01:08:06.737]  What is the point?
[01:08:06.737 --> 01:08:08.619]  Acosta should have said, hey, she grabbed at me.
[01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:10.801]  It was reflex to push back at her.
[01:08:10.801 --> 01:08:16.466]  The reason we're doing it is they said that Corey Lewandowski basically murdered a woman by barely pushing her hand away when she grabbed him.
[01:08:17.714 --> 01:08:18.474]  It's not a big deal.
[01:08:18.474 --> 01:08:18.895]  It's okay.
[01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:20.295]  You guys got a little bit of a thing.
[01:08:20.295 --> 01:08:25.457]  The point is, by their yardstick, this is like dropping hydrogen bombs on babies.
[01:08:25.457 --> 01:08:30.160]  And so now they said, we lied about it, but now they're saying, no, she needs to be arrested.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.001]  Arrest the woman when the man overpowers them.
[01:08:33.001 --> 01:08:33.661]  That's the view.
[01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:34.942]  I appreciate your call, Brandon.
[01:08:34.942 --> 01:08:35.442]  God bless you.
[01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:37.892]  I understand you're nervous.
[01:08:37.892 --> 01:08:39.053]  It's okay, we'll let you call back.
[01:08:39.053 --> 01:08:42.054]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois.
[01:08:42.054 --> 01:08:42.794]  You're on the air.
[01:08:42.794 --> 01:08:43.414]  Go ahead.
[01:08:43.414 --> 01:08:51.557]  We got a new acting Attorney General and the Deep State has launched 900 Antifa groups swearing to go to people's houses and intimidate them.
[01:08:51.557 --> 01:09:00.040]  Antifa, again, is just a cover group for the Deep State and actual assassination teams the Deep State is looking at actually using.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.202]  But the real assassination teams are watching those teams, so this could be a very explosive moment in history, my friend.
[01:09:05.202 --> 01:09:05.502]  Go ahead.
[01:09:07.355 --> 01:09:09.576]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:09.576 --> 01:09:10.397]  Truth.
[01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:12.077]  There's truth in their error.
[01:09:12.077 --> 01:09:14.759]  Truth mixed with error is still error.
[01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:24.584]  So, first of all, with this QAnon thing, those of us who were kind of sucked in by it need to have the humility to understand that we need to learn from this.
[01:09:24.584 --> 01:09:27.925]  I mean, that's sort of my opinion on that.
[01:09:27.925 --> 01:09:37.010]  And on the other thing, do you think, I think this Acosta thing, you're trying to keep this in the news cycle, you know, is a big distraction.
[01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:43.859]  Basically, from all the stuff that's going on and all, you know, and Trump going on offense so aggressively.
[01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:44.659]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:09:44.659 --> 01:10:01.652]  The whole show should be Trump's on offense, his new AG, who is he, what has he said, why are they sending out 900 Antifa teams to harass people, when I've already predicted that's the precursor for the real physical attacks, which means they may be preparing to kill the President.
[01:10:01.652 --> 01:10:02.713]  Correct, I agree with that.
[01:10:02.713 --> 01:10:06.396]  And, you know, is there a way to juxtapose the video of Lewandowski
[01:10:07.012 --> 01:10:17.657]  With the ACOSTA video and sort of push that out there, you know, because whenever they act completely ridiculous, you know, it's obviously acceptable.
[01:10:17.657 --> 01:10:32.043]  And then now that they're kind of trying to flip the script and charge this woman with assault on ACOSTA, I mean, it's just... The good news is I really think the same people that are left in this world are not buying any of this, you know?
[01:10:33.473 --> 01:10:44.716]  Well that's it, and I'm not even mad at The View, I'm ashamed as an American that we have a show with like 8 million viewers or whatever, 5 million viewers, depending on the day, saying this woman assaulted him.
[01:10:44.716 --> 01:10:51.198]  We're not even saying that he assaulted her, we're just saying that he's lying, he did push on her, and he did grab at her.
[01:10:52.078 --> 01:10:55.920]  It's just, there's no, again, they will drop women like an old shoe.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.381]  These so-called feminists do not care about women.
[01:10:58.381 --> 01:10:59.922]  They want to control you.
[01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:00.723]  I care about women.
[01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:01.483]  I care about men.
[01:11:01.483 --> 01:11:03.984]  I care about black people, white people, everybody.
[01:11:03.984 --> 01:11:04.745]  I love everybody.
[01:11:04.745 --> 01:11:06.966]  I mean, I don't like virtue signal.
[01:11:06.966 --> 01:11:09.267]  I got three daughters.
[01:11:09.267 --> 01:11:14.710]  I saw the media put out reports saying Jones says his daughters can't have professional jobs.
[01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:15.490]  Never said that.
[01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:18.532]  I hope my daughters become rocket scientists for the president.
[01:11:18.532 --> 01:11:20.492]  But this is what they project on us.
[01:11:20.492 --> 01:11:21.173]  God bless you, Chris.
[01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:27.314]  Good points.
[01:11:27.314 --> 01:11:29.916]  We're in a civil war right now, okay?
[01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:42.487]  And I said this on air, not just from my own research, but from Intel, that the Antifa groups publicly work for Soros and work for Holder and the Deep State, and that they want them to get demonized, actually.
[01:11:42.487 --> 01:11:48.992]  They don't know they're part of this, to go out to people's houses and identify them so they can later kill who they want and blame Antifa.
[01:11:50.536 --> 01:11:53.718]  If they decide to decapitate Trump.
[01:11:53.718 --> 01:12:04.626]  And so, the fact that they're now doing this and going to everybody's houses and by tonight, because these cowards always show up at night, 900 targets.
[01:12:04.626 --> 01:12:14.933]  They're hitting 900 targets directed by MoveOn.org, who's the main funder of that, you guessed it, Mr. Rotten Face, George Soros.
[01:12:16.215 --> 01:12:17.616]  So it's on, folks.
[01:12:17.616 --> 01:12:18.616]  This is it.
[01:12:18.616 --> 01:12:19.597]  Trump's dropping the hammer.
[01:12:19.597 --> 01:12:20.557]  Everybody wanted it.
[01:12:20.557 --> 01:12:21.317]  You got it.
[01:12:21.317 --> 01:12:22.398]  And Sessions is gone.
[01:12:22.398 --> 01:12:22.938]  And we were right.
[01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:23.758]  He was bad.
[01:12:23.758 --> 01:12:24.599]  Boom!
[01:12:24.599 --> 01:12:28.140]  Deal with it.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.981]  Obviously, they're going to try to infiltrate our movement.
[01:12:29.981 --> 01:12:32.322]  Obviously, they're going to try to discredit the real patriots.
[01:12:32.322 --> 01:12:34.743]  And they did it with QAnon.
[01:12:34.743 --> 01:12:42.247]  So don't listen to the next magic bot that doesn't have skin in the game, that hasn't been around 20 years, that has no track record.
[01:12:42.247 --> 01:12:44.888]  All we've got is a track record of delivering.
[01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:54.002]  And it's not about being up here going, oh look, we delivered, we're right, we're so smart.
[01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:58.382]  It's about, dude, they're trying to destroy us because we're sending the truthful signal.
[01:12:58.382 --> 01:13:01.963]  We're broadcasting the coordinates of victory.
[01:13:01.963 --> 01:13:04.344]  And if people just get that, it's over for them.
[01:13:04.344 --> 01:13:12.025]  If our talking points go mainstream, which is starting to happen, it's over for the globalists.
[01:13:12.025 --> 01:13:16.466]  Mega banks, tax exempt, with diplomatic immunity and all the rest of us are poor.
[01:13:17.904 --> 01:13:21.747]  And the elites say we're obsolete?
[01:13:21.747 --> 01:13:23.708]  That doesn't sound like a very good sales plan.
[01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:28.352]  You're all scum, you're idiots, we're gonna steal your money and then kill you.
[01:13:28.352 --> 01:13:31.694]  My political ideology is not trying to be part of the elite.
[01:13:31.694 --> 01:13:33.295]  Because you're not elite.
[01:13:33.295 --> 01:13:35.637]  I get around these globalists, I feel empty inside.
[01:13:35.637 --> 01:13:38.179]  I get around average real people, I feel strong.
[01:13:38.179 --> 01:13:40.300]  So, it's a pleasure.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:46.545]  It's like Tony Montana, when they say, okay, we'll get you a green card if you kill this communist, he goes, I'll kill the communist for free.
[01:13:47.537 --> 01:13:48.538]  And he does.
[01:13:48.538 --> 01:13:49.258]  And I'm the same way.
[01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.860]  It's like, this is a pleasure.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.323]  I mean, it's a pleasure to die for freedom.
[01:13:54.323 --> 01:13:54.963]  I don't want to die.
[01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:55.644]  I want to live forever.
[01:13:55.644 --> 01:14:00.288]  The point is, it's a pleasure.
[01:14:00.288 --> 01:14:03.510]  You give me a green card, I'll carve him up real nice.
[01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.192]  See the difference?
[01:14:05.192 --> 01:14:07.974]  I want to defeat them.
[01:14:07.974 --> 01:14:09.695]  I kill the commons for fun.
[01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.718]  For a green card, I'm going to carve him up real nice.
[01:14:16.343 --> 01:14:20.464]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Arkansas.
[01:14:20.464 --> 01:14:21.385]  Chuck, thanks for calling.
[01:14:21.385 --> 01:14:24.105]  You're on the air.
[01:14:24.105 --> 01:14:24.606]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:24.606 --> 01:14:25.526]  I'm a big fan.
[01:14:25.526 --> 01:14:26.706]  First time caller.
[01:14:26.706 --> 01:14:27.326]  God bless.
[01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:31.728]  And since we got a new AG, how about if we have some new policy?
[01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:38.790]  A second special counsel to finally go after all of the criminal behavior by the Democrats.
[01:14:40.293 --> 01:14:41.834]  Oh, I say go on the total.
[01:14:41.834 --> 01:14:42.734]  I said this.
[01:14:42.734 --> 01:14:46.436]  Trump must go on a total warpath, a total crusade.
[01:14:46.436 --> 01:14:47.857]  They did it with all made-up crap.
[01:14:47.857 --> 01:14:49.277]  They are the real colluders.
[01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:50.498]  They're the real foreign influence.
[01:14:50.498 --> 01:14:51.418]  They're the censors.
[01:14:51.418 --> 01:14:52.979]  Go thermonuclear!
[01:14:52.979 --> 01:14:54.460]  You have the executive!
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.902]  Annihilate or be annihilated!
[01:14:58.902 --> 01:15:05.065]  Well, he should also go after special tech or high tech with all the meddling they did in this election.
[01:15:05.925 --> 01:15:08.427]  And all the deplatforming.
[01:15:08.427 --> 01:15:13.712]  I mean, just, we've got two months before they bring in the new, uh, the new crew.
[01:15:13.712 --> 01:15:15.694]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:15:15.694 --> 01:15:19.757]  They're activating their terror teams because Trump's taking the gloves off, brother.
[01:15:19.757 --> 01:15:20.238]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:20.238 --> 01:15:21.219]  Everybody better get ready.
[01:15:23.703 --> 01:15:26.505]  Do you think he's going to do that?
[01:15:26.505 --> 01:15:29.267]  He's going to do it all and more.
[01:15:29.267 --> 01:15:30.648]  I hope so.
[01:15:30.648 --> 01:15:33.330]  He gave them the path of backing off and getting out of the way.
[01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:36.852]  Now they've chosen the path of pain.
[01:15:36.852 --> 01:15:39.634]  Now they've chosen the path of war.
[01:15:39.634 --> 01:15:40.875]  And guess what?
[01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.796]  Those that know war don't want war.
[01:15:42.796 --> 01:15:45.058]  But when war comes, we wage war.
[01:15:45.058 --> 01:15:47.239]  War is now coming into orbit.
[01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:48.820]  Mars is here.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:49.461]  Stay with us.

[01:15:51.803 --> 01:15:52.263]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.603 --> 01:16:01.204]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[01:16:01.204 --> 01:16:08.586]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[01:16:08.586 --> 01:16:13.467]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:14.307]  There is.
[01:16:14.307 --> 01:16:15.887]  It's RightSocial.net.

[01:19:06.796 --> 01:19:08.257]  Believe me, I know.
[01:19:08.257 --> 01:19:12.982]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:17.966]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com I still have that energy.

[01:19:46.519 --> 01:19:51.523]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:19:51.523 --> 01:19:54.245]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:19:54.245 --> 01:20:01.511]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:04.173]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.825 --> 01:20:29.164]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting to the world wide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.844 --> 01:20:48.976]  Well, you know, Amy Owens-Troyer is riding shotgun with us, and Michael Graves, who I've been a big fan of for decades, former Misfits lead singer, and has sold out shows across the world, got cancelled in England because he dared tweet Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones tweets.
[01:20:48.976 --> 01:20:49.977]  He's riding shotgun with us.
[01:20:49.977 --> 01:20:54.019]  You guys are doing a flag laying ceremony this weekend, but out of the gates.
[01:20:54.019 --> 01:20:56.321]  I was literally during the break, didn't even talk to you guys.
[01:20:56.321 --> 01:20:56.981]  Front and center.
[01:20:57.992 --> 01:21:07.963]  All this stuff going on, Antifa going to folks' houses, Soros saying go to everybody's houses, 900 of them, they're talking about violence, killing Republicans, killing Trump.
[01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:10.105]  They're so scared of this new AG.
[01:21:10.105 --> 01:21:14.469]  You've got Ginsburg breaking her ribs, and so they say she could be gone in a month or two.
[01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:17.052]  I mean, she looks like the Crypt Keeper.
[01:21:17.052 --> 01:21:19.394]  Just everything, it seems, is accelerating.
[01:21:19.394 --> 01:21:20.115]  It's like a quickening.
[01:21:20.115 --> 01:21:20.736]  What would you call it?
[01:21:23.152 --> 01:21:25.272]  I think, exactly, it's a quickening.
[01:21:25.272 --> 01:21:37.494]  I mean, for people that have been paying attention, like myself, we've seen that this is all culminating exactly as you've said it would culminate.
[01:21:37.494 --> 01:21:42.375]  It's been building to this, and it's dangerous out there.
[01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:45.416]  It's crazy out there.
[01:21:45.416 --> 01:21:45.856]  Exactly.
[01:21:45.856 --> 01:21:49.697]  I don't even feel like I should also... It's so crazy, I feel like I could be on air.
[01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:51.917]  It feels weird to even talk about it, like it's about action.
[01:21:52.878 --> 01:21:56.941]  No, I agree, Alex, but a certain level, I'm not surprised by any of it.
[01:21:56.941 --> 01:21:59.743]  I mean, if you light a stick of dynamite, it's gonna blow up.
[01:21:59.743 --> 01:22:03.907]  I mean, you know, so this was inevitably gonna happen at some point in time.
[01:22:03.907 --> 01:22:04.948]  I'm just honestly stunned.
[01:22:04.948 --> 01:22:08.050]  I mean, we've seen the lengths that the fake news would go to.
[01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:11.173]  We've seen the lengths that the left will go to to lie and deceive.
[01:22:11.173 --> 01:22:12.634]  This is truly next level.
[01:22:12.634 --> 01:22:16.437]  I mean, this is beyond... They say we faked the video of Acosta!
[01:22:16.437 --> 01:22:17.097]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:22:17.097 --> 01:22:19.759]  So you're basically, at this point, assuming that
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.923]  You can play the same video, the exact same video twice, and say, see?
[01:22:24.923 --> 01:22:25.924]  That one's doctored.
[01:22:25.924 --> 01:22:27.605]  It's literally the same video.
[01:22:27.605 --> 01:22:30.066]  And I don't know if they're that stupid on The View.
[01:22:30.066 --> 01:22:32.508]  I don't know if they assume their audience is that stupid.
[01:22:32.508 --> 01:22:33.209]  I don't know what it is.
[01:22:33.209 --> 01:22:33.989]  Michael, what's going on?
[01:22:33.989 --> 01:22:34.490]  You're a showman.
[01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:36.211]  You're a smart guy at the top of your game.
[01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:37.992]  What is this attempt just to see?
[01:22:37.992 --> 01:22:39.153]  It's like a mind control test.
[01:22:40.376 --> 01:22:44.301]  It's look at the left hand as the right hand is doing something else.
[01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:53.572]  The left and the progressives that are paying attention to this, they clearly see what reality is and what happened with Jim Acosta.
[01:22:53.572 --> 01:22:57.857]  But then you have all their other minions, these crazy women on the view say, oh,
[01:23:00.079 --> 01:23:07.264]  Now it was, it was Jim Acosta that got, that got, uh, you know, uh, roughed up.
[01:23:07.264 --> 01:23:11.627]  And then everyone on the left goes, yeah, that's what happened, I seen it, yeah!
[01:23:11.627 --> 01:23:14.509]  And it's the same video, they were just saying spank.
[01:23:14.509 --> 01:23:15.950]  Right, I, yeah.
[01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:24.376]  Meanwhile, they're about to activate their Antifa thugs or whoever else, I mean, you can put whatever name you want on it, violent leftists.
[01:23:24.376 --> 01:23:25.416]  They're about to activate them.
[01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:27.998]  We saw it at Tucker Carlson's last night, it's only gonna get worse.
[01:23:27.998 --> 01:23:28.899]  So behind the scenes,
[01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:42.959]  They're up here trying to protect their corrupt establishment government, and they've got these people so brainwashed, they don't even understand how they're literally foot soldiers of the most criminal cabal in world history.
[01:23:42.959 --> 01:23:45.661]  The world has shrunk thanks to technology.
[01:23:45.661 --> 01:23:49.424]  These are the greatest criminals in world history, Alex.
[01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:52.506]  Mueller, the Clintons, the Obama administration's crimes.
[01:23:52.506 --> 01:23:57.410]  These are the biggest criminals, George Soros, in world history.
[01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:58.691]  People ask, why is it so crazy?
[01:23:59.091 --> 01:23:59.451]  I don't know.
[01:24:23.778 --> 01:24:44.727]  Again, what's happened is all of these people that have been put in this bubble, and again, why InfoWars is being taken off the map in silence, so that that stream, that reality, that stream of consciousness, the truth that you need for your eyes to be open and see, is those people are shut away from it.
[01:24:44.727 --> 01:24:46.067]  They're taken away from the light.
[01:24:46.067 --> 01:24:47.108]  They don't want that confirmation.
[01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.190]  But this is like, I mean this is really a spiritual battle Alex.
[01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:52.652]  I don't know how else to explain this.
[01:24:52.652 --> 01:24:58.257]  I even had a friend of mine send me a text like, now you guys are editing videos to make people look bad and I'm just like...
[01:25:07.785 --> 01:25:09.506]  How do you fall for this?
[01:25:09.506 --> 01:25:14.847]  There is a spiritual frequency right now between good and evil and you're tuned in to either one.
[01:25:14.847 --> 01:25:15.948]  You cannot miss it anymore.
[01:25:15.948 --> 01:25:17.108]  There's no middle ground.
[01:25:17.108 --> 01:25:20.649]  You're either on the frequency of good or you're on the frequency of evil.
[01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:21.730]  There's no middle ground.
[01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:23.030]  There's no open spaces.
[01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.670]  It's all clear.
[01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:25.811]  Or versus good and evil, how about sane-insane?
[01:25:26.731 --> 01:25:28.812]  I don't even know... That's part of that.
[01:25:28.812 --> 01:25:30.972]  That's just one element of the frequency.
[01:25:30.972 --> 01:25:37.153]  But I just look at this... And of course it's all a distraction for what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:25:37.153 --> 01:25:44.015]  They don't want people to know that behind the scenes Trump is actually trying to put a bunch of child traffickers in jail that have been running government since the last... And he's been doing it.
[01:25:44.015 --> 01:25:46.495]  Yeah, he just had actually a bust here in Texas.
[01:25:46.495 --> 01:25:47.976]  They arrested 75 people.
[01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:48.936]  They saved 5 victims.
[01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:53.217]  Mainstream media goes, oh Trump claims they're busting, even though they're up like a thousand percent.
[01:25:53.217 --> 01:25:54.517]  There is no child trafficking.
[01:25:55.157 --> 01:25:56.238]  Michael Graves, let me ask you this.
[01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:59.379]  What do you think the globalists, their minions, do next?
[01:25:59.379 --> 01:26:01.360]  They seem so scared now.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.662]  We've got a new AG, two months until they try to confirm him.
[01:26:04.662 --> 01:26:06.903]  Trump's got to move now, but they are so scared.
[01:26:06.903 --> 01:26:08.303]  Gut level, what do you think they're going to pull next?
[01:26:08.303 --> 01:26:09.104]  Because they've already gone to...
[01:26:10.187 --> 01:26:12.888]  Level 11, like spinal tapping crazy.
[01:26:12.888 --> 01:26:14.289]  I think the rats are cornered.
[01:26:14.289 --> 01:26:16.370]  They know that they're cornered.
[01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:24.613]  And it's absolutely terrifying, Alex, what happened to Tucker Carlson this morning.
[01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:26.434]  They were trying to bust in the door.
[01:26:26.434 --> 01:26:28.695]  Can you imagine that?
[01:26:28.695 --> 01:26:29.536]  But think about this.
[01:26:29.536 --> 01:26:30.196]  I'd go crazy.
[01:26:30.196 --> 01:26:32.377]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:26:32.377 --> 01:26:33.297]  The same response.
[01:26:33.297 --> 01:26:37.019]  Honestly, in that situation, the same response is to shoot those people.
[01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:40.340]  And I'm sorry, and they're going to say on Media Matters that I'm calling for violence.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:41.321]  No, I'm not!
[01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:47.803]  If someone comes to your house and is threatening your family, it is a human instinct to kill!
[01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:53.126]  Well, they're all around knocking down part of the door, saying, we know where you sleep, and it's his wife alone.
[01:26:53.126 --> 01:26:57.988]  The night before, reportedly, it's in the news, but they've talked about it before, their kids were alone there.
[01:26:57.988 --> 01:26:58.488]  They went out to dinner.
[01:26:59.048 --> 01:27:00.149]  What if your kids are alone?
[01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:05.032]  There's like 40 people banging on your windows and saying, we're going to get you, we know you're in there.
[01:27:05.032 --> 01:27:08.294]  I mean, the normal thing is either hide or attack.
[01:27:08.294 --> 01:27:09.735]  Well, they're just going to keep doing it, Alex.
[01:27:09.735 --> 01:27:14.057]  What would have happened if Tucker was there and the guy tries to knock his door down and Tucker would have kicked his ass?
[01:27:14.057 --> 01:27:18.020]  But see, that's what they want.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.881]  They want someone to shoot one of these people.
[01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:21.622]  So what you're saying, Michael, is they're going to escalate.
[01:27:22.202 --> 01:27:28.064]  Absolutely, I mean look, they're saying that Paul Joseph Watson's edited this video.
[01:27:28.064 --> 01:27:32.186]  When clearly, anyone that has eyes can see that it isn't.
[01:27:32.186 --> 01:27:41.470]  So now when it escalates to violence, they're kicking in someone's door and someone's defending themselves or some sort of confrontation on the street and it goes down.
[01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:43.372]  What do you think they're going to say?
[01:27:43.372 --> 01:27:44.514]  They're going to blame us.
[01:27:44.514 --> 01:27:46.276]  They're going to blame the Patriots.
[01:27:46.276 --> 01:27:49.361]  Because all they have to do is say, oh yeah, this phone is green.
[01:27:49.361 --> 01:27:51.104]  And they go, yeah, the phone's green!
[01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:52.206]  And they believe it.
[01:27:52.206 --> 01:27:56.232]  That's like, you've got a huge, long, blue hair.
[01:27:56.232 --> 01:27:56.692]  You don't.
[01:27:57.571 --> 01:27:58.292]  No, I heard it!
[01:27:58.292 --> 01:27:59.052]  I don't have a beard!
[01:27:59.052 --> 01:28:00.654]  He has beautiful blue hair!
[01:28:00.654 --> 01:28:01.755]  I heard it on CNN!
[01:28:01.755 --> 01:28:03.637]  Michael Raves has long blue hair!
[01:28:03.637 --> 01:28:04.658]  True!
[01:28:04.658 --> 01:28:06.199]  CNN said so!
[01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:09.622]  And CNN also said you must kill people with blue hair, so now I know what to do.
[01:28:09.622 --> 01:28:12.004]  And if you don't believe us, you're crazy!
[01:28:13.626 --> 01:28:20.031]  This is the sad part, and this is why the restraint conservatives have and Republicans have is so key, Alex.
[01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:23.033]  I mean, they already tried to kill Steve Scalise and other Republicans at the base program.
[01:28:23.033 --> 01:28:23.714]  Ran Paul's ribs.
[01:28:23.714 --> 01:28:26.696]  Yeah, Ran Paul's been attacked multiple times.
[01:28:26.696 --> 01:28:29.218]  They confront these people in restaurants.
[01:28:29.218 --> 01:28:30.579]  They are pushing.
[01:28:30.579 --> 01:28:32.981]  They are pushing for someone to fire the first shot.
[01:28:32.981 --> 01:28:35.002]  Thank God conservatives have restraint.
[01:28:35.002 --> 01:28:40.687]  Thank God we aren't retaliating with the actual force that we should be retaliating with.
[01:28:41.907 --> 01:28:43.288]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:43.288 --> 01:28:45.249]  Right now, it's just American vs. Globalist.
[01:28:45.249 --> 01:28:46.229]  This country's under attack.
[01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:47.850]  Michael Graves is our guest.
[01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:50.431]  We also have Owen Schroer in here in the studio with us.
[01:28:50.431 --> 01:28:51.472]  So much more coming up.
[01:28:51.472 --> 01:28:52.352]  Matt Bracken as well.
[01:28:52.352 --> 01:28:53.052]  And your phone calls.
[01:28:53.052 --> 01:28:54.333]  Whatever you do, share these live links.
[01:28:57.603 --> 01:29:02.386]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:29:02.386 --> 01:29:08.269]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:29:08.269 --> 01:29:14.772]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:29:14.772 --> 01:29:18.815]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:29:18.815 --> 01:29:25.078]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[01:29:25.078 --> 01:29:26.819]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[01:29:27.359 --> 01:29:33.701]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:36.743]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:29:36.743 --> 01:29:42.665]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:29:42.665 --> 01:29:46.466]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:29:46.466 --> 01:29:47.727]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:29:47.727 --> 01:29:49.067]  Who do we fight for?
[01:29:49.067 --> 01:29:55.269]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:29:55.269 --> 01:29:56.710]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:09.117]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:30:09.117 --> 01:30:11.179]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:30:11.179 --> 01:30:14.061]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:30:14.061 --> 01:30:15.543]  It's made in the USA.
[01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:22.369]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:30:22.369 --> 01:30:23.630]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:30:24.431 --> 01:30:34.135]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[01:33:18.307 --> 01:33:19.468]  Big Brother.
[01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:20.809]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:20.809 --> 01:33:23.130]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:24.851]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:24.851 --> 01:33:26.572]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.572 --> 01:33:28.933]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:28.933 --> 01:33:31.334]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:31.334 --> 01:33:35.837]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.837 --> 01:33:36.077]  Well!
[01:33:38.917 --> 01:33:43.119]  We've got the new acting Attorney General for at least two months.
[01:33:43.119 --> 01:33:52.184]  He's already said, day one, that he is not going to recuse himself from the fake Russiagate investigation, as if he's involved in it.
[01:33:52.184 --> 01:33:55.926]  And he's not going to take a congressional subpoena as the president, because it's a separation of powers.
[01:33:55.926 --> 01:34:00.528]  And he says Hillary should be indicted from all the evidence he's seen.
[01:34:00.528 --> 01:34:04.510]  Meanwhile, the InfoWars White House pipeline is alive and well, says Media Matters.
[01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:08.372]  You type in InfoWars.com, Alex Jones, Paul Watson, it's on every channel.
[01:34:10.276 --> 01:34:29.842]  Again, it's the boldness to say that we put a fake video out of Jim Acosta, which is a distraction from everything, but then it's how bold they are to simultaneously say that we put out a fake video, but then to also have other channels, like you said, The View, saying that, oh, actually, she assaulted him.
[01:34:29.842 --> 01:34:31.383]  This is really weird.
[01:34:31.383 --> 01:34:33.063]  This is bizarre.
[01:34:33.063 --> 01:34:36.144]  Let's get into the Attorney General and then go to some calls, but also this.
[01:34:36.144 --> 01:34:37.685]  What do you think the method here is?
[01:34:37.685 --> 01:34:38.085]  They just lie?
[01:34:40.043 --> 01:34:46.786]  Well, I think that as spirits of good are rising, the spirit of evil is going to lash out.
[01:34:46.786 --> 01:34:48.487]  And that's basically what you're seeing, Alex.
[01:34:48.487 --> 01:34:53.529]  I mean, as the demons are getting exposed, they're exposing themselves as demons.
[01:34:53.529 --> 01:35:03.613]  I mean, nobody in their right mind watches that video of Jim Acosta and says, oh my gosh, he just got battered by that young girl who weighs like, what, 90 pounds?
[01:35:03.613 --> 01:35:04.233]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:35:04.233 --> 01:35:04.914]  And it's her job!
[01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:07.154]  He won't give the mic back.
[01:35:07.154 --> 01:35:07.794]  You're supposed to take it.
[01:35:07.794 --> 01:35:09.175]  You can tell, like, her face.
[01:35:09.175 --> 01:35:09.995]  She's stunned.
[01:35:09.995 --> 01:35:10.555]  Here's the issue.
[01:35:10.555 --> 01:35:15.096]  They first... It's the 1984 deal.
[01:35:15.096 --> 01:35:16.136]  They're saying it's fake.
[01:35:16.136 --> 01:35:17.656]  Now they're playing it, saying it's real.
[01:35:17.656 --> 01:35:26.098]  But let's remember, Jim Acosta has been acting like a petulant child during these White House briefings for almost two years.
[01:35:26.098 --> 01:35:28.478]  So he's been trying to get banned.
[01:35:28.478 --> 01:35:32.359]  He's been intentionally acting like a jackass to try to get banned.
[01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:33.779]  So he finally got what he wanted.
[01:35:34.219 --> 01:35:38.040]  Acting like an immature jackass, and Trump finally did what he had to do and ban him.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.801]  But you notice how small Jim Acosta is?
[01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:45.342]  He'll hit that woman trying to grab the microphone, but when Trump steps away from the podium, he folds like a cheap tent.
[01:35:45.342 --> 01:35:46.443]  Oh, that's part of the video, too.
[01:35:46.443 --> 01:35:49.984]  Like, he's so scared of Trump, when Trump starts walking towards him, he, like, hides.
[01:35:49.984 --> 01:35:51.344]  Yeah, he folds like a cheap tent.
[01:35:53.517 --> 01:35:55.258]  But the 90-year-old girl, the 90-year-old girl...
[01:36:08.985 --> 01:36:15.468]  I challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms.
[01:36:15.468 --> 01:36:16.869]  Here we go.
[01:36:16.869 --> 01:36:21.010]  Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:22.591]  I consider it to be an invasion.
[01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:24.792]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[01:36:24.792 --> 01:36:30.655]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[01:36:30.655 --> 01:36:33.236]  Thank you for telling me that.
[01:36:33.236 --> 01:36:35.177]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[01:36:35.797 --> 01:36:38.159]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:39.459]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[01:36:39.459 --> 01:36:43.082]  But do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election?
[01:36:43.082 --> 01:36:43.642]  Not at all.
[01:36:43.642 --> 01:36:44.262]  No, not at all.
[01:36:44.262 --> 01:36:46.964]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally.
[01:36:46.964 --> 01:36:49.366]  You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process.
[01:36:49.366 --> 01:36:50.966]  I want it to be a process.
[01:36:50.966 --> 01:36:52.287]  And I want people to come in.
[01:36:52.287 --> 01:36:53.148]  And we need the people.
[01:36:53.148 --> 01:36:53.688]  Your campaign...
[01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:57.050]  You know why we need the people, don't you?
[01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:59.271]  Because we have hundreds of companies moving in.
[01:36:59.271 --> 01:37:00.371]  We need the people.
[01:37:00.371 --> 01:37:04.493]  But your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[01:37:04.493 --> 01:37:05.613]  Well, that's true.
[01:37:05.613 --> 01:37:06.353]  But they weren't actors.
[01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.314]  They're not going to be doing that.
[01:37:07.314 --> 01:37:08.254]  They weren't actors.
[01:37:08.254 --> 01:37:09.214]  Well, no, it's true.
[01:37:09.214 --> 01:37:10.535]  Do you think they were actors?
[01:37:10.535 --> 01:37:11.255]  They weren't actors.
[01:37:11.255 --> 01:37:13.076]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[01:37:13.076 --> 01:37:14.516]  These were people, this was an actual
[01:37:16.661 --> 01:37:21.064]  You know, it happened a few days ago, and, uh... They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[01:37:21.064 --> 01:37:22.285]  They're hundreds of miles away.
[01:37:22.285 --> 01:37:23.106]  They're waving foreign flags!
[01:37:23.106 --> 01:37:24.447]  That's not an invasion, that's not an invasion.
[01:37:24.447 --> 01:37:27.829]  Throwing rocks at helicopters, saying that they're coming to take us down.
[01:37:27.829 --> 01:37:28.390]  Hit pause real quick.
[01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:29.070]  Back for some 10 seconds.
[01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:30.271]  I want you to make that point.
[01:37:30.271 --> 01:37:31.532]  It's the same gaslighting, though.
[01:37:32.771 --> 01:37:34.392]  No, he never touched the girl.
[01:37:34.392 --> 01:37:35.472]  She assaulted him now.
[01:37:35.472 --> 01:37:36.873]  It's all on video, the opposite.
[01:37:36.873 --> 01:37:38.533]  And now, there's no migrant caravan.
[01:37:38.533 --> 01:37:41.515]  There's no... I mean, what is... These people, you know what it is?
[01:37:41.515 --> 01:37:42.755]  They're crazy.
[01:37:42.755 --> 01:37:47.357]  Jim Acosta believes he controls reality, and that's why CNN, everybody hates him.
[01:37:47.357 --> 01:37:50.518]  Because they are the gold standard of fake news, Mr. Graves.
[01:37:50.518 --> 01:37:52.259]  Lies, lies, lies.
[01:37:52.259 --> 01:37:54.720]  Just lies.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.781]  That whole exchange was just lies.
[01:37:57.961 --> 01:37:58.982]  It's not an invasion.
[01:37:58.982 --> 01:38:00.563]  It's a migrant caravan.
[01:38:00.563 --> 01:38:01.824]  It's not coming.
[01:38:01.824 --> 01:38:03.185]  It's hundreds of miles away.
[01:38:03.185 --> 01:38:05.928]  Yeah, they're not climbing fences.
[01:38:05.928 --> 01:38:08.189]  My fist isn't coming!
[01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:09.390]  They're not climbing walls.
[01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:11.292]  There's just video showing them climbing walls.
[01:38:11.292 --> 01:38:13.473]  They're not throwing rocks at helicopters.
[01:38:13.473 --> 01:38:15.435]  They're just throwing rocks at helicopters!
[01:38:15.635 --> 01:38:16.616]  And police.
[01:38:16.616 --> 01:38:24.081]  And police and saying that they're coming to confront the police and that they want in.
[01:38:24.081 --> 01:38:25.982]  They don't want to be Americans.
[01:38:25.982 --> 01:38:27.303]  They don't want to come in here.
[01:38:27.303 --> 01:38:32.087]  Because they were handpicked by the UN and Soros at those camps.
[01:38:32.087 --> 01:38:32.547]  Exactly.
[01:38:35.202 --> 01:38:36.183]  Here's what CNN's doing.
[01:38:36.183 --> 01:38:36.943]  No one watches him.
[01:38:36.943 --> 01:38:37.864]  They're being disruptive.
[01:38:37.864 --> 01:38:42.047]  So if Acosta goes, the sky's not blue at high noon, we all debate it with him.
[01:38:42.047 --> 01:38:43.087]  I think that's their final deal.
[01:38:43.087 --> 01:38:46.430]  But the problem is, as long as they're at the White House briefings, they can keep doing this.
[01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:49.372]  Well, that's why Trump finally gave him the boot.
[01:38:49.372 --> 01:38:50.752]  Long overdue.
[01:38:50.752 --> 01:38:51.393]  Long overdue.
[01:38:52.813 --> 01:38:54.995]  And then Fox News, can we queue that up?
[01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:57.097]  I keep going back to this, not because it's about us.
[01:38:57.097 --> 01:39:00.520]  It's the top story, not the mass shooting, not the AG fired.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.245]  I go out there, the top story in the country is that we faked this video!
[01:39:05.245 --> 01:39:06.866]  On my children, we did not!
[01:39:06.866 --> 01:39:11.471]  Paul Watson put a clip up and zoomed in on it, which is normal!
[01:39:11.471 --> 01:39:14.333]  But that's not why I don't even care about me!
[01:39:14.333 --> 01:39:16.535]  What Twilight Zone episode am I in?
[01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:26.097]  Well, we're at the center of the top news again, and they're saying something that openly happened didn't happen, and then here's even Fox News acting like we made it up.
[01:39:26.097 --> 01:39:26.458]  Here it is.
[01:39:26.971 --> 01:39:27.912]  They're all defending Acosta.
[01:39:27.912 --> 01:39:29.053]  To the super clown Jim Acosta.
[01:39:29.053 --> 01:39:29.693]  Now here's the good part.
[01:39:54.062 --> 01:40:02.067]  Yeah, I think it's a misstep on the part of the White House to claim that Jim Acosta was laying his hands on this young intern and tried to take the mic away.
[01:40:02.067 --> 01:40:03.608]  The contact was very incidental.
[01:40:03.608 --> 01:40:13.755]  I also think it was a misstep for Sarah Sanders to tweet out a doctored video put out by InfoWars, the Alex Jones conspiracy site, that kind of made it look more aggressive than it was.
[01:40:13.755 --> 01:40:17.658]  The conspiracy site, as he spreads a conspiracy about a doctored video.
[01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:20.446]  That's what you get on Fox News.
[01:40:20.446 --> 01:40:23.148]  That's why people are waking up to who Fox News really is.
[01:40:23.148 --> 01:40:24.188]  They never cared about you being here.
[01:40:24.188 --> 01:40:35.753]  But it's the defending Acosta, like you said, is this rabid clown who runs around all day everywhere doing this, and then now the girl's the bad person.
[01:40:35.753 --> 01:40:36.593]  My mind is blown.
[01:40:36.593 --> 01:40:39.994]  I know that we're going to break here, but this is all over the news.
[01:40:39.994 --> 01:40:40.915]  This is the top story.
[01:40:40.915 --> 01:40:46.337]  Meanwhile, again, the truth is, it's demonstrable that
[01:40:47.386 --> 01:40:49.468]  That violence is happening.
[01:40:49.468 --> 01:40:50.929]  We are on the cusp.
[01:40:50.929 --> 01:40:54.892]  Like you said, there's 900 people have been doxxed.
[01:40:54.892 --> 01:40:56.333]  Their addresses are out there.
[01:40:56.333 --> 01:40:57.975]  These people are being activated.
[01:40:57.975 --> 01:40:58.495]  They're activating.
[01:40:58.495 --> 01:41:01.237]  They're being activated and they're coming for us.
[01:41:01.237 --> 01:41:08.543]  But let's be clear, as they want to sit here and point the finger saying, you doctored this video, you're the worst, you're fake news.
[01:41:08.543 --> 01:41:12.846]  They all willingly went along with fake rape allegations.
[01:41:12.846 --> 01:41:17.030]  Three women came out and admitted they made up rape allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
[01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:18.511]  Dave said nothing.
[01:41:18.511 --> 01:41:21.113]  And all three were literally interviewed and said, don't indict me.
[01:41:21.113 --> 01:41:22.174]  I mean, he's a Republican.
[01:41:22.174 --> 01:41:22.574]  He's bad.
[01:41:22.574 --> 01:41:27.178]  It's a tactic to, in front of his wife and kids, say he raped the living hell out of me.
[01:41:27.178 --> 01:41:31.141]  On days like these, Alex, I just, I just sit back and I say, God's in charge.
[01:41:31.141 --> 01:41:32.061]  There's nothing I can do.
[01:41:32.061 --> 01:41:32.462]  No, I agree.
[01:41:32.462 --> 01:41:33.883]  But here's the answer.
[01:41:33.883 --> 01:41:38.526]  Acosta and all these people have gotten away with lying so long that they think it's going to work again.
[01:41:38.526 --> 01:41:43.410]  And since the lie doesn't work, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again that doesn't work.
[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:46.893]  Now they're just getting, so let me ask you this, Michael, how far does it go?
[01:41:48.027 --> 01:41:55.354]  As far as we'll let them go, but I think that they're going to go as far as they can.
[01:41:55.354 --> 01:41:57.516]  They're going to jail.
[01:41:57.516 --> 01:42:01.339]  They know the crimes that they've committed.
[01:42:01.339 --> 01:42:02.760]  They know at the highest levels.
[01:42:04.581 --> 01:42:06.522]  What's coming up against them.
[01:42:06.522 --> 01:42:09.704]  But again, it's the apathy of a lot of patriots.
[01:42:09.704 --> 01:42:14.186]  It's the apathy that is going to get us rolled over.
[01:42:14.186 --> 01:42:15.726]  We have to stand up.
[01:42:15.726 --> 01:42:18.147]  We have to push back against the lies.
[01:42:18.147 --> 01:42:19.588]  That's what Ted Nugent said yesterday.
[01:42:19.588 --> 01:42:20.929]  He said, we gotta not get violent.
[01:42:20.929 --> 01:42:22.209]  We gotta get aggressive.
[01:42:22.209 --> 01:42:22.649]  Right.
[01:42:22.649 --> 01:42:23.790]  And back in their face right now.
[01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:31.053]  I truly believe that we could avoid a hot war in the near future if the police would actually do their job.
[01:42:31.053 --> 01:42:35.476]  Every person that showed up at Tucker Carlson's house last night should have been in jail for at least 24 hours.
[01:42:35.476 --> 01:42:36.576]  Every single one of them.
[01:42:36.576 --> 01:42:37.116]  Every single one.
[01:42:37.116 --> 01:42:39.538]  Yeah, because they said you're not safe, they knocked the door in.
[01:42:39.538 --> 01:42:40.218]  This is dangerous.
[01:42:40.218 --> 01:42:41.418]  Of course they're gonna do it again.
[01:42:41.418 --> 01:42:43.560]  They don't face jail, they face... Let me ask the cops this.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:49.623]  What would happen to you if you're at work and your wife's there and 40 punks, a gang, show up to threaten your wife?
[01:42:49.623 --> 01:42:50.223]  What would you do?
[01:42:51.604 --> 01:42:52.945]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:52.945 --> 01:42:53.445]  Stay with us.
[01:42:53.445 --> 01:42:57.327]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:42:57.327 --> 01:43:05.932]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:43:05.932 --> 01:43:07.393]  Believe me, I know.
[01:43:07.393 --> 01:43:12.096]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:43:12.096 --> 01:43:15.158]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com,
[01:43:15.638 --> 01:43:17.320]  I still have that energy.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:37.481]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:43:37.981 --> 01:43:41.964]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:43:45.647 --> 01:43:50.651]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.

[01:43:57.233 --> 01:44:06.543]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:44:06.543 --> 01:44:09.406]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.406 --> 01:44:15.453]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:16.113 --> 01:44:22.380]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:28.667]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:28.667 --> 01:44:35.715]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:35.715 --> 01:44:35.895]  But!
[01:44:36.736 --> 01:44:49.764]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.764 --> 01:44:54.106]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:54.106 --> 01:44:56.648]  X3, now available at mforwardslife.com.

[01:45:58.362 --> 01:46:02.606]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:06.089]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:46:06.089 --> 01:46:07.851]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:46:07.851 --> 01:46:11.114]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[01:46:11.114 --> 01:46:17.900]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:23.005]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[01:46:23.325 --> 01:46:29.431]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:46:29.431 --> 01:46:32.414]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:46:32.414 --> 01:46:33.515]  I want to keep going.
[01:46:33.515 --> 01:46:37.339]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:46:37.339 --> 01:46:39.361]  I want to push all the way.
[01:46:39.361 --> 01:46:40.662]  I've committed to do that.
[01:46:40.662 --> 01:46:43.384]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:46:43.384 --> 01:46:45.807]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:46:46.287 --> 01:46:47.428]  I will never falter.
[01:46:47.428 --> 01:46:49.948]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:46:49.948 --> 01:46:50.889]  I physically will.
[01:46:50.889 --> 01:47:01.973]  But I give you my commitment if you financially support us and fullwarestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:47:01.973 --> 01:47:04.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:25.124]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[01:47:25.124 --> 01:47:31.450]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.450 --> 01:47:32.831]  We're on a mission.
[01:47:32.831 --> 01:47:38.336]  He just took a jet fuel and brought it down to the World Trade Center.
[01:47:38.336 --> 01:47:39.937]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[01:47:43.027 --> 01:47:47.050]  You know, I kind of picked up the way you said, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[01:47:47.050 --> 01:47:50.152]  Kind of picked it up as a little bit of a ministry thing or was I just imagining it?
[01:47:50.152 --> 01:47:51.253]  Absolutely.
[01:47:51.253 --> 01:47:51.753]  Absolutely.
[01:47:51.753 --> 01:47:53.674]  Oh, Al, he's a piece of work.
[01:47:53.674 --> 01:47:55.195]  I love that you have that sense, Alex.
[01:47:55.195 --> 01:47:58.717]  It's one of the things that is remarkable about you.
[01:47:58.717 --> 01:48:07.082]  The way that you, you know, when you're coming back from the breaks and you jump on the music and you use those lyrics and make it relevant to what's happening.
[01:48:07.082 --> 01:48:07.683]  It's amazing.
[01:48:08.283 --> 01:48:09.163]  Well, you guys are amazing.
[01:48:09.163 --> 01:48:10.564]  I want to go to calls in the next hour.
[01:48:10.564 --> 01:48:14.625]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, has predicted a lot of this is going to be joining us.
[01:48:14.625 --> 01:48:16.405]  We'll ride shotgun with him.
[01:48:16.405 --> 01:48:17.926]  But I want to be clear.
[01:48:17.926 --> 01:48:23.027]  I got called by the FBI after Vegas.
[01:48:23.027 --> 01:48:26.868]  And they said, how did you say Sunday night?
[01:48:26.868 --> 01:48:34.310]  I think they're bringing in Al Qaeda and ISIS forces and I think they'll attack a concert or a big event at, say, 10 o'clock at night.
[01:48:37.183 --> 01:48:42.106]  I said, let me be honest with you, I just said that, it just came to me.
[01:48:42.106 --> 01:48:53.975]  And they said, okay, well now we're going to tell you that the guy had ISIS and Al Qaeda paraphernalia in the room, and it was an arms deal, and there were Saudis in the country, and they used this as a way to get weapons.
[01:48:53.975 --> 01:48:56.576]  He was already basically working for the CIA.
[01:48:56.576 --> 01:48:57.857]  They didn't go all the way, the rest of the way.
[01:48:57.857 --> 01:49:00.419]  Then the CIA came and gave me a visit, and they told me the rest of the story.
[01:49:00.419 --> 01:49:01.760]  That's how that works, you get different pieces.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.242]  See, I'm not on air saying that to act cool.
[01:49:04.242 --> 01:49:05.143]  This happened.
[01:49:06.044 --> 01:49:06.305]  Okay.
[01:49:06.305 --> 01:49:08.268]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:49:08.268 --> 01:49:11.994]  It's like God's not going to put us in a position and not have somewhere the truth comes out.
[01:49:11.994 --> 01:49:13.836]  And it's not just me.
[01:49:13.836 --> 01:49:15.699]  Soros has overthrown more than 20 countries.
[01:49:17.094 --> 01:49:20.076]  Five or six just the last five, six years.
[01:49:20.076 --> 01:49:21.297]  He has a blueprint.
[01:49:21.297 --> 01:49:23.779]  He brags that he overthrew Ukraine.
[01:49:23.779 --> 01:49:24.779]  He caused riots.
[01:49:24.779 --> 01:49:26.440]  He had people shoot police.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.001]  He did it.
[01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:28.162]  He overthrew it.
[01:49:28.162 --> 01:49:37.388]  And so now he's funding through his son, Alexander, is kind of taking over these riot groups, and they're attacking, and they're saying, we're going to go dox houses, and then we're going to kill people.
[01:49:37.388 --> 01:49:45.774]  And then I know from other sources, they're just the cover for real teams, because if they're going to try to kill Trump, they're not going to leave Sean Hannity and Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and Matt Grudge around.
[01:49:46.454 --> 01:49:49.176]  They're not going to have these little meth heads in the decoys.
[01:49:49.176 --> 01:49:50.977]  They're the guy they'd blame.
[01:49:50.977 --> 01:49:53.819]  But the real teams are warmed up and ready.
[01:49:53.819 --> 01:50:04.165]  The fact that they ordered this morning, with Eric Holder involved, 900 teams to go dox everybody's house, that should create the smoke, which means they are close to trying to kill the President.
[01:50:04.165 --> 01:50:05.706]  Now, I didn't just say this now.
[01:50:05.706 --> 01:50:10.009]  The video I did three months ago, where they said Jones doesn't get battle rivals from the press, never said it, they never played it.
[01:50:10.569 --> 01:50:13.536]  It was a message to the President, 25 minutes long, laying all this out.
[01:50:13.536 --> 01:50:17.204]  And now I look back on it, from my sources and everything else, that's what scared him.
[01:50:17.204 --> 01:50:19.348]  95% of it is what they've said and what they've done.
[01:50:19.348 --> 01:50:20.531]  The other 5% is the ether.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.882]  And it is like Oracle level, because I say it, and it's what happens hours before it happens.
[01:50:26.882 --> 01:50:28.763]  So I don't know what's going on here, but it scares them.
[01:50:28.763 --> 01:50:29.363]  What do you guys think?
[01:50:29.363 --> 01:50:34.306]  Well, I think, actually, I'm glad that you brought up Ukraine, because I think that's actually a key situation to learn about.
[01:50:34.306 --> 01:50:36.047]  Well, Soros overthrows governments!
[01:50:36.047 --> 01:50:37.267]  But that's what they're about to do here.
[01:50:37.267 --> 01:50:41.189]  I mean, let's not forget, there were quote-unquote shootouts.
[01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:44.851]  It wasn't really a shootout, but they had people getting sniped, basically, and they said,
[01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:46.332]  Where is this coming from?
[01:50:46.332 --> 01:50:53.636]  And then all of a sudden, these two groups started fighting and fighting and fighting, and it turns out it was just some provocateur sitting on top of a building just shooting people.
[01:50:53.636 --> 01:50:55.697]  That's what Soros is gonna do here next.
[01:50:55.697 --> 01:51:05.523]  And he's got his Antifa groups lined up, so he'll say, oh, the right will say, oh, it's Antifa, and he'll have the Patriots over here, and they'll say, oh, it's the Patriots, when it shows they can have a Patriot cell and claim they came out because of Antifa.
[01:51:05.523 --> 01:51:08.965]  And then they'll have some guys, you know, standing off in a tower with a rifle mowing everybody down.
[01:51:09.673 --> 01:51:10.373]  That's what Soros is about.
[01:51:27.162 --> 01:51:34.124]  Putting it out there that, okay, anything coming from this outlet or anybody, anything associated with it is not true.
[01:51:34.124 --> 01:51:51.549]  And then my mind goes to all of the news and information that's come out, even in mainstream media, about what's happening in China and the credit scores and all of the concentration camps, the re-education camps that they're putting people in.
[01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:58.632]  Everybody here, well not everybody, you know, the leftists, the progressives... Slow down, say that again.
[01:51:58.632 --> 01:52:03.734]  They announce social scores and start putting people in concentration camps and it's even in our news.
[01:52:03.734 --> 01:52:06.114]  All over the news, all over the news.
[01:52:06.114 --> 01:52:15.338]  And then you have all these leftists, these progressives, who hardly know that the sky is blue, don't know that there's anything else happening in the world, are
[01:52:16.078 --> 01:52:24.947]  Being the foot soldiers to usher this thousand years of darkness into this country and they have no idea that...
[01:52:26.367 --> 01:52:32.008]  When the guillotine starts to fall, we'll be the first, you know, few waves to be taken.
[01:52:32.008 --> 01:52:33.769]  And then, they're next.
[01:52:33.769 --> 01:52:35.569]  They don't understand that.
[01:52:35.569 --> 01:52:39.850]  They don't understand it because they're... They don't get how hard people fought to create a beachhead of freedom.
[01:52:39.850 --> 01:52:41.330]  They have no idea.
[01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:42.191]  They have no idea.
[01:52:42.191 --> 01:52:44.171]  Well, they never studied the French Revolution.
[01:52:44.171 --> 01:52:47.692]  I forget the exact quote, but it's, you know, the guillotine lusts for blood.
[01:52:47.692 --> 01:52:51.973]  You know, that once the guillotine starts working, doesn't matter whose blood, it just wants the blood.
[01:52:51.973 --> 01:52:52.533]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:52:53.672 --> 01:52:57.173]  They bash the West all day because we are the folks that ended slavery.
[01:52:57.173 --> 01:52:59.894]  We're the folks that actually were women got the right to vote.
[01:52:59.894 --> 01:53:01.934]  We're the people that put women on a pedestal.
[01:53:01.934 --> 01:53:07.675]  And we have a conscience so they can manipulate our conscience to feel like, well, yeah, we're not perfect.
[01:53:07.675 --> 01:53:12.417]  When meanwhile, it's pure barbarism and the left funding the Arab state, the Muslims to all this.
[01:53:12.417 --> 01:53:13.177]  It's just insane.
[01:53:13.177 --> 01:53:14.077]  I want to go to phone calls here.
[01:53:15.646 --> 01:53:17.528]  Ladies and gentlemen, the country is in a civil war.
[01:53:17.528 --> 01:53:18.769]  It is in a civil emergency.
[01:53:18.769 --> 01:53:20.890]  It's under attack from every angle.
[01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:21.931]  The press is under attack.
[01:53:21.931 --> 01:53:23.472]  Free speech is under attack.
[01:53:23.472 --> 01:53:32.500]  But the good news is, we're actually winning because God's not going to sit here and leave us without the tools to deal with it.
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.140]  We have free will.
[01:53:34.537 --> 01:53:36.058]  And you look at Trump.
[01:53:36.058 --> 01:53:38.240]  It's not about getting down on my knees to Trump.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.881]  I've been persecuted for supporting Trump.
[01:53:39.881 --> 01:53:41.122]  I know how he's been persecuted.
[01:53:41.122 --> 01:53:42.563]  I know what he's really done.
[01:53:42.563 --> 01:53:46.066]  He's just trying to get better trade deals and empower us, make us believe in each other and come together.
[01:53:46.066 --> 01:53:47.427]  And they're saying that's bad.
[01:53:47.427 --> 01:53:51.650]  And if we reject this, it's God giving us a choice.
[01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:54.072]  If we reject it, like you said, thousand years of darkness.
[01:53:54.072 --> 01:53:56.274]  Michael Graves.
[01:53:56.274 --> 01:54:02.859]  Owen and I were talking and I had the opportunity to visit Auschwitz and Birkenau a couple months ago when I was in Europe.
[01:54:03.966 --> 01:54:13.491]  And we were talking about the feeling that... My mother said, oh, I've been to the Coliseum, I've been to other places where hundreds of thousands died.
[01:54:13.491 --> 01:54:17.913]  She said visiting Auschwitz and places like that, literally she couldn't breathe and had to get out.
[01:54:17.913 --> 01:54:20.334]  I had a panic attack and I had to... I didn't even know that.
[01:54:20.974 --> 01:54:22.817]  I had a panic attack and I had to leave.
[01:54:22.817 --> 01:54:23.859]  I was weeping and crying.
[01:54:23.859 --> 01:54:35.315]  I went into one of the intakes and there were just piles of shoes and hair and pictures of children and just normal people that were going about their lives.
[01:54:36.471 --> 01:54:41.692]  And then George Soros came along and all the evil.
[01:54:41.692 --> 01:54:43.073]  It's the same evil.
[01:54:43.073 --> 01:54:49.334]  It's the same evil that rears its head throughout human history.
[01:54:49.334 --> 01:55:00.317]  And what's happened in this country to a lot of the people that are out there pushing against us is that part of history, that part of the world is gone.
[01:55:00.317 --> 01:55:03.237]  And so they can't use that, they don't use that in their campaign.
[01:55:03.237 --> 01:55:04.118]  And it's worse than that!
[01:55:04.118 --> 01:55:05.618]  They say we're the Nazis!
[01:55:06.665 --> 01:55:10.006]  Right, but that's the thing, they have no idea what Nazis are.
[01:55:10.006 --> 01:55:23.530]  You know, you talk about World War II, you talk about any of it, any example of totalitarian, authoritarian evil, and it's like, it's the same thing as watching Netflix to them.
[01:55:23.530 --> 01:55:24.571]  It's just fake.
[01:55:24.571 --> 01:55:25.311]  It doesn't really happen.
[01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:31.433]  Well, you know, and there's also the super ultra right-wing lies and hates Israel and hates Jews and says, you know, I work for him and all this.
[01:55:32.353 --> 01:55:41.642]  My grandfather was in North Africa in the Army Air Corps and they did his missions and then he was an officer in the Army and my other grandfather was in the Army Air Corps in Europe as well.
[01:55:41.642 --> 01:55:49.530]  I talked to all the other guys who used to come to our ranch, they're all dead now, these World War II vets, and I always asked for World War II stories they wouldn't tell me, but the few times they did,
[01:55:50.171 --> 01:55:57.775]  They were like, man, you're talking about miles of starving and dead people, dead bodies everywhere, huge forced labor camps, dead people piled up.
[01:55:57.775 --> 01:55:59.917]  We had to bury them with bulldozers.
[01:55:59.917 --> 01:56:01.958]  There were blackbirds everywhere eating people.
[01:56:01.958 --> 01:56:04.439]  There were dead babies everywhere.
[01:56:04.439 --> 01:56:09.702]  Super hot women would come out and like flash their breasts at you in a fur coat and pull a machine gun out and try to kill you.
[01:56:09.702 --> 01:56:11.503]  It was cuckoo land.
[01:56:11.503 --> 01:56:12.744]  And then I see the Nazis saying,
[01:56:13.144 --> 01:56:14.405]  Oh no, Hitler wasn't bad.
[01:56:14.405 --> 01:56:15.826]  He didn't kill anybody.
[01:56:15.826 --> 01:56:18.827]  Dude, 30 plus million Russians died.
[01:56:18.827 --> 01:56:19.708]  22 million Germans.
[01:56:19.708 --> 01:56:20.788]  Millions of Jews.
[01:56:20.788 --> 01:56:22.009]  Millions of Poles.
[01:56:22.009 --> 01:56:23.430]  Almost a million Americans.
[01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:26.151]  Yes, a million Brits.
[01:56:26.151 --> 01:56:27.952]  Yes, World War II happened.
[01:56:27.952 --> 01:56:28.552]  It did.
[01:56:28.552 --> 01:56:29.173]  It happened.
[01:56:29.173 --> 01:56:30.053]  Not too long ago.
[01:56:30.053 --> 01:56:31.334]  Stop denying it.
[01:56:31.334 --> 01:56:32.154]  Right, not too long ago.
[01:56:32.154 --> 01:56:33.235]  Our grandparents remember.
[01:56:34.338 --> 01:56:36.001]  Many of them fought, even.
[01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:43.131]  But you know, Alex, it almost seems trivial at this point, and we'll talk about it on the other side, but there's still mass genocide going on in this country every day.
[01:56:43.131 --> 01:56:44.854]  It's called abortion.
[01:56:44.854 --> 01:56:47.197]  Oh, tell us right now, I almost forgot.
[01:56:47.197 --> 01:56:49.180]  You guys have a great demonstration, a couple of them coming up.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:49.701]  Tell us about that.
[01:56:49.861 --> 01:56:54.763]  So this Saturday, we're doing a flag lay at a cemetery here in Texas.
[01:56:54.763 --> 01:57:00.225]  It's the Texas State Cemetery, 909 Navasota Street in Austin, Texas.
[01:57:00.225 --> 01:57:01.085]  Michael will be there.
[01:57:01.085 --> 01:57:02.045]  It's the Marines' birthday.
[01:57:02.045 --> 01:57:04.186]  We're going to do a flag lay on the veterans' graves.
[01:57:04.186 --> 01:57:08.887]  Then after that, we're going to the Planned Parenthood here in South Austin on Ben White Boulevard.
[01:57:08.887 --> 01:57:10.668]  It's the biggest Planned Parenthood in Austin.
[01:57:10.668 --> 01:57:14.949]  And I'm having a stop government funding of abortion rally outside of that Planned Parenthood.
[01:57:14.949 --> 01:57:18.211]  I have people traveling from all over the states to be- We've been talking about this for a while.
[01:57:18.211 --> 01:57:19.011]  I'm going to come out.
[01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:21.312]  Tell folks again.
[01:57:21.312 --> 01:57:29.477]  This Saturday, the Stop Government Funding of Abortion Rally at the South Planned Parenthood on Ben White Boulevard.
[01:57:29.477 --> 01:57:31.358]  We're going to be there at 1 o'clock.
[01:57:31.358 --> 01:57:35.220]  1 o'clock this Saturday, Stop Government Funding of Abortion Rally.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:36.220]  And where do people go on InfoWars.com?
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:38.301]  Well, we're going to come up with specifics for folks.
[01:57:38.301 --> 01:57:41.523]  Stay with us, 4th Hour, Matt Bracken and both these great guys, straight ahead.
[01:57:41.523 --> 01:57:44.045]  I want to talk about Ted Nugent, too, on the other side.
[01:57:44.045 --> 01:57:44.385]  Stay with us.

[01:59:05.942 --> 01:59:06.462]  We're good to go.
[01:59:27.998 --> 01:59:29.799]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:58.718 --> 02:00:01.299]  Paul Watson!
[02:00:25.345 --> 02:00:27.685]  Things are so incredible.
[02:00:27.685 --> 02:00:30.806]  I was hoping to be able to take, you know, four or five days off for Thanksgiving.
[02:00:30.806 --> 02:00:31.926]  The crew certainly needs it.
[02:00:31.926 --> 02:00:34.047]  They deserve it.
[02:00:34.047 --> 02:00:51.370]  But we all know, now that Trump has removed Sessions that for whatever reason was involved in incredible dereliction of duty, the level of criminality is gone now and they're put in at least the next two months until he's got to get confirmed.
[02:00:52.199 --> 02:00:53.199]  This is Matthew Whitaker.
[02:00:53.199 --> 02:00:57.641]  This has hit the doomsday button for the left, for Soros, the Deep State.
[02:00:57.641 --> 02:01:02.063]  You've got the former Attorney General saying, get out there Antifa, get out there MoveOn.org.
[02:01:02.063 --> 02:01:05.264]  And now we're going to see all sorts of doxing and harassment.
[02:01:05.264 --> 02:01:10.947]  We tracked a guy who came here that works for Brian Skelter, has been around here for quite a while.
[02:01:10.947 --> 02:01:14.748]  They have CNN people stalking me, not for the purposes of a documentary.
[02:01:14.748 --> 02:01:16.449]  They've got something big planned, Paul.
[02:01:18.846 --> 02:01:24.030]  Well, this has been part of the revenge attack against everybody who helped Trump over the past two years.
[02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:33.558]  Clearly, they've targeted everyone in some form or another, whether that's character-wise or whether it's actual, you know, inciting physical violence against people.
[02:01:33.558 --> 02:01:35.920]  So, at this point, I don't know what's coming next, Alex.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:43.687]  I mean, this whole Mueller thing, they know it's baseless, they know there's nothing there whatsoever, so they're petrified about it going away, but it is going to go away.
[02:01:43.687 --> 02:01:44.968]  Like with the whole Roger Stone thing.
[02:01:45.672 --> 02:01:47.694]  We were talking about Dan A. Williams.
[02:01:47.694 --> 02:01:53.761]  You remember right around that time, early October, when this whole WikiLeaks Assange Podesta leak was about to come out.
[02:01:53.761 --> 02:01:56.144]  None of us knew anything about it.
[02:01:56.144 --> 02:01:57.665]  We were talking about Dan A. Williams.
[02:01:57.665 --> 02:01:59.407]  I went back on the emails and checked it.
[02:01:59.407 --> 02:02:00.949]  Not a single reference to it.
[02:02:00.949 --> 02:02:06.055]  In fact, you even did a show when Assange originally planned to release some info, and he didn't.
[02:02:06.055 --> 02:02:07.016]  And you were bashing him!
[02:02:07.396 --> 02:02:14.220]  So we were actually briefly anti-Assange for a while when all that was going down, right before the Podesta leaks.
[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:15.761]  So it's all absolute nonsense.
[02:02:16.673 --> 02:02:23.654]  All this is part of a revenge attack by the left against everybody, every single person who helped get Trump elected.
[02:02:23.654 --> 02:02:24.814]  And they're just not going to stop.
[02:02:24.814 --> 02:02:27.235]  You think winning the House is going to satisfy them for a while?
[02:02:27.235 --> 02:02:27.715]  No.
[02:02:27.715 --> 02:02:33.496]  It's only made them even more angry because they failed in thinking this blue wave was going to happen when it didn't.
[02:02:33.496 --> 02:02:40.977]  So now they know that Trump's chances of re-election in 2020 have been boosted by this recent midterm result.
[02:02:40.977 --> 02:02:44.398]  And that's why they're getting even more irate, even more vicious.
[02:02:46.387 --> 02:02:57.015]  That's right, and Paul, now that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who, you know, looks like a 90-year-old lady in a nursing home, nothing against her, is very, very sad, but when you see her in public, she doesn't look like she knows what planet she's on.
[02:02:57.015 --> 02:02:58.696]  She just broke three ribs.
[02:03:00.055 --> 02:03:03.478]  And so that's really got to scare them.
[02:03:03.478 --> 02:03:04.659]  And this is just coming in.
[02:03:04.659 --> 02:03:05.861]  The bulldog.
[02:03:05.861 --> 02:03:13.389]  Super respected acting AG Matthew Whitaker will not recuse himself from Russia probe and won't approve presidential subpoena.
[02:03:13.389 --> 02:03:18.894]  So Trump looks like he has a real American now and not that traitor Mueller.
[02:03:18.894 --> 02:03:22.138]  They are in absolute crap their pants mode at this point.
[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:25.691]  Well, I've said it from the start, Alex.
[02:03:25.691 --> 02:03:31.697]  I mean, to be honest, I lost interest in this whole Mueller thing months and months ago, because they clearly had no evidence whatsoever.
[02:03:31.697 --> 02:03:40.205]  They were going after apartments that Trump had rented out to Russian people in the 80s and stuff like that, trying to claim that was some kind of collusion.
[02:03:40.205 --> 02:03:42.567]  Absolute scrape-in-the-barrel nonsense.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.180]  You know, now they're talking about getting Don Jr.
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:45.981]  indicted.
[02:03:45.981 --> 02:03:48.881]  Again, that whole meeting that he went to, I remember.
[02:03:48.881 --> 02:03:51.542]  Well, they admit there's no collusion with Russians.
[02:03:51.542 --> 02:03:57.604]  Hillary Clinton and Fusion GPS who paid for that dossier, which came from Russians.
[02:03:57.604 --> 02:04:01.525]  They were the ones who colluded with Russians.
[02:04:01.525 --> 02:04:07.326]  Paul, I know you want to take some time off, so do I, but how do you, I know you don't even sleep right now.
[02:04:07.326 --> 02:04:11.367]  This is just such an, what would you call in 30 seconds this point of history we're in right now?
[02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:19.615]  I mean, I hope everyone dials it down and, you know, cooler heads prevail, but it's, you know, it's very acerbic.
[02:04:19.615 --> 02:04:22.197]  It's very monumental time to be alive.
[02:04:22.197 --> 02:04:23.898]  Things are changing very quickly.
[02:04:23.898 --> 02:04:25.419]  You can get a mass shooting in the news.
[02:04:25.419 --> 02:04:27.401]  It's disappeared like 12 hours later.
[02:04:27.401 --> 02:04:28.962]  The news is absolutely crazy.
[02:04:28.962 --> 02:04:32.004]  Everything's been sped up, unlike that doctored video.
[02:04:32.004 --> 02:04:35.167]  So, yeah, it's going to be interesting going forward, but we'll continue to battle on.
[02:04:37.068 --> 02:04:40.890]  I have another guest who's really a smart cookie popping in for just a segment and a half, Paul.
[02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:43.111]  We're back in 60 seconds, but this is just in.
[02:04:43.111 --> 02:04:52.816]  Acosta now officially is saying he didn't even touch her and that we basically created a whole cartoon and that it's all fake.
[02:04:52.816 --> 02:04:53.696]  That's right.
[02:04:53.696 --> 02:04:55.397]  Now he's saying he didn't even touch her.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.141]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[02:06:07.575 --> 02:06:08.716]  Big Brother.
[02:06:08.716 --> 02:06:10.496]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:12.357]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:12.357 --> 02:06:14.098]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:14.098 --> 02:06:15.759]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:15.759 --> 02:06:20.961]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.961 --> 02:06:27.444]  Well, we've got a guest coming up here in just a few minutes, who came out, and just lovingly, nicely,
[02:06:29.066 --> 02:06:40.617]  pointed out that QAnon was saying a lot of things in the midterm of the QAnon thing, the fantasy, that really weren't true and ridiculous and so much of what they said hadn't come true.
[02:06:40.617 --> 02:06:45.301]  We're just supposed to trust this little secret bot though, not somebody that we know publicly.
[02:06:45.301 --> 02:06:53.409]  But now that Sessions is out and now that you see the deep state war about to blow up and you're about to see Mueller get in some big trouble, boy, what's QAnon gonna do then?
[02:06:54.991 --> 02:07:06.637]  But I've learned, like in Nigerian scams, I've had friends, I've had some distant family, that were like bragging, hey, I'm getting a million dollars from Nigeria from Prince Bubu.
[02:07:06.637 --> 02:07:08.878]  And you tell them, no, no, that's a famous scam.
[02:07:08.878 --> 02:07:16.702]  First you give them a thousand, because you're going to get 20,000, then they go, oh, Prince of Bubu can talk to you now on the phone, but they need 20,000, and then you get the million.
[02:07:16.702 --> 02:07:20.404]  And about the time you get the, you know, 20,000, you never get the million.
[02:07:20.404 --> 02:07:24.726]  But some folks get ratcheted up to 100,000, because they don't want to admit they got taken.
[02:07:27.632 --> 02:07:28.693]  And people get mad, man.
[02:07:28.693 --> 02:07:34.497]  People are like, shut up, you're just mad that I've got this deal and I know Prince of Boo-Boo.
[02:07:34.497 --> 02:07:36.998]  And then it happened to me again recently, another Nigerian scam.
[02:07:36.998 --> 02:07:44.803]  It had been over 10 years since somebody in my family got sucked into Nigerian stuff and they're still mad at me.
[02:07:44.803 --> 02:07:51.167]  They still do not believe that it was a scam and they got $6,000.
[02:07:54.230 --> 02:07:56.092]  I almost give up at this point.
[02:07:56.092 --> 02:07:58.433]  I just don't know what to do.
[02:07:58.433 --> 02:08:02.877]  I'm not going to give up fighting, but giving up on people that don't get how the scam works.
[02:08:02.877 --> 02:08:06.659]  They get you on a little bit, and then you're invested, and then you never get out of it.
[02:08:06.659 --> 02:08:08.441]  It's like fake college degrees.
[02:08:08.441 --> 02:08:10.983]  Most college degrees are worthless now, 90 plus percent.
[02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:17.528]  But people just get a second one, or a third one, or a fourth one, or a fifth one, because once they've got their arm in the wood chipper, you can't get it out.
[02:08:18.456 --> 02:08:23.058]  And it's like abusive relationships, that's what happens, or abuse of the government, or socialism.
[02:08:23.058 --> 02:08:26.099]  If we just had pure communism, it would suddenly be free.
[02:08:26.099 --> 02:08:26.640]  No!
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:29.341]  For all you socialists that wonder why you're so unhappy.
[02:08:29.341 --> 02:08:31.982]  It's because you're domesticated.
[02:08:31.982 --> 02:08:34.423]  But that is all a side issue.
[02:08:34.423 --> 02:08:34.963]  Two A.G.
[02:08:34.963 --> 02:08:39.065]  sessions, and our next guest has a lot of info, and he's a really smart guy.
[02:08:39.065 --> 02:08:43.047]  And so he's going to be popping in with us, and we have several other guests today, and I'm going to open the phones up as well.
[02:08:44.329 --> 02:08:48.512]  We're gonna have Michael Graves and Owen Schroer in studio, Matt Bracken's coming up, but this is such a huge time.
[02:08:48.512 --> 02:08:51.895]  The left is launching Civil War officially.
[02:08:51.895 --> 02:09:00.382]  But getting back to, in the Civil War, the mainstream media, the corporate media, the collaborator media, the globalist media, is gonna get that much worse.
[02:09:00.382 --> 02:09:03.124]  So if you're a radio listener, you've always seen this on the news.
[02:09:03.124 --> 02:09:07.428]  You go to Infowars.com and you go to Paul Watson's Twitter to see it for yourself.
[02:09:07.428 --> 02:09:11.731]  But now Acosta denies touching White House intern despite video evidence.
[02:09:12.714 --> 02:09:15.580]  He's saying that we totally faked the video.
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:19.689]  Even Fox News is saying it's doctored to deceive.
[02:09:19.689 --> 02:09:23.456]  And all Paul Watson did was download it, blow it up, zoom in.
[02:09:25.612 --> 02:09:28.716]  On him, pushing her arm down and pulling the mic away from her.
[02:09:28.716 --> 02:09:30.057]  She's trying to get it away.
[02:09:30.057 --> 02:09:30.898]  President says, that's enough.
[02:09:30.898 --> 02:09:31.799]  He won't stop.
[02:09:31.799 --> 02:09:33.982]  Just like anybody else at any public event.
[02:09:33.982 --> 02:09:35.824]  You ever been to a place where you ask questions to a speaker?
[02:09:35.824 --> 02:09:37.526]  When your time's up, you'll get the mic up.
[02:09:37.526 --> 02:09:38.907]  They come and get it.
[02:09:38.907 --> 02:09:42.031]  So he pushes her arm down, pushes the hand back.
[02:09:42.031 --> 02:09:43.252]  He says, we're lies.
[02:09:43.252 --> 02:09:43.853]  It's all fake.
[02:09:46.377 --> 02:09:47.738]  And there's other camera angles of this.
[02:09:47.738 --> 02:09:51.940]  It's just, and the whole corporate media, Fox News, CNN, they're all together.
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:52.980]  Paul Watson's a liar.
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:54.141]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:09:54.141 --> 02:09:55.121]  Akasha did nothing.
[02:09:55.121 --> 02:09:56.042]  It's all fake.
[02:09:56.042 --> 02:09:57.062]  Sarah Sanders is bad.
[02:09:57.062 --> 02:09:58.003]  Trump's bad.
[02:09:58.003 --> 02:10:00.824]  This is disgraceful.
[02:10:00.824 --> 02:10:04.746]  So Paul, I wanted you to have a chance to respond to them now saying, it's not just doctored.
[02:10:04.746 --> 02:10:06.547]  He didn't touch her.
[02:10:06.547 --> 02:10:09.908]  And then while you're talking, just roll our C-SPAN unedited video.
[02:10:09.908 --> 02:10:10.709]  Don't even blow it up.
[02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:13.890]  Just show people over and over again for TV viewers, the unedited C-SPAN.
[02:10:13.890 --> 02:10:14.551]  Here it is.
[02:10:14.551 --> 02:10:14.911]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.202]  Yeah, he clearly touched her.
[02:10:18.202 --> 02:10:20.504]  She went to get the microphone, that's her job.
[02:10:20.504 --> 02:10:28.471]  He reached across her with his left arm and forced her arm down to resist or to restrain her or to overpower her.
[02:10:28.471 --> 02:10:30.233]  It wasn't assault, it wasn't battery.
[02:10:30.233 --> 02:10:38.140]  I mean, it wasn't much better than what Corey Lewandowski did, which he got, I think he got charged with battery for that, of course, demonized by the mainstream media.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:41.043]  Based on six frames of video evidence, I might add,
[02:10:41.727 --> 02:10:43.308]  This video was not edited.
[02:10:43.308 --> 02:10:45.569]  They've got video editing experts.
[02:10:45.569 --> 02:10:52.352]  There's one with the Telegraph who says there are discrepancies between the C-SPAN version and the version which Sarah Sanders tweeted.
[02:10:52.352 --> 02:10:57.315]  Yeah, because it's been run through like three different programs then re-uploaded, okay?
[02:10:57.315 --> 02:10:58.955]  Nothing was doctored.
[02:10:58.955 --> 02:11:00.016]  Nothing was changed.
[02:11:00.971 --> 02:11:05.712]  I posted screenshots from the video editing program showing nothing was sped up.
[02:11:05.712 --> 02:11:10.153]  There are little wavy lines on the track on Sony Vegas Pro 15 if a clip is sped up.
[02:11:10.153 --> 02:11:12.133]  Those are not there because it was not sped up.
[02:11:12.133 --> 02:11:13.534]  I did not speed it up.
[02:11:13.534 --> 02:11:14.834]  I did not doctor it.
[02:11:14.834 --> 02:11:19.215]  So they created a huge conspiracy, which some of them are now even trying to back away from.
[02:11:19.215 --> 02:11:21.815]  First it was, oh, fake doctored video sped up.
[02:11:21.815 --> 02:11:23.736]  Now it's, oh, debate rages.
[02:11:23.736 --> 02:11:25.196]  So they're trying to walk it back a little bit.
[02:11:25.196 --> 02:11:25.837]  But look at her!
[02:11:25.837 --> 02:11:28.901]  She's trying to grab it away and he's shoving her down and pulling it away.
[02:11:28.901 --> 02:11:31.484]  And we're showing unedited HD footage.
[02:11:31.484 --> 02:11:33.026]  Now let's blow it up for TV viewers again.
[02:11:33.026 --> 02:11:34.348]  Now let's go in slow motion.
[02:11:34.348 --> 02:11:35.229]  Blow it up.
[02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:36.771]  And slow motion please.
[02:11:37.901 --> 02:11:40.142]  Yeah, watch his left wrist and his left hand.
[02:11:40.142 --> 02:11:45.343]  It clearly comes down to restrain her, to stop her from getting, from retrieving the microphone, okay?
[02:11:45.343 --> 02:11:46.444]  That happened.
[02:11:46.444 --> 02:12:00.268]  No matter how many stupid claims he can claim about, like little frames that are different because it's been re-uploaded and downloaded six times, that doesn't change the fact that what you're seeing is him physically resisting having a physical confrontation with a woman, okay?
[02:12:00.268 --> 02:12:00.668]  It happened.
[02:12:00.828 --> 02:12:04.529]  We're going to put this, what you just said out in HD, right now to the world.
[02:12:04.529 --> 02:12:12.432]  Jim Acosta is literally 1984 level now, telling us 2 plus 2 doesn't equal 4, telling us that our own eyes are lies.
[02:12:12.432 --> 02:12:17.874]  They've been caught red-handed in the corporate media, though it's all behind this, and you might get banned from Twitter now.
[02:12:17.874 --> 02:12:19.594]  That's their goal, saying you're fake.
[02:12:19.594 --> 02:12:22.255]  Jim Acosta wasn't even there, actually.
[02:12:22.255 --> 02:12:24.276]  That's fake video, too.
[02:12:24.276 --> 02:12:26.737]  Paul, let's keep tracking Antifa.
[02:12:26.737 --> 02:12:29.898]  The fact that the leader of the group that went after Cruz and after Tucker Carlson
[02:12:30.694 --> 02:12:32.960]  That's called for killing police Mike Pence and others.
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.464]  That's pretty big news.
[02:12:34.464 --> 02:12:36.409]  This is pretty incredible.
[02:12:36.409 --> 02:12:39.056]  Great job, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:12:39.056 --> 02:12:39.637]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:12:40.379 --> 02:12:42.140]  Okay, I appreciate our guest holding.
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:43.960]  He's only got this segment and the next.
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.361]  And again, he is Zachary Claywan.
[02:12:47.361 --> 02:12:52.542]  He's a former Army veteran, officer, patriot, knows a lot of inside intel.
[02:12:52.542 --> 02:13:01.905]  I've talked to a lot of generals and other people and former CIA, black ops commanders, but he's fun to get on because he's just a smart guy and he knows a lot of these folks.
[02:13:01.905 --> 02:13:05.466]  And he's given me a lot of stuff that turned out to be very, very accurate in the past.
[02:13:05.466 --> 02:13:07.827]  But he was the guy trying to be nice to QAnon, but saying,
[02:13:09.093 --> 02:13:11.479]  You know, it's kind of like some of these fake Bitcoin companies.
[02:13:11.479 --> 02:13:13.905]  They're not all fake, but some of them are like, oh, trust this secret bot.
[02:13:13.905 --> 02:13:15.349]  It turns out to be a total Ponzi scheme.
[02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:19.771]  And so now they said, trust the plan, Trump will never fire Sessions.
[02:13:19.771 --> 02:13:21.692]  Sessions is good, Mueller's good.
[02:13:21.692 --> 02:13:27.715]  I can assure you, I've talked to high-level people, they hate Sessions and they hate Mueller and know it's all crap.
[02:13:27.715 --> 02:13:30.336]  So now, what is QAnon going to do?
[02:13:30.336 --> 02:13:38.420]  This has all happened and then shifting gears away from that, I hope we all learn about this anonymous bot stuff and trust the experts and trust, you know, foggy oracles.
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:40.481]  Some people's names are public and folks that are public.
[02:13:42.631 --> 02:13:45.933]  Zachary, then we'll move on in the next segment to the big enchilada.
[02:13:45.933 --> 02:13:48.754]  How big this is that Sessions was going to be canned.
[02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:51.836]  You texted me last week, said the word is just going down.
[02:13:51.836 --> 02:13:54.777]  And then what comes out of this now and this new guy they've got.
[02:13:54.777 --> 02:13:59.539]  But boy, I tell you, you and I are certainly vindicated.
[02:13:59.539 --> 02:14:00.460]  Without question, Ned.
[02:14:01.656 --> 02:14:06.240]  It's a pleasure to be back on to the Q movement with all sincerity.
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:08.061]  It seemed very appealing.
[02:14:08.061 --> 02:14:11.264]  But now we have our full transparency on what occurred here.
[02:14:11.264 --> 02:14:15.027]  And I just you know, their whole movement was trust a plan trust.
[02:14:16.238 --> 02:14:29.951]  Sessions of course last year there was a clear line drawn in the sand when I stated on your show on InfoWars that Bannon would be gone, Tillerson would be gone, Haley would be gone, and Sessions would be gone in succession.
[02:14:29.951 --> 02:14:32.354]  And they looked at that as sort of the line in the sand.
[02:14:33.721 --> 02:15:01.009]  Obviously today what's occurring and it's no coincidence that the new Attorney General an individual that the QAnon movement surprisingly since they're all mighty and all-knowing did not know was coming argued two years ago that Hillary Clinton should be criminally charged and he will go through with it and it makes no coincidence make make no mistake this happens a day after the midterms because it was going to go one way or another and it went one way and so did we so
[02:15:02.606 --> 02:15:17.504]  I don't know where these QAnon individuals are going to go now or look to for information, but I find it very coincidental that during its phenomenon, during its rise to fame, InfoWars, a hub of information and alternative media gets deplatformed.
[02:15:17.504 --> 02:15:19.066]  So I would look to who was really
[02:15:20.231 --> 02:15:24.432]  Behind that movement and how sophisticated the PSYOP was, because it was quite sophisticated.
[02:15:24.432 --> 02:15:26.613]  And believe me, these people are not our friends.
[02:15:26.613 --> 02:15:34.475]  Well, notice, just like CNN and everybody else was attacking his show, was the foggy, all-powerful, all-Lord Q. I was going to be arrested.
[02:15:34.475 --> 02:15:35.815]  You're going to be arrested.
[02:15:35.815 --> 02:15:38.036]  Trump loves sessions.
[02:15:38.036 --> 02:15:38.916]  Sessions will be there.
[02:15:38.916 --> 02:15:39.856]  It's all about to happen.
[02:15:39.856 --> 02:15:41.557]  Always the sealed indictments.
[02:15:41.557 --> 02:15:44.497]  Always, for a year and a half, going to happen.
[02:15:44.497 --> 02:15:45.177]  Unbelievable.
[02:15:45.177 --> 02:15:46.778]  But the people that have drunk the
[02:15:47.558 --> 02:15:48.539]  You know, Kool-Aid.
[02:15:48.539 --> 02:15:51.381]  The Nigerian prince scammed Kool-Aid.
[02:15:51.381 --> 02:15:52.762]  They're just gonna double down, Zach.
[02:15:52.762 --> 02:15:54.284]  Let's talk about the future when we come back.
[02:15:55.808 --> 02:15:57.009]  Hear that?
[02:15:57.009 --> 02:16:02.413]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:16:02.413 --> 02:16:05.315]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:16:05.315 --> 02:16:08.897]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:16:08.897 --> 02:16:16.463]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:16:16.463 --> 02:16:21.066]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[02:16:21.066 --> 02:16:23.488]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:16:23.488 --> 02:16:24.649]  Faketv.com
[02:16:25.538 --> 02:16:28.661]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[02:16:28.661 --> 02:16:32.163]  So you want to be sure it's the purest for you and your family.
[02:16:32.163 --> 02:16:36.006]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on Berkey Clean Water.
[02:16:36.006 --> 02:16:39.409]  The Berkey guy has you covered at home, work, and on the go.

[02:16:55.481 --> 02:17:00.284]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:17:00.284 --> 02:17:06.148]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:17:06.148 --> 02:17:12.673]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:17:12.673 --> 02:17:16.715]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[02:17:25.541 --> 02:17:26.782]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.782 --> 02:17:30.704]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.704 --> 02:17:32.225]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:32.225 --> 02:17:35.187]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:35.187 --> 02:17:40.750]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:41.951]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:41.951 --> 02:17:44.892]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:44.892 --> 02:17:47.114]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:47.114 --> 02:17:51.556]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:51.556 --> 02:17:53.857]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:56.254 --> 02:17:58.316]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[02:17:58.316 --> 02:18:01.778]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know, and your support's been amazing.
[02:18:01.778 --> 02:18:04.200]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products.
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:15.548]  And we're announcing a mega blowout sale at Infowarsstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.
[02:18:15.548 --> 02:18:17.570]  Super male and super female vitality.
[02:18:18.311 --> 02:18:23.537]  It's incredibly high-quality cold-pressed herbs known for strength, stamina, libido, energy.
[02:18:23.537 --> 02:18:24.258]  It's amazing.
[02:18:24.258 --> 02:18:28.384]  It is a whopping 57% off.
[02:18:28.384 --> 02:18:30.767]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, super high-quality.
[02:18:30.767 --> 02:18:31.668]  The best out there.
[02:18:31.668 --> 02:18:33.550]  Never gone this low.
[02:18:33.550 --> 02:18:36.014]  67% off to blow it all out.
[02:18:36.514 --> 02:18:39.915]  RainForce Plus, now available, 50% off.
[02:18:39.915 --> 02:18:43.056]  Survival Shield X3, the best iodine out there.
[02:18:43.056 --> 02:18:45.996]  Brand new product, 50% off and free shipping.
[02:18:45.996 --> 02:18:54.979]  And we're continuing free shipping store-wide on Alexa, Pure Breeze, water filters, and on all the other books and videos and materiel at the M4 Store.
[02:18:56.059 --> 02:19:05.346]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:19:05.346 --> 02:19:08.208]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:19:08.208 --> 02:19:14.253]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:19:14.933 --> 02:19:21.199]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:19:21.199 --> 02:19:27.485]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:19:27.485 --> 02:19:34.532]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:19:34.532 --> 02:19:34.712]  But!
[02:19:35.553 --> 02:19:37.174]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:22.079]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:40.396 --> 02:20:42.317]  Here comes the night.
[02:20:42.317 --> 02:20:44.438]  Antifa thinks we're scared of the dark.
[02:20:44.438 --> 02:20:46.379]  George Soros thinks we're scared of the dark.
[02:20:46.379 --> 02:20:48.560]  We live in the dark.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:52.262]  We were born in the dark.
[02:20:52.262 --> 02:20:57.744]  Now the globalists are about to meet a real fight.
[02:20:57.744 --> 02:21:01.106]  Trump is releasing a titan.
[02:21:01.106 --> 02:21:04.247]  A junkyard dog.
[02:21:04.247 --> 02:21:07.829]  A demolition man with a huge wrecking ball right at the deep state.
[02:21:08.959 --> 02:21:12.520]  Get ready, because you could see Trump assassinated within days.
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:13.780]  You could see a nuke go off.
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:19.402]  You could see Libertarian Conservative leaders wiped out, because the enemy is preparing to launch an attack.
[02:21:19.402 --> 02:21:20.742]  But we're ready!
[02:21:20.742 --> 02:21:22.162]  We're ready.
[02:21:22.162 --> 02:21:23.523]  But we could fall in this fight.
[02:21:23.523 --> 02:21:27.264]  I'm going to get more into that with Zach in a moment, because Zach, off the record, is a super smart dude.
[02:21:27.264 --> 02:21:28.404]  He'll come on the air.
[02:21:28.404 --> 02:21:30.004]  I really appreciate him coming on.
[02:21:30.004 --> 02:21:31.625]  Zachary Lee Claywon.
[02:21:33.723 --> 02:21:36.005]  Zack, the QAnon thing buried.
[02:21:36.005 --> 02:21:38.646]  I don't want to fight with it, but clearly it was an op.
[02:21:38.646 --> 02:21:43.149]  We were very sad to tell people yet again about Nigerian scams being fake or other things like that being fake.
[02:21:43.149 --> 02:21:43.650]  They don't listen.
[02:21:43.650 --> 02:21:45.491]  They don't want to listen once you're invested in a lie.
[02:21:46.715 --> 02:21:51.039]  But now this guy, acting AG, says Hillary should be indicted.
[02:21:51.039 --> 02:21:53.481]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:53.481 --> 02:21:54.642]  Also, a former U.S.
[02:21:54.642 --> 02:21:59.686]  attorney, Matthew Whitaker, enough evidence to have a special prosecutor investigate Clinton Foundation.
[02:21:59.686 --> 02:22:00.587]  No kidding.
[02:22:00.587 --> 02:22:02.789]  So now they are so scared.
[02:22:02.789 --> 02:22:04.470]  What does this signify?
[02:22:04.470 --> 02:22:10.436]  And from your intel and your sources, the highest levels of CENTCOM, because I know some of the same people, what is about to happen next?
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:13.721]  Uh, we're in it right now.
[02:22:13.721 --> 02:22:24.169]  Like you said, something very, very serious could occur in the next couple of days as a retaliation because what we have with the new appointment of Attorney General Mike, Matt G. Whitaker, um,
[02:22:26.005 --> 02:22:26.925]  Signifies a lot.
[02:22:26.925 --> 02:22:33.747]  And what you also have to understand is one day after this, Jim Mattis also releases a major statement.
[02:22:33.747 --> 02:22:35.847]  This is at a Freebeak, and I think they released it today.
[02:22:35.847 --> 02:22:37.287]  They just released this this morning.
[02:22:37.287 --> 02:22:38.948]  They gave an official report.
[02:22:38.948 --> 02:22:42.208]  Defense Secretary Mattis is to stand at the Pentagon.
[02:22:42.208 --> 02:22:47.850]  He says, despite of what the media was saying, I have no desire to leave the Trump administration.
[02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:48.450]  So he's dealt
[02:22:51.317 --> 02:22:52.858]  Pulling down his efforts.
[02:22:52.858 --> 02:23:00.202]  We now have Whitaker as the AG, and he, as he stated two years ago, they will launch an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
[02:23:00.202 --> 02:23:01.263]  So this is Fort Hood.
[02:23:01.263 --> 02:23:02.223]  This is Benghazi.
[02:23:02.223 --> 02:23:03.164]  This is Gaddafi.
[02:23:03.164 --> 02:23:03.944]  This is Vegas.
[02:23:03.944 --> 02:23:08.747]  This is a whole lot of things, and it symbolizes a lot of things.
[02:23:08.747 --> 02:23:14.871]  Obviously, the timing is immediately following the midterms, and this was on schedule, planned and politically precise.
[02:23:15.876 --> 02:23:34.725]  Of course, I don't want to get into inside baseball, but that stuff where he said Mattis is bad, Trump did all that, The Globalist actually bought it, and obviously just like a Godfather movie or something, Trump has sent people over to find out who really the traitors are, and now he knows the whole blueprint, the whole map, and I'm not bragging, now Trump knows that my blueprint I already gave him is exactly on target.
[02:23:35.285 --> 02:23:47.248]  And so now what's happening is literally what I say now is taken at the highest levels because I spend all my time doing this and I'm not afraid to tell the president and tell the public and tell others even though they want to silence me.
[02:23:47.248 --> 02:23:49.789]  So folks need to understand, I'm not bragging when I say this.
[02:23:49.789 --> 02:23:53.750]  They want us off air because I know exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:55.650]  Here's George Soros' media matters.
[02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:58.511]  The Infowars White House pipeline is alive and well.
[02:23:58.511 --> 02:24:00.451]  That's right, it never went away, fools.
[02:24:02.648 --> 02:24:06.571]  But here's the problem, Zach, and I know you're expert in paramilitary stuff.
[02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:07.832]  I was told by high-level folks...
[02:24:08.735 --> 02:24:14.757]  But I can also see the shape of it, that if they're getting ready to really launch a bunch of violence or take the president out, they're going to try to take everybody out.
[02:24:14.757 --> 02:24:16.637]  A few thousand top people if they make their move.
[02:24:16.637 --> 02:24:21.918]  So if Trump gets killed, God forbid, they're going to move everybody else that same day, pretty much simultaneously.
[02:24:21.918 --> 02:24:27.840]  Then they're just sending antifa to everybody's houses first, so they can set them up for the teams they're going to use.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.280]  Do you have any intel on that?
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:35.622]  And other than Hezbollah groups hooked into some of the globalist deep state and MS-13, some of the type of hit teams they're going to be using?
[02:24:37.095 --> 02:24:51.239]  The timing is classic when you look at the caravan approaching the country, the appointment of these individuals, the solidifying of what the plan, the true plan is moving forward in the Second American Revolution.
[02:24:51.239 --> 02:24:52.579]  We have to be looking for anything.
[02:24:52.579 --> 02:24:56.500]  I believe the deplatforming of yourself was part of this attack.
[02:24:56.500 --> 02:25:00.101]  I believe these Antifa groups are obviously paid and provocative.
[02:25:01.806 --> 02:25:03.608]  At the at the at root levels.
[02:25:03.608 --> 02:25:09.231]  But yes, we do have to look out for the obvious terror threats that are already present.
[02:25:09.231 --> 02:25:19.358]  And whether it be Islamic, whether it be lone, you know, lone gunmen, because like your guest said earlier, Paul Watson, within, you know, we just had a shooting in California and it's not even news now.
[02:25:19.358 --> 02:25:19.938]  It's gone.
[02:25:19.938 --> 02:25:22.680]  So it's going to come from from many different angles.
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:27.643]  But internally, what I could really get at is that's going to continue to occur.
[02:25:27.643 --> 02:25:29.805]  And when you have the appointing of
[02:25:30.485 --> 02:25:34.866]  Matt Whitaker, followed by the solidifying of the White House with Jim Mattis.
[02:25:34.866 --> 02:25:40.128]  All at the same time, following after McCain's death, the midterms, the Awan brothers.
[02:25:40.128 --> 02:25:43.608]  There's information that's now, like, you know, gonna come out in the next few days or weeks.
[02:25:43.608 --> 02:25:51.490]  It's already out, really, but truly what was going on with the Awan brothers and the true investigation into the Clinton Foundation, what we have is the whole shebang.
[02:25:51.490 --> 02:25:51.991]  This is it.
[02:25:51.991 --> 02:25:56.992]  We're in it, and they're capable of anything because their lives are literally on the line, as they should be.
[02:25:57.694 --> 02:26:00.155]  And the good news is here, we're in deep crap.
[02:26:00.155 --> 02:26:02.656]  That's forced everybody to choose which side they're on.
[02:26:02.656 --> 02:26:07.499]  I wish we weren't in this situation, but you're going to now see some of the best people who aren't cowards come forward.
[02:26:07.499 --> 02:26:10.200]  And we're about to see a real fight for this country.
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:12.901]  But folks, you better choose a side.
[02:26:12.901 --> 02:26:14.062]  There is no middle of the road here.
[02:26:14.062 --> 02:26:15.002]  That's where you get run over.
[02:26:15.002 --> 02:26:19.745]  Everybody better get on their knees before God and ask which side you're on in all this.
[02:26:21.041 --> 02:26:21.961]  It's that simple.
[02:26:21.961 --> 02:26:27.083]  Because clearly Trump tried to tell the deep state, keep your money, your stolen money, just stop it.
[02:26:27.083 --> 02:26:28.364]  We're not going to destroy America.
[02:26:28.364 --> 02:26:30.644]  We're not going to do all this horrible stuff.
[02:26:30.644 --> 02:26:32.185]  We're willing to get rid of all your globalism.
[02:26:32.185 --> 02:26:33.986]  Just stop trying to run America in the ground.
[02:26:33.986 --> 02:26:35.566]  Let's just make a deal.
[02:26:35.566 --> 02:26:36.667]  They wouldn't do it.
[02:26:36.667 --> 02:26:39.988]  So now the gloves come off and that's why they're so scared.
[02:26:39.988 --> 02:26:43.369]  And you can believe behind the scenes Trump is about to turn the dogs loose.
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:46.721]  Absolutely.
[02:26:46.721 --> 02:26:47.802]  We're in full effect right now.
[02:26:47.802 --> 02:26:50.405]  We called this out a year ago.
[02:26:50.405 --> 02:26:52.827]  This is not a shot in the dark.
[02:26:52.827 --> 02:26:54.548]  This is very calculated.
[02:26:54.548 --> 02:27:00.633]  When I said Bannon will be gone, Tillerson will be gone, Haley will be gone, and Sessions will be gone.
[02:27:00.633 --> 02:27:01.774]  That's on purpose.
[02:27:01.774 --> 02:27:03.135]  Certain things need to be fleshed out.
[02:27:03.135 --> 02:27:04.797]  Certain people need to be pushed to certain points to see
[02:27:05.865 --> 02:27:08.406]  Yeah, QAnon was 100% wrong.
[02:27:08.406 --> 02:27:12.988]  You've been 100% right and so have I. And that's why we have a lot of the same sources.
[02:27:12.988 --> 02:27:16.850]  And because there was a plan to fix this peacefully, there was a plan to fix this the other way.
[02:27:18.122 --> 02:27:19.142]  They were internal.
[02:27:19.142 --> 02:27:19.803]  They were internal.
[02:27:19.803 --> 02:27:35.708]  At one point, when it comes to that encryption and that sort of modality that they were using for that sort of psychological operation, they were saying things that were obviously inside baseball, meaning even our opponent within the deeps, they understand certain things that the general public doesn't, but the way they were manipulating
[02:27:37.552 --> 02:27:44.196]  Truly, you know, free thinkers and truly people of, I would say, you know, what would be your listening base was very sophisticated.
[02:27:44.196 --> 02:27:47.337]  Well, Q was a target to take down InfoWars.
[02:27:47.337 --> 02:27:52.380]  Q was a target to kill the human intelligence of the public working with the military and others.
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:28:01.384]  It was meant to just confuse everything and fry everything and make everybody kind of pacify and sit down and everything's fine, go to sleep, don't be involved, you know, keep sessions in.
[02:28:01.704 --> 02:28:05.786]  Because everything Antifa and Soros and all of them is, keep sessions in.
[02:28:05.786 --> 02:28:07.286]  Q, keep sessions in.
[02:28:07.286 --> 02:28:08.547]  CNN, keep sessions in.
[02:28:08.547 --> 02:28:09.867]  ABC, keep sessions in.
[02:28:09.867 --> 02:28:20.871]  And now, I don't know how they put you... To attack you is to attack you and dox you and do certain things within their, you know, supposed, you know, areas of operation.
[02:28:20.871 --> 02:28:22.692]  They essentially attack you in my likeness.
[02:28:24.291 --> 02:28:29.457]  Um, yet when you get deplatformed, a major leader and a side that won't hurt them, they don't, they don't defend you.
[02:28:29.457 --> 02:28:33.361]  So it really gives you a real story of who these individuals are and the timing.
[02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:36.370]  I mean, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on here.
[02:28:55.999 --> 02:28:57.220]  Hear that?
[02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:02.604]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:29:02.604 --> 02:29:05.506]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:29:05.506 --> 02:29:09.088]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:29:09.088 --> 02:29:16.653]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:29:16.653 --> 02:29:21.256]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[02:29:21.256 --> 02:29:23.698]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:29:23.698 --> 02:29:24.859]  Faketv.com
[02:29:25.828 --> 02:29:29.451]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[02:29:29.451 --> 02:29:36.816]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[02:29:36.816 --> 02:29:41.720]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:42.540]  There is.
[02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.122]  It's RightSocial.net.
[02:29:44.122 --> 02:29:45.483]  RightSocial.net.
[02:29:45.483 --> 02:29:48.825]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[02:29:48.825 --> 02:29:50.106]  RightSocial.net.
[02:29:50.106 --> 02:29:52.348]  Where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[02:29:52.348 --> 02:29:53.689]  RightSocial.net.
[02:29:53.689 --> 02:29:54.950]  The right place to be.
[02:29:56.627 --> 02:30:00.534]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:30:01.897 --> 02:30:10.581]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:30:10.581 --> 02:30:12.562]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:30:12.562 --> 02:30:16.024]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:30:16.024 --> 02:30:18.625]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:30:18.625 --> 02:30:20.926]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:30:20.926 --> 02:30:27.870]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[02:30:28.430 --> 02:30:38.218]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:30:38.218 --> 02:30:39.399]  We'll win.
[02:30:39.399 --> 02:30:42.322]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:30:42.322 --> 02:30:49.488]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[02:30:49.488 --> 02:30:53.171]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[02:30:53.171 --> 02:30:54.713]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:30:54.713 --> 02:30:55.573]  We need your support.
[02:30:55.573 --> 02:30:56.134]  I'm counting on you.
[02:30:56.610 --> 02:31:01.474]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:31:01.474 --> 02:31:10.940]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:15.724]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:31:53.935 --> 02:32:04.941]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:32:04.941 --> 02:32:06.401]  Believe me, I know.
[02:32:06.401 --> 02:32:11.104]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:32:11.104 --> 02:32:16.126]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:32:16.346 --> 02:32:36.509]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:32:37.009 --> 02:32:40.992]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:32:52.399 --> 02:33:00.064]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:00.064 --> 02:33:02.666]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.377 --> 02:33:23.627]  When I was growing up, both my grandmothers were not arrogant people.
[02:33:23.627 --> 02:33:24.448]  They were very humble.
[02:33:24.448 --> 02:33:26.170]  They were also very smart.
[02:33:28.542 --> 02:33:31.623]  Both my grandmothers told me that the Republic was going to be in threat.
[02:33:31.623 --> 02:33:32.443]  And that once again,
[02:33:53.610 --> 02:33:56.371]  We would have to sacrifice to save it.
[02:33:56.371 --> 02:33:59.653]  You hear this when you're like 8, 9, 10 years old.
[02:33:59.653 --> 02:34:01.354]  You think, this is really weird.
[02:34:01.354 --> 02:34:03.535]  My grandmother doesn't usually look like this.
[02:34:03.535 --> 02:34:06.356]  Their eyes on fire.
[02:34:06.356 --> 02:34:10.578]  They said, you'll learn the secrets later when you get older.
[02:34:10.578 --> 02:34:14.740]  But you've got to grow and you've got to learn those for yourself.
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:22.083]  And now, at 45 years old, and all the things we see happening, and how epic this struggle is,
[02:34:25.538 --> 02:34:28.260]  It's not embarrassing to hear about my ancestors.
[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:33.124]  Now I begin to become their peer.
[02:34:33.124 --> 02:34:36.587]  And all of you have incredible backgrounds, even if you lost track of it.
[02:34:36.587 --> 02:34:41.311]  The fact that you're alive means your ancestors went through amazing struggles.
[02:34:41.311 --> 02:34:49.338]  And there's been good in the universe, and there's been bad in the universe, and we've been traveling on twin tracks into the future together.
[02:34:49.338 --> 02:34:50.199]  It's been a long battle.
[02:34:52.558 --> 02:34:57.522]  And I get really guilty and I feel incredible weight on me.
[02:34:57.522 --> 02:34:58.403]  And believe me, I don't want to.
[02:34:58.403 --> 02:35:00.384]  I don't want to have a conscience that's so big sometimes.
[02:35:00.384 --> 02:35:05.188]  I think sociopaths, it must be really easy for them because I'm not doing enough.
[02:35:05.188 --> 02:35:06.349]  I'm not fighting hard enough.
[02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:07.630]  I know other enemies bad.
[02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:11.914]  I haven't found the way to defeat them.
[02:35:11.914 --> 02:35:13.455]  But God says it takes time.
[02:35:13.455 --> 02:35:15.156]  Relax.
[02:35:15.156 --> 02:35:16.077]  You've already done good.
[02:35:16.077 --> 02:35:17.518]  Just keep it up.
[02:35:17.518 --> 02:35:18.239]  Just hold the line.
[02:35:21.533 --> 02:35:34.525]  And then the election came and went, such pressure that I had to beat them, we had to stop them, and they got a small victory, but it didn't matter, because they had to do so many evil things to get it, that it woke up a lot of people.
[02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:47.696]  So at a spiritual level, as I said, even before the election, last Sunday, last Monday, I said, we're winning, but we're losing, but in the long term, we're winning the war, and
[02:35:48.877 --> 02:35:50.278]  Trump's going to make his move.
[02:35:50.278 --> 02:35:57.501]  And now that Trump has fired Sessions, who is obviously scared and compromised, whatever they've got on him.
[02:35:57.501 --> 02:36:00.382]  And now he's gone.
[02:36:00.382 --> 02:36:09.046]  And now they've got somebody that's on record and he's already coming out saying, the new Attorney General, saying he will not recuse himself on the fake Russiagate.
[02:36:09.046 --> 02:36:10.927]  He will not accept congressional subpoenas.
[02:36:10.927 --> 02:36:12.068]  No one ever does that.
[02:36:12.068 --> 02:36:13.529]  Separate powers.
[02:36:13.529 --> 02:36:14.269]  All this crap.
[02:36:14.269 --> 02:36:16.210]  They are so scared right now.
[02:36:18.439 --> 02:36:20.760]  And then he would indict Hillary Clinton.
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.403]  The arrogance of the enemy is now clear.
[02:36:24.403 --> 02:36:42.854]  And then you look at how the Attorney General, the former Attorney General Eric Holder is running Antifa and MoveOn.org and putting out press releases saying that get out there at 900 sites, get out there and go to people's houses and intimidate them.
[02:36:42.854 --> 02:36:44.936]  Do you think going to Tucker Carlson's house
[02:36:46.383 --> 02:36:56.407]  I know Tucker's got the big wasp hair and the nice suit and the gold watch his dad gave him, but I mean, you know people like Tucker Carlson, there's a lot more going on there than meets the eye.
[02:36:56.407 --> 02:36:59.708]  And if you think, we'll play this video in a minute, there's a bunch of these.
[02:36:59.708 --> 02:37:04.710]  If you think intimidating and threatening people's families makes them back off, it's the opposite scumbags.
[02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:11.993]  Now that's it.
[02:37:11.993 --> 02:37:15.254]  We've not won this war yet.
[02:37:15.254 --> 02:37:15.394]  But
[02:37:16.539 --> 02:37:17.759]  If you take action, we will.
[02:37:17.759 --> 02:37:19.260]  There's an article on Infowars.com.
[02:37:19.260 --> 02:37:19.960]  It's the live feed.
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:21.000]  Let's put it back up.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.540]  Thanks for doing that.
[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:23.501]  Watch live.
[02:37:23.501 --> 02:37:28.642]  Soros activates 900 antivitara cells.
[02:37:28.642 --> 02:37:31.643]  Leader of group calls for killing of police and Republicans.
[02:37:31.643 --> 02:37:32.123]  Red alert.
[02:37:32.123 --> 02:37:35.484]  Now, everything I said there's true.
[02:37:35.484 --> 02:37:37.084]  Earlier, I showed their press release.
[02:37:37.084 --> 02:37:38.224]  I showed Holder.
[02:37:38.224 --> 02:37:39.184]  I showed MoveOn.org.
[02:37:39.184 --> 02:37:45.126]  I showed the leader of it that sent the people to the House, the professor, saying all this.
[02:37:48.143 --> 02:37:49.444]  What is their response to that?
[02:37:49.444 --> 02:38:03.295]  I mean, if I was on the radio and on TV telling people, go and kill the Vice President, it's one thing if I was some crazy dude, you know, in some house saying it, you send the Secret Service, you get a mental evaluation.
[02:38:03.295 --> 02:38:05.797]  You see if you've got the means to do it.
[02:38:05.797 --> 02:38:12.663]  If you're powerful, and you say kill the Vice President or kill the President, you get SWAT teamed.
[02:38:12.663 --> 02:38:15.065]  And I mean in an hour.
[02:38:15.065 --> 02:38:16.186]  Or somebody's gonna get fired.
[02:38:17.287 --> 02:38:20.088]  So how did they have this unnatural position to do all this?
[02:38:20.088 --> 02:38:25.349]  Because they've had the Attorney General!
[02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:31.011]  So, a lot of people got sick of Antifa pointing guns at us and threatening us.
[02:38:31.011 --> 02:38:33.811]  And a little birdie told me that Antifa ran into some problems here.
[02:38:33.811 --> 02:38:36.992]  We haven't seen a lot of them out in Austin since then.
[02:38:36.992 --> 02:38:39.413]  But the whole point is, you guys are in a man's world.
[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:51.786]  And Antifa, though, is only the cannon fodder, the minions that go out so they can set somebody up when the deep state sends the real killers.
[02:38:51.786 --> 02:38:53.287]  That's what I keep trying to explain to people.
[02:38:53.287 --> 02:38:59.650]  The fact that they have deployed these folks and they're going to now go out to 900 targets, which is exactly what I said.
[02:38:59.650 --> 02:39:02.652]  I said a thousand to two thousand targets.
[02:39:05.401 --> 02:39:11.644]  Because that's about as much as anybody's ever tried to kill in one day when you do a political operation like this.
[02:39:11.644 --> 02:39:27.432]  So I'm going to tell you, if you're a prominent conservative or Christian or libertarian leader, if you're a Christian conservative leader who's never even been political but they know privately from their spies and reading your email, they have computers that do profiles, that you'd stand up in an emergency, you may not even know you'd do that.
[02:39:27.432 --> 02:39:29.293]  They've got AI that says you will.
[02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:30.394]  Maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong.
[02:39:30.394 --> 02:39:32.075]  They're going to kill you.
[02:39:34.116 --> 02:39:43.481]  So a lot of you out there who are prominent billionaires, successful people who've never really been in the arena, but they've got your profile, they got a hit team coming to kill you.
[02:39:43.481 --> 02:39:49.084]  Because they got people inside your organization, just like the Nazis would do, ready to take over your company.
[02:39:49.084 --> 02:39:50.105]  They also want that money.
[02:39:51.305 --> 02:39:54.667]  They're going to use this political upheaval to get control of that infrastructure.
[02:39:54.667 --> 02:39:57.509]  They want full control.
[02:39:57.509 --> 02:40:02.512]  Now just like authoritarians always do, once they get full control it always falls apart because they don't want to run things anymore.
[02:40:02.512 --> 02:40:04.173]  They just wanted the control.
[02:40:04.173 --> 02:40:05.894]  So you become Venezuela.
[02:40:05.894 --> 02:40:10.977]  Or North Korea.
[02:40:10.977 --> 02:40:18.341]  So, I don't have words right now to describe to you how incredibly serious this situation is.
[02:40:21.974 --> 02:40:22.494]  This is it.
[02:40:22.494 --> 02:40:25.436]  This is the attempt to kill the country 240 years later.
[02:40:25.436 --> 02:40:28.499]  And you're like, oh, America, it's not perfect.
[02:40:28.499 --> 02:40:30.720]  Have you studied what they're going to bring in?
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.183]  People ought to be on their knees to God begging we aren't defeated here.
[02:40:35.183 --> 02:40:37.085]  And I don't know what we're supposed to do at this point.
[02:40:37.085 --> 02:40:38.626]  I've already laid it all out.
[02:40:38.626 --> 02:40:41.248]  The president's taking action against him.
[02:40:41.248 --> 02:40:47.772]  The amount of traitors in the media and everywhere else, it's a problem.
[02:40:47.772 --> 02:40:49.614]  And maybe the country isn't even meant to be reprieved.
[02:40:51.107 --> 02:40:55.492]  All I know is I cannot stand down and go along with this.
[02:40:55.492 --> 02:41:03.120]  And I really feel sorry for people that serve the system, because the system you're bringing in is meant to destroy your own family and your own future.
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.524]  You know, they keep telling me that, hey, Alex, you might want to plug products.
[02:41:07.524 --> 02:41:09.206]  That's how we fund the operation.
[02:41:09.206 --> 02:41:10.307]  And it's true.
[02:41:10.307 --> 02:41:13.391]  Since I entered the big sale, our revenue has absolutely cratered the last week.
[02:41:14.529 --> 02:41:16.391]  And if we don't get funding, we won't be here.
[02:41:16.391 --> 02:41:17.812]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[02:41:17.812 --> 02:41:21.915]  So, in this serious time, understand we need war bonds.
[02:41:21.915 --> 02:41:22.816]  Look, just, you know what?
[02:41:22.816 --> 02:41:23.976]  Forget the deals, forget the specials.
[02:41:23.976 --> 02:41:25.898]  We got some of the biggest specials ever.
[02:41:25.898 --> 02:41:27.920]  And we got free shipping, store-wide.
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:31.182]  But let me just talk straight to the camera here.
[02:41:31.182 --> 02:41:33.504]  We can go to camera one.
[02:41:33.504 --> 02:41:34.965]  We've changed the world with your help.
[02:41:34.965 --> 02:41:36.346]  You've changed the world through us.
[02:41:36.346 --> 02:41:38.308]  We've changed it through you.
[02:41:38.308 --> 02:41:39.088]  I'm in your hands.
[02:41:39.088 --> 02:41:40.289]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:41:40.289 --> 02:41:41.070]  The world's in your hands.
[02:41:41.894 --> 02:41:47.418]  I've got really great products that everybody needs anyways, but we need your funding.
[02:41:47.418 --> 02:41:53.783]  We need money to do this and to continue to fight and hopefully expand, because if you don't expand, you contract.
[02:41:53.783 --> 02:41:55.965]  There is no middle ground.
[02:41:55.965 --> 02:41:59.108]  I need everybody today to realize how real all this is.
[02:41:59.108 --> 02:42:02.490]  I told you about the anti-vidoxing and going to the houses as the prelude.
[02:42:02.490 --> 02:42:04.392]  I even said they'll probably do it first with Tucker Carlson.
[02:42:04.392 --> 02:42:05.473]  I don't know how I know all this stuff.
[02:42:06.175 --> 02:42:09.277]  The point is, is that I need everybody to go.
[02:42:09.277 --> 02:42:16.880]  I really need a water filter system, and Alex Jones sells the highest rated ones out there, and they're 49% off right now.
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:21.763]  I should do that, or maybe I already got one that my cousin, or my mom, or my dad, or my son or daughter doesn't have.
[02:42:21.763 --> 02:42:28.166]  I'm gonna get Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system with five star reviews, 4.7 reviews.
[02:42:28.166 --> 02:42:31.047]  Or I'm gonna get X2, which is selling out.
[02:42:31.047 --> 02:42:31.728]  We have the new X3.
[02:42:31.728 --> 02:42:33.769]  People go, wait, X3 looks a little bit weaker.
[02:42:34.704 --> 02:42:36.466]  Well, yeah, because it's got three types of iodine.
[02:42:36.466 --> 02:42:38.808]  So there's less of one and then more of the other two.
[02:42:38.808 --> 02:42:41.170]  And it's not about cheapening or having something else.
[02:42:41.170 --> 02:42:42.471]  It's cheaper to put one type in there.
[02:42:42.471 --> 02:42:46.475]  It's better to put all three in triiodine.
[02:42:46.475 --> 02:42:46.875]  So X3.
[02:42:46.875 --> 02:42:47.375]  50% off as well.
[02:42:47.375 --> 02:42:48.596]  Free shipping storewide.
[02:42:48.596 --> 02:42:49.517]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:42:49.517 --> 02:42:51.279]  Without you, we won't be here.

[02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:52.200]  Thank you.
[02:42:55.421 --> 02:42:57.523]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.

[02:43:00.967 --> 02:43:03.390]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products.

[02:44:02.909 --> 02:44:12.151]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.

[02:44:22.182 --> 02:44:33.631]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[02:44:33.631 --> 02:44:42.718]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:44:43.178 --> 02:44:45.921]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[02:44:45.921 --> 02:44:49.586]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:44:49.586 --> 02:44:52.049]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:44:56.164 --> 02:45:05.456]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:45:05.456 --> 02:45:08.339]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:45:08.339 --> 02:45:14.387]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:45:15.047 --> 02:45:21.290]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:45:21.290 --> 02:45:27.574]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:45:27.574 --> 02:45:34.518]  Now, due to the Establishers trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:45:35.658 --> 02:45:48.687]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:45:48.687 --> 02:45:52.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:55.632]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[02:45:56.372 --> 02:46:00.615]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:46:00.615 --> 02:46:04.098]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:46:04.098 --> 02:46:05.859]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:46:05.859 --> 02:46:09.122]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:46:09.122 --> 02:46:15.907]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:46:15.907 --> 02:46:20.991]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:46:21.331 --> 02:46:27.435]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:27.435 --> 02:46:30.416]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:46:30.416 --> 02:46:31.517]  I want to keep going.
[02:46:31.517 --> 02:46:35.359]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:46:35.359 --> 02:46:37.360]  I want to push all the way.
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:38.661]  I've committed to do that.
[02:46:38.661 --> 02:46:39.742]  I've prayed for that.
[02:46:39.742 --> 02:46:41.382]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:46:41.382 --> 02:46:43.804]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:46:44.304 --> 02:46:45.424]  I will never falter.
[02:46:45.424 --> 02:46:47.965]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:46:47.965 --> 02:46:48.906]  I physically will.
[02:46:48.906 --> 02:46:59.630]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 444.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:46:59.630 --> 02:47:02.251]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.299 --> 02:47:19.641]  We're good to go.
[02:47:45.219 --> 02:47:54.685]  We know where you sleep at night.
[02:47:54.685 --> 02:47:56.626]  We know where you sleep at night!
[02:48:00.228 --> 02:48:01.689]  By the way, we got video coming up.
[02:48:01.689 --> 02:48:02.750]  The view.
[02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:04.492]  Those harpies.
[02:48:04.492 --> 02:48:09.476]  Yuko Hosei, White House female aide committed battery against Acosta.
[02:48:09.476 --> 02:48:10.577]  She shouldn't have touched him.
[02:48:10.577 --> 02:48:11.097]  Well, wait!
[02:48:11.097 --> 02:48:17.202]  That's all fake video where she tries to get the mic back when he won't give it up and he shoves her arm down and grabs it away from her.
[02:48:17.202 --> 02:48:17.783]  Didn't happen.
[02:48:17.783 --> 02:48:24.748]  It's fake video that InfoWars has like, you know, Industrial Light and Magic or Pixar.
[02:48:24.748 --> 02:48:25.869]  We just made it all.
[02:48:25.869 --> 02:48:26.310]  It's fake.
[02:48:27.952 --> 02:48:29.393]  At first, there was no altercation.
[02:48:29.393 --> 02:48:34.834]  He didn't even touch her, he says.
[02:48:34.834 --> 02:48:40.316]  But again, we uploaded it, so it was a little bit grey, because it was re-uploaded, and that, they say, is fake.
[02:48:40.316 --> 02:48:42.157]  Okay.
[02:48:42.157 --> 02:48:43.017]  They're all over the news.
[02:48:43.017 --> 02:48:46.399]  Fox News, CNN, ban InfoWars, ban Paul Watson.
[02:48:46.399 --> 02:48:48.679]  He's fake!
[02:48:48.679 --> 02:48:52.761]  Media lies, claims, Acosta Video is doctored.
[02:48:54.599 --> 02:48:58.042]  Press invents bizarre conspiracy theory to distract from Acosta's behavior.
[02:48:58.042 --> 02:49:12.214]  That's a great article by Paul Joseph Watson, but writer accused, reporter accused of fabricating Acosta incident, or Acosta manhandling woman.
[02:49:12.214 --> 02:49:14.476]  No, let's just change Paul's.
[02:49:14.476 --> 02:49:15.457]  I'm actually the head of Infowars.
[02:49:15.457 --> 02:49:16.237]  I'm the editor.
[02:49:16.237 --> 02:49:17.499]  I can even change headlines.
[02:49:17.499 --> 02:49:19.060]  Let's change Paul's headline.
[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:19.700]  Here's the headline I want.
[02:49:22.256 --> 02:49:35.001]  Reporter accused of doctoring Acosta, overpowering woman, at White House briefing, stands his ground.
[02:49:35.001 --> 02:49:37.402]  Sub-headline.
[02:49:37.402 --> 02:49:46.685]  Video was not edited, was C-SPAN original, only zoomed in, so that you could see the manhandling clearer.
[02:49:46.685 --> 02:49:50.687]  Side-by-side videos show media involved in giant oaths.
[02:49:54.918 --> 02:49:56.018]  But wait!
[02:49:56.018 --> 02:50:05.620]  He says it never happened, but Whoopi Goldberg and the other liars, they say she assaulted him!
[02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:11.262]  Oh my God, these people are unbelievable.
[02:50:11.262 --> 02:50:13.022]  But here's the problem.
[02:50:13.022 --> 02:50:15.963]  We have a new Attorney General.
[02:50:15.963 --> 02:50:16.883]  We have two months
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:21.323]  Until they seek that Democrat House that's going to go on.
[02:50:21.323 --> 02:50:28.388]  If you thought we've seen a witch hunt, baby, the new name of Congress is going to be Salem Witch Trials.
[02:50:28.388 --> 02:50:29.869]  And they're going to go crazy.
[02:50:29.869 --> 02:50:36.295]  We got two months to clean out the executive branch, to start acting like it's the executive branch, and to start going after the crooks.
[02:50:37.642 --> 02:50:41.063]  And I think there's going to be criminal investigations, which we have them open and shut.
[02:50:41.063 --> 02:50:43.203]  Mueller delivering uranium.
[02:50:43.203 --> 02:50:46.504]  Hillary getting 30-something million to give 20% of our uranium.
[02:50:46.504 --> 02:50:50.585]  The Chi-Com deals, the illegal servers, the smuggling kids out of Haiti.
[02:50:50.585 --> 02:50:52.306]  I mean, they're in one of these people.
[02:50:52.306 --> 02:51:00.048]  Mueller should be investigated for running Epstein's aircraft for that subgroup in the FBI.
[02:51:00.048 --> 02:51:05.229]  Not the whole FBI, but the subgroup that would then have Epstein and world leaders having sex with little kids.
[02:51:06.886 --> 02:51:16.692]  Reportedly, old Muller didn't get his old Diggly Dong involved in it, but his old Diggly Dong, but he sure as hell shot the video.
[02:51:16.692 --> 02:51:19.214]  That's what he does in his off time.
[02:51:19.214 --> 02:51:22.476]  Got some private production things like, Muller's a killer, aren't you scared?
[02:51:22.476 --> 02:51:24.157]  Oh no, I'm fighting because he is.
[02:51:24.157 --> 02:51:26.579]  Only way to go up against this is head on, baby.
[02:51:26.579 --> 02:51:27.880]  Rocket fuel.
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:29.541]  I'm like humongous and Mad Max.
[02:51:29.541 --> 02:51:32.343]  I may not make it out of this, but I'm like, I'm turning the nitrous oxide on and
[02:51:35.097 --> 02:51:44.924]  Or I'm like the guy on the front of the Humongous's truck, where they like finally get down with the bolt cutters and have to unlock.
[02:51:44.924 --> 02:51:48.806]  I'm not saying I'm the titan, but I'm like a little baby titan.
[02:51:48.806 --> 02:51:51.388]  And we gotta clash the titans when they release the Kraken.
[02:51:51.388 --> 02:51:52.569]  Because that's what I'm doing here.
[02:51:52.569 --> 02:51:57.952]  I mean, if I don't resist Mueller and other horrible people, I feel like I'm going to hell.
[02:51:57.952 --> 02:51:58.713]  It's like torture.
[02:51:59.738 --> 02:52:05.800]  I mean, look at these arrogant people strutting in front of the media like they're badass.
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:07.260]  They'll deal with the electorate.
[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:08.641]  They'll deal with the election of Trump.
[02:52:08.641 --> 02:52:10.941]  They'll deal with the 4.8% economy.
[02:52:10.941 --> 02:52:13.102]  They'll deal with taking care of the veterans.
[02:52:13.102 --> 02:52:16.163]  They'll deal with real show America.
[02:52:16.163 --> 02:52:18.804]  I'm Robert Mueller III.
[02:52:18.804 --> 02:52:20.924]  I'm married to the family that helped kill Kennedy.
[02:52:20.924 --> 02:52:22.085]  Why, we kill people.
[02:52:22.085 --> 02:52:23.325]  We're really scary.
[02:52:23.325 --> 02:52:25.506]  Yeah, there are other folks that do that too, Mueller.
[02:52:26.286 --> 02:52:27.867]  That's easy.
[02:52:27.867 --> 02:52:30.009]  Killing people is like taking a crap.
[02:52:30.009 --> 02:52:30.890]  Or having sex.
[02:52:30.890 --> 02:52:32.891]  Anybody can do it.
[02:52:32.891 --> 02:52:40.638]  But only patriots can go through their fear against the deep state and not join the power structure to make a better world.
[02:52:40.638 --> 02:52:42.579]  And that's why you fear us.
[02:52:42.579 --> 02:52:44.381]  Because we don't have fear.
[02:52:44.381 --> 02:52:48.204]  We only have fear of letting you run things.
[02:52:48.204 --> 02:52:49.305]  Stick with the plan.
[02:52:49.305 --> 02:52:50.045]  Stick with Mueller.
[02:52:50.045 --> 02:52:50.946]  Stick with Sessions.
[02:52:50.946 --> 02:52:52.868]  Why, they're jolly old pals with Trump.
[02:52:54.195 --> 02:52:56.724]  Meanwhile, I talk to high level people, they're like, no, they're horrible.
[02:52:59.602 --> 02:53:00.262]  What does it matter?
[02:53:00.262 --> 02:53:04.664]  There was a message board on 4chan that was doxing Alex Jones and people.
[02:53:04.664 --> 02:53:06.065]  Because I'm the bad guy.
[02:53:06.065 --> 02:53:07.506]  I'm going to prison.
[02:53:07.506 --> 02:53:09.266]  I'm the one that doesn't like NAFTA and GATT.
[02:53:09.266 --> 02:53:11.047]  I'm the one that doesn't want TPP.
[02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:12.948]  I'm the one defending the Second Amendment.
[02:53:12.948 --> 02:53:14.629]  I'm the one defending free market.
[02:53:14.629 --> 02:53:17.030]  I'm the, oh, I'm the bad man.
[02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:19.251]  But the no one knows who they are.
[02:53:19.251 --> 02:53:20.492]  They're the good guys.
[02:53:20.492 --> 02:53:25.494]  Because no one criticizes the shadowy guys.
[02:53:25.494 --> 02:53:27.655]  With no credibility, no name, no nothing.
[02:53:28.643 --> 02:53:32.145]  The Peter Strock's of the world there on the 4chan and 8chan board.
[02:53:32.145 --> 02:53:34.267]  Oh yeah, that's Skew-It-On right there on screen.
[02:53:34.267 --> 02:53:38.189]  There he is.
[02:53:38.189 --> 02:53:42.512]  I bet he sucked a couple of diggly-dongs last night.
[02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:49.457]  Anyways, the point is, I just like to say diggly-dong.
[02:53:49.457 --> 02:53:50.117]  Look at that, man.
[02:53:50.117 --> 02:53:53.500]  That is the Jezebel spirit right there.
[02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:56.742]  You know, I don't think women can really be what you call bitches, female dogs.
[02:53:58.012 --> 02:54:02.153]  But old Strzok, that's... It's men that act like bitches.
[02:54:02.153 --> 02:54:05.654]  Nothing weirder than a guy acting all Nelly.
[02:54:05.654 --> 02:54:08.815]  Like, it's the worst traits of a man, the worst traits of a woman.
[02:54:08.815 --> 02:54:12.256]  And the Diggly Dongs around.
[02:54:12.256 --> 02:54:14.717]  Peter, Diggly Dong, Strzok.
[02:54:14.717 --> 02:54:16.257]  And the Diggly Dong crew.
[02:54:16.257 --> 02:54:22.959]  And it's all sycophantic, they all just worship each other and they say, Oh, you hijacked America, we worship you!
[02:54:22.959 --> 02:54:23.139]  Oh!
[02:54:23.139 --> 02:54:24.179]  Oh!
[02:54:24.179 --> 02:54:26.300]  And of course they hate one thing more than anything, the military.
[02:54:27.039 --> 02:54:34.821]  Because those people that are actually willing to go fight and die and be in bad conditions and kill people, they don't want to be able to do that, but they would never do it.
[02:54:34.821 --> 02:54:44.905]  They just walk around all day as a bunch of dirty lawyers, kissing each other's butts all day, and setting people up, and screwing over clients, and ha ha ha.
[02:54:44.905 --> 02:54:46.565]  Oh, it's going to go on forever.
[02:54:46.565 --> 02:54:47.825]  Let me get the number out.
[02:54:47.825 --> 02:54:49.686]  We're going to take a couple segments of calls.
[02:54:49.686 --> 02:54:52.367]  We've got some great people coming in to join us here in studio.
[02:54:54.079 --> 02:54:54.719]  The A.G.
[02:54:54.719 --> 02:54:55.559]  is gone!
[02:54:55.559 --> 02:54:57.880]  Ding dong, the witch is dead!
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:54:59.080]  The witch, oh witch!
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:00.240]  The witch, witch, witch!
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:02.761]  Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead!
[02:55:02.761 --> 02:55:07.402]  He just flew away with those little ears.
[02:55:07.402 --> 02:55:10.523]  They're new offspring.
[02:55:10.523 --> 02:55:12.283]  They had them like in a grand dragon outfit.
[02:55:12.283 --> 02:55:14.624]  I think that's probably what they had.
[02:55:14.624 --> 02:55:17.405]  Little diggly dong time.
[02:55:17.405 --> 02:55:18.845]  There you go, old diggly dong.
[02:55:19.721 --> 02:55:20.742]  Now that's edited video.
[02:55:20.742 --> 02:55:21.302]  That's not real.
[02:55:21.302 --> 02:55:23.224]  Oh, by the way, Daria made a great point.
[02:55:23.224 --> 02:55:26.747]  They constantly put up edited video to set the stuff.
[02:55:26.747 --> 02:55:30.950]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, Trump lording over a little girl that cried.
[02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:32.531]  Wasn't a real photo.
[02:55:32.531 --> 02:55:34.373]  Little girl wasn't taken from her parents.
[02:55:34.373 --> 02:55:42.179]  Hadn't had food in over a day because her horrible mother uses her as a human shield to go through with what her husband admitted was some weird clandestine operation.
[02:55:43.206 --> 02:55:47.947]  We can only guess why she smuggles up from Central America once a year using her kid as a shield.
[02:55:47.947 --> 02:55:50.367]  Gee, I wonder what mommy's doing.
[02:55:50.367 --> 02:55:53.288]  It's not her that's bad, it's Trump that's bad!
[02:55:53.288 --> 02:55:54.228]  That's fake!
[02:55:54.228 --> 02:55:55.829]  That's doctored!
[02:55:55.829 --> 02:55:58.329]  That's manufactured!
[02:55:58.329 --> 02:56:05.050]  But Paul Watson uploads video and it gets a shade grayer because it's been up, downloaded, uploaded.
[02:56:05.050 --> 02:56:07.571]  And Paul doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to video.
[02:56:07.571 --> 02:56:11.532]  And my lord, look at that woman, a saltacosta!
[02:56:11.532 --> 02:56:12.532]  Well, you heard it on
[02:56:14.902 --> 02:56:17.083]  You heard it on CNN.
[02:56:17.083 --> 02:56:18.744]  Good people right there.
[02:56:18.744 --> 02:56:22.145]  How dare us get caught in that fake video.
[02:56:22.145 --> 02:56:25.546]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:56:25.546 --> 02:56:26.546]  Here's the number to join us.
[02:56:26.546 --> 02:56:29.587]  We'll take a few segments, a few calls throughout the next hour.
[02:56:29.587 --> 02:56:30.628]  What's your take on all this?
[02:56:30.628 --> 02:56:31.468]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[02:56:41.431 --> 02:56:49.975]  Remember, Antifa's been activated, 900 sites they're gonna target, more people's houses, more harassment, more everything.
[02:56:49.975 --> 02:56:59.139]  And you know, I'm not scared of Antifa, they're just the useful idiots that are gonna get set up and sent to Supermax prisons later, if the Globalists are successful.
[02:56:59.139 --> 02:57:01.080]  They're sending assassination teams.
[02:57:04.468 --> 02:57:09.051]  Poor, stupid Antifa are just the patsies.
[02:57:09.051 --> 02:57:10.312]  The decoys.
[02:57:10.312 --> 02:57:11.053]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:57:11.053 --> 02:57:13.895]  Please remember, without Lister's support, we are not here.
[02:57:13.895 --> 02:57:17.717]  We've got the best supplements, the best t-shirts, the best books, the best films.
[02:57:17.717 --> 02:57:19.158]  Your support's been amazing, thank you.
[02:57:19.158 --> 02:57:25.343]  If you've never purchased products, or you haven't in a while, we need funding or they win!
[02:57:25.343 --> 02:57:26.984]  I need money to fight, I get that?
[02:57:26.984 --> 02:57:30.607]  But it's two equations, I gotta be willing to die, and I gotta have money.
[02:57:30.607 --> 02:57:32.488]  I'm willing to die, I need the money.
[02:57:33.416 --> 02:57:35.079]  So, give me the money!
[02:57:35.079 --> 02:57:35.861]  Show me the money!
[02:57:35.861 --> 02:57:36.782]  We got great products you need.

[02:58:50.493 --> 02:58:56.216]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:58:56.216 --> 02:59:04.081]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:59:04.081 --> 02:59:07.243]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:59:07.423 --> 02:59:12.705]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:59:12.705 --> 02:59:15.485]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:59:15.485 --> 02:59:24.468]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:59:24.628 --> 02:59:36.475]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:59:36.475 --> 02:59:41.298]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:41.298 --> 02:59:49.583]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:49.583 --> 02:59:52.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.004 --> 03:00:12.589]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:12.589 --> 03:00:29.157]  Well, for two weeks, I have doubled the guards at the office and at my house, and I said, look for Antifa to start doxing prominent conservatives and Fox News personalities, ahead of them launching their full armed assault
[03:00:30.780 --> 03:00:39.972]  ...on conservative and libertarian and nationalist leaders, and that will all be a prelude to the assassination of the president.
[03:00:39.972 --> 03:00:45.400]  Let's just say, I've got the Pentagon and other people's attention predicting all of this, but it's not hard to do.
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:47.602]  We have the entire enemy battle plan.
[03:00:48.396 --> 03:00:54.583]  And I've been on the phone with leading individuals today, laying out exactly what move they're going to make next.
[03:00:54.583 --> 03:01:07.698]  I told people last night, they're going to mobilize in every city, Antifa terror squads, who are only the decoys, to probe defenses at people's homes, offices and infrastructures.
[03:01:08.735 --> 03:01:28.194]  Then, once the targets have been basically lathed in a low-tech fashion, then the real teams, MS-13, Hezbollah, and others that openly are being used as an auxiliary army by the deep state here in the United States, with plausible deniability, can begin to hit targets.
[03:01:28.194 --> 03:01:31.317]  So maximum red alert, ladies and gentlemen, maximum red alert.
[03:01:32.077 --> 03:01:34.018]  They have foreign paramilitary teams.
[03:01:34.018 --> 03:01:35.838]  They have MS-13.
[03:01:35.838 --> 03:01:40.180]  They have Hezbollah inside the United States publicly working with the Democrats.
[03:01:40.180 --> 03:01:44.441]  They have the professor class that's the Antifa class.
[03:01:44.441 --> 03:01:52.144]  They are the group that again are just organizing the patsies at the lower level in case they ever lose or things fall apart.
[03:01:52.144 --> 03:01:53.905]  They have plausible deniability.
[03:01:53.905 --> 03:01:57.586]  I have all the total proof when we come back from break.
[03:01:58.567 --> 03:02:03.814]  Now, what did I say three months ago that got me, quote, banned off Twitter?
[03:02:03.814 --> 03:02:09.761]  I said Antifa is preparing to come to your homes if you're in your ice, if you're somebody like Tucker Carlson.
[03:02:09.761 --> 03:02:11.664]  I actually talked about Tucker Carlson in the 25-minute video.
[03:02:13.380 --> 03:02:16.161]  And I said, that's just first level.
[03:02:16.161 --> 03:02:33.145]  After that, you need to have your battle rifles ready to defend yourself because that means the threat level goes way up and it shows that the globalists have at least taken the safety off and put their finger on the trigger or the detonator to go to a hot war here in the United States.
[03:02:33.145 --> 03:02:35.905]  This is a maximum total red alert.
[03:02:35.905 --> 03:02:37.466]  Trump started getting rid of Sessions.
[03:02:38.499 --> 03:02:41.380]  Getting rid of the deep state double agents.
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:44.661]  He's got an acting Attorney General in here that is a patriot, 100%.
[03:02:44.661 --> 03:02:50.483]  And it says he's ready to move against them, even in op-eds in USA Today.
[03:02:50.483 --> 03:02:53.744]  Acting AG says he would indict Hillary and many others.
[03:02:53.744 --> 03:02:55.085]  We have them.
[03:02:55.085 --> 03:03:01.627]  So they are now going to make their move, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:01.627 --> 03:03:02.327]  This is it.
[03:03:02.327 --> 03:03:03.408]  And you go to InfoWars.com.
[03:03:03.408 --> 03:03:03.748]  900 groups
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:09.502]  Mobilized, and who mobilized them?
[03:03:09.502 --> 03:03:15.647]  The former Attorney General put out tweets and is quoted in MoveOn.org.
[03:03:15.647 --> 03:03:16.828]  Who's the main funder of that?
[03:03:16.828 --> 03:03:17.948]  You guessed it.
[03:03:17.948 --> 03:03:19.810]  George and Alexander Soros.
[03:03:19.810 --> 03:03:26.095]  Soros is beginning to fade a bit at 89, but it's now Alexander in command.
[03:03:26.095 --> 03:03:27.176]  And it's just incredible.
[03:03:27.176 --> 03:03:30.339]  We have secret documents that were again obtained earlier this year.
[03:03:31.650 --> 03:03:36.375]  That showed their previous battle plans to cause civil emergencies and martial law.
[03:03:36.375 --> 03:03:39.097]  Those plans in 2015 failed.
[03:03:39.097 --> 03:03:39.938]  But we have them.
[03:03:39.938 --> 03:03:41.420]  We have their blueprints.
[03:03:41.420 --> 03:03:42.561]  We have their battle plans.
[03:03:42.561 --> 03:03:51.710]  We would be completely and totally maniac-level stupid, ladies and gentlemen, if we did not get this information out.
[03:03:51.710 --> 03:03:55.113]  Separately, you've got Ruth Bader Ginsburg falling down and breaking three ribs.
[03:03:56.295 --> 03:04:00.761]  You've got reports that the Pope and the Italian media is imminently about to resign.
[03:04:00.761 --> 03:04:06.789]  We have got the war vet Slaughter's Twelve at the Borderline Bar who reportedly had PTSD.
[03:04:06.789 --> 03:04:09.092]  When I saw the horrible footage...
[03:04:11.937 --> 03:04:14.838]  When I got up this morning, I thought, man, those people are all in really good shape.
[03:04:14.838 --> 03:04:15.798]  Their shirts are all off.
[03:04:15.798 --> 03:04:20.359]  They've all got Marine Corps tattoos on their chest and things.
[03:04:20.359 --> 03:04:23.400]  And it was basically a Marine Corps hangout bar.
[03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:25.421]  And I guess somebody dissed this guy or something.
[03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:29.982]  And look, they started doing the instinctive killing training in about the 60s.
[03:04:29.982 --> 03:04:34.203]  And when people go haywire with that training, it kills the inhibition and our hearts go out to everybody.
[03:04:35.515 --> 03:04:44.439]  This story itself, compared to Antifa activating the terror cells and the shadow government army activating, is the big news.
[03:04:44.439 --> 03:04:48.260]  We could just be hours away from paramilitary hits across the country.
[03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:51.802]  So, ladies and gentlemen, get your firearms out and ready to defend yourself.
[03:04:54.505 --> 03:05:01.971]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[03:05:01.971 --> 03:05:11.238]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[03:05:11.238 --> 03:05:20.306]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as acid xanthan and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:05:21.247 --> 03:05:32.700]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[03:05:32.700 --> 03:05:41.790]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[03:05:42.250 --> 03:05:44.992]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.
[03:05:44.992 --> 03:05:48.654]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[03:05:48.654 --> 03:05:58.120]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:58.120 --> 03:06:00.782]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:00.782 --> 03:06:05.925]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:12.714 --> 03:06:21.820]  This is a total 100% maximum alert for the Republic, for you and your family, and for the entire world.
[03:06:21.820 --> 03:06:32.827]  The United States has been in a cold civil war with globalist forces and patriotic loyal to the Republic forces.
[03:06:32.827 --> 03:06:37.931]  I have tracked George Soros, the Deep State, Eric Holder, and Obama.
[03:06:39.227 --> 03:06:46.297]  And MSNBC and CNN promoting and preparing Antifa in the last decade for what they're now doing.
[03:06:46.297 --> 03:06:54.268]  Mobs of them in 900 areas in the United States under moveon.org command of George Soros and Alexander Soros.
[03:06:54.969 --> 03:07:14.097]  ...are now going to go to conservatives, Christians, libertarians, prominent people's homes, lawmakers' homes and businesses, to bang on the windows, to break down doors in the case of Tucker Carlson's home, cracking and crushing in the door, saying, we got pipe bombs, we're here, we're gonna get ya!
[03:07:14.097 --> 03:07:15.078]  You think you're safe?
[03:07:17.967 --> 03:07:19.028]  It's all here.
[03:07:19.028 --> 03:07:24.011]  But they're only preparing so that they get the blame later.
[03:07:24.011 --> 03:07:29.115]  But it's really going to be Hezbollah, the Iranian forces allied with Obama.
[03:07:29.115 --> 03:07:32.017]  That's the deal.
[03:07:32.017 --> 03:07:36.240]  And it's going to be MS-13, because they have plausible deniability.
[03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:41.463]  They have killers that are ready to follow orders, ready to be given targets.
[03:07:41.463 --> 03:07:45.206]  So I'm telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[03:07:47.332 --> 03:07:52.374]  They also have some leftist veterans, but it's very, very hard for them to find people that are competent, who are U.S.
[03:07:52.374 --> 03:07:54.294]  citizens, that will engage in the type of evil.
[03:07:54.294 --> 03:07:57.115]  Now, I have stacks of news proving all this.
[03:07:57.115 --> 03:08:06.058]  The main leader of the Antifa group, directly funded by Alexander Soros, we have the documents, we have the newscast, I literally have like 25 mainstream articles about this right here.
[03:08:06.058 --> 03:08:09.999]  He is the one that says, kill all white people, he's white, he says,
[03:08:10.919 --> 03:08:15.200]  Kill Pence, kill the Trump family.
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:21.301]  He is the group commander that sent the people in to go after Ted Cruz.
[03:08:21.301 --> 03:08:28.663]  And he is the person in command of the group who's allowed to operate on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of followers to send people to Tucker Carlson's house.
[03:08:28.663 --> 03:08:29.683]  It's this group.
[03:08:29.683 --> 03:08:30.983]  I'm going to say that again.
[03:08:30.983 --> 03:08:35.644]  The leader, or you mean the idiot moron Patsy that has no idea that he's being set up.
[03:08:37.372 --> 03:08:42.394]  Known as Pencil Neck or Pez Dispenser Man by Paul Watson.
[03:08:42.394 --> 03:08:48.257]  In the card deck, he's known as the Moron Patsy, the sucker.
[03:08:48.257 --> 03:08:52.019]  You know, the guy that's gonna get the fall for this.
[03:08:52.019 --> 03:08:55.120]  He is all over the news and the media's like, yeah, he's a good guy.
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:57.121]  Kill all cops, kill all white people.
[03:08:57.121 --> 03:08:58.662]  What he wants for Christmas is dead cops.
[03:08:58.662 --> 03:09:00.582]  What he wants is, you know, kill Mike Pence.
[03:09:00.582 --> 03:09:03.904]  And he hasn't gotten in any trouble because the Justice Department
[03:09:06.857 --> 03:09:11.220]  Because the Justice Department was controlled by his bosses.
[03:09:11.220 --> 03:09:13.162]  Eric Holder commands this group.
[03:09:13.162 --> 03:09:14.883]  I have mainstream news.
[03:09:14.883 --> 03:09:21.808]  Eric Holder is in command right now with Hillary and Obama and Alexander Soros of these groups.
[03:09:21.808 --> 03:09:26.251]  He is the idiot that then goes out and gives the public order.
[03:09:26.251 --> 03:09:27.552]  So I'm going to say that again.
[03:09:27.552 --> 03:09:34.858]  The people that came to Tucker Carlson's house, more than 40 of them, that blocked the street, wouldn't let cars in or out, who took control,
[03:09:36.520 --> 03:09:36.640]  Yes.
[03:09:57.808 --> 03:10:00.549]  They're routinely at the house alone.
[03:10:00.549 --> 03:10:01.769]  They were not there.
[03:10:01.769 --> 03:10:03.430]  They were about to get back.
[03:10:03.430 --> 03:10:09.251]  But his wife was there and thought a home intruders were coming in and had to get in the pantry.
[03:10:09.251 --> 03:10:11.652]  Of course, in DC, you really can't even have a gun.
[03:10:11.652 --> 03:10:13.612]  We won the Supreme Court ruling, but it hasn't happened yet.
[03:10:13.612 --> 03:10:20.794]  So imagine, this is a group run by someone saying, I want to kill all the conservatives.
[03:10:20.794 --> 03:10:23.555]  Go read his tweets, read his statements, watch his videos.
[03:10:23.555 --> 03:10:26.056]  He's a New York professor.
[03:10:26.056 --> 03:10:26.516]  Pencil neck.
[03:10:28.405 --> 03:10:36.547]  And then when these groups show up at your house, ladies and gentlemen, understand they are run by people that say they want to kill you!
[03:10:36.547 --> 03:10:49.210]  And I committed the big cardinal sin three months ago when I said they're going to activate Antifa groups to go threaten people at their houses and then Antifa will be set up and it's going to be Hezbollah and it's going to be
[03:10:50.758 --> 03:10:55.003]  Uh, MS-13 groups that are involved, maybe even some Chi-Con groups.
[03:10:55.003 --> 03:11:06.794]  And it upset the leftist arm of the CIA so much that I reverse-engineered every piece of their operation and studied other covert operations that they run in other parts of the world that I exactly laid out exactly their blueprint.
[03:11:06.794 --> 03:11:08.056]  Because I had all the pieces, they were already there.
[03:11:09.875 --> 03:11:11.397]  And that's why they said, oh, it's so scary.
[03:11:11.397 --> 03:11:12.458]  He's saying kill the media.
[03:11:12.458 --> 03:11:13.279]  Get him off.
[03:11:13.279 --> 03:11:14.381]  Take the video down.
[03:11:14.381 --> 03:11:16.524]  It was an emergency message to the president.
[03:11:16.524 --> 03:11:17.104]  I didn't say that.
[03:11:17.104 --> 03:11:19.087]  I said, they come to your house.
[03:11:19.087 --> 03:11:22.852]  The first wave will just say that we know where you live.
[03:11:22.852 --> 03:11:26.617]  But the next wave is to kill you.
[03:11:26.617 --> 03:11:28.319]  A paramilitary attack.
[03:11:29.093 --> 03:11:32.436]  Not by pencil neck, not by their 900 groups going out.
[03:11:32.436 --> 03:11:35.219]  They are simply being shut up as the patsies.
[03:11:35.219 --> 03:11:40.264]  And they don't want Antifa, the meth heads, and all the rest of them to hear this and know this.
[03:11:40.264 --> 03:11:43.367]  They don't want me up here blowing their whole operation like I always do.
[03:11:43.367 --> 03:11:48.291]  And I'm not bragging, but ladies and gentlemen, this is what I do.
[03:11:48.291 --> 03:11:49.813]  And I'm almost never wrong.
[03:11:49.813 --> 03:11:51.414]  And now I'm proven right again.
[03:11:51.414 --> 03:11:54.277]  So this country is in a maximum total red alert.
[03:11:57.813 --> 03:11:59.554]  Now, who's above this guy?
[03:11:59.554 --> 03:12:00.134]  Who funds him?
[03:12:00.134 --> 03:12:01.775]  Alexander Soros.
[03:12:01.775 --> 03:12:02.575]  Who's above that?
[03:12:02.575 --> 03:12:04.396]  Eric Holder.
[03:12:04.396 --> 03:12:07.838]  The former Attorney General is in command.
[03:12:07.838 --> 03:12:10.720]  And his people were still in command.
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:12.481]  Inside the Justice Department.
[03:12:12.481 --> 03:12:16.042]  And Trump just went... Rosenstein has no more power.
[03:12:16.042 --> 03:12:18.404]  A new AG is on top of him.
[03:12:18.404 --> 03:12:20.525]  And these guys are scared.
[03:12:20.525 --> 03:12:22.706]  And they should be, because they have gone for broke.
[03:12:23.516 --> 03:12:49.314]  They have overthrown so many countries, they have engaged in the Arab Spring, they have looted society to the hilt, and now they are being resisted and they don't know what to do, so they've dispatched 900 scumbag groups to go out and get it on the news, where the house is, to create hysteria, to create fear, to get other copycats to go in, to create a fog of war, so when the establishment's ready,
[03:12:50.117 --> 03:12:53.958]  In the dead of night, like a ringwraith, to pull their sword.
[03:12:53.958 --> 03:12:56.118]  No one knows they're an expert coming in.
[03:12:56.118 --> 03:12:58.799]  Well, I just told you!
[03:12:58.799 --> 03:13:02.979]  And the enemy specifically cannot stand that report because it is dead on.
[03:13:02.979 --> 03:13:05.300]  In fact, it was taken off Twitter, YouTube, everywhere.
[03:13:05.300 --> 03:13:06.600]  Let's find that report.
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:07.480]  I know we have the full thing.
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:08.800]  Let's upload that.
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:15.042]  This is the emergency broadcast exposing the Antifa detonation of the Civil War.
[03:13:15.042 --> 03:13:16.982]  Again, we're not facing an Antifa army.
[03:13:17.796 --> 03:13:20.777]  We're facing them as the detonator.
[03:13:20.777 --> 03:13:27.139]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have so many other huge stories here.
[03:13:27.139 --> 03:13:32.581]  The Attorney General gone, the Deep State, QAnon, blown into a trillion pieces of the fraud it was.
[03:13:32.581 --> 03:13:34.802]  And I'm not being mean to people that followed it or liked it.
[03:13:34.802 --> 03:13:39.264]  You know, it's, oh, there's this secret thing and everything's handled and Sessions is good.
[03:13:39.264 --> 03:13:40.684]  No, he's not.
[03:13:40.684 --> 03:13:41.104]  OK?
[03:13:41.104 --> 03:13:44.306]  I've talked to the highest levels who told me, no, is Sessions good?
[03:13:44.306 --> 03:13:45.406]  No, Sessions is not.
[03:13:47.168 --> 03:13:52.854]  So, I'm a famous, well-known person that does talk to the highest levels of the government.
[03:13:52.854 --> 03:13:57.919]  But then some mysterious thing over here is telling you all this is going on, so everything's okay.
[03:13:57.919 --> 03:13:59.160]  Stick with the program.
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:00.542]  You know, don't question.
[03:14:00.542 --> 03:14:03.445]  We all go one way, everybody else goes with it.
[03:14:03.445 --> 03:14:04.586]  All this BS, okay?
[03:14:06.647 --> 03:14:07.888]  Trump is under attack.
[03:14:07.888 --> 03:14:09.028]  America is under attack.
[03:14:09.028 --> 03:14:12.609]  Trump is like a lion surrounded by hyenas trying to bring the country back.
[03:14:12.609 --> 03:14:18.572]  And the enemy and the globalists and the foreign money and the censorship and all of it is coming down like a wrecking ball.
[03:14:18.572 --> 03:14:23.894]  The only way Trump could go after big tech was with the Justice Department.
[03:14:23.894 --> 03:14:27.275]  And that's why the enemy is now going to make their move.
[03:14:27.275 --> 03:14:28.956]  Trump isn't going to play nice guy anymore.
[03:14:29.696 --> 03:14:32.759]  He knows they're gunning for him with made-up crap for his son.
[03:14:32.759 --> 03:14:33.860]  They're gunning for Stone.
[03:14:33.860 --> 03:14:39.124]  They're gunning for me because we're American patriots that'll line up and fight.
[03:14:39.124 --> 03:14:40.105]  And they know it.
[03:14:40.105 --> 03:14:41.106]  Nothing special.
[03:14:41.106 --> 03:14:43.468]  We're just people that'll line up and defend the country.
[03:14:43.468 --> 03:14:44.889]  We're not traitors.
[03:14:44.889 --> 03:14:47.771]  By the way, what you're seeing here, people go, Oh God, Alex, we thank you.
[03:14:47.771 --> 03:14:48.392]  You're so wonderful.
[03:14:48.392 --> 03:14:48.972]  You're so great.
[03:14:48.972 --> 03:14:49.213]  Listen!
[03:14:50.066 --> 03:14:52.767]  This is what we're all supposed to be doing here.
[03:14:52.767 --> 03:15:03.532]  This is normal response to multinational forces with a bunch of thug brown shirts they've mobilized to try to intimidate us to take our country over.
[03:15:03.532 --> 03:15:07.994]  Roger Stone on Tuesday night, he said, you must fire the AG now.
[03:15:07.994 --> 03:15:11.035]  You must do it in the morning.
[03:15:11.035 --> 03:15:13.916]  Well, Trump let him know in the morning.
[03:15:13.916 --> 03:15:16.978]  And now time is of the essence, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:16.978 --> 03:15:17.578]  When I come back,
[03:15:18.933 --> 03:15:21.856]  The media is framing this like, big deal, they went to his house, he's a racist.
[03:15:21.856 --> 03:15:24.619]  They dehumanize you with that term.
[03:15:24.619 --> 03:15:35.270]  We're going to show you this group, where the video of what they said to Tucker's family, what they did, how they terrorized his wife, how they banged on the windows and the doors, and all the things they did.
[03:15:36.181 --> 03:15:39.044]  And then we're going to show you the microcosm of where this goes from there.
[03:15:39.044 --> 03:15:41.707]  We're going to look at the new acting A.G.
[03:15:41.707 --> 03:15:44.690]  We're going to look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg falling down.
[03:15:44.690 --> 03:15:46.131]  Archival image.
[03:15:46.131 --> 03:15:46.912]  Another metaphor.
[03:15:46.912 --> 03:15:49.655]  An omen of the deep state's fall.
[03:15:49.655 --> 03:15:52.397]  But in its death throes, it is deadly dangerous.
[03:15:53.507 --> 03:15:58.291]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[03:15:58.291 --> 03:16:04.176]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[03:16:04.176 --> 03:16:10.681]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[03:16:10.681 --> 03:16:14.724]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[03:16:14.724 --> 03:16:20.989]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[03:16:20.989 --> 03:16:22.751]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[03:16:23.451 --> 03:16:27.073]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[03:16:27.073 --> 03:16:34.436]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[03:16:34.436 --> 03:16:39.337]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[03:16:39.337 --> 03:16:40.158]  There is.
[03:16:40.158 --> 03:16:41.758]  It's RightSocial.net.
[03:16:41.758 --> 03:16:43.099]  RightSocial.net.
[03:16:43.099 --> 03:16:46.420]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[03:16:46.420 --> 03:16:47.721]  RightSocial.net.
[03:16:47.721 --> 03:16:49.962]  Where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[03:16:49.962 --> 03:16:51.162]  RightSocial.net.
[03:16:51.162 --> 03:16:52.563]  The right place to be.
[03:16:53.223 --> 03:16:59.565]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:59.565 --> 03:17:02.606]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:17:02.606 --> 03:17:08.528]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:17:08.528 --> 03:17:12.309]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:13.589]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:17:13.589 --> 03:17:14.930]  Who do we fight for?
[03:17:14.930 --> 03:17:21.131]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:17:21.131 --> 03:17:22.552]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:17:23.212 --> 03:17:26.314]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[03:17:26.314 --> 03:17:29.817]  So you want to be sure it's the purest for you and your family.
[03:17:29.817 --> 03:17:33.679]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on Berkey Clean Water.
[03:17:33.679 --> 03:17:37.082]  The Berkey guy has you covered at home, work, and on the go.

[03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:58.043]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:17:58.043 --> 03:17:59.805]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:17:59.805 --> 03:18:11.074]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.855 --> 03:18:21.042]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:21.042 --> 03:18:27.006]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:18:27.006 --> 03:18:32.109]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:32.109 --> 03:18:34.711]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:18:34.711 --> 03:18:36.432]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:36.432 --> 03:18:41.236]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[03:18:41.476 --> 03:18:46.425]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:46.425 --> 03:18:49.069]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:49.069 --> 03:18:53.777]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[03:19:57.995 --> 03:20:06.542]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:06.542 --> 03:20:08.023]  It hadn't even been a day
[03:20:27.879 --> 03:20:45.571]  And George Soros' Antifa Frankenstein doxxed members of the Fox News team and sent more than 40 thugs to the family home of Tucker Carlson.
[03:20:45.571 --> 03:20:52.656]  Where they rammed in part of the door and said, we know where you live, we know where your children sleep.
[03:20:52.656 --> 03:20:54.257]  It's a bunch of these videos, it's incredible.
[03:20:55.490 --> 03:21:00.912]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got the national media calling me for comments about Jim Acosta and Trump.
[03:21:00.912 --> 03:21:07.555]  And did we doctor video and fake it that he pushed the woman or shoved the woman in the arm?
[03:21:07.555 --> 03:21:11.777]  And I'm not even responding to that at this time because it's pure bull.
[03:21:11.777 --> 03:21:13.417]  Paul Watson blew up the video.
[03:21:13.417 --> 03:21:14.798]  He didn't doctor the video.
[03:21:14.798 --> 03:21:16.378]  Anybody can go to the raw video and do that.
[03:21:16.378 --> 03:21:17.479]  We'll do it next segment.
[03:21:17.479 --> 03:21:18.799]  Paul Watson joins us.
[03:21:18.799 --> 03:21:20.000]  And we've got the terrible shooting.
[03:21:21.397 --> 03:21:26.758]  We've got all of this going on, but front and center, and our heart goes out to all those that have been maimed and killed.
[03:21:26.758 --> 03:21:28.279]  Truly a tragedy.
[03:21:28.279 --> 03:21:29.539]  All dead in California.
[03:21:29.539 --> 03:21:32.240]  The Country Music Nightclub.
[03:21:32.240 --> 03:21:34.480]  You have Ruth Bader Ginsburg falling down, breaking three ribs.
[03:21:34.480 --> 03:21:35.260]  She's on her way out.
[03:21:35.260 --> 03:21:36.061]  She can't hold on.
[03:21:36.061 --> 03:21:38.821]  She's been in a near-vegetative state for a long time.
[03:21:38.821 --> 03:21:40.502]  Falling asleep in public.
[03:21:40.502 --> 03:21:41.562]  She's gone.
[03:21:41.562 --> 03:21:43.342]  She'll be gone in months.
[03:21:43.342 --> 03:21:45.163]  Another big omen.
[03:21:45.163 --> 03:21:45.643]  You've got
[03:21:46.618 --> 03:21:53.662]  The Pope, in the Italian news, they're saying his resignation is imminent because of the pedophilia scandal.
[03:21:53.662 --> 03:22:05.508]  We have incredible developments in the economy, unbelievable things happening on so many fronts, but the most important thing I can say to you today is this.
[03:22:05.508 --> 03:22:10.030]  I have studied how governments are overthrown, how strong nations are overthrown from within.
[03:22:11.024 --> 03:22:17.771]  I've studied how Soros and the Globalist and the Leftist Deep State overthrew Ukraine four or five years ago.
[03:22:17.771 --> 03:22:23.957]  I know how they engineered the Arab Spring to overturn our allies in Egypt and other areas.
[03:22:23.957 --> 03:22:32.004]  And I've seen their own battle plans, and we've received secret Antifa blueprints that I'm going to show you here in a moment.
[03:22:32.004 --> 03:22:35.388]  We got in January of this year, and we've received other secret blueprints.
[03:22:37.386 --> 03:22:45.374]  And I suggest if you have family that's in Antifa, or you have neighbors that are in Antifa, it's time to do what you have to do to get the documents.
[03:22:45.374 --> 03:22:46.255]  We're in a war now.
[03:22:46.255 --> 03:22:47.556]  We're not going to attack people's houses.
[03:22:47.556 --> 03:22:48.837]  We're not going to be violent.
[03:22:48.837 --> 03:22:50.779]  But do what you think's best.
[03:22:50.779 --> 03:22:52.380]  You need to get them and just get them out.
[03:22:53.231 --> 03:22:55.613]  We need their current battle plans.
[03:22:55.613 --> 03:22:59.657]  I've reverse-engineered them, and I'm gonna lay it out, but this is, we need warrants.
[03:22:59.657 --> 03:23:01.098]  This is a terrorist organization.
[03:23:01.098 --> 03:23:03.119]  We need the police, local, state, and federal.
[03:23:03.119 --> 03:23:07.723]  You need to be getting your witnesses, and you need to be raiding Antifa now.
[03:23:07.723 --> 03:23:09.145]  You need local prosecutions.
[03:23:09.145 --> 03:23:14.169]  I mean, we have documents that show massive felony crimes being planned.
[03:23:14.169 --> 03:23:17.552]  We have the leaders publicly saying, kill the Vice President!
[03:23:18.499 --> 03:23:20.863]  Kill all law enforcement on site.
[03:23:20.863 --> 03:23:31.301]  And he is in command of the group that went after Ted Cruz and now went to the home of Tucker Carlson.
[03:23:31.301 --> 03:23:32.223]  Just the night before.
[03:23:34.517 --> 03:23:38.119]  The Carlsons were out to dinner and their younger children were there alone.
[03:23:38.119 --> 03:23:39.901]  Thank God they didn't come when they were alone.
[03:23:39.901 --> 03:23:43.143]  His wife locked herself in the pantry in the kitchen.
[03:23:43.143 --> 03:23:48.566]  She thought there was a home invasion because they crushed in the door screaming, we know where you sleep, you are not safe.
[03:23:48.566 --> 03:23:51.829]  We've got pipe bombs.
[03:23:51.829 --> 03:23:54.971]  And I'll just leave it at that, but I have, I'll just leave it at that.
[03:23:54.971 --> 03:23:57.172]  I'm not gonna get into who I've been talking to.
[03:23:57.172 --> 03:23:59.714]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is hardcore.
[03:24:01.721 --> 03:24:03.342]  This is a probing action.
[03:24:03.342 --> 03:24:04.802]  So, let me do this right now.
[03:24:04.802 --> 03:24:07.303]  Let me, Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[03:24:07.303 --> 03:24:13.686]  Let me go over these articles so you understand what we're dealing with.
[03:24:13.686 --> 03:24:15.946]  And remember what got me banned off Twitter.
[03:24:15.946 --> 03:24:19.328]  Why they said I was calling for battle rivals against the media, which I didn't say.
[03:24:19.328 --> 03:24:27.331]  Because the video was actually their blueprint using anti for the trigger of civil war and it scared the hell out of them that it was exactly
[03:24:28.530 --> 03:24:30.150]  What they're now doing.
[03:24:30.150 --> 03:24:31.611]  They don't want that out.
[03:24:31.611 --> 03:24:39.373]  They don't want somebody here on the rampart telling you, hey, there's people with a battering ram coming up to knock down the gate.
[03:24:39.373 --> 03:24:42.413]  And now the gate's getting knocked down, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:42.413 --> 03:24:45.254]  So, there were threatening me and my family.
[03:24:45.254 --> 03:24:47.495]  Took Carlson's home, targeted by protesters.
[03:24:47.495 --> 03:24:48.335]  San Francisco Gate.
[03:24:48.335 --> 03:24:55.697]  No, not by protesters, but by an international terror group funded by George Soros and his son and headed up by Eric Holder.
[03:24:55.697 --> 03:24:56.557]  I'm going to show you that in a moment.
[03:24:57.659 --> 03:25:00.380]  Protesters send messages to Tucker Carlson outside his home.
[03:25:00.380 --> 03:25:01.961]  We know where you sleep at night.
[03:25:01.961 --> 03:25:03.842]  No, that's not protesters.
[03:25:03.842 --> 03:25:06.263]  That's a threat.
[03:25:06.263 --> 03:25:07.604]  Terroristic threat.
[03:25:07.604 --> 03:25:09.444]  Crushing in the door.
[03:25:09.444 --> 03:25:14.687]  A mob showed up outside Tucker Carlson's house and ordered him to leave town.
[03:25:14.687 --> 03:25:15.787]  Now it's a terroristic threat.
[03:25:15.787 --> 03:25:17.668]  Now they're ordering him to leave.
[03:25:17.668 --> 03:25:18.809]  Criminal orders.
[03:25:18.809 --> 03:25:20.790]  Walking off the streets.
[03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:25.292]  DC Antifa publishes home addresses of Tucker Carlson and his brother, as well as Ann Coulter.
[03:25:26.277 --> 03:25:31.100]  Neil Patel and Sean Hannity, the people that are loyal to the country.
[03:25:31.100 --> 03:25:39.325]  I told Tucker and others just two weeks ago, get ready after the election, that they would be at their house.
[03:25:39.325 --> 03:25:45.549]  So as we continue, ladies and gentlemen, let me get to the other documents now.
[03:25:45.549 --> 03:25:46.450]  This is the key area.
[03:25:46.450 --> 03:25:48.011]  I just gave you some of what's currently happening.
[03:25:49.870 --> 03:25:52.952]  Antifa mob descends on Tucker Carlson's home.
[03:25:52.952 --> 03:25:53.453]  Red alert!
[03:25:53.453 --> 03:25:55.234]  Tucker Carlson's home under siege by Antifa mob.
[03:25:55.234 --> 03:25:56.936]  That was last night.
[03:25:56.936 --> 03:25:57.776]  Emergency alert!
[03:25:57.776 --> 03:26:00.418]  Dems promise Civil War of Sessions removed.
[03:26:00.418 --> 03:26:02.860]  Attack Tucker Carlson's home afterwards.
[03:26:02.860 --> 03:26:04.121]  Now here's the key.
[03:26:04.121 --> 03:26:08.224]  The left is organizing response events in 900 U.S.
[03:26:08.224 --> 03:26:14.710]  cities today to protest, they mean to terrorize and intimidate and lace targets, the firing of Jeff Sessions.
[03:26:15.598 --> 03:26:20.721]  Michael Snyder article, End of the American Dream, dot com, up on Infowars.com.
[03:26:20.721 --> 03:26:27.485]  MoveOn.org, that is a dispatch from Soros and Holder.
[03:26:27.485 --> 03:26:31.608]  They admitting here, and Holder has tweeted this out, nobody is above the law.
[03:26:31.608 --> 03:26:35.070]  Mueller, protection, rapid response.
[03:26:35.070 --> 03:26:37.812]  Protect your false prosecutor.
[03:26:37.812 --> 03:26:40.353]  Protect your new fifth branch of government.
[03:26:40.353 --> 03:26:41.474]  Protect the rogue group.
[03:26:41.474 --> 03:26:42.515]  Protect the criminal group.
[03:26:43.407 --> 03:26:47.548]  And they say, go out, get in their face, don't even let them get rid of A.G.
[03:26:47.548 --> 03:26:49.149]  Sessions.
[03:26:49.149 --> 03:26:49.589]  D.C.
[03:26:49.589 --> 03:26:52.050]  Antifa dots home addresses.
[03:26:52.050 --> 03:26:53.030]  There it is.
[03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:59.212]  Founder of group that harassed Ted Cruz tweeted about dead cops assassinating Mike Pence.
[03:26:59.212 --> 03:27:00.273]  Go read it for yourself.
[03:27:00.273 --> 03:27:01.793]  Infowars.com.
[03:27:01.793 --> 03:27:09.956]  Antifa professor who bragged about teaching future dead cops complains about receiving threats.
[03:27:11.803 --> 03:27:15.604]  Here's Eric Holder tweeting out that we're going to stand against what's happened.
[03:27:15.604 --> 03:27:19.105]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest, martial law in Baltimore.
[03:27:19.105 --> 03:27:22.105]  This is the Rosetta Stone.
[03:27:22.105 --> 03:27:24.906]  Alexander Soros' group is in command of this.
[03:27:24.906 --> 03:27:26.887]  They sign pledges.
[03:27:26.887 --> 03:27:28.387]  They're given action directives.
[03:27:28.387 --> 03:27:37.349]  They're told what police in blue cities to work with trying to get blacks to riot to bring in quote civil emergency martial law.
[03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:39.429]  Action code BW10418.
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:44.160]  Comma 15.
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:45.681]  Confidential.
[03:27:45.681 --> 03:27:48.081]  Level 7.
[03:27:48.081 --> 03:27:51.502]  AB-G.
[03:27:51.502 --> 03:27:52.622]  Level 7.
[03:27:52.622 --> 03:27:55.583]  This is an intelligence operation in our government.
[03:27:55.583 --> 03:27:56.323]  Breakaway Griffith.
[03:27:56.323 --> 03:27:59.843]  It's got all the signatures, all the sign-on by the officers.
[03:27:59.843 --> 03:28:02.924]  They're going to attack this business, this trash can.
[03:28:02.924 --> 03:28:06.165]  It's corporations that have already agreed, like McDonald's and Starbucks, to be in on it.
[03:28:06.165 --> 03:28:07.265]  You always wonder why they attack that.
[03:28:09.764 --> 03:28:12.388]  It's done all in agreement, all courted by the left.
[03:28:12.388 --> 03:28:14.831]  Jack Dorsey, they're all involved.
[03:28:14.831 --> 03:28:17.014]  That's why they're so scared, because I've got their number.
[03:28:17.014 --> 03:28:22.602]  And it goes through the entire action plan and how to manipulate black urban populations.
[03:28:22.602 --> 03:28:25.146]  White professors in their
[03:28:26.636 --> 03:28:35.379]  Disguises trying to get black people to riot with all the Hollywood movies about whites being racist right at the same time coming out and all the TV shows saying cops deserve to die.
[03:28:35.379 --> 03:28:44.063]  All of it working with blue city police in blue cities to stage the event and try to trigger real martial law as a cover for Obama.
[03:28:44.063 --> 03:28:45.643]  But they failed and they're trying again.
[03:28:45.643 --> 03:28:46.664]  They're going to fail again.
[03:28:46.664 --> 03:28:50.185]  But this time they're getting ready with actual kill teams.
[03:28:50.185 --> 03:28:51.625]  The kill teams are coming.
[03:28:51.625 --> 03:28:52.786]  The kill teams are coming.
[03:28:53.553 --> 03:28:57.395]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[03:28:57.395 --> 03:29:01.077]  It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year.
[03:29:01.077 --> 03:29:05.859]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[03:29:05.859 --> 03:29:11.882]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.

[03:29:34.056 --> 03:29:43.202]  Plus, they will show you how to become a cannabis angel investor, backing the hottest startups before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.

[03:29:54.429 --> 03:29:58.571]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[03:31:47.569 --> 03:31:49.830]  Taken on the globalist at point blank range.
[03:31:49.830 --> 03:31:53.952]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:31:54.452 --> 03:32:03.743]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:03.743 --> 03:32:06.626]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:06.626 --> 03:32:12.673]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:13.334 --> 03:32:19.599]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:19.599 --> 03:32:25.883]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.883 --> 03:32:32.808]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.949 --> 03:32:35.570]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:08.596 --> 03:33:13.439]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:33:13.439 --> 03:33:14.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.720 --> 03:33:20.644]  Yeah, she had a corpse under her bed.
[03:33:20.644 --> 03:33:27.749]  She had a fun, but now he's dead.
[03:33:27.749 --> 03:33:35.174]  Her mama said, come feed the sire.
[03:33:41.010 --> 03:33:51.313]  Folks better decide which team they're on, if they're loyal to America and the Republic and everything that's been good and decent compared to the rest of the world, or whether they're on the side of the chi-coms, the globalists.
[03:33:51.313 --> 03:33:55.935]  Now here's the most important thing I'm going to say today.
[03:33:55.935 --> 03:34:01.137]  The globalists, the deep state, have totally panicked that Trump has fired the totally compromised
[03:34:02.142 --> 03:34:04.643]  Incompetent, cowardly Jeff Sessions.
[03:34:04.643 --> 03:34:06.544]  The disgraced Jeff Sessions.
[03:34:06.544 --> 03:34:11.807]  They have put in an acting AG that said he would indict Hillary immediately because the evidence is overwhelming.
[03:34:11.807 --> 03:34:13.187]  Like the sun being yellow.
[03:34:13.187 --> 03:34:16.289]  They are really scared of Matthew Whitaker.
[03:34:16.289 --> 03:34:20.831]  Trump is making his move against them because he tried to play nice.
[03:34:20.831 --> 03:34:23.192]  He tried to turn the economy on, have them back off.
[03:34:23.192 --> 03:34:24.713]  They're making their move on Don Jr.
[03:34:24.713 --> 03:34:26.594]  You name it, it's imminent next week.
[03:34:28.106 --> 03:34:30.927]  So, the country is now in a civil emergency.
[03:34:30.927 --> 03:34:37.208]  They've got foreign caravans slamming in, trying to trigger uprisings inside the United States and Latin America.
[03:34:37.208 --> 03:34:52.412]  They've got Antifa train groups, funded by George Soros, activating in 900 cities and towns, calling for violence, and saying they're going to target conservatives and Christians and nationalist leaders.
[03:34:52.412 --> 03:34:56.373]  As I told you months ago, and as I documented,
[03:34:58.194 --> 03:35:07.562]  They're only using Angie for the Deep State as the patsies on the streets of Austin, pointing guns at my reporters, saying they can't even, you know, go onto the Capitol grounds.
[03:35:07.562 --> 03:35:18.552]  They've been authorized to act like this and behave like this and call for Mike Pence's death and call for the police to be killed and call for me to be killed and all of this because they're protected in blue cities.
[03:35:18.552 --> 03:35:24.957]  But only because they're being prepared and set up if we go into real, violent, Deep State civil war
[03:35:25.987 --> 03:35:36.496]  And they unleashed the different paramilitary groups, the Hezbollah groups that the Deep State, Obama's been signing deals with, we know, MS-13, all God's little children that Pelosi talked about.
[03:35:36.496 --> 03:35:39.699]  Those will be the real hit teams coming.
[03:35:39.699 --> 03:35:48.187]  And so this country is now being pushed into civil war, civil emergency, and martial law by the Democrats.
[03:35:49.784 --> 03:35:55.426]  I said Trump should just declare an emergency so he can get the main military standing up and knowing what happened.
[03:35:55.426 --> 03:35:58.727]  I called for that the Friday that the caravan smashed through.
[03:35:58.727 --> 03:36:00.467]  Trump did it on Monday.
[03:36:00.467 --> 03:36:03.528]  So we are under civil emergency.
[03:36:03.528 --> 03:36:05.008]  That doesn't mean tanks in the streets.
[03:36:05.008 --> 03:36:07.889]  That means to stop it getting to that point.
[03:36:07.889 --> 03:36:10.190]  So we're not the ones that brought the martial law.
[03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:11.890]  We are now under martial law.
[03:36:11.890 --> 03:36:12.671]  You need to understand that.
[03:36:12.671 --> 03:36:14.531]  It just hasn't been announced yet.
[03:36:14.531 --> 03:36:15.951]  That's why they are sending out 900
[03:36:18.211 --> 03:36:25.893]  Front groups, 900 operations have just been triggered, and that's why they want us off the air.
[03:36:25.893 --> 03:36:29.214]  You must take this live feed at InfoWars.com for its live show.
[03:36:29.214 --> 03:36:31.554]  Let's put the main article feed up if we can, as well.
[03:36:31.554 --> 03:36:35.115]  Watch live feed, the red alert feed.
[03:36:35.115 --> 03:36:41.477]  Get that article and send it out to everyone you know from NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:36:43.018 --> 03:36:47.019]  Watch live, Soros activates 900 antipatera cells.
[03:36:47.019 --> 03:36:50.341]  Leader of group calls for killing of police and Republicans.
[03:36:50.341 --> 03:36:51.361]  Red alert!
[03:36:51.361 --> 03:36:56.323]  He's now put out an article making fun of Tucker saying he deserves it.
[03:36:56.323 --> 03:36:59.924]  Tucker Carlson is the paragon of crocodile tears.
[03:36:59.924 --> 03:37:01.885]  Mike Isaacson.
[03:37:01.885 --> 03:37:02.965]  He is the front man.
[03:37:02.965 --> 03:37:03.805]  He's the patsy.
[03:37:03.805 --> 03:37:05.386]  He's the idiot.
[03:37:05.386 --> 03:37:08.127]  I don't think he would actually pull the trigger on people, but
[03:37:10.074 --> 03:37:15.520]  This professor is the guy who heads up the New York group and the DC group.
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:18.683]  Because of criminal investigations they've claimed a month ago he's no longer the leader.
[03:37:18.683 --> 03:37:22.827]  Bravo Sierra!
[03:37:22.827 --> 03:37:30.314]  Now, I'm only going to go to this subject because, not because it's about us,
[03:37:31.220 --> 03:37:32.800]  Because I've had national news calling all day.
[03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:35.101]  I don't know what they were talking about this morning.
[03:37:35.101 --> 03:37:39.822]  I left my phone at a restaurant last night, didn't want to go back and get it, got it this morning.
[03:37:39.822 --> 03:37:45.363]  And the home phone, and families getting called like, what's this you faked?
[03:37:45.363 --> 03:37:46.803]  And fake a Costa video?
[03:37:46.803 --> 03:37:55.805]  I was too busy worrying about Antifa, and too busy worrying about trying to trigger a civil war, and Alexander Soros funding it, and all the secret documents we have that no one seems to even care that we have.
[03:37:55.805 --> 03:37:58.906]  We have the total proof!
[03:37:58.906 --> 03:38:00.126]  And then I got into the office.
[03:38:01.516 --> 03:38:06.340]  And I looked at the video and all Paul did was blow up the video.
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:12.905]  He zoomed in, like you do on any news show, so it's absolutely clear that he basically whacked her arm.
[03:38:12.905 --> 03:38:21.152]  Now they say that Trump just talking to a female reporter that won't sit down, they've had their question answered.
[03:38:21.992 --> 03:38:22.873]  Is assaulting him.
[03:38:22.873 --> 03:38:26.276]  This guy's pushing a woman out of the way, shoving her, looks like he's hitting her arm.
[03:38:26.276 --> 03:38:33.883]  All we do is blow it up, and I've got Fox News, and I've got CRTV, and I've got a calling machine.
[03:38:33.883 --> 03:38:36.305]  Am I going to respond to this?
[03:38:36.305 --> 03:38:43.231]  So see, that's how they changed the subject from Jim Acosta acting like a grandstanding monster at these events.
[03:38:43.231 --> 03:38:46.073]  You know, I could go to Trump events and act like this.
[03:38:46.073 --> 03:38:46.594]  Anybody could.
[03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:50.031]  So, this is out of control.
[03:38:50.031 --> 03:38:51.111]  He's had his credentials pulled.
[03:38:51.111 --> 03:39:00.755]  So, here's the big, because one of the top Twitter trends yesterday and today, that Imphal Wars has been caught doctoring video.
[03:39:00.755 --> 03:39:02.456]  Gosh, these people are incredible.
[03:39:02.456 --> 03:39:03.677]  But all he did was zoom in.
[03:39:03.677 --> 03:39:08.619]  Joining us is Paul Joseph Watson from Her Britannic Majesties London, England.
[03:39:08.619 --> 03:39:10.980]  Paul, what's the PSYOP here, just to change the subject?
[03:39:12.682 --> 03:39:17.304]  The side of Alex is that Jim Acosta manhandled a woman, basically.
[03:39:17.304 --> 03:39:18.505]  I never said it was assault.
[03:39:18.505 --> 03:39:20.245]  A lot of people claimed it was assault.
[03:39:20.245 --> 03:39:26.868]  He used his left arm to physically restrain, put pressure on the woman when she was trying to do her job and grab the microphone.
[03:39:26.868 --> 03:39:30.109]  That obviously resulted in his press access getting revoked.
[03:39:30.109 --> 03:39:38.193]  And so instead of focusing on that controversy and having to talk about it, the media invented this giant conspiracy theory with no evidence that I,
[03:39:39.045 --> 03:39:39.985]  We're good to go.
[03:40:01.713 --> 03:40:10.218]  You had the Washington Post report on it, Newsweek said it was fake, Doctored, Vice, all these big websites trashing us on a minute by minute basis.
[03:40:11.155 --> 03:40:12.336]  OK, it's not fake.
[03:40:12.336 --> 03:40:13.596]  It's zoomed in.
[03:40:13.596 --> 03:40:17.378]  It's the same thing that James O'Keefe gets when they say, oh, your videos are edited.
[03:40:17.378 --> 03:40:21.200]  Yeah, it's zoomed in to show the moment when this exchange happened.
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:22.520]  It's not sped up.
[03:40:22.520 --> 03:40:32.565]  I even posted the screenshot, Alex, from my video editing software, Sony Vegas Pro, where you can see if a clip in the track is sped up, it has wavy lines.
[03:40:32.565 --> 03:40:33.685]  I posted the track.
[03:40:33.685 --> 03:40:36.927]  There are no wavy lines because I did not speed it up, OK?
[03:40:37.387 --> 03:40:43.789]  And Paul, where do people find that or even show that obviously it's a term of editing to zoom in?
[03:40:43.789 --> 03:40:44.510]  This is ridiculous.
[03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:51.132]  Everybody knows when you're watching the news, they show the clip first of a plane blowing up or whatever, then they zoom in on it.
[03:40:51.132 --> 03:40:56.033]  He did this, he got his credentials pulled, and now they're changing the subject saying we're fake news.
[03:40:56.033 --> 03:40:57.234]  When in truth, they're the fake news.
[03:40:58.322 --> 03:41:02.424]  Yeah, and they're saying, oh, but there's like a couple of frames which were a little bit different.
[03:41:02.424 --> 03:41:11.369]  Okay, I downloaded a GIF file, exported it as an mt2 file, exported it, ran it through another program as an mp4 file, uploaded it to Twitter.
[03:41:11.369 --> 03:41:15.491]  The quality, the frame, the compression is not going to be absolutely identical, okay?
[03:41:16.372 --> 03:41:22.618]  Paul, that's why I've tried to get you the money to hire a team to be able to help you, but everybody knows about video artifacts.
[03:41:22.618 --> 03:41:29.685]  The point is, Jim Acosta did this, and now it's becoming an even bigger fiasco for mainstream media lying and saying we lied.
[03:41:29.685 --> 03:41:30.826]  I think it's already blown up in their face.
[03:41:31.786 --> 03:41:40.391]  No, Alex, like even BuzzFeed writers are now semi-defending me because they're saying everybody rushed to call this fake when it obviously wasn't fake.
[03:41:40.391 --> 03:41:41.211]  This happened.
[03:41:41.211 --> 03:41:48.996]  You know they denounced and demonized Corey Lewandowski based on six video frames from that alleged assault on Michelle Fields.
[03:41:48.996 --> 03:41:52.878]  Now they're getting all pedantic about these video frames even though it's a straight video.
[03:41:52.878 --> 03:41:55.759]  That Lewandowski video was just like six frames.
[03:41:55.759 --> 03:41:58.521]  It wasn't even a video, it was a series of still images.
[03:41:58.521 --> 03:41:59.802]  So again, it's a complete hoax.
[03:42:00.682 --> 03:42:03.945]  It's a massive smear campaign by the international media.
[03:42:03.945 --> 03:42:08.448]  Now I'm getting death threats, that's always a nice juicy bonus that you get out of all this attention.
[03:42:08.448 --> 03:42:10.450]  And again, it's a complete hoax.
[03:42:10.450 --> 03:42:14.553]  Video analysts have looked at it and said, no, it wasn't sped up, it was slowed down.
[03:42:14.553 --> 03:42:18.836]  Maybe there was some compression lost in a couple of frames, but it is what it is.
[03:42:18.836 --> 03:42:26.662]  Yeah, everybody knows when you download video and re-upload it, especially on things like Twitter, Twitter has crappy video that it looks like crap.
[03:42:27.102 --> 03:42:32.543]  I mean, I'll shoot a video on my phone back when I was allowed on Twitter, and it'd be crystal clear on the phone and look like crap on Twitter.
[03:42:32.543 --> 03:42:34.764]  That doesn't mean I distorted it.
[03:42:34.764 --> 03:42:40.965]  It's what compression does when you're sending a five-minute video in ten seconds up to Twitter.
[03:42:40.965 --> 03:42:45.106]  It compresses it, so it's not as good.
[03:42:45.106 --> 03:42:48.307]  We'll be right back, because the media wants a statement from you, Paul.
[03:42:48.307 --> 03:42:49.627]  They want like a two-minute statement.
[03:42:49.627 --> 03:42:52.748]  A bunch of news groups do, so let's get your statement to the media straight ahead.
[03:42:53.723 --> 03:43:00.870]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[03:46:57.428 --> 03:47:00.049]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:20.524 --> 03:47:25.526]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:25.526 --> 03:47:31.627]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:31.627 --> 03:47:39.270]  So, during the break, I walked back in the kitchen, the coffee room, and InfoWars fakes video of Acosta.
[03:47:39.270 --> 03:47:40.130]  He didn't do anything.
[03:47:40.130 --> 03:47:41.110]  He didn't shove a woman.
[03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:43.531]  He didn't push her hand down.
[03:47:43.531 --> 03:47:46.972]  I walked back into the studio, and they're going, look at this, Fox News.
[03:47:48.937 --> 03:47:54.984]  Another clip of them saying, yes, we faked it, it's not true, Jim Acosta never did anything wrong in his life.
[03:47:54.984 --> 03:47:59.950]  They are so obsessed with discrediting us, ladies and gentlemen, because they know we're on to them.
[03:47:59.950 --> 03:48:02.533]  Now, we were playing this live yesterday, okay?
[03:48:03.746 --> 03:48:07.647]  And this isn't about Jim Acosta, it's not about Infowars, it's about the lying corporate media.
[03:48:07.647 --> 03:48:21.070]  We should all be talking about Antifa, saying they're going to attack 900 targets, not just Tucker Carlson's house, doxing all these people ahead of real violence, and how they said they're going to drive Trump from power in full-page ads.
[03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.910]  They mean business!
[03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:28.132]  I predicted it all, it's happening, he just fired Sessions, this is seismic.
[03:48:28.132 --> 03:48:29.432]  We're in a new ballgame now.
[03:48:29.432 --> 03:48:32.913]  But we've got to cover this, because they want to shut us down.
[03:48:33.797 --> 03:48:36.718]  And they've got the corporate media doing all of this.
[03:48:36.718 --> 03:48:48.123]  It came out in the news that Fox News buys ads everywhere trying to siphon off InfoWare's audience while they then get up and lie about us and say things that aren't true.
[03:48:50.213 --> 03:49:00.658]  It's across the board, and the media also wants a statement on this, so Paul will make a statement here in about two minutes specifically on this issue, then we'll put the videos in and post, and send this out and post it.
[03:49:00.658 --> 03:49:13.544]  So, the man who edited the video, and technically, yes, blowing it up is editing it, zooming in a video, any type of change, downloading it and uploading it, I guess you could say is an edit because it changes the format.
[03:49:13.544 --> 03:49:14.865]  All these systems are on different formats.
[03:49:16.032 --> 03:49:17.293]  Did it get washed out a little bit?
[03:49:17.293 --> 03:49:17.913]  Absolutely.
[03:49:17.913 --> 03:49:21.856]  But that's not us distorting it for the purposes of deception.
[03:49:21.856 --> 03:49:25.098]  That's us uploading it to Twitter where it loses quality.
[03:49:25.098 --> 03:49:26.339]  But they think you're stupid.
[03:49:26.339 --> 03:49:28.320]  They hope to change the subject.
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:31.482]  We happen to have the live satellite feed recorded in HD.
[03:49:31.482 --> 03:49:34.784]  Oh, we happen to have the C-SPAN recorded in HD.
[03:49:34.784 --> 03:49:44.531]  So in a few minutes, we're going to show you the raw footage, and then we're going to zoom in live off the board in there with a tool.
[03:49:45.638 --> 03:49:46.980]  So that you can see.
[03:49:46.980 --> 03:49:48.121]  But the point is it doesn't matter.
[03:49:48.121 --> 03:49:50.164]  Acosta did it in front of everybody!
[03:49:50.164 --> 03:49:57.794]  They withdrew his credentials there because the president saw it with his eyeballs from five feet away.
[03:49:57.794 --> 03:50:01.119]  So this is an incredible example of attempted mind control.
[03:50:01.119 --> 03:50:03.122]  Here's Fox News just minutes ago.
[03:50:04.947 --> 03:50:10.130]  The White House Correspondents Association, however, making it clear that they do not support this decision.
[03:50:10.130 --> 03:50:16.753]  The Correspondents Association strongly objects to the Trump administration's decision to use U.S.
[03:50:16.753 --> 03:50:22.395]  Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship.
[03:50:22.395 --> 03:50:30.539]  Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported offense and is unacceptable, Howie.
[03:50:31.883 --> 03:50:39.867]  Yeah, I think it's a misstep on the part of the White House to claim that Jim Acosta was laying his hands on this young intern who tried to take the mic away.
[03:50:39.867 --> 03:50:41.387]  The contact was very incidental.
[03:50:41.387 --> 03:50:52.892]  I also think it was a misstep for Sarah Sanders to tweet out a doctored video put out by InfoWars, the Alex Jones conspiracy site, that kind of made it look more aggressive than it was.
[03:50:52.892 --> 03:50:56.654]  So, we had credentials for like a month, doesn't mean anything.
[03:50:57.796 --> 03:50:59.697]  The media made a deal and they took it away from us.
[03:50:59.697 --> 03:51:01.337]  It wasn't the President's decision.
[03:51:01.337 --> 03:51:03.438]  What's the reason we're not there?
[03:51:03.438 --> 03:51:08.439]  Oh, but Acosta, who accosts everyone, he is God.
[03:51:08.439 --> 03:51:17.222]  So let's show you the C-SPAN unedited video at the point where she tries to take the mic back, her job, and he slaps it in her arm.
[03:51:17.222 --> 03:51:17.502]  Here it is.
[03:51:20.222 --> 03:51:21.223]  Go ahead.
[03:51:21.223 --> 03:51:22.784]  Look, I don't think he assaulted her.
[03:51:22.784 --> 03:51:23.624]  But he laid hands on her.
[03:51:23.624 --> 03:51:24.865]  He pulled the mic back.
[03:51:24.865 --> 03:51:25.946]  He wasn't cordial.
[03:51:25.946 --> 03:51:27.126]  He's always causing problems.
[03:51:27.126 --> 03:51:30.469]  Totally reasonable to kick him out and say bring somebody else in from fake CNN.
[03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:32.670]  Totally agree with the president.
[03:51:47.938 --> 03:51:53.121]  Paul didn't even say it was an assault, but compared to Corin Lewandowski, he basically murdered her.
[03:51:53.121 --> 03:51:55.243]  So see, off their leftist rules...
[03:51:56.747 --> 03:52:08.109]  Off their leftist rules, him pushing her arm down, and then with his hand, grabbing the mic away from her, when she's trying to take it away, that's a double action, beyond what Korn and Lewandowski did.
[03:52:08.109 --> 03:52:12.210]  So like you said, Paul, they used six frames, like it was the Subruder film.
[03:52:12.210 --> 03:52:13.490]  We have the footage.
[03:52:13.490 --> 03:52:14.551]  I'm gonna show it one more time.
[03:52:14.551 --> 03:52:16.591]  Now, again, let's show it to you.
[03:52:16.591 --> 03:52:19.632]  This is unedited video, recorded on the DVRs in there.
[03:52:19.632 --> 03:52:21.072]  Put it back on screen for TV viewers.
[03:52:21.072 --> 03:52:22.152]  Radio listeners, I'm gonna describe it.
[03:52:22.152 --> 03:52:24.373]  Okay, there it is, not zoomed in.
[03:52:24.373 --> 03:52:25.653]  Now, they call this an edit.
[03:52:25.653 --> 03:52:26.213]  Zoom in on it.
[03:52:28.553 --> 03:52:29.014]  Zoom in.
[03:52:29.014 --> 03:52:29.775]  This is live time.
[03:52:29.775 --> 03:52:30.596]  We're zooming in.
[03:52:30.596 --> 03:52:31.858]  All we're doing is zooming in.
[03:52:31.858 --> 03:52:34.501]  Look, I know you know that, but notice it's misdirection.
[03:52:34.501 --> 03:52:35.923]  How they always change the subject.
[03:52:35.923 --> 03:52:37.886]  Paul, this is unbelievable, isn't it?
[03:52:39.335 --> 03:52:43.619]  Well, the original that you're playing now looks even worse than the one I posted.
[03:52:43.619 --> 03:52:46.422]  Listen, Vice News put out this article about an hour ago.
[03:52:46.422 --> 03:52:47.483]  It said, quote, So again,
[03:53:00.399 --> 03:53:03.821]  What I've said to the media who've asked me about this, the video is not sped up.
[03:53:03.821 --> 03:53:06.422]  They initially ran with this fake story that it was sped up.
[03:53:06.422 --> 03:53:10.704]  Then they said, oh, it's not sped up, but maybe there's some digital artifact problems in there.
[03:53:10.704 --> 03:53:14.546]  Yeah, because I ran it through like three different programs and re-uploaded it to Twitter, OK?
[03:53:14.546 --> 03:53:15.867]  That's not doctoring.
[03:53:15.867 --> 03:53:21.630]  Doctoring is when you change the footage deliberately, which I didn't do, to change the meaning of the footage.
[03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:22.971]  This does not change anything.
[03:53:23.698 --> 03:53:27.841]  Okay, I did not distort the video, as Brian Stelter of CNN claims.
[03:53:27.841 --> 03:53:30.963]  Even BuzzFeed journalists are now semi-defending me on this.
[03:53:30.963 --> 03:53:35.566]  The media invented a conspiracy theory to distract from Acosta's behavior.
[03:53:35.566 --> 03:53:44.492]  Sarah Sanders was perfectly correct in posting this video, which is genuine, and it proves her point that Acosta placed his hands on the woman to overpower her.
[03:53:44.492 --> 03:53:46.693]  Doesn't mean it was assault, but it was an issue.
[03:53:46.693 --> 03:53:50.536]  But he did overpower- It was a controversy for them to distract from with this conspiracy theory.
[03:53:51.397 --> 03:53:51.857]  You're right, Paul.
[03:53:51.857 --> 03:53:53.599]  He overpowered a woman.
[03:53:53.599 --> 03:53:55.080]  That's the correct term.
[03:53:55.080 --> 03:54:02.108]  And so what I think you should do is put out another tweet that shows the unedited, unblown-up in front, and then the blown-up rolling right after.
[03:54:02.108 --> 03:54:03.509]  Not even side-by-side.
[03:54:03.509 --> 03:54:06.292]  But there's the InfoWars edit, there's the C-SPAN original.
[03:54:06.292 --> 03:54:11.037]  And yes, in HD that we have, it's much clearer that he actually pushes her down pretty damn hard.
[03:54:12.904 --> 03:54:14.825]  No, I'm going to make a video about this tonight.
[03:54:14.825 --> 03:54:21.687]  I've been tweeting about it all day, and yeah, compare it to how they reacted to the Lewandowski thing, which was based on six frames.
[03:54:21.687 --> 03:54:25.408]  And there's another thing going around today, Alex, which we're also getting hit on.
[03:54:25.408 --> 03:54:37.412]  The mainstream media, after this shooting earlier today, hundreds of verified Twitter accounts, Sky News, ABC News reported, eyewitnesses say the shooter was Middle Eastern, okay?
[03:54:37.412 --> 03:54:40.514]  That was the first thing I woke up to in the media this morning.
[03:54:40.514 --> 03:54:41.774]  So now we're being attacked,
[03:54:42.566 --> 03:54:50.697]  Laura Loomer's being attacked, everyone's being attacked because we quoted mainstream media reports saying the shooter was initially, they thought, Middle Eastern.
[03:54:50.697 --> 03:54:58.147]  So they put out the fake news, we quote them, and then we get blamed for it by them and by all their sycophants.
[03:54:58.147 --> 03:55:00.030]  Again, it's the same thing over and over again.
[03:55:00.955 --> 03:55:04.839]  Oh, they're getting ready to take you off Twitter and YouTube, brother.
[03:55:04.839 --> 03:55:08.984]  They are, like they do about me, making up something that you didn't do.
[03:55:08.984 --> 03:55:10.905]  I never said kill the media with battle rifles.
[03:55:10.905 --> 03:55:14.269]  I said, if Antifa comes to your house, the first time they come, they just dox you.
[03:55:14.269 --> 03:55:15.610]  The next time they come, they're violent.
[03:55:15.610 --> 03:55:16.932]  Have a firearm to protect yourself.
[03:55:16.932 --> 03:55:17.672]  Nothing to do with media.
[03:55:18.547 --> 03:55:20.348]  And they did this because they're making their move.
[03:55:20.348 --> 03:55:21.908]  What about big picture, Paul?
[03:55:21.908 --> 03:55:29.050]  Where 900 targets to be hit by Antifa, Tucker Carlson cracking in his door saying, we know where you sleep, we know your kids are here.
[03:55:29.050 --> 03:55:34.132]  The same guy that runs this Antifa group is the one you've written about, known as Pez Dispenser.
[03:55:34.132 --> 03:55:36.632]  I mean, this is everything I predicted.
[03:55:36.632 --> 03:55:38.673]  They're so scared about Sessions being removed.
[03:55:40.456 --> 03:55:48.685]  Oh no, the professor had violent threats encouraging the assassination of Trump administration officials on Twitter for months and months and months.
[03:55:48.685 --> 03:55:50.807]  They did absolutely nothing about it.
[03:55:50.807 --> 03:55:56.033]  This smash racism DC group is known for doxing people over and over again.
[03:55:56.033 --> 03:55:59.436]  All that happened before was that they got a few tweets deleted.
[03:55:59.436 --> 03:56:01.919]  Finally last night their entire account was suspended.
[03:56:02.199 --> 03:56:10.100]  But these groups have been on Twitter for years promoting this doxing, harassment, targeting of individuals and basically nothing's done.
[03:56:10.100 --> 03:56:13.021]  A new group just pops up whenever they get caught.
[03:56:13.021 --> 03:56:19.682]  So yeah, it's just another distraction from all that, from the violent mobs that are actually out on the street harassing and targeting people.
[03:56:19.682 --> 03:56:24.003]  Tucker Carlson with his wife and four kids who were potentially in the house.
[03:56:24.003 --> 03:56:26.623]  Absolute disgrace.
[03:56:26.623 --> 03:56:30.804]  The only update on that is that Stephen Colbert, one of your favourite people, has actually tweeted
[03:56:31.491 --> 03:56:36.576]  That targeting Tucker Carlson's home and terrorizing his family is an act of monstrous cowardice.
[03:56:36.576 --> 03:56:43.022]  So at least he sees sense, unlike a lot of other people who actually applauded this.
[03:56:43.022 --> 03:56:48.748]  Oh yeah, in fact, Pencil Neck has put out an article basically praising Mike.
[03:56:48.748 --> 03:56:51.711]  Mike Isaacson is very, very happy right now.
[03:56:53.672 --> 03:56:59.577]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I get death threats every day on Twitter, or at least violent threats, or at least, you know, why don't you just kill yourself?
[03:56:59.577 --> 03:57:01.699]  It's just par for the course at this point.
[03:57:01.699 --> 03:57:08.285]  The vast majority of it does come from the far left, some comes from the far right, and we denounce it, we distance ourselves from those people.
[03:57:08.285 --> 03:57:10.627]  When the far left engage in this, they're embraced.
[03:57:11.107 --> 03:57:13.589]  You know, they made apologies for by the left and by the right.
[03:57:13.589 --> 03:57:14.070]  Stay there.
[03:57:14.070 --> 03:57:17.433]  I want to ask you a big picture about Sessions is more, one more segment.
[03:57:17.433 --> 03:57:22.577]  Then I'm going to open the phones up at a bunch of other big guests with Inside Intel coming up today.
[03:57:22.577 --> 03:57:25.300]  But folks, this is the most grave situation ever.
[03:57:25.300 --> 03:57:26.121]  It's very positive.
[03:57:26.121 --> 03:57:27.062]  We're taking the country back.
[03:57:27.922 --> 03:57:31.623]  Good things are happening, but now the enemy's gonna come in and try to steal our victory.
[03:57:31.623 --> 03:57:33.104]  It's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:33.104 --> 03:57:34.244]  Trump's taking the gloves off.
[03:57:34.244 --> 03:57:37.625]  Whatever you do, we're the most banned broadcast in the world for a reason.
[03:57:37.625 --> 03:57:39.366]  We can save this country with your help.
[03:57:39.366 --> 03:57:41.126]  Tell folks at the local station you're listening to.
[03:57:41.126 --> 03:57:49.009]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:50.737 --> 03:57:53.878]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.878 --> 03:57:56.539]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:56.539 --> 03:58:00.841]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.841 --> 03:58:08.324]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:58:08.324 --> 03:58:10.745]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:14.193 --> 03:58:16.395]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:16.395 --> 03:58:17.115]  They called it U.N.
[03:58:17.115 --> 03:58:18.896]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[03:58:18.896 --> 03:58:19.437]  2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.437 --> 03:58:31.366]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:58:31.366 --> 03:58:33.707]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:58:33.707 --> 03:58:35.689]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:37.150]  I mean, what?
[03:58:37.150 --> 03:58:37.950]  I mean, never!
[03:58:44.608 --> 03:58:48.872]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:58:48.872 --> 03:58:52.335]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:58:52.335 --> 03:58:54.117]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:58:54.117 --> 03:58:57.380]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:58:57.380 --> 03:59:04.166]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:59:04.166 --> 03:59:09.251]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[03:59:09.571 --> 03:59:15.693]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.693 --> 03:59:18.654]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:59:18.654 --> 03:59:19.775]  I want to keep going.
[03:59:19.775 --> 03:59:23.596]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.596 --> 03:59:25.617]  I want to push all the way.
[03:59:25.617 --> 03:59:26.897]  I've committed to do that.
[03:59:26.897 --> 03:59:29.618]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:59:29.618 --> 03:59:32.559]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:59:32.559 --> 03:59:33.880]  I will never falter.
[03:59:33.880 --> 03:59:36.201]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:59:36.201 --> 03:59:36.821]  I physically will.
[03:59:37.461 --> 03:59:47.471]  I give you my commitment if you financially support us, InfoWareStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:59:47.471 --> 03:59:50.094]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
