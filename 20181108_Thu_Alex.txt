[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:11.000 --> 00:38.000]  Listen to Alex Jones.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Michael Graves was in my studio.
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  Here he is.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  Hey, I actually bought your 50s album. What's the name of that? I love it.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  The 1950s. It was called the Project 1950s.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  I love the punk variant on that.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  I got a couple of those songs that kind of go between the original and the new ones with a little effect.
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  I got to go to calls. You guys are awesome. I apologize for making you hold. We got the former head of the Misfits, his own super popular band right here.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  But I wanted to say something briefly about Ted Nugent.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  But I said I'd go to your calls. We'll go to him now, but I'm going to briefly say it at the start of the deal because I admire renegades.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  And I admire people that have paid a serious price for what they've done.
[01:24.000 --> 01:34.000]  And you know, it's cost him over $100 million since Obama got in where he was banned in the major sports stadiums everywhere by three cartels that run it.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  And he's happy to do that. He feels better.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  But I don't want to hear people say you can't make sacrifices.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  And on this road to liberty and freedom, people made a lot of sacrifices.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  A lot of folks go, well, I better put my head down and kiss ass.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  Well, then you'll sell everything. So we'll talk about next segment.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  But right now, Jim and Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  I love you, Jim. I will hold it against you. You got the same first name as Jim Acosta.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  Oh, it's, um, yeah, unfortunate.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  It's a joke. I got the same name as Alexander Soros.
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.000]  I'm going to have to congratulate you guys on getting that deep fake into the C-SPAN video feed there, how you managed to pull that off.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  Well, my God, I had no idea.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  We're better than industrial light and magic. We hijacked satellite feeds and edited them in a long time.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Yeah, that's going to be the talk news tonight.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  Canadian conspires with Alex Jones to hijack video feeds.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  That's it. New topic, new headline. Canada is going to come hunt and for me now, I'm sure.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  So what's on your mind is migrant caravan?
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  Migrant caravan. Yeah, I was thinking that. And then I started thinking a bunch of other things.
[02:43.000 --> 02:53.000]  But now I'm thinking about how words and violence and wasn't World War I started over a parent besmirching of a woman's honor,
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  which allegedly never happened but wasn't found out until after the husband.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  And it started with a false flag on the Lusitania and a British intelligence assassination of the Archduke, Prince Ferdinand.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  So it started with a bunch of fake BS.
[03:06.000 --> 03:16.000]  It's a big line of BS to push a narrative so that they could go out and do crazy stuff and then they did the same thing repeatedly over and over and over again.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  So that's why they don't quit because it's been working?
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  Well, it's because people lack critical thinking and common sense.
[03:23.000 --> 03:30.000]  And I think that's why the media is so terrified of you and the work that all of your employees do is you guys think critically about it.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  Does this make sense? Is it rational? What are the alternatives?
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  How could it play out if this was the case, if that was the case?
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  That's why they hate you about Sandy Hook.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  You played devil's advocate, my friend. You can't do that.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  Arguing both sides of the coin and saying, hey, there's an edge here.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  You can't do that. That violates people's thoughts of writing.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Well, you sound like a smart ombre.
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.000]  Let me ask you this, Jim.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  Soros has overcome a bunch of governments with anti-fuck types coming.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  He was Nazis in Ukraine.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  They're clearly launching all these attacks.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  I think it's a smokescreen for real attacks. What do you think?
[04:04.000 --> 04:14.000]  If I knew where he was and I had the ability, I would go claim that a reward that the Russians have on him.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  That's what I would do. I wouldn't hesitate.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  I know it's chump change and Western money, but I'd go out and collect it in a heartbeat.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  Well, I don't want to turn him into a martyr because now his little demon son is actually in command.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  I'm thoroughly anti-violence, but evil should be purged.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  The true evil that that guy is, he's overthrowing nations for profit.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  And then the left worship scene.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  Interesting point. God bless, Jim. Smart cookie.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  More calls straight ahead. Matt Bracken will be taking over.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  He'll ride shotgun.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  We've got Michael Graves of The Misfits and so much more.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  And we've got ride-to-shot gun. I'll ensure your calls straight ahead.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  We're the thick of the battle now.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  Trump just dropped the hammer. He's got a Bulldog AGN.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  He's only got two months to execute. We'll tell you how on the other side.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  When paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients.
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  These formulas fuel your gut and your body to help you fight toxins and stay fueled all day.
[05:37.000 --> 05:45.000]  These incredible formulas can help keep your body in tip-top shape in the fight against stress, age, and outside toxins.
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  There's no better time to try fluorolife and carnivore to see how well they can support your body.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Don't miss out on the chance to fuel your body and support recovery.
[05:55.000 --> 06:22.000]  Try the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[06:25.000 --> 06:41.000]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  Our children will be a spy to cross your field brave and crazy to judge the fear.
[06:49.000 --> 07:00.520]  You know who's gonna be screaming? It's gonna be the little antifush. Not when we do something
[07:00.520 --> 07:04.560]  to them, but if the globalists pull off their assassination plans against major conservatives
[07:04.560 --> 07:08.640]  and they're gonna hang out to dry, they're gonna be in supermax prisons. Crank it up!
[07:08.640 --> 07:15.360]  I wanna hear you! I wanna hear you scream! Because you're gonna be you morons! What
[07:15.360 --> 07:26.040]  a group of idiots? You know that my card went about 180 miles an hour to listen to this?
[07:26.040 --> 07:33.640]  Just joking, I'm not that cool. 176. Here's the best part right here at the end of the song.
[07:33.640 --> 07:39.720]  I just want to hear you! I just want to hear you! If you're singing for us, Michael.
[07:39.720 --> 07:49.320]  I can't wait to hear you scream. Yeah. It drives me insane. Although you try to fight,
[07:49.320 --> 07:59.200]  you drag from the silence where you hide. I can't wait to hear you scream. I just want to hear
[07:59.200 --> 08:05.760]  you scream. Exactly, stop screaming out against the tyranny. Right. I just want to hear you!
[08:05.760 --> 08:22.760]  I can't wait to hear you scream. Crank it up. I can't wait to hear you scream. I can't wait to hear you scream.
[08:22.760 --> 08:27.960]  Great build up, man. And so what are you talking about there? It's what you're saying here. I can't
[08:27.960 --> 08:31.080]  wait to hear you. I can't wait to hear you get out of that silence. Quit lying to yourself. Get
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.360]  out of your box. Right. Get out of that apathy, that silence where you hide. You have to come
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.800]  out. You have to scream. You have to scream it from the rooftops. You have to stand up and you
[08:40.800 --> 08:49.800]  have to... That's how you claim your life and your soul. You can't hide. Especially not now.
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.720]  It's over. The hiding is over. The weakness is over. I'm going to go to Matt Bracken and these
[08:54.720 --> 08:57.320]  calls. We're going to ride shotguns for the rest of the hour if you want to. And we're going to
[08:57.320 --> 09:00.920]  continue on. This is the most epic moment ever what's happening right now. It's so insane. I can't
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.440]  believe we're even on air during this period. The Civil War is on. The Deep Space Mechanics move.
[09:04.440 --> 09:09.640]  There's no doubt it's all on. I've talked to high-level folks. It's all just pentagons going.
[09:09.640 --> 09:15.840]  They've got the cent com and reams. I mean, it's insane right now, folks. There's a deep state war
[09:15.840 --> 09:22.160]  going on. It is on like Donkey Kong with this new announcement. But just remember, he told me the
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.280]  story. He told me the story. I later learned it from some other executives. So I'll tell the story
[09:27.280 --> 09:33.640]  briefly. I was out like six months ago at Ted Nugent's house here in Texas and hanging out with
[09:33.640 --> 09:37.000]  him and doing a great interview. They got tens of millions of views until YouTube took it down.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.120]  And he was talking about Americana and why he loved America and loved his mom, his dad,
[09:41.120 --> 09:44.880]  everything else, and the spirit of Ted Nugent. He was doing this in the 60s when nobody else was.
[09:44.880 --> 09:50.840]  And he talked about how it didn't hurt him to lose the $10 million a year because he could sell
[09:50.840 --> 09:55.120]  out stuff everywhere in all these big stadiums. But it's three main leftist companies that control
[09:55.120 --> 09:59.680]  it so he can only play it like city, city-owned arenas and things that they don't control.
[09:59.680 --> 10:03.560]  But they didn't have access to the marketing, all of it. And they even told him,
[10:03.560 --> 10:07.880]  leave the second, leave a second amendment. You can be Anto Obama. He's been told,
[10:07.880 --> 10:13.960]  stop being pro-second amendment and you can go earn your own money. It's like they're giving him
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.160]  money. They're going to let him go be successful. And you know what, Ted Nugent, like nine years ago,
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.280]  eight years ago, told him F off. And I knew that story. He told me it was a confidence. I didn't
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.400]  break the confidence. I learned it from other people separately. And that's what everybody's
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.720]  going through here. You know how much more that makes me admire Ted Nugent, that he's lost over
[10:32.720 --> 10:39.920]  $100 million to just say he believes in the second amendment. So when I get persecuted and they
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.400]  take our bank accounts, they lie about me and say I'm putting fake video out and all this in the
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.600]  crap. That's what it takes to do this, folks. So let's not be wimps about this. A lot of folks
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.960]  go, we better kiss ass and go on with the system. No. Everything we've got is because men like Ted
[10:52.960 --> 10:56.880]  Nugent and people that got their arms and legs blown off gave him more for basic freedom.
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.120]  Gentlemen, comments on that. Well, I just think that Ted Nugent understands and has the spirit
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.160]  of liberty. And part of that means, you know, you don't cooperate with tyrants. You have to stand
[11:07.160 --> 11:10.760]  against time. You don't negotiate with terrorists. And I keep, I was actually talking to Michael
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.280]  during the break. I keep thinking about the scene at the beginning of the Patriot Alex,
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.160]  where the red coats come to his house and he thinks, oh, I'm just going to cooperate. Everything
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.440]  will be fine. They kill us. And they kill his kids. And then what time is it? Time to kill. So,
[11:23.440 --> 11:29.960]  well, he'd been a red coat. But the point is, you cannot cooperate. There is no agreeing with
[11:29.960 --> 11:35.360]  these people. They are full blown authoritarians. They all, oh, if I just, so Ted Nugent understands,
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.160]  oh, well, if I just cooperate, you know, I just won't go with the Second Amendment. They'll let
[11:39.160 --> 11:42.840]  me live and everything will be cool. No, Ted Nugent has the spirit of liberty. He says, no,
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.040]  there's no quarter with the tyrant. No, they're not going to give me quarter. As soon as I
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.320]  said, it wasn't even a decision. That's a man. There wasn't even like, well, the money or the
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.720]  Second Amendment, there was no, and if we had that spirit again, it all be over. That's what
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.640]  created the prosperity. Michael, my mind is going to epigenetics. And when we stand up and you take
[12:01.640 --> 12:08.280]  a stand and what's inside of us then comes alive and we're able to then expand our minds, expand
[12:08.280 --> 12:15.000]  our experience, expand our souls, we get closer together. Us, we get closer to God. Yes. Yes.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.560]  And it's, and it's worth it. That's one of the things that separates us from the other side,
[12:19.560 --> 12:26.160]  is that connection to spirit, that connection to that, that force and that energy that makes us,
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.560]  brings us closer to God. And, and, and in the end, saves us. We know that. Can you not feel that
[12:32.560 --> 12:37.800]  force rising? But that's the sad thing is that people are consciously leaving that force. We're
[12:37.800 --> 12:42.560]  getting more in tune with it. We're feeling it. We're in it. And people are consciously trying to
[12:42.560 --> 12:45.440]  get away from it, get away from God. And they're saying they're fake. They're fake. They're not
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.240]  real. They're not real. They're not real. Matt Bracken, we're going to get into these calls. We're
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.520]  going to have you take over. I want you back tonight to former Navy Shield best-selling author.
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.320]  You predict the season of the false flags. This new AG, the way they're crapping their
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.760]  britches now, the establishment is so scared, activating the 900 Antifa grips, which I've
[13:01.760 --> 13:07.440]  been told by high-level folks. I'm going to leave it at that. You start seeing Antifa doxing a bunch
[13:07.440 --> 13:12.000]  of locations. That's the smoke screen for real attacks coming, not by them, but the real teams,
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.840]  Matt. What's your intel on the situation we're in right now? I think that nobody should be eager
[13:17.840 --> 13:26.720]  for this because it can turn into a bloodbath very quickly. It's not just formal groups,
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.560]  but when invasions happen throughout history, when civil wars break out throughout history,
[13:32.560 --> 13:42.240]  private actors use that period as a smoke screen. It'll be like the purge.
[13:42.240 --> 13:48.120]  Where old vendettas, just people that have a grudge, will know that there's no way the police
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.640]  are going to be able to CSI every murder. People get sniped or shot in an intersection. It's just
[13:55.640 --> 14:01.840]  going to be put down to the general mayhem. So people with their own personal grudges will
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.160]  be able to do things and just figure there's no way it's going to be examined than now.
[14:06.160 --> 14:09.680]  I agree, but what do you call this period? How big is the Attorney General move?
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.000]  Well, it's this lame duck period is a period of super high danger because for the next couple
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.240]  months, Jim Jordan and Devin Nunez and the heroes of the Freedom Caucus still control the committees.
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.440]  The Democrats may boycott and say, we're not even going to sit-sit,
[14:27.440 --> 14:32.080]  but the eight members on the Republican side can do a lot in the next two months.
[14:32.080 --> 14:39.280]  This is their window. Well, this is their window, for example,
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.320]  to put out all the information about the FISA document and the deep state coup,
[14:44.320 --> 14:52.000]  all the information tying fusions, the DNC, all these CIA spies, like the
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.680]  the Australian diplomat, Halper, the CIA academic that set up Papadopoulos.
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.080]  It's time to put all of this stuff out. But and I'm really glad that Trump preemptively
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.040]  put the military at the border. He would be so back on his heels if he waited till the caravans,
[15:09.040 --> 15:13.600]  you know, were approaching the border. Now, effectively, this puts the military in charge,
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.240]  which is constitutional, has nothing to do with Posse Comitatus when you're at the border.
[15:18.240 --> 15:22.880]  It's right in the Constitution. Let's expand on that. We come back. We're going to call.
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.760]  Let's look at the triangulation of the attacks and the fact they're making their move.
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.800]  This is definitely a period where we're going to see the deep state counter strike.
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.080]  And what do we know about this new attorney general and what he's about to do?
[15:36.080 --> 15:39.360]  From the behavior of the deep state and the globalist, it appears that they are
[15:40.240 --> 15:43.680]  stricken with fear. We're going to come back with a pastor, Sam,
[15:43.680 --> 15:49.680]  and Ryan and others at Matt Bracken. Michael Graves is here as well and Owen Schreuer.
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.240]  It's a big roundtable for the future. And we're all in it. Stay with us,
[15:54.240 --> 15:56.480]  spread those links and break the censors control.
[15:59.760 --> 16:05.280]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.840]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year resolved not to be the next victim

[16:53.360 --> 17:03.760]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[17:03.760 --> 17:09.040]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[17:13.040 --> 17:17.840]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay, don't
[17:17.840 --> 17:23.600]  wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 834 no tax or go to my
[17:23.600 --> 17:51.600]  website. Danpilla.com. That's Danpilla.com. Danpilla.com.
[17:53.600 --> 18:04.560]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[18:04.560 --> 18:10.000]  the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[18:10.560 --> 18:15.600]  dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[18:15.600 --> 18:21.760]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[18:21.760 --> 18:26.160]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[18:26.160 --> 18:32.000]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible. Now,
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.960]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.240]  earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[18:42.240 --> 18:48.640]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[18:48.640 --> 18:54.640]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want
[18:54.640 --> 19:01.680]  to see it. It's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com. We are kept afloat
[19:01.680 --> 19:07.200]  only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site now. If you're not in
[19:07.200 --> 19:14.800]  the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution. 25, 50, 100,
[19:14.800 --> 19:22.400]  250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists
[19:22.400 --> 19:29.040]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[19:59.840 --> 20:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:10.000 --> 20:36.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:40.960 --> 20:48.800]  Well, that's the previous misfit singer, Glenn Danzick, Hollywood Babylon, the evil Elvis.
[20:49.440 --> 20:52.560]  Matt, I want to take calls for a couple of segments and let you take over here at the
[20:52.560 --> 20:56.480]  end. You've always got a lot of great points to add, but I'm sitting up here all cheerful about
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.200]  them firing the bad AG obviously. So there goes the whole Q and on thing down the toilet.
[21:01.840 --> 21:08.080]  But the activation of Antifa and the calls for violence and them saying we're putting fake videos
[21:08.080 --> 21:16.400]  out that aren't fake. There's suddenly a new level or several levels of desperate lying of threats.
[21:16.960 --> 21:20.560]  Now the view is saying that the woman at the White House attacked the Costa.
[21:20.560 --> 21:26.720]  It's not about a Costa. It's about the level of lying. What is the tactic here? And what would
[21:26.720 --> 21:32.480]  you call this period we're in right now? I think this is the this is like the kickoff or the
[21:32.480 --> 21:40.000]  interim period where we're going to see actions happening so fast that there's not time in between
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.680]  to sort them out and get to the truth. You know, one false flag will go out and its lie will stand
[21:45.680 --> 21:52.160]  as truth. And before the aggrieved party, the party that's actually being set up can
[21:52.160 --> 21:58.480]  figure out another one happens. And this will take on a life of its own. It's going to accelerate
[21:58.480 --> 22:05.920]  into a feedback mechanism that basically has no breaks. And there could even be a depending
[22:05.920 --> 22:11.680]  on who's who becomes a target. This thing with with Tucker Carlson is very significant.
[22:11.680 --> 22:18.160]  When guys like Tucker Carlson have a mob outside, it's very small, a very small step to Molotov
[22:18.160 --> 22:26.000]  cocktails through windows at night. And and then to, you know, down the street rifle sniping
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.840]  when that's the thing that they block the street off the guy that leads it out of New York. This
[22:31.840 --> 22:37.200]  professor is the same one that sent him after Cruz and and he's made fun of this thing. It's a great
[22:37.200 --> 22:44.160]  thing. He's the guy protected by Soros. He's in charge of this. He says kill cops, kill all white
[22:44.160 --> 22:47.680]  people. He's white, of course. You know, you're an effing white male and the guys saying it's white.
[22:48.480 --> 22:53.920]  So this is their plan. This we call him Pez dispenser neck. You know, he is this this NYC
[22:53.920 --> 23:00.960]  professor. He is literally calling for war and death. So they're sending a mob out under the
[23:00.960 --> 23:06.320]  command of a guy that says our mission is to kill. So if I said my mission, which I'm not saying it's
[23:06.320 --> 23:10.400]  hypothetical, is to go down and attack the Austin Police Department. And I believe they should all
[23:10.400 --> 23:15.760]  be killed, which I'm not saying I'm saying, you know, his stead. And then I show up with a mob of
[23:15.760 --> 23:22.640]  people. The cops have got their safeties off, Matt. Yeah, this is this is pretty close to where you
[23:22.640 --> 23:27.920]  read the riot act and you demand people dispersed or else, you know, if somebody's holding a Molotov
[23:27.920 --> 23:33.680]  cocktail on your lawn, that's one of the exceptions where you can shoot somebody outside your house.
[23:33.680 --> 23:38.160]  You don't have to, you know, so it becomes more and more of a gray line. What if somebody else gets
[23:38.160 --> 23:44.320]  their house Molotov and now a mob shows up at your house and you hear them talking about Molotov
[23:44.320 --> 23:51.360]  cocktails? They've showed their intent. Matt, don't you agree, though, that the police need to stop
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.040]  this now? Everyone that showed up at Tucker Carlson's house should have been arrested and
[23:55.040 --> 23:58.640]  detained for 48 hours. They're part of a terroristic threat. They're part of an organized racket
[23:58.640 --> 24:03.280]  to dirt because when I told Tucker Tucker's family on video, move out, get out. That's like the
[24:03.280 --> 24:07.600]  Klan coming to black people's house in Alabama and say I move out of our town. If this is literal
[24:07.600 --> 24:14.080]  KKK crap. Sorry, Matt, go ahead. Yeah, this is this is this is absolutely right. That riot act
[24:14.080 --> 24:20.080]  point is very true. And if Tucker came out on the one in front ports with a shotgun and fired over
[24:20.080 --> 24:24.480]  their heads, I mean, that's it didn't happen last night, but that's going to be something that happened
[24:24.480 --> 24:30.000]  soon. And now there's a guy in my house, man, you know, something important to understand
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.280]  when a when a free first world affluent country rolls into a civil war, it's much different
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.880]  than say it happening in El Salvador. In El Salvador, Tucker Carlson and Jim Acosta and
[24:40.880 --> 24:46.400]  everybody up the food chain, political media, they already live in a gated community fortified
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.320]  in a condo behind a wall in a free society. So we're wide open. You were wide open. We have
[24:52.320 --> 25:00.080]  generals and CIA officials living in Falls Church and, you know, in Maryland suburbs,
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.080]  and they've just got a house you can drive up on the lawn if you want, you can take a truck can
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.960]  drive it across the lawn straight into America is a soft target to asymmetrical warfare.
[25:09.920 --> 25:15.360]  And it's going to be impossible to unwind. Like let's say the next guy instead of a mob,
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.080]  it's a sniping, but but it's a right winger that's sniped. Will you assume that it's a
[25:20.080 --> 25:24.960]  left winger that shot him? Or, you know, we have a lot of really crazy people out here.
[25:24.960 --> 25:31.200]  And it's coming unraveled after Pittsburgh, we know now, it's not just antifuzz, you know,
[25:31.200 --> 25:37.760]  the communists, there are and I know that everybody to the to the, you know, right of
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.600]  Lenin is called a Nazi and I get that. But there are swastika wearing swastika flag,
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.760]  hard, cold, national socialist. No, no, so the crazy, crazy beehive is open and this is a crazy
[25:49.760 --> 25:56.160]  time to be alive. Michael, cross flags, it's a time when false flags can be extremely prevalent,
[25:56.160 --> 26:02.000]  because you have people who are very violent, willing to use the binary means necessary tactic.
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.920]  No, I get it. Once hell breaks loose, hell breaks loose. Once the venerable civilization is peeled
[26:07.920 --> 26:13.680]  back, everybody starts killing because it's open season. Let me tell you, civil war starts.
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.400]  I'm going to be very upset because I didn't stop it. But then once it starts, well,
[26:19.920 --> 26:26.400]  I'm having anxiety over here because when you, you know, you listen to to to Matt talk and
[26:26.400 --> 26:33.600]  taking in all of the information that that you have that we have that we know when you put all
[26:33.600 --> 26:41.040]  those pieces together and you and and you you think forward to where we've come and I see those
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.680]  the pictures that you're putting up outside Tucker Carlson's house and that anxiety because that
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.520]  spirit knowing where we're knowing where we're headed is is is terrible and this is a group run
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.800]  by a guy that says he wants to kill Trump's family and he wants to kill police, right? It's not it's
[26:58.800 --> 27:03.600]  not we're just, you know, this is what we think is going to happen. No, a group's coming that wants
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.880]  to kill him. They're saying it. They're saying that this is that they're coming to to take out
[27:08.880 --> 27:14.560]  conservative and you're not safe. That's the truth. But let's not forget that's true. Let's not forget
[27:14.560 --> 27:20.560]  this all stems from the biggest lies ever told that Trump colluded with Russia, that Trump's a
[27:20.560 --> 27:25.680]  Nazi, that Trump's a KKK member. That's the background of this entire thing that justifies
[27:25.680 --> 27:34.720]  their violence, all perpetuated by CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, New York Times, Washington Post. If this
[27:34.720 --> 27:40.160]  civil war pops up, those are the news outlets responsible for it. 100 percent. Amen to that
[27:40.160 --> 27:44.320]  be military tribunals. We're going to come back with phone calls with Matt Bragg and I promise
[27:44.320 --> 27:48.160]  we won't everybody will come back in three minutes. Michael, stay here. Michael Graves,
[27:48.160 --> 27:52.000]  Michael plug your website for folks that haven't visited official Michael Graves.com,
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.200]  official Michael Graves dot com. All right. And you guys briefly you have a pro life demonstration
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.080]  in a flag length event this weekend in Austin. Tell folks about that this Saturday at 10 a.m.
[28:02.080 --> 28:08.640]  We're meeting at a Texas State Cemetery 909 Nova Soda Street in Austin, Texas. It's the
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.480]  Marines birthday. We're going to lay. We got hundreds of flags. We're going to lay them
[28:12.480 --> 28:17.760]  at the veteran cemetery to honor our veterans. Then after that at one o'clock, we have the
[28:17.760 --> 28:23.200]  stop government funding of abortion rally, which is going to be at the South Austin Planned Parenthood
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.720]  on Ben White Boulevard. We're going to have signs. Bring your own signs. You know, heck,
[28:26.720 --> 28:29.520]  bring your family. Honestly, it's going to be a really fun event. A lot of great people coming.
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.480]  Going to be a lot of camaraderie. A lot of parking around there. There should be plenty
[28:32.480 --> 28:37.360]  of parking. Two nine and a 35. People coming from all over the states. Marines coming out. I'm
[28:37.360 --> 28:41.760]  really looking forward. So one o'clock Saturday, stop government funding a Planned Parenthood
[28:41.760 --> 28:45.680]  protest at the South Austin Planned Parenthood. 10 o'clock that morning, we're celebrating the
[28:45.680 --> 28:49.680]  Marines birthday honoring the veterans by doing a flag lay at Texas State Senate. And if you've
[28:49.680 --> 28:52.320]  missed it, get your pen and paper ready. We'll tell you about it again when we come back on the
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.240]  other side of this quick break. Matt Bracken, your calls and more. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.

[33:21.520 --> 33:29.760]  You know, if you want to know why they did the whole Jim Acosta thing and he had
[33:30.720 --> 33:33.200]  bumped into the lady and grabbed her, then they simply put off that video.
[33:34.400 --> 33:40.400]  It's to change the subject from Gizburg breaking through her ribs and looking like the Crip Keeper
[33:40.400 --> 33:44.240]  and another Supreme Court Justice getting racked up for Trump in America, to change the subject
[33:44.240 --> 33:50.240]  from the corrupt AG being removed. It's to change the subject of the left lasing all the right wing
[33:50.240 --> 33:54.640]  and patriot targets right now. That's what it is. We're going to your phone calls. Everybody's
[33:54.640 --> 34:00.320]  welcome. Here's our four-person round table on the caller. That makes five pop in on these topics
[34:00.320 --> 34:07.600]  here, but it's really hard to overstate how amazing it is. So when I just get easier for one minute
[34:07.600 --> 34:13.840]  before we go to calls, what it's like to finally see sessions, everything we wanted out. And then
[34:13.840 --> 34:17.840]  now it's here and we're kind of just moved on past it. And there's a fire-breathing guy that sees
[34:17.840 --> 34:23.040]  what's going on and's got them so scared. Let's go to Michael Graves and then Owen Schreuer and then
[34:23.040 --> 34:31.120]  Matt Bracken. Well, I just pulled up an article that says, you know, Rachel Maddow is one of the
[34:31.120 --> 34:37.120]  people behind these protests that's happening. Oh, yeah. This is a break the glass in case of
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.240]  emergency plan to protect the Mueller investigation. Yeah, that's Holder runs that. To protect the
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.840]  lies and the... We've got to go out and go to your house and threaten you because of the... So,
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  yeah, the marches are being sponsored by Indivisible.org, which is a liberal activist group made up of
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.640]  former congressional staffers, which you know, that's on the up and up. You know what it means?
[35:00.640 --> 35:06.800]  A bunch of leftist spooks are going out run by Holder to people's houses. I'm glad you brought
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.040]  that up. Guys, print that for me because Soros is involved. Move-ons involved. Read that article,
[35:11.040 --> 35:19.520]  Michael Graves. That's so key. It's from Grabby News or Graby News. The group is demanding acting
[35:19.520 --> 35:24.640]  Attorney General Matt Whitaker disclaim any authority over the Robert Mueller Russia probe.
[35:24.640 --> 35:31.680]  But he's already refused. Matt, I was MSNBC colleague Matt Miller earlier Wednesday called for
[35:31.680 --> 35:37.520]  taking the streets in response to sessions fire. Because this was all a hoax, setting up this
[35:37.520 --> 35:41.600]  group, doing it. Now the new Attorney General, the acting Attorney General, is saying he's not
[35:41.600 --> 35:47.040]  going to do this. Owen, what are you expected to do? Well, I think we know what they're going to do.
[35:47.040 --> 35:50.960]  Eventually, they're going to get even more violent. They'll start doing marches. But Alex,
[35:50.960 --> 35:54.480]  I kind of want to just zoom out and talk about the larger picture here for a second. You know,
[35:55.280 --> 36:01.360]  this society has become so perverted and so corrupt that it's just inevitable. We have more
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.400]  perversion, corruption, criminal activity, and we're just totally inept from any morals. We're
[36:06.400 --> 36:13.120]  totally inept from God and greed and lust and perversion and deception rue the day.
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.960]  So this is the spiritual battle that eventually had to be here. Humanity,
[36:16.960 --> 36:23.680]  the West had become so corrupt, had become so sick, so deceived, and so just inept of morals or
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.360]  God that this is the culmination of all of it, Alex. This is humanity finally deciding we're
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.520]  done living in a perverse society. We're done living in a West that's so corrupt where we don't
[36:33.520 --> 36:37.440]  even know what freedom is anymore. We're done having tyrants run our country. We're done with
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.840]  the lies and it's a spiritual battle. It's not going to be fun. It's not going to be easy.
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.760]  But humanity has finally reached this point where we've seen what would become in the mirror
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.000]  and some of us reject it and get violent. Others want to fix it. And let's expand on that.
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.200]  The left one, oh, party, do whatever you want. Anything goes except my free speech or raising
[36:55.200 --> 36:59.200]  my kids the way I want or living my life. And now they've really shown themselves
[36:59.200 --> 37:07.120]  as the authoritarians. Matt Braggum. Whether you are a believer in God or in natural law,
[37:07.760 --> 37:16.720]  which could in a sense be on the same side, this level of perversion and taking humanity
[37:16.720 --> 37:22.880]  towards areas that are so far out of bounds, the snapback was inevitable. The pendulum
[37:22.880 --> 37:27.760]  returning is inevitable. What's different though is that we have such a technologically complex
[37:27.760 --> 37:34.560]  society that if there are massive riots that lead to looting, the whole thing can go down the tubes
[37:34.560 --> 37:42.160]  because it'll be impossible to sustain this type of an economy if there are highways being blocked,
[37:43.920 --> 37:49.920]  railroads being sabotaged. Sure, no one believes you can have a world war until 50 million die.
[37:49.920 --> 37:52.880]  Everybody thinks it goes on forever until you realize how fragile it is.
[37:52.880 --> 37:58.320]  Yeah, I want to make a point about what you said, the left lasing. That's exactly right.
[37:59.680 --> 38:06.880]  The cavernal hearings showed that the Democrats and the media were willing to participate in an
[38:06.880 --> 38:13.760]  all out character assassination and totally lie about it. And even as the false witnesses are
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.840]  revealed, they don't care. It's a tactic. It's like what Harry Reid said. You know, well, it worked,
[38:19.840 --> 38:27.760]  didn't it? You're lying about tax returns. So what we're seeing is that the left and the media
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.600]  will absolutely lie. They will point at the sky and say that it's green or purple and with a straight
[38:33.600 --> 38:39.760]  face. But, and I wrote about this in a short story called what I saw at the coup. At a certain point,
[38:39.760 --> 38:45.840]  the media will become targeted. And, you know, that when when they become an active participant
[38:45.840 --> 38:52.800]  in this civil war, when they become, you know, virtually the gobbles of the of the left, then
[38:52.800 --> 38:59.680]  they become part of, you know, one of the soldiers and they can't then expect to be in some sacrosanct
[38:59.680 --> 39:03.600]  bubble. You know, look at what happens. That's why they're preently doing it. You're right.
[39:03.600 --> 39:07.280]  Pastor Sam in Texas, Pastor Sam, thanks for holding. You're a trooper. You're on the air.
[39:08.320 --> 39:15.200]  I will go up to the land of unwalled villages. I will go to them that are at rest that dwell safely.
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.160]  All of them dwelling without walls and having meter bars nor gates to take a spoil and to take a
[39:20.160 --> 39:26.080]  prey to turn their hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.720]  have that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the
[39:30.720 --> 39:37.040]  midst of the land. That is out of Ezekiel 38. And it's exactly what the round table is discussing
[39:37.040 --> 39:41.840]  right now. I'd encourage the infill warriors to look at it. I've been pounding the pavement pretty
[39:41.840 --> 39:48.240]  hard, Alex, and I've got 20 things to say. I'd like to just pick one or two. We have some elected
[39:48.240 --> 39:54.320]  representatives that have gone on the war path and they're being suppressed. We need to get in and
[39:54.320 --> 40:01.840]  really call them Rep Steve King out of Iowa. Senator Jim Inhofe out of Oklahoma, he just laid
[40:01.840 --> 40:08.400]  out his funding plan for the border wall and it's almost nowhere in the news. I was at that
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.880]  conference. I asked some questions to the senator and we had a good talk about that,
[40:12.880 --> 40:19.520]  which can be found if you bring up Pastor Sam hyphen Inhofe. You won't find it anywhere else
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.160]  on the net. What was really discussed in his press conference because this is what the news is
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.560]  trying to do, but it's time for us as a land of unwalled villages to fortify our defenses and to
[40:30.560 --> 40:36.560]  really strengthen ourselves and be ready for battle. I appreciate you, Alex, as a battlefield
[40:36.560 --> 40:42.400]  commander going out to each foxhole and saying, okay, no more 50% alert. Everybody's got to be awake
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.040]  all the time, all night long, because now's the time that the attack's coming. That's always a
[40:47.040 --> 40:53.280]  shock to the young soldier, but the grizzled veterans know it and you're 100% right. One more
[40:53.280 --> 40:59.920]  thing, Austin PD, it's time for you to be on the side of right. We know the Patriots know all about
[40:59.920 --> 41:06.080]  Dr. Terry Allen's organ trafficking ring. We know how many exchange students have disappeared
[41:06.080 --> 41:13.280]  and walked out of his house in 15 igloo coolers. It is time for you to stand up to the wicked powers
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.240]  that are right here in this capital city and to take them down, hold them accountable to the law,
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.600]  to the law. That's all we ask is Patriots. I'll pass. I don't know about igloo killers and stuff,
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.920]  but I appreciate your point, the point that we're an open and free society. That's being exploited.
[41:27.920 --> 41:33.680]  Let's jam in one more here. Let's go ahead and talk to Golda in Minnesota. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[41:33.680 --> 41:41.520]  Hi, Alex. Thank you for having me on. So this whole Jim Acosta thing, we're all talking about
[41:41.520 --> 41:46.560]  how he's touching a woman's arm and talking about video editing. We're missing the big point.
[41:46.560 --> 41:52.560]  He doesn't follow directions in these press briefing rooms. That itself is a form of violence.
[41:52.560 --> 41:59.360]  When I was watching him, you know, kind of challenging the president, getting rough,
[41:59.360 --> 42:06.880]  he was less than two feet away from the president, not following directions, not listening to people,
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.000]  you know, fighting this lady. I think that the reason why they want him in that press briefing
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.520]  room and all these journalists are there is to kind of be a Trojan horse or inspire some sort
[42:17.520 --> 42:23.040]  of crazy to actually attack the president. You're saying Acosta could be used at a later
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.640]  point as a distraction or some sort of a foil? Right. I think what's really happening is they're
[42:28.640 --> 42:35.920]  all part of their resistance. CNN actually supports Antifa, right? No, CNN is a dedicated, foreign,
[42:35.920 --> 42:40.960]  offshore criminal institution. Great points. Let me get Matt Bracken and our other guests take
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.160]  on that in a few more calls. And then you got to get suited up. The war room, three to six p.m.
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.440]  I'll take all these callers on the war room that don't make it here, Alex. They can transfer those
[42:49.440 --> 42:53.520]  over. All right. We'll be right back, folks. But the big news is we got a new attorney general.
[42:53.520 --> 42:59.360]  We'll eat your takes on that, too. When we come back, all hell's breaking loose and we're covering it.
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.680]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[43:03.680 --> 43:09.120]  the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.320]  dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best
[43:14.320 --> 43:20.240]  iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.400]  was pretty good, but hard to source. And the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.680]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been
[43:29.680 --> 43:35.520]  incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.320]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.440]  showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[43:45.440 --> 43:52.640]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen,
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.000]  you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.760]  X3, now available at infowarslife.com. We all know that the outside toxins in the water
[44:01.760 --> 44:06.320]  is a serious health issue. Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost

[47:16.480 --> 47:24.160]  Live uncensored and really hated by the globalists. Live, raw and unfiltered.
[47:24.160 --> 47:31.680]  It's the Alex Jones show. Thank you sir. We got a great crew here you know. You know a lot
[47:31.680 --> 47:38.400]  of our crew are former members of Legion of Down. Now seriously, let's get serious.
[47:39.200 --> 47:45.680]  Ginsburg Hospitalized the Broken Ribs. Man, more bad news, I tell you. Texas Judge releases
[47:45.680 --> 47:53.120]  juvenile defendants after losing election. South Africa, South African whites barred from registering
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.440]  on government jobs website. Now see if I'm against whites being discriminated against,
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.200]  I'm a white supremacist but I wouldn't want to hear that blacks anywhere were barred because
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.160]  you know, I believe Martin Luther King and Common Sense but over there, ZeroHedge.com,
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.680]  it's up on infowars.com, they're taking the land, they're saying you can't register,
[48:11.680 --> 48:16.560]  whites can't have jobs. Wow, that's what Hitler did to the Jews. Baby,
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.160]  trafficking ring busted in massive raid. That's up on infowars.com. Five-month-old baby,
[48:22.160 --> 48:27.440]  rescue. This is happening everywhere. A multi-thousand percent increase, even NPR has to report on it
[48:27.440 --> 48:33.600]  but they say Trump's not doing anything. That's what's scary to me is to watch national news go.
[48:33.600 --> 48:37.840]  Jones claims there's pedophile rings. The pope's about to step down because of it.
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.920]  Matt Bracken, EnemiesFar in Domestic.com, former Navy SEAL terrorism expert.
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.440]  I almost feel guilty that I haven't been more chicken with the head cut off today with Antifa
[48:49.440 --> 48:56.560]  activating 900-inch harassing people. I, like you said, they're creating the atmosphere. They
[48:56.560 --> 49:01.520]  don't even know why they've been sent. I know why from my own research and sources. I was told
[49:02.480 --> 49:07.760]  six months ago, if you see Antifa start going to people's houses all over, that they don't know
[49:07.760 --> 49:13.040]  they're being set up. That means that the deep state criminal elements are preparing a coup
[49:13.040 --> 49:18.480]  against the entire nationalist resistance. And when I did a video on that, they flipped out
[49:18.480 --> 49:24.720]  lied about what I said and took it down. So they're particularly scared of this analysis. And I've
[49:24.720 --> 49:30.480]  learned over the target, get the flak. I get more flak on this, anything else. And now it's manifesting.
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.040]  You're a smart guy in closing comments. What do you think's going on?
[49:34.720 --> 49:37.680]  Well, we're going to see it turn the corner when it goes from
[49:38.400 --> 49:43.760]  moms outside of houses to targeted assassination. And the target of assassinations will be just
[49:43.760 --> 49:50.160]  as likely to be a false flag as not. And another factor are weaponized lunatics,
[49:50.960 --> 49:57.600]  especially in the internet era. It's particularly easy to find somebody who's label and susceptible
[49:57.600 --> 50:01.840]  and then spin them up and turn them into a human weapon. I'm not saying that any of the
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.880]  recent ones, like the fake bomber in his van, he was practically a walking advertisement,
[50:06.880 --> 50:12.880]  please weaponize me for some purpose. I'm an idiot and I'll do anything. But another factor
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.840]  in here that we're seeing in the California case, the thousand oaks case, we're going to see,
[50:18.560 --> 50:23.760]  especially with the new Democratic Congress, a really harsh crackdown on anybody that's ever
[50:23.760 --> 50:29.200]  visited a shrink or taken any kind of a psychotropic drug being forbidden to own firearms.
[50:29.200 --> 50:34.000]  And this will be another way to ratchet the pressure on conservatives. We saw in Maryland
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.760]  a couple days ago, the first red flag fatality where the police went to somebody's house to
[50:39.760 --> 50:44.800]  confiscate his weapons because I forget what, what the issue was a restraining order or something,
[50:44.800 --> 50:51.280]  but it was a divorce. Yeah. But the guy, you know, got into a tussle with the cops and he's dead.
[50:51.280 --> 50:56.000]  So you want to get the, the conservatives spun up to spin the, get the overall speed of this
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.760]  thing, moving faster and faster, find ways, backdoor ways to threaten to take away. No,
[51:01.760 --> 51:05.840]  I get it. That's why I'm really covering those is because I get it's an attempt to
[51:05.840 --> 51:09.760]  to, uh, provocate. You're absolutely right. Matt Bracken, great job. We'll talk to you again soon.
[51:10.640 --> 51:13.920]  Michael Graves, uh, Owen Schreuer, uh, Owen, you got the war room coming up here in just a
[51:13.920 --> 51:18.080]  few minutes. You guys got an event, two events, a flag laying event. We'll say, oh, big flag
[51:18.080 --> 51:22.800]  laying. They hate our veterans. They hate our dead. The, the, nothing triggers them like the
[51:22.800 --> 51:28.000]  veneration of sacrifice, very important ritual. And then the unborn, you're going to honor the
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.360]  dead that stood up for freedom and you're going to honor the unborn. Yeah. And again, Alex,
[51:33.360 --> 51:39.680]  this is mass genocide happening in America. And I mean, if you want to do the identity politics,
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.400]  millions and millions of black babies in New York are aborted like 70% of the blacks are
[51:44.400 --> 51:48.400]  aborted more than that are even born. So it's really sad story. So we're raising issue to this.
[51:48.400 --> 51:53.440]  And, you know, there's so many great veterans that have done so much for this country, even
[51:53.440 --> 51:57.520]  after they serve, you know, the least I can do, I mean, my grandfather served as well. The least
[51:57.520 --> 52:02.240]  I can do is go out and lay a flag and honor their sacrifice on the Marines birthday. And I'm going
[52:02.240 --> 52:06.720]  to be honored to be joined by a bunch of Marines who are joining me. So that's at Texas State
[52:06.720 --> 52:12.240]  Cemetery. What was it guys? Navasota Street, Navasota Street here in Austin, Texas. That's at
[52:12.240 --> 52:17.120]  10 o'clock in the morning, if you want to join us there. And then at one o'clock at the Planned
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.360]  Parenthood in South Austin on Benwhite Boulevard, that's the stop the government funding of abortion.
[52:21.360 --> 52:25.760]  Because here's the thing, Alex, there's nothing I can do personally. No, I agree. If you, if you
[52:25.760 --> 52:29.280]  want to nose job or to have your balls chopped off, I shouldn't have to pay for the sex change.
[52:29.280 --> 52:33.120]  And don't make me pay. You're going to kill your baby. Exactly. So, so right now it's legal to
[52:33.120 --> 52:37.680]  abort your baby. And that's fine. But it should be totally illegal to take government funds to
[52:37.680 --> 52:43.440]  pay for it, which Travis County is the only one in Texas makes you pay. And also, they fund the
[52:43.440 --> 52:46.880]  Democrat Party. So it's totally illegal. So we're going to, we're going to raise some awareness
[52:46.880 --> 52:51.040]  there. And it's going to be a great event just with great people. Yeah, folks, be there. We appreciate
[52:51.040 --> 52:54.880]  you spending an hour and a half with us. Michael Graves again, official Michael Graves.com,
[52:55.680 --> 52:59.200]  former head of the misfits, great ban on your own, have a lot of courage to promote freedom.
[52:59.200 --> 53:06.080]  Closing comments by this amazing epic transmission. Well, we talked a lot today about energy. And I
[53:06.080 --> 53:11.600]  think I guess my message is to the Patriots and the believers out there is to remember that Lucifer
[53:11.600 --> 53:18.880]  Satan is not the opposite of God. It's not God's equal on the other side. Lucifer, Satan, the
[53:18.880 --> 53:28.800]  accuser, the spirit of false is a con artist. He's our adversary. He's ours, not God's,
[53:28.800 --> 53:34.480]  not God's. God has control over everything. He's ours. And we have to continue to fight and push
[53:34.480 --> 53:41.760]  back. And it is my honor to, to, to, to be here and to be on the team. But you're right. I mean,
[53:41.760 --> 53:46.880]  he's our tester. He's not equal to God. He's a joke to God. He's, he's, he's at our level.
[53:48.240 --> 53:54.240]  Yes, yes. And, and he is running rampant. Remember, be vigilant, right? And sober-minded
[53:54.240 --> 54:00.240]  because the devil roams the earth looking for souls to devour, roaring like a lion.
[54:00.800 --> 54:04.960]  And Alex, I think the big news of the day here, as we're about to conclude here, I'm going to take
[54:04.960 --> 54:09.040]  all your calls on the war room, by the way, so college didn't get in. You can Marshall and Tim
[54:09.040 --> 54:13.600]  and Chris and Jeff and Dre and Jacob and Ryan and we'll put it right here in a minute. Go ahead.
[54:14.320 --> 54:18.560]  I think Alex, it's clear what's happening right now. The deep state, the globalists
[54:18.560 --> 54:23.280]  believed they had Jeff sessions under control. So they didn't, you know, pull the plug. They
[54:23.280 --> 54:28.000]  didn't light the dynamite. Now Trump was getting ready. Now that sessions is out, they don't think
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.440]  they have control over Whitaker and they're, they're totally afraid. So now they have to
[54:31.440 --> 54:36.160]  pull that cork. They have to let the flow. The race is on. All right, pull that back up because
[54:36.160 --> 54:40.720]  they want me to plug, but I'm not just in four store.com, water filters, t-shirts, books, supplements.
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.240]  If you don't support us, we won't be here and then we really need your support. So thank you all
[54:44.240 --> 54:48.000]  for supporting four store.com. Whatever you share the articles, the videos, that's what really matters
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.920]  because when I said they're getting ready for civil war folks, it's already been initiated.
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.840]  It's on. We've gone down the slide. It's here. So we have up to 67% off products in four store.com.
[54:57.840 --> 55:01.920]  The new X3, it's got three types of eye down. It's even better. Check that out.
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.480]  Real quick here. Let's see. I'm going to call her Sean in Florida. You say censorship,
[55:06.480 --> 55:13.520]  dims, violence, turning up civility. What do you think's going on? Hey, AJ Owen, the destroyer,
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.240]  Matt, you guys, I love you guys. You're patriots, man. Absolute patriots. I'm
[55:18.240 --> 55:24.640]  totally disgusted. Me and my wife with the politics now, they say more civility after they won some
[55:24.640 --> 55:29.600]  of the, you know, the house. It's absolutely absurd. I can't believe it. I talked to you when
[55:29.600 --> 55:36.960]  you were on Clyde Lewis and on his program and, you know, what kind of a patriot you were and
[55:36.960 --> 55:42.080]  all the facts that you come out with, all the people you've had on your program, everybody.
[55:42.080 --> 55:48.560]  I mean, you had senators, congressmen, people, you know, of valor and distinction on your program.
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.800]  Everything you say is pretty much always spot on. These people are lunatics. I can't even talk to
[55:54.800 --> 56:02.000]  my mother. My mother is like an atheist and, you know, I'm a libertarian Christian and I can't
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.160]  even talk to my mother. You know what I mean? Well, it's not her fault. She's in a trance.
[56:06.160 --> 56:10.160]  She's in a trance, but I hear you. What do we do? I can't break her out of it, man. I can't break her,
[56:10.160 --> 56:15.600]  you know, and I'm not going to try. She's old, she's 80 years old, but still, the whole thing is,
[56:15.600 --> 56:21.120]  the bottom line is, how can you threaten the president with death, you know, and not be, and not...
[56:21.120 --> 56:26.560]  A cost to push that woman, I've had family call this morning and said, why'd you fake a video?
[56:26.560 --> 56:32.080]  Alex, you get banned from social media for just making a comment that's all about free speech,
[56:32.080 --> 56:36.080]  second amendment. They ban you from social media. I said, you little jerk, you've gotten me banned
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.480]  and you brag, you little twerp in public and I'm banned. And then they're like, oh, go to people's
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.400]  houses and threaten them. They're doxing people. They're inciting violence. They're doing all this
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.760]  and they're perfectly allowed to. I mean, I don't know, man. Yeah. Well, listen, they got the system
[56:49.760 --> 56:54.640]  on their side. It's all rigged. The goodness is their time's coming to an end. Sean, epic times.
[56:54.640 --> 56:58.240]  What do you think of this new attorney general? I think by the response we've seen that he's real.
[56:58.240 --> 57:03.280]  I think it's awesome. I think it's awesome. I think we need a clean house once and for all. I'm
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.720]  so pissed off. You know, I'm a registered Democrat for 34 years. I swear to God. I mean, I have my
[57:08.720 --> 57:13.920]  registration still. I vote Republican all the way down the line because of the situation that we're
[57:13.920 --> 57:19.520]  in. Attorney general, awesome. Awesome. I mean, I want this guy to clean. They need a clean house.
[57:19.520 --> 57:25.600]  We love the president, me and my wife, my son, my family, you know, besides my mom, you know,
[57:25.600 --> 57:32.240]  but we, this guy, we need to clean up now. I mean, I agree. I'm out of time. Other callers coming

[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:19.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:29.440]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. You know, I'm almost embarrassed to
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:34.080]  focus on news that's about info wars. It was a distraction.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.680]  But there's a form of alchemy where you can take their distraction and use it not as a teaching
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.960]  moment, but just as an example of what congenital liars these people are and how their tactics work
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:52.720]  and then have it boomerang back on them. Plus, if we don't defeat each lie as it comes at us,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.720]  it scores and then we fall. And I kind of have this attitude of not caring what they do to me.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.520]  And that's a balance. But man, now they're saying that the woman that when he wouldn't give the
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:11.120]  microphone back that Jim Acosta was assaulted by the woman. First, they said he didn't grab it away
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.000]  and push her and grab it away because he pushes her away and then grabs it away and grabs it away
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.360]  again. Now they're saying she assaulted him with the video shows and they show the exact video.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.080]  It's like, it's like this. It's like in 1984. O'Brien, the inner party member is torturing one
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.680]  of their propagandists, Winston Smith, just because they're jealous of him. He's smart.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.760]  He's actually a smart guy. So they want to kill him. It's a form of human sacrifice.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.280]  He explains it to Winston. It's like, it's because you are smart and really cool that we're going to
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.600]  push the hell out of you, making brain dead. We're sick people. We're not making a world
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.440]  that's better when it's to remain a world that's worse. That's the whole eugenicist globalist
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.400]  operation. So he holds up two fingers that we're torturing for like six months. And he finally
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.520]  sees whatever O'Brien wants. You see 10, you see 20, and he goes, oh, I get it now. I'm totally
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.160]  insane. He goes, yes, now your mission is complete. We'll let you drink some gin and watch TV for a
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:06.000]  while. And then we're going to burn you up and kill you. He says, thank you. And then that's
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.960]  what this is. This is all an exercise of he's pushes her away. He pulls back.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.120]  We're not saying it's assault. According to Democrats, it is. We show the footage
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:23.120]  and they say it's fake. Well, now they've gone, oh my God, the public hasn't bought that.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.040]  So it's not just the view. It's coming in that, okay, she assaulted him. And then they show the
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:37.440]  exact footage thinking you have no memory, minute, two minute, two minute. And with five women on the
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:44.560]  scene, they create this artificial consensus idea that all five women, their authority figures,
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:55.520]  they're on TV. They say now he, she should be fired. She assaulted him. The cost is making
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.280]  big scene, won't go away. It's her job to get the mic. She reaches for it. He grabs it away,
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.800]  pushes her back. I mean, according to Democrats, this is like gang raping, what, what he did.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.080]  This is like murdering. I'm not saying it is. It's just still uncouth and unorderly and bad.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.680]  But this is how they operate. And this is the subject we're talking about,
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.440]  so the new attorney general and all the huge things that are happening. Let's go ahead and play
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.520]  the clip of the view here in a moment because this is ridiculous. Here it is.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.680]  When I saw that, I mean, I learned very early on that what I saw was a battery,
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:35.440]  not by Jim Acosta, but by the young White House aide. When you are holding something, if I may,
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.120]  if you're holding something and you snatched this from me, this cup is now an extension of me.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.360]  And that means you've battered me. You've assaulted me. So you're blaming a woman and it's
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:54.320]  very ridiculous. Wow. So the flu's getting fake now. No, it's her attacking. Oh,
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.760]  battery. Two plus two equals. We should get her arrested for battery. I'm telling you what the
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.800]  law is. Clearly. I mean, that is the best I know. I'm telling you what the law is. Okay. Hold on.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.160]  Finish this. This is the lawyer. I'm telling you what the law is. You better arrest her. So I mean,
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.120]  I better go arrest her for battery. Stop, Megan. Go ahead. I think what's terrible is that the White
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:24.080]  House. We need to arrest her. So ABC, the view calls, that's your real headline, ABC News,
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:33.200]  the view calls for the arrest of woman manhandled by Acosta. Change the headline, please. ABC News,
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:41.280]  the view, ABC News, the view calls for arrest of White House aid manhandled by Creepy Jim Acosta.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:52.880]  So now the footage is real, not fake, but it's an assault by her. Yeah, these women really care
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.320]  about women's rights just like Hillary does. That's why she represented rapists and pedophiles.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:04.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:09.680]  Lailania states, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:16.800]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.800]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.960]  metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.360]  metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:41.280]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:48.160]  optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:54.000]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:07.840]  When I grow up, I will be a rock star.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:23.840]  We now take you live to the simple Texas command center. In the heart of the resistance, we have
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:33.040]  pulled X caliber. We now take you live to the central Texas command center. In the heart
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:39.280]  of the resistance, you're listening to Alex Jones. Born and bred to take on tyranny,
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:47.920]  born to avenge, held to pay, committed, ready, 100% thankful.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:53.360]  All right, we're taking your phone calls. Got great, amazing guests in the studio coming up.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.640]  You don't want to miss so much more is going on. But if you just joined us, I just played the view.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:03.680]  There and other channels are saying this. They're not saying that Jim Acosta didn't assault the
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.840]  White House aide when she tried to get the microphone back. They're now saying she assaulted
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:15.440]  him and are calling for her arrest. Man, these people have reached next level BS.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:21.920]  That's up on infowars.com and newswars.com. Let's talk to a caller on this subject.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.880]  Let's talk to Brandon in Georgia. Again, we got all this huge stuff happening,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:33.680]  but so illustrative that we show HD video, we zoom in on it to show it up close and they say
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.440]  that's hoaxing when everyone in the world could see 10 different camera angles of the same thing.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:47.520]  What are they thinking, Brandon? Hey, uh, so, uh, I don't know what they're thinking,
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:53.280]  but I know Jim Acosta is the reason that I do the info wars army.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:00.160]  And, uh, it's my first time calling if I'm a little. It's all right, Brad. Because I'm nervous.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.600]  No, I was on this subject and I saw you when I talked about Jim Acosta and CNN.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.440]  But I mean, why do they tell lies like this? What is the point? Acosta should have said,
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.760]  hey, she grabbed at me. It was reflex to push back at her. The reason we're doing it is they
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.000]  said that Corey Lewandowski basically murdered a woman by barely pushing her hand away when she
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.480]  grabbed him. It's not a big deal. It's okay. You guys gotten a little bit of a thing. The point
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:26.480]  is by their yardstick, this is like dropping hydrogen bombs on babies. And so now they said,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.200]  we lied about it, but now they're saying, no, she needs to be arrested. Arrest the woman
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.360]  when the man overpowers them. That's the view. I appreciate your call, Brandon. God bless you.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.120]  We're going to understand your nervous. It's okay. We'll let you call back. All right,
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.240]  let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois. You're on the air. Go ahead. We've got a new
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.360]  acting attorney general and the deep state has launched 900 Antifa groups swearing to go to
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.120]  people's houses and intimidate them. Antifa, again, is just a cover group for the deep state
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.880]  and actual assassination teams. The deep state is looking at actually using
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.080]  but the real assassination teams are watching those teams. So this could be a very explosive
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:12.000]  moment in history, my friend. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Truth. There's truth in their air.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.800]  Truth mixed with air is still air. So first of all, with this QAnon thing, those of us
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.680]  who were kind of sucked in by it need to have the humility to understand that we need to learn from
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:31.920]  this. I mean, that's sort of my opinion on that. And on the other thing, do you think,
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.880]  I think this is a costly thing. You're trying to keep this in the news cycle.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:41.120]  You know, there's a big distraction basically from all the stuff that's going on and all,
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.120]  you know, and Trump going on offense so aggressively. Oh, I totally agree. The whole show
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.400]  should be Trump's on offense. His new AG. Who is he? What has he said? Why are they sending
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.560]  out 900 Antifa teams to harass people when I've already predicted that's the precursor for the
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.760]  real physical attacks, which means they may be preparing to kill the president.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.600]  Correct. I agree with that. And, you know, is there a way to juxtapose the video of
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.440]  Lewandowski with the Acosta video and sort of push that out there, you know, because
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  whenever they act completely ridiculous, you know, it's obviously acceptable. And then now
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.000]  that they're kind of trying to flip the script and charge this woman with assault on Acosta. I
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.640]  mean, it's just the good news is I really think the same people that are left in this one are not
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:37.520]  buying any of this, you know? Well, that's it. And I'm not even mad at the view. I'm ashamed as an
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.360]  American that we have a show with like eight million viewers or whatever, five million viewers
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.960]  putting on the day saying this woman assaulted him. We're not even saying that he assaulted her.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:52.240]  We're just saying that he's lying. He did push it on her and he did grab grab better. It's just
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.760]  there's no, again, they will drop women like an old shoe. The so-called feminists do not care about
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.720]  women. They want to control you. I care about women. I care about men. I care about black people,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.680]  white people, everybody. I love everybody. I mean, I don't like virtue saying, well, I got three
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:14.240]  daughters. I saw the media put out reports saying Jones says his daughters can't have professional
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.320]  jobs. Never said that. I hope my daughters become rocket scientists and the president.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.640]  But this is what they project on us. God bless you, Chris. Good points.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.080]  We're in a civil war right now. Okay. And I said this on air, not just from my own research, but
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:38.880]  from Intel, that the anti-fagribs publicly work for sorrows and work for holder in the deep state,
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.760]  that they want them to get demonized. Actually, they don't know they're part of this
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.000]  to go out to people's houses and identify them so they can later kill who they want
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:56.400]  and blame Antifa if they decided to decapitate Trump. And so the fact that they're now doing
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.320]  this and going to everybody's houses and by the night, because these cowards always show up at night,
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:09.200]  900 targets. They're hitting 900 targets directed by moveon.org, who's the main funder of that.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:19.120]  You guessed it. Mr. Rottenface towards Soros. So it's on, folks. This is it. Trump's dropping
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.680]  the hammer. Everybody wanted it. You got it. And Sessions is gone and we were right. He was bad.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:30.160]  Boom. Deal with it. Obviously, they're going to try to infiltrate our movement. Obviously,
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.920]  they're going to try to discredit the real patriots. They did it with QAnon. So don't listen to the next
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.440]  magic bot that doesn't have skin in the game, that hadn't been around 20 years, that has no
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:52.160]  track record. All we've got is a track record of delivering. It's not about being up here going,
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.840]  oh, look, we delivered. We're right. We're so smart. It's about, dude, they're trying to destroy us
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.080]  because we're sending the truthful signal. We're broadcasting the coordinates of victory.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.560]  And if people just get that, it's over for them. If our talking points go mainstream,
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:14.880]  which is starting to happen, it's over for the globalists. Mega banks, tax exempt with diplomatic
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:22.240]  immunity and all the rest of us are poor. And the elites say we're obsolete. That doesn't sound
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.000]  like a very good sales plan. You're all scum. You're skiddiots. We're going to steal your money
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.160]  and then kill you. My political ideology is not trying to be part of the elite because you're not
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.720]  elite. I get around these globalists. I feel empty inside. I've got around average real people. I
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:43.920]  feel strong. So it's a pleasure. It's like Tony Montana, when they say, okay, we'll get you a
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.320]  green card if you kill this communist. He goes, I'll kill the communist for free. And he does.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.240]  Now I'm the same way. It's like, this is a pleasure. I mean, it's a pleasure to die for freedom. I
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.440]  don't want to die. I want to live forever. The point is, it's a pleasure.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:06.640]  You give me a green card, I'll carve him up real nice to the difference. I want to defeat them.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.360]  I kill the comments for fun. For a green card, I got to carve him up real nice. Let's take
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:21.200]  our phone call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck and Arkansas. Chuck, thanks for calling
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:28.720]  you on the air. Hi, Alex. I'm a big fan, first time caller. God bless. And since we got a new
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:36.080]  AG, how about if we have some new policy, a second special counsel to finally go after
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.640]  all of the criminal behavior by the Democrats? Oh, I say go on the total. I said this,
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.760]  Trump must go on a total war path, a total crusade. They did it with all made up crap.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.760]  They are the real polluters. They're the real foreign influence. They're the censors. Go
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.320]  thermonuclear. You have the executive annihilate or be annihilated.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:04.560]  Well, he should also go after a special tech or high tech with all the meddling they did in this
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:12.240]  election and all the deep platforming. I mean, just we've got two months before they bring in the new
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.720]  crew. Oh, don't worry. They're activating their terror teams because Trump's taking the gloves off,
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:24.800]  brother. That's why I'm saying everybody better get ready. Do you think he's going to do that?
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.480]  You know, he's going to do it all and more. He gave them the path. I hope so. He gave them the
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.480]  path of backing off and getting out of the way. Now they've chosen the path of pain. Now they've
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:42.960]  chosen the path of war. And guess what? Those that know war don't want war. But when war comes,
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:50.160]  we wage war. War is now coming into orbit. Mars is here. Stay with us. Infowars.com. Thank you,
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:16:08.640]  Chuck. God bless. Stay with us. What if there was a social media network only for the conservatives?
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.080]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence? There is.

[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:25.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:35.040]  it's Alex Jones. Well, you know, in each own Troy, he's riding shotgun with us and Michael Graves.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:40.800]  I've been a big fan of for decades. Former misfits lead singer and has
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.440]  sold out shows across the world got canceled in England because he dared tweet Paul Joseph Watson
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:51.040]  and Alex Jones tweets. He arrived and shot down whether you guys are doing a flag laying
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.360]  ceremony this weekend, but out of the gates. So I was literally during the break to even talk to
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.480]  you guys front and center. All this stuff going on and if you go into folks houses,
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.640]  sorrel saying go to everybody's houses 900 of them, they're talking about violence,
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:10.880]  killing Republicans, killing Trump. They're so scared of this new AG. You've got Ginsburg
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.760]  breaking her ribs. And so they say she could be gone in a month or two. I mean, she looks like
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.240]  the Crip Keeper. Just everything it seems is accelerating. It's like a quickening. What would
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:27.200]  you call it? I think it's exactly it's a quickening. I mean, for for people that have been paying
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:35.760]  attention like myself, we've seen that this is all culminating exactly as you've said it would
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:43.200]  culminate. This it's it's been building to this and it's it's dangerous out there. It's crazy out
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:49.520]  there. Exactly. I don't even feel like I shall. So it's so crazy. I feel like I can be on air.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.520]  It feels weird even talk about it like it's about action. No, I agree, Alex, but a certain level.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.280]  I'm not surprised by any of it. I mean, if you light a stick of dynamite, it's going to blow
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.160]  up. I mean, you know, so this was inevitably going to happen at some point in time. I'm just
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:08.400]  honestly stunned. I mean, we've seen the lengths that the fake news would go to. We've seen the
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.640]  lengths that the left will go to to lie and deceive. This is truly next level. I mean,
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:17.040]  this is beyond. I mean, they say we fake the video of a costa. That's what I'm saying. So
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:23.520]  so you're basically at this point assuming that you can play the same video, the exact same video
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.160]  twice and say, see that one's doctored. It's literally the same video. And I don't know if
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.320]  if they're that stupid on the view. I don't know if they assume their audience is that stupid.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.360]  I don't know what it is. Michael, what's going on? You're a showman. You're a smart guy at the top
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.880]  of your game. What is this attempt just to see it's like a mind control test? It's it's it's
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.240]  look at the left hand as the right hand is doing something else. They the left and the
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  progressives that are paying attention to this, they clearly see what reality is and what happened
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.920]  with Jim Acosta. But then you have all their other minions. These crazy women on the on the on the
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:07.520]  view say, Oh, now it was it was Jim Acosta that got that got, you know, roughed up. And then
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:13.280]  everyone on the left goes, Yeah, that's what happened. I've seen it. Yeah. They were just saying
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:21.200]  right. Yeah. Meanwhile, they're about to activate their antifa thugs or whoever else. I mean,
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.520]  you can put whatever name you want on it. Violent leftist, they're about to activate them. We saw
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.000]  to Tucker Carlson's last night, it's only going to get worse. So behind the scenes, they're up
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.320]  here trying to protect their corrupt establishment government. And they've got these people so
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:40.400]  brainwashed. They don't even understand how they're literally foot soldiers of the most criminal
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.960]  cabal in world history. The world has shrunk thanks to technology. These are the greatest
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:52.320]  criminals in world history, Alex Mueller, the Clintons, the Obama administration's crimes.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:59.200]  These are the biggest criminals George Soros in world. His people ask, why is it so crazy? Michael,
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.760]  because they keep getting away with it. And if you read like crime books or historical criminology,
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.760]  a psycho may kill 15 people and do it all perfectly. But then he wants to start getting caught. So
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.600]  he starts sending letters. He starts getting drunk while he's killing people. He starts,
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.040]  he finally gets caught with three dead bodies in the back of the car. They've gotten to the point
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.520]  where it's just insane. Like they fund these huge caravans, they're smashing the borders,
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:27.040]  and then they go, no, there's no caravan exists. Again, what's happened is all of these people
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:33.440]  that have been put in this bubble. And again, why Info Wars is being taken off the map in silence.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:40.080]  So that stream, that reality, that stream of consciousness, the truth that you need for your
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:45.920]  eyes to be open and see is those people are shut away from it. They're taken away from the light.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.000]  They don't want that confirmation. The truth. They want to show you two of the same videos
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.640]  and say one's a lie. And have you think you're crazy? They don't want anybody there to like
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.080]  say, no, you're right. That's the same video. But this is like, I mean, this is really a spiritual
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.360]  battle, Alex. I don't know how else to explain this. I even had a friend of mine send me a
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.960]  text like, now you guys are editing videos to make people look bad. And I'm just like,
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.960]  how do you fall for this? There is a spiritual frequency right now between good and evil.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.960]  And you're tuned in to either one. You cannot miss it anymore. There's no middle ground.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.600]  You're either on the frequency of good or you're on the frequency of evil. There's no middle ground.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.760]  There's no open spaces. It's all clear. Or versus good and evil. How about saying insane?
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.880]  I don't even know. That's part of that. That's part. That's just one element of the frequency.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.840]  But I just look at, I just look at this, you look at, and of course, it's all a distraction for
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.640]  what's going on behind the scenes. They don't want people to know that behind the scenes,
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.480]  Trump is actually trying to put a bunch of child traffickers in jail that have been running
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.640]  governments. He's been doing it. Yeah. And you just had actually a bust here in Texas. They
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.960]  arrested 75 people. They saved five victims. The mainstream media goes, oh, Trump claims
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  they're busting. You know, they're up like a thousand percent. There is no child trafficking.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.200]  Michael Graves, let me ask you this. What do you think the globalist their minions do next?
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.480]  They seem so scared now. We've got a new AG who two months till they try to confirm him.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.840]  Trump's got to move now, but they are so scared. Gut level. What do you think they're going to
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.520]  pull next? Because they've already gone to level 11, like spinal tapping crazy. I think the rats
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:21.440]  are cornered. They know that they're cornered. And it's absolutely terrifying, Alex. What happened
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:28.560]  to Tucker Carlson this morning is they were trying to bust in the door. Can you imagine that?
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:33.200]  But I'd go crazy. That's what I'm saying. The same response. Yes, kids. The same response.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.840]  Honestly, in that situation, the same response is to shoot those people. And I'm sorry. And
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.680]  they're going to say on media matters that I'm calling for violence. No, I'm not. If someone
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.840]  comes to your house and is threatening your family, it is a human instinct to kill. Well,
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.840]  that's they're all around knocking down part of the door and say, we know where you sleep. And
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.400]  it's his wife alone the night before. Reportedly, it's in the news, but they've talked about it
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.560]  before. Their kids were alone. They went out to dinner. What if your kids are alone? There's like
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.880]  40 people banging on your windows and said, we're going to get you. We know you're in there.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.840]  I mean, the normal thing is either hide or attack. Well, they're just going to keep doing it, Alex.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:12.640]  What would have happened if Tucker was there and the guy tries to knock his door down
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.480]  and Tucker would have kicked his ass? But see, that's what they want. Yes. They agree. They want
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.280]  someone to shoot one of these people. So what you're saying, Michael, is they're going to ask
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:28.320]  a like? Absolutely. I mean, look, they're saying that Paul Joseph Watson's edited this video when
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:34.080]  clearly anyone that has eyes can see that it isn't. So now when it escalates to violence,
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.880]  they're kicking in someone's door and someone's defending themselves or some sort of confrontation
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.320]  on the street and it goes down. What do you think they're going to say? They're going to blame us.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.720]  They're going to blame the Patriots because all they have to do is say, oh, yeah, this phone is
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.000]  green and they go, yeah, the phone's green and they believe it. That's like, you've got a huge,
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.160]  you know, long blue hair. You don't. No, I heard it. I don't have a beard. It has beautiful blue
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.120]  hair. I heard it. I'm seeing it. Michael Graves has long blue hair. It's true. And so and they all
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.440]  see it and said so. And CNN also said you must kill people with blue hair. So now I know what to do.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:14.080]  And if you don't, and if you don't believe us, you're crazy. But that seems to be locked up. This
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:19.120]  is the sad part. And this is why the restraint conservatives have and Republicans have is so
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.640]  key, Alex. I mean, they already tried to kill Steve Scalise and other Republicans at the base.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.960]  Broke Rand Paul's ribs. Yeah, Rand Paul's been attacked multiple times.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.400]  Through hot coffee on me. They confront these people in restaurants. They are pushing.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.880]  They are pushing for someone to fire the first shot. Thank God conservatives have restrained.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.640]  Thank God we aren't retaliating with the actual force that we should be retaliating with.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.120]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen. Right now, it's just American versus globalist.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.960]  This country is under attack. Michael Graves is our guest. We also have Elin Schreuer in
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.360]  here with us. So much more coming up. Matt Bracken as well. And your phone calls, whatever you do,
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:29:00.800]  share these live links. In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.520]  to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.560]  over an open fire, then there's a much better way. The Minivan rocket stove is a biomass burning
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.600]  cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minivan stove
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.320]  is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the finest in survival cooking
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.640]  stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to Minimanstove.com. That's Minimanstove.com.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:33.600]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:39.120]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:46.320]  World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:51.840]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:56.640]  the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:03.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:08.560]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:14.160]  the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:19.840]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.600]  detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:30.480]  that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:35.200]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.320]  it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:46.480]  healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:51.040]  to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.200]  to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:59.920]  bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com. Our grandparents, our great grandparents,

[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:07.280]  at the info store. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:25.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:38.640]  so does he. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. Well,
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:44.880]  we've got the new acting attorney general for at least two months. He's already said day one
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.240]  that he is not going to recuse himself in the fake Russia gate investigation as if he's involved in
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:55.440]  it. And he's not going to take congressional subpoena as the president because it's a separation of
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.720]  powers. He says Hillary should be indicted from all the evidence he's seen. Meanwhile,
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:06.080]  the M4Wars White House pipeline is alive and well says media matters. You type in info wars.com,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:13.280]  Alex Jones, Paul Watson, it's on every channel. Again, it's the boldness to say that we put a
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.960]  fake video out of Jim Acosta, which is distractions from everything. But then it's how bold they are
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:26.240]  to simultaneously say that we put out a fake video. But then to also have other channels,
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:32.320]  like you said, the view saying that actually she assaulted him. This is really weird. This is
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.560]  bizarre. Let's get into the attorney general and go to some calls, but also this. What do you think
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:44.560]  the method here is? They just lie? Well, I think that as spirits of good are rising, the spirit
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.560]  of evil is going to lash out. And that's basically what you're seeing, Alex. I mean, as the demons
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.200]  are getting exposed, they're exposing themselves as demons. I mean, nobody in their right mind
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:01.840]  watches that video of Jim Acosta and says, oh my gosh, he just got battered by that young girl
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.720]  who weighs like what, 90 pounds? I mean, give me a break. And it's her job. He won't give the mic
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:10.400]  back. You're supposed to take it. You can tell, like her face, she's stunned. So here's the issue.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:17.520]  They first, it's not a four deal. They're saying it's fake. Now they're playing it, saying it's real.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:23.040]  But let's, but let's remember Jim Acosta has been acting like a petulant child during these
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:29.280]  White House briefings for almost two years. So he's been trying to get banned. He's been intentionally
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:35.200]  acting like a jackass to try to get banned. So he finally got what he wanted acting like an immature
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.440]  jackass. And Trump finally did what he had to do in ban him. But you notice how small Jim Acosta
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.280]  is. He'll hit that woman trying to grab the microphone. But when Trump steps away from the
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.360]  podium, he falls like a cheap tent. Oh, that's part of the video too. Like he's so scared of Trump
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.280]  with some church walking towards him. He like hides. He falls like a cheap tent.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.880]  But, but, but the 90 year old girl, here, here, since we keep talking about it, let's, for radio
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.240]  listeners, they can't see all this info wars.com, four slash show. Let's play the unedited HD from
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.560]  C span off our satellite for TV viewers, radio listeners. Obviously you've seen it all. But
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:11.520]  here it is. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to challenge you on on one of the statements that
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.680]  you made in the tail end of the campaign. In the terms that here we go, that, well, if you don't
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.560]  mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion. As you know, I consider it to be as
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:27.360]  you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion. It's a, it's a group of migrants moving
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.280]  up from Central America towards the border with the US. Thank you for telling me. And
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.040]  why did you, why did you characterize it as such?
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:40.080]  Because I consider an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion. But do you think that
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:45.600]  you demonized immigrants in this election? I want them, I want them to come into the country,
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.120]  but they have to come in legally. You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.680]  I want it to be a process and I want people to come in and we need the people. Your campaign,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.480]  your campaign, you know why we need the people, don't you? Because we have hundreds of companies
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.000]  moving in. We need the people. But your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.120]  and so on. Well, that's true. They weren't actors. They're not going to be doing that.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.120]  They weren't actors. Well, no, it's true. Do you think they were actors? They weren't actors.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.600]  They didn't come from Hollywood. These were, these were people, this was an actual,
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:21.520]  you know, it happened a few days ago. And they're hundreds of miles away, though. They're hundreds
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.240]  of miles away. They're waiting foreign flags, not an invasion.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.400]  Throwing rocks at helicopters, saying that, that they're coming to take. Hit pause real quick. Back
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:31.440]  to some 10 seconds. I want you to make that point. It's the same gaslighting, though.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.720]  He never touched the girl. She assaulted him now. It's all on video, the opposite.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.200]  And now there's no migrant caravan. There's no, I mean, what is, these people, you know,
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.160]  it is, they're crazy. Jim Acosta believes he controls reality. And that's why CNN,
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:51.600]  everybody hates them because they are the gold standard of fake news. Mr. Graves. Lies, lies,
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:59.680]  lies. Just lies. That whole exchange was just lies. It's not an invasion. It's a migrant
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.440]  caravan. It's, it's not coming. It's hundreds of miles away. It's not, it's, they're not climbing
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.000]  fences. My fist isn't coming. It's like, right. They're not climbing walls. There's just video
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.400]  showing them climbing walls. They're not throwing rocks at helicopters. They're just throwing rocks
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.600]  at helicopters and police and, and police and saying that they're, that they're coming to,
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.440]  to, to, uh, to confront the police and, and that they want in. They don't want to be Americans.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.720]  That's it. They don't want to come in here because they were handpicked by the UN and Soros at those
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:37.680]  camps. Exactly. So, so this is what CNN's doing. No one watches them. They're being disruptive.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.920]  So he, who have a constant goes, the sky's not blue at high noon. We all debate it with him.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.880]  I think that's their final deal. But the problem is, as long as they're at the White House,
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.600]  Bravings, they can keep doing this. Well, and that's why Trump finally gave him the boot. Long
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:55.760]  overdue. Long overdue. And then Fox News, can we cue that up? I keep going back to this. Not
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.960]  because it's about us. It's the top story, not the mass shooting, not the AG fired. I go out there.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:08.080]  The top story in the country is that we faked this video on my children. We did not. Paul Watson
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.040]  put a clip up and zoomed in on it, which is normal, but that's not why I don't even care about me.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:19.600]  What Twilight Zone episode of my end, where we're at the center of the top news again,
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.280]  and they're saying something that openly happened, didn't happen. And then here's
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.760]  even Fox News acting like we made it up. Here it is. The White House
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.160]  Correspondence Association, however, making it clear that they do not support this decision.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.800]  The Correspondence Association strongly objects to the Trump administration's decision to use U.S.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.760]  Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:49.840]  relationship. Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.840]  offense and is unacceptable. Now here's the good part. Yeah, I think it's a misstep on the part
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.120]  of the White House to claim that Jim Acosta was laying his hands on this young intern to try to
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:05.760]  take the mic away. The contact was very incidental. I also think it was a misstep for Sarah Sanders to
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:11.120]  tweet out a doctored video put out by InfoWars, the Alex Jones conspiracy site that kind of
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.720]  made it look more aggressive than it was. The conspiracy site, as he spreads a conspiracy
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.760]  about a doctored video. That's what you get on Fox News. That's why people are waking up to
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.920]  who Fox News really is. They never cared about you being a norm. But it's the defending Acosta,
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:31.600]  like you said, is this rabid clown who runs around all day everywhere doing this. And then
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:38.240]  and then now the girl's the bad person. My mind is blown. I know that we're going to break here, but
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:45.520]  this is all over the news. This is the top story. Meanwhile, again, the truth is it's demonstrable
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:53.440]  that that violence is happening. We are on the cusp. Like you said, there's nine hundred people
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.680]  have been doxxed. Their addresses are out there. These people are being activated. They're
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:02.880]  activating. They're being activated. They're coming for us. But let's be clear, as they want to
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:08.400]  sit here and point the finger saying, you doctored this video, you're the worst, you're fake news,
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:14.800]  they all willingly went along with fake rape allegations. Three women came out and admitted
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:19.120]  they made up rape allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Dave said nothing. And all three were
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:23.440]  literally interviewed and said, don't indict me. I mean, he's a Republican. He's bad. It's a tactic
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.840]  to in front of his wife and kids saying you rape the living hell out of me. On days like these,
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:32.320]  Alex, I just I just sit back and I say, God's in charge. There's nothing I can do. No, I agree.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:36.960]  But here's the answer. Acosta and all these people have gotten away with lying so long
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.080]  that they think it's going to work again. And since the lie doesn't work,
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:43.280]  the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again that doesn't work.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.880]  Now they're just getting. So let me ask you this, Michael, how far does it go?
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:55.200]  As far as as we'll let them go. But I think that they're going to go as as far as they can.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.480]  They're going to jail. You know, I mean, they they know that the crimes that they've committed,
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:07.200]  they know at the highest levels, the what's coming up against them. But again, it's the
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:15.200]  apathy of a lot of patriots. It's the apathy that is going to get us rolled over. We have to stand
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.680]  up. We have to push back against the lies. That's what Ted Newsom said yesterday. He said,
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:24.080]  we got to not get violent. We got to get aggressive. Right. And back in their face right now.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.920]  I truly believe that we could avoid a hot war in the near future. If the police would actually
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.520]  do their job. Every person that showed up at Tucker Carlson's house last night should have
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.120]  been in jail for at least 24 hours, every single one of them, every single one. Yeah,
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:40.400]  because they said you're not safe. They knocked the door in. This is dangerous. Of course,
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.440]  they're going to do it again. They don't face jail. They face. Let me ask the cops this,
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.640]  what would happen to you if you're at work and your wife's there and 40 punks, a gang show up
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:54.080]  to threaten your wife? What would you do? We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're going to take
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:01.680]  your calls. It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.560]  or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dogs for a walk. Believe me,
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.920]  I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:18.400]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy. There's no way I could

[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.920]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.760]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park,

[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.000]  environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.600]  IQ. It literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:17.840]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed based iodine
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:21.760]  that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:27.440]  it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:33.280]  incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:38.480]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others showed us the
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:44.080]  research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:50.480]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.520]  you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at

[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.960]  Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship and you
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.360]  saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars. Yes, some of them are like little side
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.920]  accounts. They even know we have like InfoWarsStore that just showed our products, but they just banned
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.120]  them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:21.040]  loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.760]  the country and the world back from the brink. But the globalists now want to target where the
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:32.320]  resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.520]  want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially. I want
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.640]  to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.760]  going to happen, but you've got to back it and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.480]  never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:57.600]  financially support us at infowarsore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:09.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:24.080]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:30.800]  States government. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.720]  We're on a mission.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.920]  You know, I kind of picked up the way you said lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies. Kind of picked
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.920]  up a little bit of ministry thing or was I just imagining that? Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh Al,
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:58.080]  he's a piece of work. I love that you have that sense, Alex. It's one of the things that is remarkable
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:02.080]  about you, the way that you, you know, when you're coming back from the breaks and you jump on the
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:08.560]  music and you use those lyrics and make it relevant to what's happening. It's amazing. Well, you guys
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.640]  are amazing. I want to go to calls in the next hour. Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL counterterrorism
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.520]  expert. He's predicted a lot of this is going to be joining us. We'll ride shotgun with him,
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:24.800]  but I want to be clear. I got called by the FBI after Vegas and they said, how did you
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:30.000]  say Sunday night? I think they're bringing in Al Qaeda and ISIS forces and I think they'll attack
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:38.720]  a concert or a big event at say 10 o'clock at night. And I said, let me be honest with you.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.400]  I just said that it just, it just came to me and they said, okay, well now we're going to tell you
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.120]  that the guy had ISIS and Al Qaeda paraphernalia in the room and it was an arms deal and there
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:54.880]  were Saudis in the country and they use this as a way to get weapons. He was already basically
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:58.960]  working for the CIA. They didn't go all the way the rest of the way. Then the CIA came and gave
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.600]  me a visit and they told me the rest of the story. That's how that works. You know, pieces.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:08.320]  See, I'm not on air saying that to act cool. This happened. Okay. And it's the same thing here. It's
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.080]  like God's not going to put us in a position and not have somewhere the truth comes out. And it's
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:19.040]  not just me. Soros has overthrown more than 20 countries. Five or six is the last five, six years.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:25.440]  He has a blueprint. He brags that he overthrew Ukraine. He caused riots. He had people shoot
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.560]  police. He did it. He overthrew it. And so now he's funding through his son, Alexander is kind of
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.960]  taking over these, these riot groups and they're attacking and they're saying we're going to go
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.880]  docks houses and then we're going to kill people. And then I know from other sources, they're just
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.640]  to cover for real teams because if they're going to try to kill Trump, they're not going to leave
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:46.960]  Sean Hannity and Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and Matt Roger round. They're not going to have
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:53.040]  these little methods of the decoys. They're the guy they blame, but the real teams are warmed up
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:58.640]  and ready. The fact that they ordered this morning with Eric Holder involved 900 teams to go docks
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.200]  everybody's house. That should create the smoke, which means they are close to trying to kill the
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.040]  president. Now I didn't just say this now, the video I did three months ago where they said
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:10.640]  Jones doesn't get battle rivals from the press. Never said it. They never played it. It was a
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.040]  message to the president 25 minutes long, laying all this out. And now I look back on it for my
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.040]  sources and everything else. That's what scared them. 95% of it is what they've said, what they've
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:25.600]  done. The other 5% is the ether and it is like Oracle level because I say it and it's what happens
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.880]  hours before it happens. So I don't know what's going on here, but it scares them. What do you
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.000]  guys think? Well, I think actually I'm glad that you brought up Ukraine because I think that's
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.320]  actually a key situation to learn about and then for us overthrows governments. But that's what
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:41.280]  they're about to do here. I mean, let's not forget there were quote unquote shootouts. It wasn't
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.520]  really a shootout, but they had people getting sniped basically and they say, oh, where is this
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:48.960]  coming from? And then all of a sudden these two groups started fighting and fighting and fighting
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.440]  and it turns out it was just some provocateur sitting on top of a building just shooting people.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.760]  That's what Soros is going to do here next. And he's got his Antifa groups lined up. So they'll
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:01.200]  say, oh, the riders, they owe it to Antifa. And you have the Patriots over here and they say, oh,
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.600]  it's the Patriots. So they can have a Patriot cell and claim they came out because Antifa. And then
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:08.960]  they'll have some guys, you know, standing off in a tower with a rifle mowing everybody down.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:13.600]  That's what Soros. Yeah. So exactly. People ask how we know this. They do it over and over again.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.840]  Michael, so gut level, what do you think? Because I just the energy level now is just insane.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:23.600]  Well, the one thing that pops into my mind is every time, every time you hear Alex Jones
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:28.240]  in Four Wars is followed by conspiracy theory. So it's putting it out there that, okay,
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:34.320]  anything coming from this outlet or anybody, anything associated with it is not true. And then
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:42.160]  my mind goes to all of the, all of the, the news and information that's come out, even a mainstream
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:48.480]  media about what has what's happening in China and the social, the credit scores and all of the
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:52.480]  concentration camps, the reeducation camps that they're putting people in. And so
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.960]  everybody here, we're not everybody, you know, the leftist, the progressives,
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:00.560]  slow down, say that again, they announced social scores and start putting people in
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:05.920]  concentration camps. And it's even in our news all over the news, all over the news.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.600]  And then you have all these leftist, these progressives who hardly know that the sky is blue.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:18.720]  Don't know that there's anything else happening in the world are being the foot soldiers to usher
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:24.880]  this thousand years of darkness into this country. And they have no idea that
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:31.280]  when the guillotine starts to fall, we'll be the first, you know, few waves to be taken. And then
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:36.320]  they're next. They don't understand that. They don't understand it because they're, they don't get
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:41.040]  how hard people fought to create a beach out of freedom. They have no idea. They have no idea.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:44.480]  Well, they never studied the French Revolution. I forget the exact quote, but it's, you know,
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:48.480]  the guillotine lusts for blood. You know, that once the guillotine starts working,
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:53.120]  doesn't matter whose blood, it just wants the blood. Well, here's the deal. They bashed the
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.480]  West all day because we are the folks that ended slavery. We're the folks that actually were women
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:03.040]  got the right to vote. We're people that put women on a pedestal. And we have a conscience so they
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:07.520]  can manipulate our conscience to feel like, well, yeah, we're not perfect. When meanwhile,
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.520]  it's pure barbarism in the left, fighting the Arab state, the Muslim state, all this,
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.000]  it's just insane. I want to go to phone calls here, but ladies and gentlemen, the country
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.240]  isn't a civil war. It isn't a civil emergency. It's on a, it's under attack from every angle.
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.440]  The press is under attack, free speech is under attack. But the good news is we're actually winning
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:32.800]  because God's not going to sit here and leave us without the tools to deal with it. But we have,
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:38.000]  we have free will. And you look at Trump, it's not about getting down on my knees to Trump.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.360]  I've been persecuted for supporting Trump. I know how he's been persecuted. I know what he's
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:45.360]  really done. He's just trying to get better trade deals and empower us, make us believe in each other
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:51.520]  and come together. And they're saying that's bad. And if we reject this, it's God giving us a choice.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:54.480]  If we reject it, like you said, 1,000 years of darkness, Michael Graves.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.840]  Owen and I were talking, and I had the opportunity to visit Auschwitz in Birkenau a couple months
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:09.760]  ago when I was in Europe. And we were talking about the, the, the feeling that my mother said,
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:13.360]  oh, I've been to the Coliseum. I've been to other places where hundreds of thousands died.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:17.760]  She said visiting Auschwitz in places like that. Literally, she couldn't bring that to get out.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:20.800]  I had a panic attack and I had to, and I had to, I didn't even know that thing.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:24.720]  I had a panic attack and I had to leave. I was weeping and crying. I went into one of the
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:32.640]  intakes and there were just piles of shoes and hair and pictures of children and just normal
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:41.520]  people that were going about their lives. And then George Soros came along and all the evil,
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:48.160]  it's the same evil. It's the same evil that's been, that, that rears its head throughout human
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:54.080]  history. And what's happened in this country to a lot of the people that are out there pushing
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:00.720]  against us is that, that part of history, that part of, of, of the world is gone. And so they
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:05.600]  can't use that. They don't use that in their case. And it's worse than that. They say we're the Nazis.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:12.320]  Right. But that's the thing. They have no idea what Nazis are. You know, you talk about World War
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:20.480]  II. You talk about any, any of it, any example of totalitarian, authoritarian evil. And, and it's
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:25.360]  like, it's the same thing as watching Netflix to them. It's, it's just fake. It doesn't really
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:30.400]  happen. There's also the super ultra right wing lies and hates Israel and hates Jews and says,
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.800]  you know, I work for all this. My grandfather was in North Africa in the Army Air Corps,
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:40.080]  and they did his missions and then he was an officer in the Army. And my other grandfather was,
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.840]  was in the Army Air Corps in Europe as well. I talked to all the other guys. He's come to our
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.360]  ranch. They're all dead now. These World War II facts. I always asked for World War II stories.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:52.480]  They wouldn't tell me. The few times they did, they were like, man, you're talking about miles of
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:57.600]  starving and dead people, dead bodies everywhere, huge forced labor camps, dead people piled up.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.080]  We had to bury them with bulldozers. There were blackbirds everywhere, eating people. There were
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.760]  dead babies everywhere. Super hot women would come out and like flash their breast at you in a fur coat
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:12.880]  and pull a machine gun out and try to kill you. It was cuckoo land. And then I see the Nazis saying,
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:19.040]  Oh no, Hitler wasn't bad. He didn't kill anybody. Dude, 30 plus million Russians died, 22 million
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:24.800]  Germans, millions of Jews, millions of Poles, almost a million Americans. Yes, a million Brits.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.120]  Yes, World War II happened. It did. It happened. Not too long ago. Stop denying it.
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:35.600]  Right. Not too long ago. Our grandparents remember. Many of them, many of them fought
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.280]  even. But you know, Alex, it almost seems trivial at this point. And we'll talk about it on the
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:43.840]  other side, but there's still mass genocide going on in this country every day. It's called abortion.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.320]  And we got, oh, tell us right now. I almost forgot. You guys have a great demonstration,
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.880]  a couple of them coming up. Tell us about that. So this Saturday, we're doing a flag lay at a
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:57:00.080]  cemetery here in Texas. It's the Texas State Cemetery 909 Navasota Street in Austin, Texas.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.000]  Michael will be there. It's the Marine's birthday. We're going to do a flag lay on the veteran's graves.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.320]  Then after that, we're going to the Planned Parenthood here in South Austin on Ben White
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.480]  Boulevard. It's the biggest Planned Parenthood in Austin. And I'm having a stop government funding
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.560]  of abortion rally outside of that Planned Parenthood. I have people traveling from all over the

[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:27.920]  This Saturday, the stop government funding of abortion rally at the South Planned Parenthood
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.120]  on Ben White Boulevard. We're going to be there at one o'clock, one o'clock this Saturday.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:36.320]  Stop government funding of abortion. And where do people go on infowords.com? Well,

[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:53.920 --> 02:00:04.800]  We're all living in America. America is wonderful.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:18.880]  We're all living in America. America, America. We're all living in America. America is wonderful.
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:27.620]  Paul Watson, things are so incredible.
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:30.800]  I was hoping to be able to take, you know, four or five days off for Thanksgiving.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:34.160]  The crew certainly needs it and they deserve it.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:39.840]  But we all know now that Trump has removed sessions that for whatever reason was involved
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.680]  in incredible dereliction of duty.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:50.360]  The level of criminality is gone now and they're put in at least the next two months until
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.240]  he's got to get confirmed.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.360]  This is Matthew Whitaker.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.720]  This has hit the doomsday button for the left, for Soros, for the deep state.
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:01.000]  You've got the former attorney general saying, get out there, Antifa, get out there, move
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  on.org.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.320]  And now we're going to see all sorts of doxing and harassment.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:10.320]  We tracked a guy who came here that works for Brian Skelter, has been around here for
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.320]  quite a while.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:14.840]  He's been in people stalking me, not for the purposes of a documentary.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:17.720]  They've got something big planned, Paul.
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:23.200]  Well, this has been part of the revenge attack against everybody who helped Trump over the
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.200]  past two years.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.880]  Clearly, they've targeted everyone in some form or another, whether that's character-wise
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:33.640]  or whether it's actual, you know, inciting physical violence against people.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.920]  So at this point, I don't know what's coming next, Alex.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.560]  I mean, this whole thing, they know it's baseless.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.240]  They know there's nothing there whatsoever, so they're petrified about it going away,
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:43.240]  but it is going to go away.
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:45.760]  Like with the whole Roger Stone thing.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:47.800]  We were talking about Dan A. Williams.
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.760]  You remember right around that time, early October, when this whole WikiLeaks Assange
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.880]  pedestrian elite was about to come out.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.200]  None of us knew anything about it.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:57.640]  We would talk about Dan A. Williams.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:00.760]  I went back on the emails and checked it, not a single reference to it.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:05.280]  In fact, you even did a show when Assange originally planned to release some info and
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.280]  he didn't.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.480]  And you were bashing him.
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:12.640]  So we were actually briefly anti-Assange for a while when all that was going down, right
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:14.320]  before the pedestal leaks.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.720]  So it's all absolute nonsense.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.880]  All this is part of a revenge attack by the left against everybody, every single person
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.760]  who helped get Trump elected.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:24.880]  And they're just not going to stop.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:27.560]  You think winning the House is going to satisfy them for a while?
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:28.560]  No.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:32.000]  It's only made them even more angry because they failed in thinking this blue wave was
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.560]  going to happen when it didn't.
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:40.240]  So now they know that Trump's chances of reelection in 2020 have been boosted by this recent midterm
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:41.240]  result.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.520]  And that's why they're getting even more irate, even more vicious and vindictive.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.520]  That's right.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.960]  And Paul, now that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who looks like a 90-year-old lady at a nursing
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:55.240]  home, nothing against her is very, very sad, but when you see her in public, she doesn't
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.080]  like, she knows what planet she's on.
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:00.160]  She just broke three ribs.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:04.680]  And so that's really got to scare them, and this is just coming in.
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:10.960]  The bulldog, super respected, acting AG, Matthew Whitaker, will not recuse himself from Russia
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:13.400]  probe and won't approve presidential subpoena.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.880]  So Trump looks like he has a real American now, and not that traitor Mueller.
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.840]  They are in absolute crap their pants moat at this point.
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:25.600]  Well, I've said it from the start, Alex.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.600]  I mean, to be honest, I lost interest in this whole Mueller thing months and months ago because
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:31.240]  they clearly had no evidence whatsoever.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:36.640]  They were going after apartments that Trump had rented out to Russian people in the 80s
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  and stuff like that.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.680]  Trying to claim that was some kind of collusion.
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:43.360]  Absolute scrape in the barrel nonsense.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:45.960]  You know, now they're talking about getting Don Jr. indicted.
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.840]  Again, that whole meeting that he went to, remember, that the Russian, there's no collusion
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:57.640]  with Russians and fusion deep GPS who paid for that dossier, which came from Russians.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:00.720]  They were the ones who colluded with Russians.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.720]  Paul, I know you want to take some time off so do I, but how do you?
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:07.400]  I know you don't even sleep right now.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.400]  This is just such an ins…
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.200]  What would you call in 30 seconds this point of history we're in right now?
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.240]  I mean, I hope everyone dials it down and, you know, cooler heads prevail.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.640]  But it's, you know, it's very acerbic.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.360]  It's very monumental time to be alive.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.920]  Things are changing very quickly.
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:25.440]  You can get a mass shooting in the news.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:27.400]  It's disappeared like 12 hours later.
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:29.280]  The news is absolutely crazy.
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:31.720]  Everything spits sped up, unlike that doctored video.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:35.680]  So, yeah, it's going to be interesting going forward, but we'll continue to bat long.
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.560]  I have another guest who's really a smart cookie popping in for just a segment and a
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:41.560]  half, Paul.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.040]  We're back in 60 seconds, but this is just in.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:48.880]  Acosta now officially is saying he didn't even touch her and that we basically created
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:52.960]  a whole cartoon and that it's all fake.
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:53.960]  That's right.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.800]  Now he's saying he didn't even touch her.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:02.920]  This is a natural part of life where family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:05.400]  of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:07.440]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:30.800]  Just a few minutes, who came out and just lovingly, nicely pointed out that QAnon was
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:37.560]  saying a lot of things in the midterm of the QAnon thing, the fantasy, that really weren't
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.680]  true and ridiculous and so much of what they said hadn't come true.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:45.400]  We're just supposed to trust this little secret bot though, not somebody that we know publicly.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:49.120]  But now that Sessions is out and now that you see the deep state war about to blow up
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:53.160]  and you're about to see Mueller getting some big trouble, boy, what's QAnon going to do
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.160]  then?
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:07:01.480]  But I've learned like in Nigerian scams, I've had friends, I've had some distant family
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:04.840]  that were like bragging, hey, I'm getting a million dollars from Nigeria, from Prince
[02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:05.840]  Boo Boo.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:09.080]  And you tell them, no, no, that's a famous scam.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:12.120]  First you give them a thousand because you're going to get 20,000, then they go, oh, Prince
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:15.800]  of Boo Boo can talk to you now on the phone, but they need 20,000 and then you get the
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:16.800]  million.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:21.000]  About the time you get the, you know, 20,000, you never get the million, but some folks
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.720]  get ratcheted up to 100,000 because they don't want to admit they got taken.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:28.720]  And people get mad, man.
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:29.720]  I'm people like, shut up.
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:31.240]  You're just mad that I've got this deal.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:34.600]  I know Prince of Boo Boo.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:37.960]  And then it happened to me again recently, another Nigerian scam had been over 10 years
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:44.840]  since my family got sucked into Nigerian stuff and they're still mad at me.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:54.840]  And they still do not believe that it was a scam and they got $6,000, I almost give
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:55.840]  up at this point.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.840]  I just, I just don't know what to do.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.920]  I'm not going to give up fighting, but giving up on people that don't get how the scam works.
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:06.880]  They get you on a little bit and then you're invested and then you never get out of it.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.600]  It's like fake college degrees.
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:12.040]  Most college degrees are worthless now, 90 plus percent, but people just get a second
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:16.160]  one or a third one or a fourth one or a fifth one because once they've got their arm in
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:17.960]  the wood chipper, you can't get it out.
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:21.720]  And it's like abusive relationships that, that's what happens or abuse of the government
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:22.720]  or socialism.
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:26.160]  If we just had pure communism, it would suddenly be free.
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:29.040]  No for all you socialists that wonder why you're so unhappy.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:34.480]  It's because you're domesticated, but that is all a side issue.
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:39.120]  Two AG sessions and our next guest has a lot of info on, he's a really smart guy.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:42.120]  And so he's, we pop it in with us and we have several other guests today and I'm going to
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.400]  open the phones up as well.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:47.160]  We're going to have Michael Graves and I'm in Troyer in studio, Matt Bracken's coming
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:48.560]  up, but this is such a huge time.
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.120]  The left is launching civil war officially, but getting back to in the civil war, the
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:59.160]  mainstream media, the corporate media, the collaborator media, the globalist media is
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:00.440]  going to get that much worse.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:03.040]  So if you're a radio listener, you've always seen this on the news.
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.520]  You can go to infowars.com and go to Paul Watts' Twitter to see it for yourself.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:12.800]  But now a costup denies touching White House intern despite video evidence.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:15.760]  He's saying that we totally faked the video.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:22.480]  Even Fox News is saying it's doctored to deceive and all Paul Watson did was download it, blow
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:28.840]  it up, zoom in on him, pushing her arm down and pulling the mic away from her.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:30.340]  She's trying to get it away.
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:31.340]  President says that's enough.
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:32.340]  He won't stop.
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.920]  Just like anybody else in any public event, you've ever been in a place where you ask
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:38.960]  questions to a speaker when your time's up and get the mic up, they come and get it.
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:42.040]  So he pushes her arm down, pushes the hand back.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.320]  He says, we're lies.
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:46.480]  It's all fake.
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:47.800]  And there's other camera angles of this.
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:51.720]  It's just, the whole corporate media, Fox News, singing in, they're all together.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:52.960]  Paul Watts was a liar.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:53.960]  Alex Jones was a liar.
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:55.200]  Acosta did nothing.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:56.200]  It's all fake.
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.200]  Sarah Sanders is bad.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.200]  Trump's bad.
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.880]  This is disgraceful.
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.800]  So Paul, I wanted you to have a chance to respond to them now saying it's not just doctored.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.640]  He didn't touch her.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:10.040]  And then while you're talking, just roll our C-SPAN unedited video.
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:13.440]  Don't even blow it up to show people over and over again for TV viewers, the unedited
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:14.440]  C-SPAN.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.440]  Here it is.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.440]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:17.440]  Yeah.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:18.440]  He clearly touched her.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:19.840]  She went to get the microphone.
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:20.840]  That's her job.
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:26.440]  He reached across her with his left arm and forced her arm down to resist, or to restrain
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.520]  her, or to overpower her.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.520]  It wasn't assault.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.520]  It wasn't battery.
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.400]  I mean, it wasn't much better than what Corey Lewandowski did, which he got.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.360]  I think he got charged with battery for that, of course, demonized by the mainstream media.
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:43.440]  Based on six frames of video evidence on my ad, this video was not edited.
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:45.360]  They've got video editing experts.
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.960]  There's one with the telegraph who says there are discrepancies between the C-SPAN version
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.120]  and the version which Sarah Sanders tweeted.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.640]  Yeah, because it's been run through like three different programs, then re-uploaded, okay?
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:59.240]  Nothing was doctored.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.880]  Nothing was changed.
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:05.840]  I posted screenshots from the video editing program showing nothing was sped up.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.880]  There are little wavy lines on the track on Sony Vegas Pro 15.
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.080]  If a clip is sped up, those are not there because it was not sped up.
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:13.480]  I did not speed it up.
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:14.920]  I did not doctor it.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:19.080]  So they created a huge conspiracy, which some of them are now even trying to back away from.
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.960]  First, it was, oh, fake doctored video sped up.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:23.840]  Now it's, oh, debate rages.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:25.440]  So they're trying to walk it back a little bit.
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:26.440]  But look at her.
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:29.360]  She's trying to grab it away and he's shoving her down and pulling it away.
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.120]  And we're showing unedited HD footage.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:34.480]  Now let's blow it up for TV viewers again and let's go in slow motion.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:37.360]  Blow it up and slow motion, please.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:40.160]  Yeah, watch his left wrist and his left hand.
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:44.840]  It clearly comes down to restrain her to stop her from getting from retrieving the microphone,
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:45.840]  okay?
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:46.840]  That happened.
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:50.800]  No matter how many stupid claims he can claim, like little frames that are different because
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:55.080]  it's been re-uploaded and downloaded six times, that doesn't change the fact that what you're
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.920]  seeing is him physically resisting having a physical confrontation with a woman.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.920]  Okay, it happened.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:04.600]  We're going to put this, what you just said out in HD right now, to the world.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:10.360]  Jim Acosta is literally 1984 level now, telling us two plus two doesn't equal four, telling
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:12.520]  us that our own eyes are our lies.
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.960]  They've been caught red-handed in the corporate media though.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.480]  It's all behind this.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.000]  And you might get banned from Twitter now.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.560]  That's their goal, saying you're fake.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:22.440]  Jim Acosta wasn't even there, actually.
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:23.880]  That's fake video too.
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:28.400]  Paul, let's keep tracking Antifa and the fact that the leader of the group that went after
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:33.080]  Cruz and after Tucker Carlson, that's called for killing police, Mike Pence and others.
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:34.560]  That's pretty big news.
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:36.560]  This is pretty incredible.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:38.120]  Great job, Paul Joseph Lawson.
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:39.120]  All right.
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.120]  Thanks Alex.
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:41.120]  Okay.
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:42.120]  I appreciate our guest holding.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.080]  He's only got this segment in the next.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.480]  And again, he is Zachary Claywine.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:53.120]  He's a former Army veteran, officer, patriot, knows a lot of inside intel and other.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:57.720]  I talked to a lot of generals and other people and former CIA black ops commanders, but he's
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:02.120]  fun to get on because he's just a smart guy and he knows a lot of these folks.
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:05.560]  And he's given me a lot of stuff that turned out to be very, very accurate in the past.
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:10.040]  But he was the guy trying to be nice to QAnon, but saying, you know, it's kind of like some
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:11.560]  of these fake Bitcoin companies.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.160]  They're not all fake, but some of them are like, oh, trust this secret, but it turns
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:16.320]  out to be a total Ponzi scheme.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.760]  And so now they said, trust the plan.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:20.080]  Trump will never fire sessions.
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:21.080]  Sessions is good.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:22.080]  Mueller's good.
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:23.080]  I can assure you.
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.080]  They're high level people.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:27.800]  They hate sessions and they hate Mueller and know it's all crap.
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:30.440]  So now what is QAnon going to do?
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:31.440]  This is all happened.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:34.880]  And then shifting gears away from that, I hope we all learn about this anonymous bot
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:39.160]  stuff and trust the experts and trust, you know, foggy oracles to the people whose names
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:45.080]  are public and folks that are public, Zachary, then we'll move on in the next segment to
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:46.080]  the big enchilada.
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:48.960]  How big this is that the sessions was going to be canned.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:52.960]  You texted me last week, said the word is just going down and then what comes out of
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.880]  this now and this new guy they've got.
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:14:02.400]  But boy, I tell you, you and I are certainly vindicated without question and say a pleasure
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:06.360]  to be back on to the Q movement with all sincerity.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:12.240]  It seemed very appealing, but now we have our full transparency on what occurred here.
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:15.000]  And I just, you know, their whole movement was trust the plan.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.640]  Trust sessions, of course, last year, there was a clear line drawn in the sand when I
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:25.600]  stated on your show on info wars that Bannon would be gone, Tillerson would be gone, Haley
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:30.040]  would be gone in sessions, would be gone in succession.
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.760]  And they looked at that as sort of the line in the sand and obviously today what's occurring
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:40.720]  and it's no coincidence that the new attorney general, an individual that the Q and I movement
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.960]  surprisingly since they're almighty and all knowing did not know was coming argued two
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:51.360]  years ago that Hillary Clinton should be criminally charged and he will go through with it and
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.200]  it makes no coincidence, make no mistake.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:58.840]  This happens a day after the midterms because it was going to go one way or another and
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:00.880]  it went one way and so did we.
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:08.120]  So I don't know where these Q and on individuals are going to go now or look to for information,
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:12.880]  but I find it very coincidental that during its phenomenon, during its rise to fame, info
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:17.560]  wars, a hub of information and alternative media gets de-platformed.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:22.600]  So I would look to who was really behind that movement and how sophisticated the PSYAP was
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:26.120]  because it was quite sophisticated and believe me, these people are not our friends.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:31.400]  Well, notice just like seeing everybody else was attacking us, so was the foggy all powerful
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:36.840]  all Lord Q, I was going to be arrested, everyone, you're going to be arrested, Trump, Trump's
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:41.440]  love sessions, sessions will be there, it's all about to happen, always the sealed indictments
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:46.560]  always for a year and a half going to happen, unbelievable, but the people that have drunk
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:52.880]  the Kool-Aid, the Nigerian Prince scam Kool-Aid, they're just going to double down, Zach.
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:56.000]  Let's talk about the future when we come back.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  Hear that?
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.240]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.440]  and what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.920]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in, go to faketv.com and discover
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:15.640]  a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:16.880]  away.
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:21.080]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:25.800]  Be vigilant, but not fearful, faketv.com.
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.920]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:32.240]  purest for you and your family.
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:36.040]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on burky clean water.
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:40.880]  The burky guy has you covered at home, working on the go with water filtration systems of
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.720]  every size for every budget.
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:49.320]  Now GCN listeners receive 10% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN at goburky.com
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:54.200]  or call 877-886-3653, goburky.com.
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:59.120]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:00.320]  food and boil water.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:04.960]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:06.160]  a much better way.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:11.000]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.680]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:16.720]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:21.280]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,

[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:26.680]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:30.600]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:32.160]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:35.120]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:40.640]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:41.960]  I can help you too.
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:47.200]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:54.400]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:58.400]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:00.640]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know.
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.640]  Your support's been amazing.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.120]  We can make it easy to support us because we have great products, and we're announcing
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:12.360]  a mega blowout sale at infowarstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:15.760]  to continue on in the face of their attacks.

[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:23.600]  strength, stamina, libido, energy.

[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:56.040]  at the infowarstore.
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:00.120]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:05.360]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:10.600]  It literally dumbs the population down, and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.200]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.320]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.920]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.080]  nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:32.440]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:37.160]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:42.120]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:48.600]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:51.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:52.800]  discovery.
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:59.120]  This is X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:10.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:27.120]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:36.120]  I know what they'll find, it's in their mind, it's what they want to see.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:45.360]  Here comes the night, Antifa thinks we're scared of the dark, George Soros thinks we're
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:52.360]  scared of the dark, we live in the dark, we were born in the dark.
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:57.760]  Now the globalists are about to meet a real fight.
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:06.800]  Trump is releasing a titan, a junkyard dog, a demolition man with a huge wrecking ball
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:09.080]  right at the deep state.
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:13.840]  Get ready because you could see Trump assassinated within days, you could see a nuke go off,
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:18.560]  you could see libertarian conservative leaders wiped out because the enemy is preparing
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:23.480]  to launch an attack, but we're ready, we're ready, but we could fall in this fight.
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:26.280]  I want to get more into that with Zach in a moment because Zach off the record is a
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:30.880]  super smart dude, he'll come on the air, and I really appreciate him coming on Zachary
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:37.840]  Lee Claywine, Zach, the QAnon thing buried, I don't want to fight with it, but clearly
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:42.000]  it was an op, we were very sad to tell people yet again about Nigerians' cams being fake
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.520]  or other things like that being fake, but they don't listen, they don't want to listen
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:46.800]  once they're invested in the line.
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:54.280]  But now this guy, acting AG says Hillary should be indicted, yeah, exactly, also a former
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:58.800]  U.S. attorney, Matthew Whitaker, enough evidence to have a special prosecutor investigate
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:00.640]  Clinton Foundation, no kidding.
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:04.520]  So now they are so scared, what does this signify?
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:08.000]  And from your intel and your sources, the highest levels of SENTCOM, because I know
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.480]  some of the same people, what is about to happen next?
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:17.000]  We're in it right now, like you said, something very, very serious could occur in the next
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:22.240]  couple of days as a retaliation because what we have with the new appointment of Attorney
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:27.000]  General, Mike Matt G. Whitaker, signifies a lot.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.720]  And what you also have to understand is one day after this, Jim Mattis also releases a
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:36.200]  major statement, and this is at a free beat, and I think they released it today, they just
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:40.760]  released this this morning, they gave an official report, Defense Secretary Mattis is the stand
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:42.240]  on the Pentagon.
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:49.600]  He says, despite of what the media was saying, I have no desire to leave the Trump administration,
[02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:56.720]  so he's doubling down his efforts on, we now have Whitaker as the AG, and he, as he stated
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:00.240]  two years ago, they will launch an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:04.400]  So this is Fort Hood, this is Benghazi, this is Gaddafi, this is Vegas, this is a whole
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:08.520]  lot of things, and it symbolizes a lot of things.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:13.720]  Obviously, the timing is immediately following the midterms, and this was on schedule, planned,
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:14.720]  and politically precise.
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:19.760]  And of course, I don't want to get into inside baseball, but that's stuff where he said Mattis is bad,
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:24.160]  Trump did all that, the globalists actually bought it, and obviously, just like a Godfather
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:29.000]  movie or something, Trump has sent people over to find out who really the traders are,
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.560]  and now he knows the whole blueprint, the whole map, and I'm not bragging, now Trump knows
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:35.360]  that my blueprint already gave him, it's exactly on target.
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:40.880]  And so now what's happening is, literally what I say now is taken at the highest levels,
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:44.800]  because I spend all my time doing this, and I'm not afraid to tell the president, and
[02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:47.320]  tell the public, and tell others, even though they want to silence me.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:50.880]  So folks need to understand, I'm not bragging when I say this, they want us off air because
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:55.720]  I know exactly what I'm talking about, here's George Soros' media matters.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:24:00.040]  The info wars, White House pipeline is alive and well, that's right, it never went away
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:06.480]  fools, and, but here's the problem, Zach, and I know you're expert in paramilitary stuff,
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:10.840]  I was told by high level folks, but I can also see the shape of it, that if they're getting
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:13.720]  ready to really launch a bunch of violence or take the president out, they're going to
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:16.720]  try to take everybody out, a few thousand top people if they make their move.
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:20.000]  So if Trump gets killed, God forbid, they're going to move, and everybody else that same
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.120]  day pretty much simultaneously, then they're just sending anti-fight everybody's houses
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.800]  first, so they can set them up for the teams they're going to use.
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:32.040]  Do you have any intel on that, and other than Hezbollah groups hooked into some of the globalist
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.120]  deep state and MS-13, some of the type of hit teams they're going to be using?
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:42.640]  The timing is classic when you look at the caravan approaching the country, the appointment
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:48.840]  of these individuals, really the solidifying of what the plan, the true plan is moving
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:52.560]  forward in the Second American Revolution, we have to be looking for anything.
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.400]  I believe the deep platforming of yourself was part of this attack.
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:04.040]  I believe these Antifa groups are obviously paid in provocateurs at root levels, but yes,
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.520]  we do have to look out for the obvious terror threats that are already present, whether
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:16.580]  it be Islamic, whether it be lone gunmen, because like your guess earlier, we just had
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:19.960]  a shooting in California and it's not even news now, it's gone.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:24.960]  So it's going to come from many different angles, but internally what I could really
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:27.840]  get at is that's going to continue to occur.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:33.640]  And when you have the appointing of Matt Whitaker, followed by the solidifying of the White House
[02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:38.760]  with Jim Mattis, all at the same time, following after McCain's death, the midterms, the Awan
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:42.400]  brothers, there's information that's now like, you know, I'm going to come out in the next
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:46.280]  few days or weeks, it's already out really, but truly what was going on with the Awan
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:50.880]  brothers and the true investigation into the Clinton Foundation, what we have is the whole
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:51.880]  shebang.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:56.040]  This is it, we're in it and they are capable of anything because their lives are literally
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:57.760]  on the line as they should be.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.880]  And the good news is here, we're in deep crap, that's forced everybody to choose which side
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:02.880]  they're on.
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:06.080]  At least we weren't in this situation, but you're going to now see some of the best people
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:10.280]  who aren't cowards come forward and we're about to see a real fight for this country.
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.280]  But folks, you better choose a side, there is no middle of the road here, that's where
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:15.280]  you get run over.
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.120]  Everybody better get on their knees before God and ask which side you're on in all this.
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:25.680]  It's that simple because clearly Trump tried to tell the deep state, keep your money, you're
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:28.920]  still in money, just stop it, we're not going to destroy America, we're not going to do
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:32.800]  all this horrible stuff, we're willing to get rid of all your globalism, just stop trying
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:36.760]  to run America on the ground, let's just make a deal, they wouldn't do it.
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.080]  So now the gloves come off and that's why they're so scared.
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.480]  And you can believe behind the scenes, Trump is about to turn the dogs loose.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:50.520]  Absolutely, we're in full effect right now, we called this out a year ago, you know, this
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.640]  is not a shot in the dark or this is very calculated.
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:27:00.040]  When I said Bannon will be gone, Tillerson will be gone, Haley will be gone, and Sessions
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.640]  will be gone, that's on purpose, certain things need to be fleshed out, certain people need
[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.200]  to be pushed to certain points to see which for.
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:11.440]  Yeah, QAnon was 100% wrong, you've been 100% right and so have I, and I said we have a
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:15.480]  lot of same sources, and because there was a plan to fix this peacefully, there was a
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:18.200]  plan to fix this the other way.
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:19.840]  They were internal, they were internal.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.480]  At one point when it comes to that encryption and that sort of modality that they were using
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:28.720]  for that sort of psychological operation, they were saying things that were obviously
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:32.120]  inside baseball, meaning even our opponent within the deep state understands certain
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:38.560]  things that the general public doesn't, but the way they were manipulating, truly, you
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:41.920]  know, free thinkers and truly people of, I would say, you know, what would be your listening
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.600]  base was very sophisticated.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:50.600]  Well, Q was a target to take down Info Wars, Q was a target to kill the human intelligence
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.200]  of the public working with the military and others, it was meant to just confuse everything
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.840]  and fry everything and make everybody kind of pacify and sit down and everything's fine,
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:02.960]  go to sleep, don't be involved, you know, keep sessions in, because everything Antifa
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:08.320]  and Soros and all of them is, keep sessions in, Q, keep sessions in, CNN, keep sessions
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:13.760]  in, ABC, keep sessions in, and now I don't know how they put you to attack you is to
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:19.840]  attack you and dox you and do certain things within their, you know, supposed, you know,
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:25.480]  days of operation, they essentially attack you in my likeness, yet when you get the
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:28.920]  platform to a major leader and a side that won't hurt them, they don't, they don't
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:29.920]  defend you.
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:33.840]  So it really gives you a real story of who these individuals are in the time.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:36.240]  I mean, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on here.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.760]  Well, Zachary, you've been proven right.
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:38.760]  God bless you.
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:39.760]  Appreciate you coming on straight ahead.
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:43.520]  I'm going to open the phones up, cover all the latest news, but what's happening is so
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.520]  incredibly dangerous.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:48.040]  I don't have words to describe it, it almost feels weird even being on the air talking
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:49.040]  about this.
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:52.800]  This is the most insane it's ever been in my 23 years, and it's about to get a lot
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:53.800]  crazier.
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:54.800]  Hear that?
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:02.680]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place,
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:05.640]  and what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:09.120]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:14.320]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:17.080]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:21.280]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:23.840]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:24.840]  Faketv.com.
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:29.600]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservatives?
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:33.680]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public,
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:36.880]  but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:41.840]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:42.840]  There is.
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:43.840]  It's rightsocial.net.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:44.840]  Rightsocial.net.
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:48.960]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:52.480]  Rightsocial.net, where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:53.480]  Rightsocial.net.
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:56.960]  The right place to be.
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:02.120]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:06.280]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:10.000]  Corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.720]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:16.080]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:18.320]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:21.040]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:25.800]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:30.440]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:36.040]  spread the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com, we won't just continue to stand
[02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:39.480]  up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:44.120]  We have huge sales at infowords.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:47.560]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:49.560]  and you're right to the market.
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:52.840]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the globe will swing
[02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:53.840]  with.
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:54.840]  This is InfoWords Darker Sour.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:55.840]  We do your support.
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:56.840]  I'm counting on you.

[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:05.240]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:09.400]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:16.520]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfoWordsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:20.720]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:24.880]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:29.880]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:37.080]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:33:00.240 --> 02:33:07.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:24.560]  You know, I was growing up, both my grandmothers were not arrogant people who were very humble,
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:45.560]  they were also very smart, and their voices would get really low, and I was a little kid.
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:53.640]  Both my grandmothers told me that the Republic was going to be enthrased, and that once again,
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:55.560]  we would have to sacrifice to save it.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:34:00.960]  You hear this when you're like 8, 9, 10 years old, and you think, this is really weird.
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:06.360]  My grandmother doesn't usually look like this, their eyes on fire.
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:11.320]  They said, you'll learn the secrets later when you get older, but you've got to grow
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.800]  and you've got to learn those for yourself.
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:21.800]  And now, at 45 years old, and all the things we see happening, and how epic this struggle
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:28.320]  is, it's not embarrassing to hear about my ancestors.
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:33.240]  Now I begin to become their peer.
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:36.640]  And all of you have incredible backgrounds, even if you lost track of it.
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.400]  The fact that you're alive means your ancestors went through amazing struggles.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.040]  And there's been good in the universe, and there's been bad in the universe, and we've
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:48.520]  been traveling on twin tracks into the future together.
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:52.760]  It's been a long battle.
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:58.240]  And I get really guilty, and I feel incredible weight on me, and believe it, I don't want
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:59.240]  to.
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:01.160]  I don't want to have a conscience that's so big sometimes.
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:05.280]  I think sociopaths, it must be really easy for them, because I'm not doing enough, I'm
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:10.800]  not fighting hard enough, I know other enemies bad, I haven't found the way to defeat them.
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.280]  But God says it takes time, relax.
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:21.600]  You've already done good, just keep it up, just hold the line.
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:24.160]  And then the election came and went.
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:28.200]  Such pressure that I had to beat them, we had to stop them, and they got a small victory,
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:31.960]  but it didn't matter, because they had to do so many evil things to get it, that it woke
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.320]  up a lot of people.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.880]  So at a spiritual level, as I said, even before the election, last Sunday, last Monday, I
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:47.760]  said, we're winning, but we're losing, but in the long term, we're winning the war.
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:53.640]  And Trump's going to make his move, and now that Trump is fired sessions, who is obviously
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:36:00.480]  scared and compromised, whatever they've got on him, and now he's gone.
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:04.960]  And now they've got somebody that's on record, and he's already coming out saying, the new
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:09.440]  Attorney General, saying he will not recuse himself on the fake Russia gate, he will not
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.600]  accept congressional subpoenas, no one ever does that, separate powers.
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:20.800]  All this crap, they are so scared right now, that he would indict Hillary Clinton.
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:26.320]  The arrogance of the enemy is now clear, and then you look at how the Attorney General,
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:31.200]  the former Attorney General, Eric Holder, is running Antifa and MoveOn.org and putting
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:39.120]  out press releases, shang, debt.
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:42.880]  Get out there at 900 sites, get out there and go to people's houses and intimidate them.
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.320]  Do you think going to Tucker Carlson's house, I know Tucker's got the big wasp hair and
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:53.160]  the nice suit and the gold watch his dad gave him, but I mean, I mean, you know, people
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:56.560]  like Tucker Carlson, there's a lot more going on there than meets the eye.
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:59.800]  And if you think, we'll play this video in a minute, there's a bunch of these, if you
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:04.080]  think intimidating and threatening people's families makes them back off, it's the opposite
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:09.720]  scumbags.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:15.400]  Now that's it, we've not won this war yet.
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.880]  But if you take action, we will, there's an article on infowars.com, it's the live
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:22.760]  feed, let's put it back up, thanks for doing that.
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:30.320]  Watch live, Soros activates 900 Antifotera cells, leader of group calls for killing of
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.160]  police and Republicans red alert.
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:35.680]  Now everything I said, there's true.
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:39.520]  Earlier I showed their press release, I showed Holder, I showed MoveOn.org, I showed the
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:48.280]  leader of it that sent the people to the house, the professor saying all this.
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:49.440]  What is their response to that?
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:57.960]  I mean, if I was on the radio and on TV telling people, go and kill the vice president, it's
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:01.400]  one thing, I was some crazy dude, you know, in some house saying it, you send a secret
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:05.880]  service, you get a mental evaluation, you see if you've got the means to do it.
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:11.240]  If you're powerful and you say kill the vice president or kill the president, you get SWAT
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:17.360]  teamed and I mean in an hour or somebody's going to get fired.
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:20.400]  So how did they have this unnatural position to do all this?
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  Because they've had the attorney general.
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:31.400]  So a lot of people got sick of Antifa pointing guns at us and threatening us and a little
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:35.280]  birdie told me that Antifa ran into some problems here, we haven't seen a lot of them
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:41.400]  out in Austin since then, but the whole point is you guys are in a man's world and Antifa
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:46.520]  though is only the cannon fodder, the minions that go out so they can set somebody up when
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:51.920]  the deep state sends the real killers.
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:55.600]  That's what I keep trying to explain to people, the fact that they have deployed these folks
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:01.640]  and they're going to now go out to 900 targets, which is exactly what I said, I said a thousand
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:07.880]  to two thousand targets because that's about as much as anybody's ever tried to kill in
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:10.560]  one day when you do a political operation like this.
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:16.280]  So I'm going to tell you if you're a prominent conservative or Christian or libertarian leader,
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.800]  if you're a Christian conservative leader who's never even been political but they know privately
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:24.240]  from their spies and reading your email, they have computers through profiles that you'd
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.640]  stand up in an emergency, you may not even know you do that, they've got AI that says
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:34.200]  you will, maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong, they're going to kill you.
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:38.240]  So a lot of you out there who are prominent billionaires, successful people who've never
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:42.440]  really been in the arena, but they've got your profile, they got a hit team coming to
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:47.880]  kill you because they got people inside your organization, just like the Nazis would do,
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:51.440]  ready to take over your company, they also want that money.
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:54.720]  They're going to use this political upheaval to get control of that infrastructure.
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:56.720]  They want full control.
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.680]  Now, just like authoritarians always do, once they get full control, always falls apart
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:03.600]  because they don't want to run things anymore, they just wanted to control.
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:11.040]  So you become Venezuela or North Korea.
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:18.160]  So I don't have words right now to describe to you how incredibly serious the situation
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:22.040]  is.
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:23.040]  This is it.
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:26.800]  This is the attempt to kill the country 240 years later and you're like, oh, America,
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:27.800]  it's not perfect.
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:30.920]  Have you studied what they're going to bring in?
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:35.840]  People ought to be on their knees to God begging, we aren't defeated here and I don't know what
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:37.040]  we're supposed to do at this point.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:42.000]  I've already laid it all out, the president's taking action against him, the amount of traders
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.840]  in the media and everywhere else, it's a problem.
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:51.200]  And maybe the country isn't even meant to be reprieved.
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:56.640]  All I know is I cannot stand down and go along with this and I really feel sorry for people
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:02.240]  that serve the system because the system you're bringing in has meant to destroy your own family
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:03.240]  and your own future.
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:07.680]  So they keep telling me that, hey, Alex, you might want to plug products.
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:10.440]  That's how we fund the operation and it's true.
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.800]  Since I ended the big sale, our revenue has absolutely cratered the last week and if we
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:16.360]  don't get funding, we won't be here.
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:17.880]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:24.040]  So in this serious time, understand we need war bonds, forget the deals, forget the specials.
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:27.960]  We got some of the biggest specials ever and we got free shipping store-wide.
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:33.560]  But let me just talk straight to the camera here, we go to camera one.
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:35.040]  We've changed the world with your help.
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:36.400]  You've changed the world through us.
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:38.200]  We've changed it through you.
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.840]  I'm in your hands, InfoWars is in your hands, the world's in your hands.
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:47.480]  I've got really great products that everybody needs anyways, but we need your funding.
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:52.160]  We need money to do this and to continue to fight and hopefully expand because if you
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:53.840]  don't expand, you contract.
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:55.040]  There is no middle ground.
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:59.080]  I need everybody today to realize how real all this is.
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:02.400]  I told you about the anti-fidoxing and going to the houses as the preload.
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:04.360]  I haven't said they'll probably do it first to Tucker Carlson.
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:06.200]  I don't know how I know all this stuff.
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  The point is, is that I need everybody to go.
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:14.040]  I really need a water filter system and Alex Jones sells the highest rated ones out there
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:16.800]  and they're 49% off right now.
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:20.880]  I should do that or maybe I already got one that my cousin or my mom or my dad or my son
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:21.880]  or daughter doesn't have.
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:28.160]  I'm going to get Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system with 5 star reviews, 4.7 reviews or
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:31.080]  I'm going to get X2, which is selling out.
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:32.080]  We have the new X3.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:34.080]  People go, wait, X3 was a little bit weaker.
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:38.000]  Well, you actually got three types of iodine, but so there's less of one and then more of
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  the other two.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.200]  And it's not about cheapening or having something else.
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:42.520]  It's cheaper to put one type in there.
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:45.240]  It's better to put all three in tri-iodine.
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.760]  So X3, 50% off as well, free shipping store wide, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:51.280]  Without you, we won't be here.

[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.600]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate.

[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:52.240]  can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:20.560]  It's pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:26.180]  of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2
[02:45:26.180 --> 02:45:27.680]  that's been incredible.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:32.560]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:37.320]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:42.280]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:48.760]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available.
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:51.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:52.960]  discovery.
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:55.960]  X3, now available at infowarslife.com.
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:00.440]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punch-drunk to the censorship
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.560]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes some of them
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:08.240]  are like little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:13.000]  our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:19.560]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:24.360]  and the world back from the brick, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:27.240]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:30.320]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:35.280]  I want to keep going, I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially,
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:39.960]  I want to push all the way, I've committed to do that, I've prayed for that and I've
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:44.560]  been told that's going to happen, but you've got a back-ish and I promise you this, I will
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:49.760]  never falter, I will never waver at a spiritual level, I physically will, but I give you my
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:54.880]  commitment if you financially support us at infowarslife.com to give you my absolute
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:55.880]  total commitment.
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:05.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:29.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:46.840]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:56.840]  We know where you sleep at night.
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:01.840]  By the way, we got video coming up.
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:03.840]  Those view, those hard piece.
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:08.840]  You co-hosts say White House Female Aid committed battery against Acosta.
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.840]  She shouldn't have touched him.
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:14.840]  Well, wait, that's all fake video where she tries to get the mic back when he won't give it up
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  and shoves her arm down and grabs it away from her.
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:17.840]  It didn't happen.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:23.840]  It's fake video that Info Wars has like industrial light and magic or Pixar.
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:25.840]  We just made it all.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:27.840]  It's fake.
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:29.840]  At first there was no altercation.
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:34.840]  He didn't even touch her, he says.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:35.840]  But again, we uploaded it.
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:39.840]  So it was a little bit gray because it was re-uploaded and that they say is fake.
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:41.840]  Okay.
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:45.840]  They're all over the news, Fox News, CNN, banned Info Wars, banned Paul Watson.
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:47.840]  He's fake.
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:50.840]  Media lies, claims.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:53.840]  Acosta video is doctored.
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:57.840]  Press invents bizarre conspiracy theory to distract from Acosta's behavior.
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:48:59.840]  That's a great article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:09.840]  But writer accused, reporter accused of fabricating Acosta incident
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  or Acosta manhandling woman.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:13.840]  No, let's just change polls.
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:15.840]  I'm actually the head of Info Wars.
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:16.840]  I'm the editor.
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:17.840]  I can even change headlines.
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:18.840]  Let's change polls headline.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:21.840]  Here's a headline I want.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:31.840]  Reporter accused of doctoring Acosta overpowering woman at White House Briefing
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:36.840]  stands his ground sub headline.
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:42.840]  Video was not edited with C-SPAN original only zoomed in.
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:45.840]  Show that you could see the manhandling Claire.
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:54.840]  Side by side videos show media involved in giant Oaks.
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:56.840]  But wait, he says it never happened.
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:07.840]  But whoopie Goldberg and the other liars, they say she assaulted him.
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:10.840]  Oh my God, these people are unbelievable.
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:12.840]  But here's the problem.
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:14.840]  We have a new attorney general.
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:20.840]  We have two months until they seek that Democrat House that's going to go on.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:27.840]  If you thought we've seen a witch hunt, baby, the new name of the Congress is going to be Salem Witch Trials.
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:29.840]  And they're going to go crazy.
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:36.840]  We got too much to clean out the executive branch to start acting like it's the executive branch and to start going after the crooks.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:40.840]  And I think there's going to be criminal investigations, which we haven't opened and shut,
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  Mueller delivering uranium, Hillary getting 30-something million to give 20% of uranium.
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:49.840]  The CHICOM deals, the illegal servers, the smuggling kids out of Haiti.
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:51.840]  I mean, they're in one of these people.
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:59.840]  Mueller should be investigated for running Epstein's aircraft for that subgroup in the FBI.
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:04.840]  Not the whole FBI, but the subgroup that would then have Epstein and world leaders having sex with little kids.
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:11.840]  And then they reportedly, old Mueller didn't get his old diggledong involved in it,
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:15.840]  but his old diggledong, but he sure as hell shot the video.
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:18.840]  That's what he does in his off time.
[02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:21.840]  That's some private production thing like, Mueller's a killer, aren't you scared?
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:23.840]  Oh, no, I'm fighting because he is.
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:26.840]  The only way to go up against this is head-on, baby, rocket fuel.
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:28.840]  I'm like humongous in Mad Max.
[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:33.840]  I mean, I'll make it out of this, but I'm like, I'm turning the nitrous oxide on and...
[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:36.840]  Or I'm like the guy on the front of those humongous' truck,
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:42.840]  where they like finally get down with the bolt cutters and...
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:47.840]  I'm not saying I'm the Titan, but I'm like a little baby Titan.
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:50.840]  And we go to clash the Titans when they release the Kraken.
[02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:52.840]  Because that's what I'm doing here.
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:55.840]  I mean, if I don't resist Mueller and other horrible people,
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:51:57.840]  I feel like I'm going to hell.
[02:51:57.840 --> 02:51:58.840]  It's like torture.
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:04.840]  I mean, look at these arrogant people strutting in front of the media like,
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:06.840]  they're about as, they'll deal with the electorate.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:08.840]  They'll deal with the election of Trump.
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:10.840]  They'll deal with the 4.8% economy.
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:12.840]  They'll deal with taking care of the veterans.
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:15.840]  They'll deal with real show America.
[02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:17.840]  I'm Robert Mueller III.
[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:20.840]  I'm married to the family that helped kill Kennedy.
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:21.840]  Why we kill people?
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:22.840]  We're really scary.
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:25.840]  Yeah, there are other folks that do that too, Mueller.
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:27.840]  That's easy.
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:29.840]  Killing people is like taking a crap.
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:30.840]  We're having sex.
[02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:32.840]  Anybody can do it.
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:35.840]  But only patriots can go through their fear against the deep state
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:39.840]  and not join the power structure to make a better world.
[02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:41.840]  And that's why you fear us.
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:43.840]  Because we don't have fear.
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:47.840]  We only have fear of letting you run things.
[02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:48.840]  Stick with the plans.
[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:49.840]  Stick with Mueller.
[02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:50.840]  Stick with Sussians.
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:53.840]  Why they're jolly old pals with Trump.
[02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:54.840]  Meanwhile, I talk to high-level people.
[02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:58.840]  They're like, no, they're horrible.
[02:52:58.840 --> 02:53:03.840]  But it's not, it was a message board on 4chan that was doxing Alex Jones and people.
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:05.840]  Because I'm the bad guy.
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:06.840]  I'm going to prison.
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:08.840]  I'm the one that doesn't like NAFTA and GATT.
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:10.840]  I'm the one that doesn't want TPP.
[02:53:10.840 --> 02:53:12.840]  I'm the one defending the Second Amendment.
[02:53:12.840 --> 02:53:14.840]  I'm the one defending free market.
[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:16.840]  I'm the, oh, I'm the bad man.
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:18.840]  But no one knows who they are.
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:20.840]  They're the good guys.
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:28.840]  Because no one criticizes the shadowy guys with no credibility, no name, no nothing.
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:31.840]  The Peter Strocks the world there on the 4chan and 8chan board.
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:33.840]  Oh, yeah, that's skewed on right there on screen.
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:37.840]  There he is.
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:41.840]  I bet he sucked a couple of dickly dongs last night.
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:48.840]  Anyways, the point is, I just like to say dickly dong.
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:49.840]  Look at that, man.
[02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:52.840]  That is the Jezebel spirit right there.
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:57.840]  You know, I don't think women can really be what you call bitches, female dogs.
[02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:01.840]  But old Strocks, that's, it's men that act like bitches.
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:04.840]  Nothing weirder than a guy act at all, Nelly.
[02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:07.840]  Like it's the worst traits of a man, the worst traits of a woman.
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:11.840]  And the dickly dongs around.
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:13.840]  Peter, dickly dongs struck.
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:15.840]  And the dickly dong crew.
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:18.840]  And it's all sycophant if y'all just worship each other in DC.
[02:54:18.840 --> 02:54:22.840]  Oh, you hijacked America, we worship you.
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:23.840]  Oh, oh.
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:26.840]  And of course they hate one thing more than anything, the military.
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:30.840]  Because those people that are actually willing to go fight and die and be in bad conditions and kill people.
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:33.840]  They all want to be able to do that, but they would never do it.
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:39.840]  They just walk around all day as a bunch of dirty lawyers kissing each other's butts all day.
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:42.840]  And shitting people up and screwing over clients.
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:44.840]  And ha ha ha.
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:46.840]  Oh, it's going to go on forever.
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:47.840]  Let me give the number out.
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:48.840]  We're going to take a couple seconds to call.
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:50.840]  We've got some great people coming in.
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:51.840]  Join us here in studio.
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:54.840]  But the age is gone.
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:56.840]  Ding dong, the witch is dead.
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:54:58.840]  The witch, oh, witch.
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:54:59.840]  The witch, witch, witch.
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:02.840]  Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:04.840]  He just flew away with those little ears.
[02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:09.840]  So do Osprey.
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:11.840]  They had him like in a grand dragon outfit.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:13.840]  I think that's probably what they had.
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:16.840]  Little diggly dong, Tom.
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:17.840]  There you go.
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:18.840]  Diggly dong.
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:20.840]  Now that's edited video.
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:21.840]  That's not real.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:22.840]  Oh, by the way, Daria made a great point.
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:25.840]  They constantly put up edited video to set the stuff.
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:27.840]  Time Magazine Newsweek.
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:30.840]  Trump lording over a little girl that cried.
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:32.840]  Wasn't a real photo.
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:34.840]  Little girl wasn't taken from her parents.
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:36.840]  Hadn't had food and over the day because her horrible mother
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:39.840]  uses her as a human shield to go through with what her husband
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:42.840]  admitted was some weird clandestine operation.
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:45.840]  We can only guess why she smuggles up from Central America
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:47.840]  once a year using her kid as a shield.
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:49.840]  Gee, I wonder what mommy's doing.
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:51.840]  It's not her that's bad.
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:52.840]  It's Trump that's bad.
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:53.840]  That's fake.
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:55.840]  That's doctored.
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:57.840]  That's manufactured.
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:02.840]  But Paul Watson uploads video and it's a shade grayer
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:04.840]  because it's been up, downloaded, uploaded.
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:06.840]  And Paul doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to video.
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:09.840]  And my lord, look at that woman.
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:11.840]  Assault Acosta.
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:16.840]  You heard it on CNN.
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:18.840]  Good people right there.
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:21.840]  How dare us get caught in that fake video.
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:23.840]  Infowars.com.
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:24.840]  Newswars.com.
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:25.840]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:26.840]  Here's the number to join us.
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:29.840]  We have two segments, a few calls throughout the next hour.
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:31.840]  What's your take on all this?
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:34.840]  877-789-2539.
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:36.840]  877-789 Alex.
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:40.840]  877-789-2539.
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:43.840]  But remember, Antifa's been activated.
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:45.840]  900 sites they're going to target.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:49.840]  More people's houses, more harassment, more everything.
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:52.840]  And you know, I must care to Antifa.
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:54.840]  They're just the useful idiots that are going to get set up
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:56.840]  and sent to supermax prisons later.
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:56:58.840]  If the globalists are successful,
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:02.840]  they're sending assassination teams.
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:08.840]  And the poor, stupid Antifa are just the patsies.
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:09.840]  The decoys.
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:10.840]  We're going to go to break.

[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:27.840]  I get that?
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:28.840]  Let's do a question.
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:29.840]  Is everyone willing to die?
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:30.840]  And I've got to have money.
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:31.840]  I'm willing to die?
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:32.840]  I need the money.
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:34.840]  So, give me the money.
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:35.840]  Show me the money.

[02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:58.840]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:10.840]  I know from using this myself the last few months
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:12.840]  and from seeing my friends and family use it
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:14.840]  that this new product is going to end up being

[02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:52.840]  Years ago, InfowarsLife created the powerful
[02:58:52.840 --> 02:58:55.840]  MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:58:55.840 --> 02:58:58.840]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped
[02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:00.840]  into the environment, our team knew we had to
[02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:02.840]  create a bigger and better formula to help
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:03.840]  support your gut health.
[02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:06.840]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula,
[02:59:06.840 --> 02:59:09.840]  a unique natural formula designed to support
[02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:12.840]  the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:15.840]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:18.840]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance
[02:59:18.840 --> 02:59:20.840]  in the body, supports your digestive tract
[02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:22.840]  and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause
[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:24.840]  you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:59:24.840 --> 02:59:26.840]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:28.840]  including grapefruit seed extract,

[02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:32.840]  our formula is fueled by ingredients
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:34.840]  that stood the test of time as powerful
[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:36.840]  microbalancing properties.

[02:59:48.840 --> 02:59:51.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:04.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:07.840]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live
[03:00:07.840 --> 03:00:10.840]  from the front lines of the info war.
[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:14.840]  Well, for two weeks I have doubled the guards
[03:00:14.840 --> 03:00:17.840]  at the office and at my house
[03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:19.840]  and I said, look for anti-photostart
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:21.840]  doxing prominent conservatives
[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:24.840]  and Fox News personalities
[03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:29.840]  ahead of them launching their full armed assault
[03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:33.840]  on conservatives and libertarian and nationalist leaders
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:35.840]  and that will all be a prelude
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:38.840]  for the assassination of the president.
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:40.840]  Let's just say I've got the Pentagon
[03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:43.840]  and other people's attention predicting all of this
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:44.840]  but it's not hard to do.
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:47.840]  We have the entire enemy battle plan
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:50.840]  and I've been on the phone with leading individuals today
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:53.840]  laying out exactly what move they're going to make next.
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:55.840]  I told people last night
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:58.840]  they're going to mobilize in every city
[03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:02.840]  anti-photera squads who are only the decoys
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:05.840]  to probe defenses at people's homes,
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:07.840]  offices, and infrastructures.
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:10.840]  Then once the targets have been basically
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:13.840]  laced in a low-tech fashion
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:17.840]  then the real teams, MS-13, Hezbollah,
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:19.840]  and others that openly are being used
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:22.840]  as a auxiliary army by the deep state
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:23.840]  here in the United States
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:25.840]  with plausible deniability
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:27.840]  can begin to hit targets.
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:29.840]  So maximum red alert, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:32.840]  maximum red alert, they have the foreign paramilitary teams,
[03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:35.840]  they have MS-13, they have Hezbollah
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:37.840]  inside the United States publicly working
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:40.840]  with the Democrats, they have the professor class
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:43.840]  that's the anti-pho class.
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:45.840]  They are the group that again
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:48.840]  are just organizing the patsies at the lower level
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:51.840]  in case they ever lose or things fall apart.
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:53.840]  They have plausible deniability.
[03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:55.840]  I have all the total proof
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:57.840]  when we come back from break.
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:00.840]  Now, what did I say three months ago
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:02.840]  that got me, quote, banned off Twitter?
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:05.840]  I said, Antifa is preparing to come to your homes
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:07.840]  if you're in your ice,
[03:02:07.840 --> 03:02:09.840]  if you're somebody like Tucker Carlson,
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:12.840]  actually talked about Tucker Carlson in the 25-minute video,
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:15.840]  and I said, that's just first level.
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:18.840]  After that, you need to have your battle rifles ready
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:21.840]  to defend yourself because that means the threat level
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:24.840]  goes way up and it shows that the globalists
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:26.840]  have at least taken the safety off
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:29.840]  and put their finger on the trigger or the detonator
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:32.840]  to go to a hot war here in the United States.
[03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:35.840]  This is a maximum total red alert.
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:37.840]  Trump started getting rid of sessions,
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:40.840]  getting rid of the deep state double agents.
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:42.840]  He's got an acting attorney general in here
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:45.840]  that is a patriot, 100%,
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:47.840]  and it says he's ready to move against them,
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:49.840]  even in op-eds in USA Today.
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:52.840]  Acting AG says he would indict Hillary and many others.
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:54.840]  We have them.
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:58.840]  So they are now going to make their move.
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:01.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:03.840]  And you go to infowars.com.
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:07.840]  900 groups mobilized.
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:09.840]  And who mobilized them?
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:13.840]  The former attorney general put out tweets
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:15.840]  and is quoted in moveon.org.
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:17.840]  Who's the main funder of that? You guessed it.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:19.840]  George and Alexander Soros.
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:22.840]  Soros is beginning to fade a bit at 89,
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:25.840]  it's now Alexander in command.
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:27.840]  And it's just incredible.
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:30.840]  We have secret documents that were again obtained earlier this year
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:33.840]  that showed their previous battle plans
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:36.840]  that caused civil emergencies and martial law.
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:38.840]  Those plans in 2015 failed.
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:40.840]  But we have them.
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:42.840]  We have their blueprints.
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:44.840]  We have their battle plans.
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:47.840]  We would be completely and totally maniac level stupid.
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:51.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, if we did not get this information out
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:53.840]  separately, you've got Ruth Bader Ginsburg falling down
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:55.840]  and breaking three ribs.
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:58.840]  You've got reports of the Pope in the Italian media
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:00.840]  is imminently about to resign.
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:04.840]  We have got the war vet slaughters 12 at the borderline bar
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:07.840]  who reportedly had PTSD.
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:10.840]  When I saw the horrible footage,
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:12.840]  when I got up this morning, I thought,
[03:04:12.840 --> 03:04:14.840]  man, those people are all in really good shape.
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:16.840]  Their shirts are all off.
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:19.840]  They've all got Marine Corps tattoos on their chest and things.
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:22.840]  And it was basically a Marine Corps hangout bar.
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:24.840]  And I guess somebody dissed this guy or something.
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:27.840]  And look, they started doing the instinctive killing training
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:29.840]  in about the 60s.
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:31.840]  And when people go haywire with that training,
[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:33.840]  it kills the inhibition and our hearts go out to everybody.
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:37.840]  But this story itself compared to Antifa
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:39.840]  activating the terror cells
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:43.840]  and the shadow government army activating is the big news.
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:47.840]  We could just be hours away from paramilitary hits across the country.
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:49.840]  So, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:05:18.840]  get your firearms out and ready to defend yourself.
[03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:23.840]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways,
[03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:26.840]  including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,
[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:28.840]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism,
[03:05:28.840 --> 03:05:31.840]  helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:35.840]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:37.840]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula
[03:05:37.840 --> 03:05:40.840]  that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate
[03:05:40.840 --> 03:05:43.840]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.
[03:05:43.840 --> 03:05:47.840]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil.
[03:05:47.840 --> 03:05:50.840]  Now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:21.840]  For the Republic, for you and your family and for the entire world,
[03:06:21.840 --> 03:06:26.840]  the United States has been in a cold civil war with globalist forces
[03:06:26.840 --> 03:06:32.840]  and patriotic loyal to the Republic forces.
[03:06:32.840 --> 03:06:38.840]  I have tracked George Soros, the deep state Eric Holder and Obama
[03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:42.840]  and MSNBC and CNN promoting and preparing Antifa
[03:06:42.840 --> 03:06:45.840]  in the last decade for what they're now doing,
[03:06:45.840 --> 03:06:49.840]  mobs of them in 900 areas in the United States
[03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:54.840]  under moveon.org command of George Soros and Alexander Soros
[03:06:54.840 --> 03:06:58.840]  are now going to go to conservatives, Christians, libertarians,
[03:06:58.840 --> 03:07:01.840]  prominent people's homes, lawmakers' homes and businesses
[03:07:01.840 --> 03:07:05.840]  to bang on the windows, to break down doors
[03:07:05.840 --> 03:07:09.840]  in the case of Tucker Carlson's home cracking and crushing in the door,
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:13.840]  saying we got pipe bombs, we're here, we're gonna get ya.
[03:07:13.840 --> 03:07:17.840]  You think you're safe?
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:18.840]  It's all here.
[03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:23.840]  But they're only preparing so that they get the blame later
[03:07:23.840 --> 03:07:26.840]  but it's really going to be Hezbollah,
[03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:31.840]  the Iranian forces outlawed with Obama, that's the deal.
[03:07:31.840 --> 03:07:35.840]  And it's going to be MS-13 because they have plausible deniability.
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:38.840]  They have killers that are ready to follow orders,
[03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:40.840]  ready to be given targets.
[03:07:40.840 --> 03:07:46.840]  So I'm telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[03:07:46.840 --> 03:07:48.840]  They also have some leftist veterans,
[03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:51.840]  but it's very, very hard for them to find people that are competent
[03:07:51.840 --> 03:07:53.840]  who are US citizens that will engage in the type of evil.
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:56.840]  Now I have stacks of news proving all this.
[03:07:56.840 --> 03:08:00.840]  The main leader of the Antifa group directly funded by Alexander Soros,
[03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:02.840]  we have the documents, we have the newscast,
[03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:05.840]  I literally have like 25 mainstream articles about this right here.
[03:08:05.840 --> 03:08:08.840]  He is the one that says kill all white people, he's white.
[03:08:08.840 --> 03:08:14.840]  He says kill pinch, kill the Trump family.
[03:08:14.840 --> 03:08:20.840]  He is the group commander that sent the people in to go after Ted Cruz.
[03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:24.840]  And he is the person in command of the group who's allowed to operate on Twitter
[03:08:24.840 --> 03:08:28.840]  with hundreds of thousands of followers to send people to Tucker Carlson's house.
[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:29.840]  It's this group.
[03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:31.840]  So I'm going to say that again, the leader,
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:36.840]  or you mean the idiot moron Patsy that has no idea that he's being set up,
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:41.840]  known as Pencilneck or Pez dispenser man by Paul Watson.
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:47.840]  In the card deck, he's known as the moron Patsy, the sucker.
[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:51.840]  You know, the guy that's going to get the fall for this.
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:54.840]  He is all over the news and the media is like, yeah, he's a good guy.
[03:08:54.840 --> 03:08:56.840]  Kill all cops, kill all white people.
[03:08:56.840 --> 03:08:58.840]  What he wants for Christmas is dead cops.
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:02.840]  What he wants is, you know, kill Mike Pence and he hasn't gotten in any trouble
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:10.840]  as the Justice Department because the Justice Department was controlled by his bosses.
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:12.840]  Eric Holder commands this group.
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:14.840]  I have mainstream news.
[03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:21.840]  Eric Holder is in command right now with Hillary and Obama and Alexander Soros of these groups.
[03:09:21.840 --> 03:09:25.840]  He is the idiot that then goes out and gives the public order.
[03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:29.840]  So I'm going to say that again, the people that came to Tucker Carlson's house,
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:33.840]  more than 40 of them that blocked the street, wouldn't let cars enter out,
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:39.840]  who took control as terrorists and held everyone captive, crashing in the door,
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:41.840]  threatening everyone.
[03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:43.840]  We know where you sleep.
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:45.840]  Tucker said this is a threat on his family.
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:47.840]  They routinely leave their young children.
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:52.840]  I know his older son, he's out of high school now, but the others are small.
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:58.840]  I've had dinner with his family and they're routinely at the house alone.
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:00.840]  They were not there.
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:05.840]  They were about to get back, but his wife was there and thought a home intruders were coming in
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:07.840]  and had to get in the pantry.
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:10.840]  And of course, in D.C., you really can't even have a gun.
[03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:13.840]  We want the Supreme Court ruling, but it hasn't happened yet, so imagine.
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:19.840]  This is a group run by someone saying, I want to kill all the conservatives.
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:22.840]  Go read his tweets, read his statements, watch his videos.
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:27.840]  He's a New York professor, pencil neck.
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:31.840]  And then when these groups show up at your house, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:36.840]  understand they are run by people that say they want to kill you.
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:41.840]  And I committed the big cardinal sin three months ago when I said they're going to activate antifa groups
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:46.840]  to go threaten people at their houses and then the antifa will be set up
[03:10:46.840 --> 03:10:52.840]  and it's going to be Hezbollah and it's going to be MS-13 groups that are involved,
[03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:57.840]  maybe even some Chai Khan groups and it upset the leftist arm of the CIA so much
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:01.840]  that I'd reverse engineered every piece of their operation and studied other covert operations
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:05.840]  that they'd run other parts of the world that I exactly laid out exactly their blueprint
[03:11:05.840 --> 03:11:08.840]  because I had all the pieces that were already there.
[03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:10.840]  And that's why they said, oh, it's so scary.
[03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:13.840]  He's saying kill the media, get him off, take the video down.
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:15.840]  It was an emergency message to the president.
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:16.840]  I didn't say that.
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:18.840]  I said, they come to your house.
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:22.840]  The first wave will just say that we know where you live,
[03:11:22.840 --> 03:11:25.840]  but the next wave is to kill you.
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:31.840]  A paramilitary attack, not by pencil neck, not by their 900 groups going out.
[03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:37.840]  They are simply being set up as the patsies and they don't want antifa, the methods
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:39.840]  and all the rest of them to hear this and know this.
[03:11:39.840 --> 03:11:42.840]  They don't want me up here blowing their whole operation like I always do.
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:47.840]  And I'm not bragging, but ladies and gentlemen, this is what I do.
[03:11:47.840 --> 03:11:49.840]  And I'm almost never wrong.
[03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:50.840]  And now I'm proven right again.
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:56.840]  So this country is in a maximum total red alert.
[03:11:56.840 --> 03:11:58.840]  Now, who's above this guy?
[03:11:58.840 --> 03:11:59.840]  Who funds him?
[03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:00.840]  Alexander Soros.
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:01.840]  Who's above that?
[03:12:01.840 --> 03:12:06.840]  Eric Holder, the former attorney general, is in command.
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:11.840]  And his people were still in command inside the Justice Department.
[03:12:11.840 --> 03:12:13.840]  And Trump just went, phew.
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:15.840]  Rosenstein has no more power.
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:17.840]  A new AG is on top of him.
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:19.840]  And these guys are scared.
[03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:22.840]  And they should be because they have gone for broke.
[03:12:22.840 --> 03:12:24.840]  They have overthrown so many countries.
[03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:26.840]  They have engaged in the Arab Spring.
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:28.840]  They have looted society to the hilt.
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:32.840]  And now they are being resisted and they don't know what to do.
[03:12:32.840 --> 03:12:40.840]  So they've dispatched 900 scumbag groups to go out and get it on the news where the house is,
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:46.840]  to create hysteria, to create fear, to get other copycats to go in, to create a fog of war,
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:52.840]  show when the establishment's ready and the dead of night like a ringraith to pull their sword.
[03:12:52.840 --> 03:12:55.840]  No one knows they're an expert coming in.
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:12:57.840]  Well, I just told you.
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:02.840]  And the enemy specifically cannot stand that report because it is dead on effect.
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:04.840]  It was taken off Twitter, YouTube, everywhere.
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:05.840]  Let's find that report.
[03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:06.840]  I know we have the full thing.
[03:13:06.840 --> 03:13:07.840]  Let's upload that.
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:13.840]  This is the emergency broadcast exposing the Antifa detonation of the Civil War.
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:16.840]  Again, we're not facing an Antifa army.
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:19.840]  We're facing them as the detonator.
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:26.840]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have so many other huge stories here.
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:31.840]  The Attorney General gone, the deep state QAnon blown into a trillion pieces of the fraud it was.
[03:13:31.840 --> 03:13:34.840]  Not being mean to people that followed it or liked it.
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:38.840]  You know, it's oh, there's this secret thing and everything's handled and sessions is good.
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:39.840]  No, he's not.
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:40.840]  Okay.
[03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:43.840]  I've talked to the highest levels who told me, no, is sessions good?
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:46.840]  No, sessions is not.
[03:13:46.840 --> 03:13:52.840]  So I'm a famous, well-known person that does talk to the highest levels of the government.
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:56.840]  But then some mysterious thing over here is telling you all this is going on.
[03:13:56.840 --> 03:13:57.840]  So everything's okay.
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:58.840]  Stick with the program.
[03:13:58.840 --> 03:13:59.840]  You know, don't question.
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:01.840]  We all go one way.
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:02.840]  Everybody else goes with it.
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:05.840]  All this BS, okay?
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:07.840]  Trump is under attack.
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:08.840]  America is under attack.
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:17.840]  Trump is like a lion surrounded by hyenas trying to bring the country back and the enemy and the globalists and the foreign money and the censorship and all of it is coming down like a wrecking ball.
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:22.840]  The only way Trump could go after big tech was with the Justice Department.
[03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:26.840]  And that's why the enemy is now going to make their move.
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:28.840]  Trump isn't going to play nice guy anymore.
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:31.840]  He knows they're gunning for him with made up crap for his son.
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:32.840]  They're gunning for stone.
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:37.840]  They're gunning for me because we're American patriots that'll line up and fight.
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:38.840]  And they know it.
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:39.840]  Nothing special.
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:42.840]  We're just people that'll line up and defend the country.
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:43.840]  We're not traders.
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:46.840]  By the way, what you're seeing here, people go, oh God, Alex, we thank you.
[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:47.840]  You're so wonderful.
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:48.840]  You're so great.
[03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:51.840]  Listen, this is what we're all supposed to be doing here.
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:15:00.840]  This is normal response to multinational forces with a bunch of thug brown shirts they mobilize to try to intimidate us to take our country over.
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:07.840]  Roger Stone on Tuesday night, he said, you must fire the AG now.
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:09.840]  You must do it in the morning.
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:13.840]  Well, Trump let him know in the morning.
[03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:16.840]  And now time is of the essence, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:19.840]  When I come back, the media is framing this like big deal.
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:20.840]  They went to his house.
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:21.840]  He's a racist.
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:23.840]  They dehumanize you with that term.
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:29.840]  We're going to show you this group where the video, what they said to Tucker's family, what they did.
[03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:33.840]  How they terrorized his wife, how they banged on the windows in the doors.
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:35.840]  And all the things they did.
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:38.840]  And then we're going to show you the microcosm of where this goes from there.
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:40.840]  We're going to look at the new acting AG.
[03:15:40.840 --> 03:15:45.840]  We're going to look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg falling down our type of image.
[03:15:45.840 --> 03:15:48.840]  Another metaphor, an omen of the deep state's fall.
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:52.840]  But in its death row, it is deadly dangerous.
[03:15:52.840 --> 03:15:57.840]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:03.840]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:09.840]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:13.840]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable.
[03:16:13.840 --> 03:16:20.840]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to Minutemanstove.com.
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:22.840]  That's Minutemanstove.com.
[03:16:22.840 --> 03:16:26.840]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservatives?
[03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:33.840]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:38.840]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:40.840]  There is. It's rightsocial.net.
[03:16:40.840 --> 03:16:45.840]  Rightsocial.net. A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:49.840]  Rightsocial.net, where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[03:16:49.840 --> 03:16:50.840]  Rightsocial.net.
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:52.840]  The right place to be.
[03:16:52.840 --> 03:16:58.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:01.840]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:17:01.840 --> 03:17:07.840]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:11.840]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:14.840]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[03:17:14.840 --> 03:17:17.840]  The deep state began with World War I.
[03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:22.840]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:52.840]  777-886-3653. GoBerkey.com
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:20.840]  Less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:23.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:26.840]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:31.840]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:35.840]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:35.840 --> 03:18:40.840]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:45.840]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:48.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:19:16.840]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:19.840]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain,
[03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:24.840]  healthy aging process with an all-new natural caffeine boost included.
[03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:27.840]  A powerful, pregnant-owned base, the real red pill,
[03:19:27.840 --> 03:19:30.840]  it could become one of our fellow Infowars' favorite products.
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:36.840]  Now, with an extra proprietary energy blend inside, including 3D extract and Ramate leaf extract,
[03:19:36.840 --> 03:19:41.840]  and more, you can get that extra pick-me-up while supporting your mind and body in a healthy way.
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:45.840]  That's all the great stuff that real red pill has, but it's also got the boost added.
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:50.840]  Get the real red pill plus at InfowarsStores.com.
[03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:27.840]  You'd hadn't even been a day.
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:35.840]  And George Soros' anti-folk Frankenstein doxxed members of the Fox News team
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:44.840]  and sent more than 40 thugs to the family home of Tucker Carlson,
[03:20:44.840 --> 03:20:48.840]  where they rammed in part of the door and said,
[03:20:48.840 --> 03:20:52.840]  we know where you live, we know where your children sleep.
[03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:55.840]  It's a bunch of these videos. It's incredible.
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:21:00.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got the national media calling me for comments about Jim Acosta and Trump,
[03:21:00.840 --> 03:21:07.840]  and did we doctor video and fake it that he pushed the woman or shoved the woman in the arm?
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:11.840]  And I'm not even responding to that at this time because it's pure bull.
[03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:14.840]  Paul Watson blew up the video. He didn't doctor the video.
[03:21:14.840 --> 03:21:16.840]  Anybody can go to the raw video and do that.
[03:21:16.840 --> 03:21:18.840]  We'll do it next segment. Paul Watson joins us.
[03:21:18.840 --> 03:21:20.840]  And we've got the terrible shooting.
[03:21:20.840 --> 03:21:24.840]  We've got all of this going on, but front and center,
[03:21:24.840 --> 03:21:27.840]  and our heart goes out to all those that have been named and killed, truly a tragedy.
[03:21:27.840 --> 03:21:31.840]  12 dead in California, the country music nightclub.
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:34.840]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg falling down, breaking three ribs.
[03:21:34.840 --> 03:21:36.840]  She's on her way out. She can't hold on.
[03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:40.840]  She's been a near vegetative state for a long time, falling asleep in public.
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:42.840]  She's gone. She'll be gone in months.
[03:21:42.840 --> 03:21:44.840]  Another big omen.
[03:21:44.840 --> 03:21:47.840]  You've got the Pope in the Italian news.
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:52.840]  They're saying his resignation is imminent because of the pedophilia scandal.
[03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:56.840]  We have incredible developments in the economy.
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:22:04.840]  Unbelievable things happening on so many fronts, but the most important thing I can say to you today is this.
[03:22:04.840 --> 03:22:10.840]  I have studied how governments are overthrown, how strong nations are overthrown from within.
[03:22:10.840 --> 03:22:17.840]  I've studied how Soros and the globalist in the leftist deep state overthrew Ukraine four or five years ago.
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:23.840]  I know how they engineered the Arab Spring to overturn our allies in Egypt and other areas.
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:31.840]  And I've seen their own battle plans and we've received secret Antifa blueprints that I'm going to show you here in a moment.
[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:36.840]  We got in January of this year and we've received other secret blueprints.
[03:22:36.840 --> 03:22:42.840]  And I suggest if you have family that's in Antifa or you have neighbors that are in Antifa,
[03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:44.840]  it's time to do what you have to do to get the documents.
[03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:48.840]  We're in a war now. We're not going to attack people's houses. We're not going to be violent.
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:54.840]  But do what you think's best. We need to get them and just get them out because we need their current battle plans.
[03:22:54.840 --> 03:22:57.840]  I've reverse engineered them and I'm going to lay it out.
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:23:02.840]  But this is we need warrants. This is a terrorist organization. We need the police, local state and federal.
[03:23:02.840 --> 03:23:06.840]  You need to be getting your witnesses and you need to be raiding Antifa now.
[03:23:06.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  You need local prosecutions. I mean, we have documents that show massive felony crimes being planned.
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:20.840]  We have the leaders publicly saying kill the vice president, kill all law enforcement on site.
[03:23:20.840 --> 03:23:30.840]  And he is in command of the group that went after Ted Cruz and now went to the home of Tucker Carlson.
[03:23:30.840 --> 03:23:37.840]  Just the night before the Carlson's were out to dinner and their younger children were there alone.
[03:23:37.840 --> 03:23:42.840]  Thank God they didn't come when they were alone. His wife locked herself in the pantry in the kitchen.
[03:23:42.840 --> 03:23:45.840]  She thought there was a home invasion because they crushed in the door screaming,
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:50.840]  we know where you sleep. You are not safe. We've got pipe bombs.
[03:23:50.840 --> 03:23:54.840]  And I'll just leave it at that. But I have, I'll just leave it at that.
[03:23:54.840 --> 03:23:56.840]  I'm not going to get into who I've been talking to.
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:24:02.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is hard core. This is a probing action.
[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:06.840]  So let me do this right now. Let me, document cam shot, please.
[03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:12.840]  Let me go over these articles so you understand what we're dealing with.
[03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:15.840]  And remember what got me banned off Twitter.
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:18.840]  Why they said I was calling for battle rivals against the media, which I didn't say,
[03:24:18.840 --> 03:24:23.840]  because the video was actually their blueprint using anti foot of trigger a civil war.
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  And it scared the hell out of them that it was exactly what they're now doing.
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:34.840]  They don't want that out. They don't want somebody here on the rampart telling you,
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:38.840]  hey, there's people with a battering ram coming up to knock down the gate.
[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:42.840]  And now the gates getting knocked down, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:44.840]  So there were threatening me and my family.
[03:24:44.840 --> 03:24:47.840]  Tucker Carlson's home targeted by protesters. San Francisco gate.
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:54.840]  No, not by protesters, but by an international terror group funded by George Soros and his son and headed up by Eric Holder.
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:56.840]  Let me show you that in a moment.
[03:24:56.840 --> 03:24:59.840]  Protesters send messages to Tucker Carlson outside his home.
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:05.840]  We know where you sleep at night. No, that's not protesters. That's, that's a threat.
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:08.840]  Terroristic threat crushing in the door.
[03:25:08.840 --> 03:25:14.840]  A mob showed up outside Tucker Carlson's house and ordered him to leave town.
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:20.840]  Now it's a terrific threat. Now they're ordering him to leave criminal orders walking off the streets.
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:25.840]  D.C. Antifa publishes home addresses of Tucker Carlson and his brother, as well as Ann Coulter,
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:30.840]  Neil Patel and Sean Hannity, the people that are loyal to the country.
[03:25:30.840 --> 03:25:38.840]  I told Tucker and others just two weeks ago, get ready after the election, that they would be at their house.
[03:25:38.840 --> 03:25:45.840]  So as we continue, ladies and gentlemen, let me get to the other documents now.
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:49.840]  This is the key area. I just gave you some of what's currently happening.
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:52.840]  Antifa mob descends on Tucker Carlson's home.
[03:25:52.840 --> 03:25:56.840]  Red alert, Tucker Carlson's home under siege by Antifa mob. That was last night.
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:02.840]  Emergency alert. Dems promise Civil War sessions removed. Attack Tucker Carlson's home afterwards.
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:09.840]  Now here's the key. The left is organizing response events in 900 U.S. cities today to protest.
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:12.840]  They need to terrorize and intimidate and lays targets.
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:19.840]  The firing of Jeff Sessions. Michael Steiner article into the American dream.com upon infowars.com.
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:26.840]  Move on.org. That is a dispatch from Soros and Holder.
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:29.840]  They admit in here and Holder has tweeted this out.
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:37.840]  Nobody is above the law. Muller, protection, rapid response. Protect your false prosecutor.
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:42.840]  Protect your new fifth branch of government. Protect the rogue group. Protect the criminal group.
[03:26:42.840 --> 03:26:48.840]  And they say go out, get in their face. Don't even let them get rid of AG Sessions.
[03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:52.840]  D.C. Antifa dots home addresses. There it is.
[03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:58.840]  Founder of group that harassed Ted Cruz tweeted about dead cops assassinating Mike Pence.
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:01.840]  Go read it for yourself. Infowars.com.
[03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:11.840]  Antifa professor who bragged about teaching future dead cops complaints about receiving threats.
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:15.840]  Here's Eric Holder tweeting out that we're going to stand against what's happened.
[03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:21.840]  This is a statement to tell plan for civil unrest, martial law, and Baltimore. This is the Rosetta Stone.
[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:28.840]  Alexander Soros' group is in command of this. They sign pledges. They're given action directives.
[03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:34.840]  They're told what police in Blue City to work with trying to get blacks to riot to bring in, quote,
[03:27:34.840 --> 03:27:50.840]  residency, martial law. Action could be W10418, 15. Confidential. Level 7, AB-G.
[03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:55.840]  Level 7. You want to, this is an intelligence operation in our government.
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:27:59.840]  Breakaway group. It's got all the signatures, all the sign on by the officers.
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:05.840]  They're going to attack this business, this trash can. It's corporations that have already agreed like McDonald's and Starbucks to be in on it.
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:11.840]  I always wonder why they attacked that. It's done all in agreement, all cordoned by the left.
[03:28:11.840 --> 03:28:16.840]  Jack Dorsey, they're all involved. That's why they're so scared because I've got their number.
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:21.840]  And it goes through the entire action plan and how to manipulate black urban populations.
[03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:29.840]  White professors in their disguises trying to get black people to riot with all the Hollywood movies,
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:34.840]  about whites being racist right at the same time coming out and all the TV shows saying cops deserve to die.
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:43.840]  All of it working with Blue City police in Blue Cities to stage the event and try to trigger real martial law as a cover for Obama.
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:46.840]  But they failed and they're trying again and they're going to fail again.
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:52.840]  This time, they're getting ready with actual kill teams. The kill teams are coming. The kill teams are coming.

[03:31:11.840 --> 03:31:23.840]  end to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[03:31:41.840 --> 03:31:53.840]  Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[03:31:53.840 --> 03:32:01.840]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[03:32:01.840 --> 03:32:12.840]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.840 --> 03:32:18.840]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it,
[03:32:18.840 --> 03:32:24.840]  so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:32.840]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine,
[03:32:32.840 --> 03:32:40.840]  but chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[03:32:40.840 --> 03:32:45.840]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:45.840 --> 03:32:49.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:49.840 --> 03:32:54.840]  X3, now available at EmpowersLive.com.
[03:33:19.840 --> 03:33:39.840]  Music plays
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:46.840]  Folks better decide which team they're on, are they loyal to America and the Republic and everything that's been good and decent,
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:50.280]  decent, compared to the rest of the world, or whether they're on the side of the chai
[03:33:50.280 --> 03:33:51.280]  comms, the globalists.
[03:33:51.280 --> 03:33:55.960]  Now, here's the most important thing I'm going to say today.
[03:33:55.960 --> 03:34:00.240]  The globalists, the deep state, have totally panicked that Trump has fired the totally
[03:34:00.240 --> 03:34:06.560]  compromised, incompetent, cowardly Jeff Sessions, the disgraced Jeff Sessions.
[03:34:06.560 --> 03:34:10.280]  They have put in an acting AG that said he would indict Hillary immediately because the
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:13.220]  evidence is overwhelming, like the sun being yellow.
[03:34:13.220 --> 03:34:16.480]  They are really scared of Matthew Whitaker.
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:21.360]  Trump is making his move against them because he tried to play nice, he tried to turn the
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:26.040]  economy on, have them back off, they're making a move on Don Jr., you name it, it's imminent
[03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:28.160]  next week.
[03:34:28.160 --> 03:34:31.040]  So the country is now in a civil emergency.
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:35.880]  They've got foreign caravans slamming in, trying to trigger uprisings inside the United
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:37.320]  States and Latin America.
[03:34:37.320 --> 03:34:43.480]  They've got anti-fatrine groups funded by George Soros activating in 900 cities and
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:49.640]  towns calling for violence and saying they're going to target conservatives and Christians
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:52.520]  and nationalist leaders.
[03:34:52.520 --> 03:35:00.040]  As I told you months ago and as I documented, they're only using anti for the deep state
[03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:05.680]  as the patsies on the streets of Austin pointing guns at my reporters saying they can't even,
[03:35:05.680 --> 03:35:07.680]  you know, go onto the Capitol grounds.
[03:35:07.680 --> 03:35:10.880]  They've been authorized to act like this and behave like this and call for Mike Pence's
[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:15.600]  death and call for the police to be killed and call for me to be killed and all of this
[03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:18.640]  because they're protected in blue cities.
[03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:24.280]  But only because they're being prepared and set up if we go into real, violent, deep state
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:30.560]  civil war and they unleash the different paramilitary groups, the Hezbollah groups, the deep state
[03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:35.720]  Obama's been signing deals with, we know, MS-13, all God's little children that Pelosi
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:39.760]  talked about, those will be the real hit teams coming.
[03:35:39.760 --> 03:35:46.840]  And so this country is now being pushed into civil war, civil emergency and martial law
[03:35:46.840 --> 03:35:49.680]  by the Democrats.
[03:35:49.680 --> 03:35:53.640]  I said Trump's just declaring emergencies and he can get the main military standing
[03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:55.400]  up and knowing what happened.
[03:35:55.400 --> 03:36:00.560]  I called for that the Friday that the caravan smashed through, Trump did it on Monday.
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:03.680]  So we are under civil emergency.
[03:36:03.680 --> 03:36:05.160]  That doesn't mean tanks on the streets.
[03:36:05.160 --> 03:36:07.960]  That means to stop it getting to that point.
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:10.240]  So we're not the ones that brought the martial law.
[03:36:10.240 --> 03:36:11.920]  We are now under martial law.
[03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:14.680]  You need to understand that it just hasn't been announced yet.
[03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:24.560]  That's why they are sending out 900 front groups, 900 operations have just been triggered
[03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:25.960]  and that's why they want us off the year.
[03:36:25.960 --> 03:36:29.080]  You must take this live feed at infowars.com for us to show.
[03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:31.680]  Let's put the main article feed up if we can as well.
[03:36:31.680 --> 03:36:35.240]  Watch live feed of the red alert feed.
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:43.200]  Take that article and send it out to everyone you know from newswars.com and infowars.com.
[03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:44.200]  Watch live.
[03:36:44.200 --> 03:36:47.200]  Soros activates 900 antifotera cells.
[03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:50.480]  Leader of group calls for killing of police and Republicans.
[03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:51.480]  Red alert.
[03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:56.320]  He's now put out an article making fun of Tucker saying he deserves it.
[03:36:56.320 --> 03:36:59.920]  Tucker Carlson is the paragon of crocodile tears.
[03:36:59.920 --> 03:37:01.920]  Mike Isaacson.
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:03.080]  He is the front man.
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:04.080]  He's the patsy.
[03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:05.320]  He's the idiot.
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:11.400]  I don't think he would actually pull the trigger on people but this professor is the
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:16.720]  guy who heads up the New York group and the D.C. group because of criminal investigations
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:17.720]  they've claimed a month ago.
[03:37:17.720 --> 03:37:18.720]  He's no longer the leader.
[03:37:18.720 --> 03:37:21.720]  Bravo C.Era.
[03:37:21.720 --> 03:37:31.520]  Now, I'm only gonna go to this subject because not because it's about us because I've had
[03:37:31.520 --> 03:37:34.680]  national news calling all day, I didn't know what they were talking about this morning.
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:38.800]  I left my phone at a restaurant last night, didn't wanna go back and get it, got it this
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:45.840]  morning and the home phone and families getting called like what's this you faked and fake
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:49.960]  a cost of video and I was too busy worrying about antifa and too busy worrying about trying
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:53.440]  to trigger a civil war and Alexander Soros funding it and all the secret documents we
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:55.840]  have that no one seems to even care that we have.
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:38:02.800]  We have the total proof and then I got into the office and I looked at the video and all
[03:38:02.800 --> 03:38:06.360]  Paul did was blow up the video.
[03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:11.360]  He zoomed in like you do on any news show so it's absolutely clear that he basically
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:12.360]  whacked her arm.
[03:38:12.360 --> 03:38:20.320]  Now, they say that Trump just talking to a female reporter that won't sit down but they've
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:23.000]  had their question answered is assaulting him.
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:26.360]  This guy's pushing a woman out of the way, shoving her, looks like he's hitting her arm.
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:33.200]  All we do is blow it up and I've got Fox News and I've got CRTV and I've got it calling
[03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:36.360]  me saying am I gonna respond to this?
[03:38:36.360 --> 03:38:40.280]  So see that's how they change the subject from Jim Acosta acting like a grandstanding
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:42.280]  monster at these events.
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:48.640]  You know, I can go to Trump events and act like this, anybody could.
[03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:51.160]  So this is out of control, he's had his credentials pulled.
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:58.040]  So here's the big, because one of the top Twitter trends yesterday today that info wars
[03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:02.520]  has been caught doctoring video, gosh, these people are incredible.
[03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:07.200]  When all he did was zoom in, joining us is Paul Joseph Watson from her Britannic Majesties
[03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:08.360]  London, England.
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:12.680]  Paul, what's the sigh up here just to change the subject?
[03:39:12.680 --> 03:39:17.800]  The sigh up Alex is that Jim Acosta manhandled the woman basically it was I never said it
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:18.800]  was assault.
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:23.240]  All people claimed it was assault, he used his left arm to physically restrain put pressure
[03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:27.360]  on the woman when she was trying to do her job and grab the microphone that obviously
[03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:30.160]  resulted in his press access getting revoked.
[03:39:30.160 --> 03:39:34.680]  And so instead of focusing on that controversy and having to talk about it, the media invented
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:42.080]  this giant conspiracy theory with no evidence that I had edited the video to first speed
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:45.920]  it up at first they said I sped it up and then later they said, oh no, it's slowed down
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:48.440]  so they couldn't even get their story straight.
[03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:53.900]  So then they made the whole story about Sarah Sanders tweeting out this video saying it
[03:39:53.900 --> 03:39:57.360]  came from info wars and that it was doctored.
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:40:00.160]  Brian Stelter of CNN claimed it was distorted.
[03:40:00.160 --> 03:40:01.760]  They're saying it's fake.
[03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:04.280]  You had the Washington Post report on it.
[03:40:04.280 --> 03:40:09.360]  Newsweek said it was fake doctored vice all these big websites trashing is on a minute
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:10.360]  by minute basis.
[03:40:10.360 --> 03:40:12.440]  Okay, it's not fake.
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:13.440]  It's zoomed in.
[03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:17.160]  It's the same thing that James O'Keeffe gets when they say, oh, your videos are edited.
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:21.280]  Yeah, it's zoomed in to show the moment when this exchange happened.
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:22.280]  It's not sped up.
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:28.480]  I even posted the screenshot Alex from my video editing software, Sony Vegas Pro where
[03:40:28.480 --> 03:40:32.480]  you can see if a clip in the track is sped up, it has wavy lines.
[03:40:32.480 --> 03:40:33.760]  I posted the track.
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:36.880]  There are no wavy lines because I did not speed it up.
[03:40:36.880 --> 03:40:37.880]  Okay.
[03:40:37.880 --> 03:40:42.760]  And Paul, where do people find that we even show that obviously it's a time of editing
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:43.760]  to zoom in.
[03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:44.760]  This is ridiculous.
[03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:47.120]  Everybody knows when you're watching the news, they show the clip first.
[03:40:47.120 --> 03:40:51.160]  And of a plane blowing up or whatever, then they zoom in on it.
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:55.120]  He did this, he got his credentials pulled and now they're changing the subject saying
[03:40:55.120 --> 03:40:56.120]  we're fake news.
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:40:57.600]  When in truth, they're the fake news.
[03:40:57.600 --> 03:40:58.600]  Yeah.
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:02.600]  And that's saying, oh, but there's like a couple of frames which were a little bit different.
[03:41:02.600 --> 03:41:03.600]  Okay.
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:08.480]  I downloaded a GIF file, exported as an MT2 file, exported it, ran it through another
[03:41:08.480 --> 03:41:11.400]  program as an MP4 file, uploaded it to Twitter.
[03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:14.920]  The quality, the frame, the compression is not going to be absolutely identical.
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:15.920]  Okay.
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:19.280]  So that's why I've tried to let me, that's why I've tried to let you use the money to
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:21.280]  hire a team so you could be helping you.
[03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:22.600]  But everybody knows about video artifacts.
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:27.880]  The point is, Jim Acosta did this and now it's becoming an even bigger fiasco for mainstream
[03:41:27.880 --> 03:41:29.600]  media lying and saying we lied.
[03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:31.560]  I think it's already blowing up in their face.
[03:41:31.560 --> 03:41:37.320]  Oh, Alex, like even Buzzfeed writers are now semi-defending me because they're saying everybody
[03:41:37.320 --> 03:41:40.520]  rushed to call this fake when it obviously wasn't fake.
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:41.520]  This happened.
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:46.400]  So they, they, they denounced and demonized Corey Lewandowski based on six video frames
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:49.040]  from that alleged assault on Michelle Fields.
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:53.000]  Now they're getting all pedantic about these video frames, even though it's a straight video.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:55.760]  That Lewandowski video was just like six frames.
[03:41:55.760 --> 03:41:56.760]  It wasn't even a video.
[03:41:56.760 --> 03:41:58.600]  It's a series of still images.
[03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:02.880]  So again, it's a complete hoax that it's a massive smear campaign by the international
[03:42:02.880 --> 03:42:03.880]  media.
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:05.360]  Now I'm getting death threats.
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:08.520]  That's always a nice juicy bonus that you get out of all this attention.
[03:42:08.520 --> 03:42:10.680]  And again, it's a complete hoax.
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:13.520]  Video analysts have looked at it and said, no, it wasn't sped up.
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:14.520]  It was slowed down.
[03:42:14.520 --> 03:42:18.840]  Maybe there was some compression lost in a couple of frames, but it is what it is.
[03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:19.840]  Yeah.
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:23.960]  Everybody knows when you download video and re upload it, especially on things like Twitter,
[03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:26.600]  Twitter has crappy video that it looks like crap.
[03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:30.000]  I mean, I'll shoot a video on my phone back when I was allowed on Twitter and it'd be
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:32.640]  crystal clear on the phone and look like crap on Twitter.
[03:42:32.640 --> 03:42:34.800]  That doesn't mean I distorted it.
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:39.360]  It's what the, it's what up, it's what compression does when you're sending a five minute video
[03:42:39.360 --> 03:42:42.480]  in 10 seconds up to Twitter, it compresses it.
[03:42:42.480 --> 03:42:44.200]  So it's not as good.
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:48.320]  We'll be right back because the media wants a statement from you, Paul.
[03:42:48.320 --> 03:42:50.760]  They want like a two minute statement, a bunch of news groups do.
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:53.760]  So let's, let's get your statement to the media straight ahead.

[03:46:57.640 --> 03:47:20.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:27.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from the info wars.com
[03:47:27.740 --> 03:47:28.740]  studios.
[03:47:28.740 --> 03:47:31.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:31.740 --> 03:47:33.320]  So you're in the break.
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:39.320]  I walk back in the kitchen, the coffee room and info wars fakes video of a costume.
[03:47:39.320 --> 03:47:40.320]  He didn't do anything.
[03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:41.320]  He didn't shove a woman.
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:43.480]  He didn't push her hand down.
[03:47:43.480 --> 03:47:49.240]  I walk back into the studio and they're going, look at this Fox News.
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:51.400]  Another clip of them saying, yes, we faked it.
[03:47:51.400 --> 03:47:52.400]  It's not true.
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:55.040]  Jim Acosta never did anything wrong in his life.
[03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:58.560]  They are so obsessed with discrediting us, ladies and gentlemen, because they know we're
[03:47:58.560 --> 03:47:59.560]  onto them.
[03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:03.840]  Now, we were playing this live yesterday, okay?
[03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:07.000]  And this isn't about Jim Acosta, it's not about info wars, it's about the lying corporate
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  media.
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:11.760]  We should all be talking about Antifa saying they're going to attack 900 targets, not
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:16.600]  just Tucker Carlson's house doxing all these people ahead of real violence and how they
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:21.120]  said they're going to drive Trump from power in full page ads.
[03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:22.120]  They mean business.
[03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:23.120]  I predicted it all.
[03:48:23.120 --> 03:48:24.120]  It's happening.
[03:48:24.120 --> 03:48:25.120]  He just fired sessions.
[03:48:25.120 --> 03:48:28.120]  This is seismic.
[03:48:28.120 --> 03:48:32.680]  We're in a new ball game now, but we've got to cover this because they want to shut us
[03:48:32.680 --> 03:48:36.680]  down and they've got the corporate media doing all of this.
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:41.600]  It came out in the news that Fox News buys ads everywhere, trying to siphon off info wars
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:48.320]  audience while they then get up and lie about us and say things that aren't true.
[03:48:48.320 --> 03:48:52.960]  So it's across the board and the media also wants a statement on this.
[03:48:52.960 --> 03:48:57.520]  So Paul will make a statement here in about two minutes specifically on this issue.
[03:48:57.520 --> 03:49:00.720]  Then we'll put the videos in and post and send this out and post it.
[03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:06.280]  So the man who edited the video and technically, yes, blowing it up is editing it, zooming
[03:49:06.280 --> 03:49:10.320]  in a video, any type of change, downloading it and uploading it.
[03:49:10.320 --> 03:49:13.600]  I guess you could say is an edit because it changes the format.
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:16.120]  All these systems are on different formats.
[03:49:16.120 --> 03:49:17.640]  Did it get washed out a little bit?
[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:18.640]  Absolutely.
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:22.040]  But that's not us distorting it for the purposes of deception.
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:26.360]  That's us uploading it to Twitter where it loses quality, but they think you're stupid.
[03:49:26.360 --> 03:49:28.360]  They hope to change the subject.
[03:49:28.360 --> 03:49:31.360]  We happen to have the live satellite feed recorded in HD.
[03:49:31.360 --> 03:49:34.800]  Oh, we happen to have the C-SPAN recorded in HD.
[03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:41.240]  So in a few minutes, we're going to show you the raw footage and then we're going to zoom
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:47.040]  in live off the board in there with a tool so that you can see.
[03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:48.040]  But the point is, it doesn't matter.
[03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:50.400]  A cost to get in front of everybody.
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:55.400]  They withdrew his credentials there because the president saw it with his eyeballs from
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:49:57.800]  five feet away.
[03:49:57.800 --> 03:50:01.160]  So this is an incredible example of attempted mind control.
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:04.960]  Here's Fox News just minutes ago.
[03:50:04.960 --> 03:50:08.720]  The White House Correspondence Association, however, making it clear that they do not
[03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:10.160]  support this decision.
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:15.760]  The Correspondence Association strongly objects to the Trump administration's decision to
[03:50:15.760 --> 03:50:20.920]  use U.S. Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:22.440]  has a difficult relationship.
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:27.640]  Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:31.240]  offense and is unacceptable, Howie.
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:36.920]  Yeah, I think it's a misstep on the part of the White House to claim that Jim Acosta was
[03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:39.880]  laying his hands on this young intern to try to take the mic away.
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:41.360]  The contact was very incidental.
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:46.920]  I also think it was a misstep for Sarah Sanders to tweet out a doctored video put up by InfoWars,
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:52.960]  the Alex Jones conspiracy site that kind of made it look more aggressive than it was.
[03:50:52.960 --> 03:50:58.800]  So we had credentials for like a month, doesn't mean anything, the media made a deal and they
[03:50:58.800 --> 03:50:59.800]  took it away from us.
[03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:01.480]  It wasn't the president's decision.
[03:51:01.480 --> 03:51:02.480]  What's the reason we're not there?
[03:51:02.480 --> 03:51:09.000]  Oh, but Acosta, who Acosta everyone, he is God.
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  So let's show you the C-Span unedited video at the point where he, she tries to take the
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:17.280]  mic back her job and he slaps at her arm.
[03:51:17.280 --> 03:51:18.280]  Here it is.
[03:51:18.280 --> 03:51:25.280]  Go ahead.
[03:51:25.280 --> 03:51:26.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:26.280 --> 03:51:27.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:28.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:28.280 --> 03:51:29.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:29.280 --> 03:51:30.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:31.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:31.280 --> 03:51:32.280]  Pardon me, ma'am.
[03:51:32.280 --> 03:51:33.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:33.280 --> 03:51:34.280]  That's enough.
[03:51:34.280 --> 03:51:35.280]  What are you doing?
[03:51:35.280 --> 03:51:36.280]  Stop right there.
[03:51:36.280 --> 03:51:37.280]  What are you doing?
[03:51:37.280 --> 03:51:38.280]  Look, I don't think he assaulted her.
[03:51:38.280 --> 03:51:39.280]  But he laid hands on her.
[03:51:39.280 --> 03:51:40.280]  He pulled the mic back.
[03:51:40.280 --> 03:51:41.280]  He wasn't cordial.
[03:51:41.280 --> 03:51:44.800]  He's always causing problems, totally reasonable to kick him out and say, bring somebody else
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:45.800]  in from fake CNN.
[03:51:45.800 --> 03:51:47.800]  Totally agree with the president.
[03:51:47.800 --> 03:51:49.360]  Paul didn't even say it was an assault.
[03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:53.160]  But compared to Corin Lewandowski, he basically murdered her.
[03:51:53.160 --> 03:52:00.800]  So see, off their leftist rules, off their leftist rules, him pushing her arm down and
[03:52:00.800 --> 03:52:05.240]  then with his hand grabbing the mic away from her, when she's trying to take it away, that's
[03:52:05.240 --> 03:52:08.160]  a double action beyond what Corin Lewandowski did.
[03:52:08.160 --> 03:52:12.240]  So like you said, Paul, they use six frames like it was the Sabruder film.
[03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:13.240]  We have the footage.
[03:52:13.240 --> 03:52:14.800]  I'm going to show it one more time.
[03:52:14.800 --> 03:52:16.680]  Now, again, let's show it to you.
[03:52:16.680 --> 03:52:19.720]  This is unedited video recorded on the DVRs in there.
[03:52:19.720 --> 03:52:22.560]  Put it back on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners, I'm going to describe it.
[03:52:22.560 --> 03:52:23.840]  Okay, there it is.
[03:52:23.840 --> 03:52:24.840]  Not zoomed in.
[03:52:24.840 --> 03:52:25.840]  Now they call us an edit.
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:28.760]  Zoom in on it.
[03:52:28.760 --> 03:52:29.760]  Zoom in.
[03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:30.760]  This is live time.
[03:52:30.760 --> 03:52:31.760]  We're zooming in.
[03:52:31.760 --> 03:52:32.760]  All we're doing is zooming in.
[03:52:32.760 --> 03:52:35.480]  And look, I know you know that, but notice it's misdirection, how they always change the
[03:52:35.480 --> 03:52:36.480]  subject.
[03:52:36.480 --> 03:52:38.640]  Paul, this is unbelievable, isn't it?
[03:52:38.640 --> 03:52:43.360]  Well, the original that you're playing now looks even worse than the one I posted.
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:48.560]  Listen, Vice News put out this article about an hour ago, said, quote, Sanders also falsely
[03:52:48.560 --> 03:52:51.400]  accused the cost of putting his hands on the young woman.
[03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:55.000]  He brings his left arm down in an aggressive manner.
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:57.560]  It's not assault, but he's restraining her.
[03:52:57.560 --> 03:52:59.320]  He's overpowering her.
[03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:03.440]  So again, what I've said to the media who've asked me about this, the video is not sped
[03:53:03.440 --> 03:53:04.440]  up.
[03:53:04.440 --> 03:53:06.520]  They initially ran with this fake story that it was sped up.
[03:53:06.520 --> 03:53:10.120]  Then they said, oh, it's not sped up, but maybe there's some digital artifact problems
[03:53:10.120 --> 03:53:13.560]  in there, yeah, because I ran it through like three different programs and re-uploaded it
[03:53:13.560 --> 03:53:14.560]  to Twitter.
[03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:15.560]  Okay.
[03:53:15.560 --> 03:53:16.560]  That's not doctoring.
[03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:20.760]  Doctoring is when you change the footage deliberately, which I didn't do, to change the meaning of
[03:53:20.760 --> 03:53:21.760]  the footage.
[03:53:21.760 --> 03:53:23.240]  This does not change anything.
[03:53:23.240 --> 03:53:24.240]  Okay.
[03:53:24.240 --> 03:53:28.000]  I did not distort the video, as Brian Stelter of CNN claims.
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:31.000]  Even BuzzFeed journalists announced they were me defending me on this.
[03:53:31.000 --> 03:53:35.640]  The media invented a conspiracy theory to distract from Acosta's behavior.
[03:53:35.640 --> 03:53:40.160]  Sarah Sanders was perfectly correct in posting this video, which is genuine, and it proves
[03:53:40.160 --> 03:53:44.320]  her point that Acosta placed his hands on the woman to overpower her.
[03:53:44.320 --> 03:53:46.720]  It doesn't mean it was assault, but it was an issue.
[03:53:46.720 --> 03:53:47.720]  But he did overpower.
[03:53:47.720 --> 03:53:50.880]  It's an outcry to distract from with this conspiracy theory.
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:52.200]  You're right, Paul.
[03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:53.760]  He overpowered a woman.
[03:53:53.760 --> 03:53:55.200]  That's the correct term.
[03:53:55.200 --> 03:53:58.680]  And so what I think you should do is put out another tweet that shows the unedited, unblown
[03:53:58.680 --> 03:54:03.960]  up in front, and then the blown up rolling right after, not even side by side, but there's
[03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:06.200]  the M4s at it, there's the C-span original.
[03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:10.800]  And yes, in HD that we have, it's much clearer, they actually pushes her down pretty damn
[03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:11.800]  hard.
[03:54:11.800 --> 03:54:14.800]  Now, I'm going to make a video about this tonight.
[03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:19.640]  I've been tweeting about it all day, and yes, compare it to how they reacted to the Lewandowski
[03:54:19.640 --> 03:54:21.360]  thing, which was based on six frames.
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:25.440]  And there's another thing going around today, Alex, which we're also getting hit on.
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:31.680]  The mainstream media after the shooting earlier today, hundreds of verified Twitter accounts,
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:37.480]  Sky News, ABC News reported, eyewitnesses say the shooter was Middle Eastern, okay?
[03:54:37.480 --> 03:54:40.560]  That was the first thing I woke up to in the media this morning.
[03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:45.080]  So now we're being attacked, Laura Loomer's being attacked, everyone's being attacked,
[03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:49.760]  because we quoted mainstream media reports saying the shooter was initially they thought
[03:54:49.760 --> 03:54:50.760]  Middle Eastern.
[03:54:50.760 --> 03:54:56.840]  So they put out the fake news, we quote them, and then we get blamed for it by them and
[03:54:56.840 --> 03:54:58.000]  by all their sicker fans.
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:00.680]  Again, it's the same thing over and over again, Alex.
[03:55:00.680 --> 03:55:04.880]  Oh, they're getting ready to take you off Twitter and YouTube, brother.
[03:55:04.880 --> 03:55:08.880]  They are like they do about me, making up something that you didn't do.
[03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:10.760]  I never said kill the media with battle rifles.
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:14.240]  I said, if Antifa comes to your house, the first time they come, they just docks you,
[03:55:14.240 --> 03:55:17.160]  the next time they come, they're violent, have a firearm to protect yourself, nothing
[03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:18.600]  to do with media.
[03:55:18.600 --> 03:55:20.440]  And they did this because they're making their move.
[03:55:20.440 --> 03:55:25.760]  What about Big Picture Poll, where 900 targets to be hit by Antifa, Tucker Carlson cracking
[03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:29.760]  in his door saying, we know where you sleep, we know your kids are here, the same guy that
[03:55:29.760 --> 03:55:34.040]  runs this Antifa group is the one you've written about, known as Pez Dispenser.
[03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:36.720]  I mean, this is everything I've predicted.
[03:55:36.720 --> 03:55:39.280]  They're so scared about sessions being removed.
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:45.680]  Oh, no, the professor had violent threats, encouraging the assassination of Trump administration
[03:55:45.680 --> 03:55:50.320]  officials on Twitter for months and months and months, they did absolutely nothing about
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:51.320]  it.
[03:55:51.320 --> 03:55:56.040]  This smash racism DC group is known for doxing people over and over again.
[03:55:56.040 --> 03:55:59.720]  All that happened before was that they got a few tweets deleted.
[03:55:59.720 --> 03:56:03.080]  Apparently last night, their entire account was suspended, but these groups have been
[03:56:03.080 --> 03:56:09.400]  on Twitter for years promoting this doxing, harassment, targeting of individuals and basically
[03:56:09.400 --> 03:56:10.400]  nothing's done.
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:13.080]  A new group just pops up whenever they get caught.
[03:56:13.080 --> 03:56:16.600]  So yeah, it's just another distraction from all that, from the violent mobs that are actually
[03:56:16.600 --> 03:56:21.360]  out on the street, harassing and targeting people, Tucker Carlson with his wife and four
[03:56:21.360 --> 03:56:26.680]  kids who were potentially in the house, absolute disgrace.
[03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:31.480]  The only update on that is that Stephen Colbert, one of your favorite people's actually tweeted
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:36.640]  that targeting Tucker Carlson's home and terrorizing his family is an act of monstrous cowardice.
[03:56:36.640 --> 03:56:42.600]  So at least he sees sense, unlike a lot of other people who actually applauded this.
[03:56:42.600 --> 03:56:43.600]  Oh yeah.
[03:56:43.600 --> 03:56:48.880]  In fact, Pencil Neck has put out an article basically praising Mike.
[03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:52.720]  Mike Isaacson is very, very happy right now.
[03:56:52.720 --> 03:56:53.720]  Yeah.
[03:56:53.720 --> 03:56:57.800]  I mean, you know, I get death threats every day on Twitter or at least violent threats
[03:56:57.800 --> 03:56:59.600]  or at least, you know, why don't you just kill yourself?
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:01.720]  It's just par for the course at this point.
[03:57:01.720 --> 03:57:05.280]  The vast majority of it does come from the far left, some comes from the far right and
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:06.280]  we denounce it.
[03:57:06.280 --> 03:57:08.320]  We distance ourselves from those people.
[03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:12.120]  When the far left engage in this, they're embraced, you know, they're made apologies
[03:57:12.120 --> 03:57:13.120]  for by the left.
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:14.120]  Stay there.
[03:57:14.120 --> 03:57:17.760]  I want to ask you a big picture about Sessions is more, one more segment, then I'm going
[03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:22.560]  to open the phones up and a bunch of other big guests with Inside Intel coming up today.
[03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:25.000]  But folks, this is the most grave situation ever.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:26.000]  It's very positive.
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:27.280]  We're taking the country back.
[03:57:27.280 --> 03:57:31.720]  Good things are happening, but now the enemy's going to come in and try to steal our victory.
[03:57:31.720 --> 03:57:35.080]  It's on, ladies and gentlemen, Trump's taking the gloves off, whatever you do.
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:37.400]  We're the most fan broadcast in the world for a reason.
[03:57:37.400 --> 03:57:39.480]  We could save this country with your help.
[03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:41.440]  Tell folks at the local station you're listening to.
[03:57:41.440 --> 03:57:50.760]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:50.760 --> 03:57:53.840]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:56.560]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:56.560 --> 03:58:00.920]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:07.000]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:08.400]  from us as individuals.
[03:58:08.400 --> 03:58:14.240]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:14.240 --> 03:58:16.080]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:16.080 --> 03:58:17.720]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[03:58:17.720 --> 03:58:19.880]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.880 --> 03:58:22.720]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[03:58:22.720 --> 03:58:24.520]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[03:58:24.520 --> 03:58:29.480]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them
[03:58:29.480 --> 03:58:31.480]  to control everyone.
[03:58:31.480 --> 03:58:33.480]  It's The David Knight Show.
[03:58:33.480 --> 03:58:35.480]  I never missed your show.
[03:58:35.480 --> 03:58:36.480]  Any day.
[03:58:36.480 --> 03:58:37.480]  And I mean, what?
[03:58:37.480 --> 03:58:39.760]  I mean, never.
[03:58:39.760 --> 03:59:09.720]  Go to www.infoors.com forward slash show.
[03:59:09.720 --> 03:59:15.520]  The goblins now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.520 --> 03:59:18.600]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:59:18.600 --> 03:59:19.600]  I want to keep going.
[03:59:19.600 --> 03:59:23.560]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.560 --> 03:59:25.560]  I want to push all the way.
[03:59:25.560 --> 03:59:26.840]  I've committed to do that.
[03:59:26.840 --> 03:59:29.760]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:59:29.760 --> 03:59:32.440]  But you've got to back us and I promise you this.
[03:59:32.440 --> 03:59:33.800]  I will never falter.
[03:59:33.800 --> 03:59:36.120]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:59:36.120 --> 03:59:37.120]  I physically will.
[03:59:37.120 --> 03:59:41.920]  But I give you my commitment if you financially support us at www.infoors.com to give you
[03:59:41.920 --> 03:59:47.640]  my absolute total commitment.
[03:59:47.640 --> 04:00:08.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
