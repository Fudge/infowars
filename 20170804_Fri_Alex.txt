[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:07.000 --> 00:13.000]  All Watson reports.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  The BBC says we shouldn't say certain things to burqa wearing Muslims.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  They got some veiled women to read out hypothetical questions
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  and then lecture the viewer about how ignorant and bigoted they are.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  I've got a few questions.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  You can't be a feminist and be wearing a burqa.
[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  If anybody was to say that to me, they would be like,
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  oh, she's the biggest feminist you can find.
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  OK, so why did one of the first ever Arab Muslim feminist groups,
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  the Egyptian feminist union, encourage women to discard their burqas?
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  The very act of Arab feminist leaders like Huda Sharawi discarding the burqa
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  was one of the symbolic acts that led to Muslim women in Egypt winning the right to an education.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  Rejecting the burqa has been an integral part of actual feminism in the Middle East
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  for nearly a hundred years.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  If feminism is about a woman's right in her own choices, then this is one of it.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  Really?
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  Did the 16-year-old girl in Canada, who was strangled to death by her own brother
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  for not wearing the veil, get to make her own choice?
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  Did the four-year-old girl in India, whose father smashed her brains out on the floor
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  after her head covering slipped, get to make her own choice?
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  Why are children as young as three and four made to wear the burqa and the hijab at all?
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  Did they get a choice?
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  Did women in Saudi Arabia look like they had a choice
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  as they're literally herded around like farmyard animals?
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  Did the woman in Saudi Arabia who wore a skirt get a choice?
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  Oh no, that's right, she was hunted down by the police and arrested.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  I was so practical.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Practical? Really?
[01:42.000 --> 01:53.000]  So practical.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  So practical.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  I thought I was so practical.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  Yes, I'm so person.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  Oh, but you're oppressed and we want to help you.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  OK, so if Muslim women who wear the burqa are on oppressed,
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  why do Muslim women in Iran literally call on Westerners to help them by oppression
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  by violating the law on head coverings?
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  If it's not a form of oppression,
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  why does Azra Nehmani, head of the Muslim reform movement,
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  assert that hijab purity culture covers, segregates, subordinates,
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  silences, jails and kills women and girls around the world?
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  If it's not a form of oppression,
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  why do gangs of men roam the streets in Iran throwing acid in the faces of women
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  whose veils are deemed to be too loose?
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  If it's not a form of oppression,
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  why are Muslim gangs in London threatening to kill women who don't cover their heads?
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  I think some women are actually having to fight to be able to wear it.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Really?
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  Is that why the first thing that women in Syria did after they were liberated from ISIS
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  was to discard it?
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Who's fighting to wear it?
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Last time I checked, ISIS was stoning women to death for not wearing it.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Sharia police patrol Muslim countries forcing women to wear it.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  Women exposing their hair is only one of the controversial crimes
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  considered to be against local Sharia law.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  And by the way, we don't undermine a woman who does not wear the face veil or the hijab at all.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  Really?
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  So are women in Europe who are being beaten by Sharia patrol gangs
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  for not wearing it being undermined?
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  What about women in Sweden who are being refused service in shops if they don't wear it?
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Are they being undermined?
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  Call back to your own country.
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  When it's a problem, something happens, but when you want your curry, when you want your samosas,
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  when you want the glitter, when you want to put bindis on your forehead to go to a wireless festival,
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  it's all good.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  No one who puts bindis on their heads, which by the way, is a Hindu thing,
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  so why are we even talking about it?
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  No one who does that and then goes to music festivals is walking up to Muslims on the street
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  and asking them, why don't you go back to your own country?
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  Where did the BBC get these dumb questions from?
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  It's cultural.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  It's never been Islamic.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  So it's cultural and not Islamic?
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  Okay, so why do you wear it?
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  I am wearing it for God.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  It's an act of worship.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  Right, so it's cultural, not Islamic, but you wear it for Allah.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  So it's Islamic.
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  What are you hiding there?
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.000]  A bomb.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  Yeah, why are you laughing about suicide bombings less than three months after a suicide bomber
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  in the UK blew up a bunch of kids at a pop concert?
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  I've also got a few questions for the BBC.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  Why are you using taxpayer money to normalise the oppression of women?
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  Why are you trying to popularise something that's clearly abnormal for an open liberal society?
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  Why are you also trying to normalise other backward Islamic practices like people marrying their cousins,
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  something that's caused a huge spike in childhood deaths in the UK of Muslim children?
[04:46.000 --> 04:53.000]  Why are you continually shoving regressive belief systems down our throats in the name of progressivism and diversity?
[04:53.000 --> 05:02.000]  Women being smothered in black cloths to obey the whims of a brutal, archaic, 7th century patriarchy isn't progressive.
[05:08.000 --> 05:16.000]  A 44-year-old father was beaten by gang of teenagers and knocked out with a skateboard after he asked them to stop smoking marijuana on a Dallas train.
[05:16.000 --> 05:24.000]  The group of teenagers included young men and women who punched the father and threw against the train's doors before arriving at the station near Deep Ellum in Dallas, Texas.
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  In World News, 22.5% of the German population now has a migrant background.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  Migrants and their children make up an estimated 18.6 million people in Germany.
[05:35.000 --> 05:43.000]  According to the federal statistical office which attributed the shocking statistic to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open border policies.
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.000]  In contrast, President Trump plans to overhaul immigration laws in America as part of his wide-ranging agenda to tighten border security.
[05:51.000 --> 06:01.000]  The president is working with two senators to draft a bill to create a skills-based immigration program that gets priority to Americans by cutting down on work visa abuse, among other things.

[08:21.000 --> 08:34.000]  Coming to you live from the infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas. It's Alex Jones.
[08:34.000 --> 08:47.000]  Well, Mueller has been paneled in the District of Columbia, the district run by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, where she threatens the police chief to cover up all the IT fraud from India,
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.000]  and the people trying to flee justice. Yes, that same District of Columbia, completely run by the swamp.
[08:55.000 --> 09:07.000]  The District of Columbia Swamp Rat team. If the grand jury had a baseball team, it's...
[09:07.000 --> 09:17.000]  Mascot would be a crocodile, an alligator, a bigfoot, a large obese swamp rat, led by people like HR McMaster.
[09:17.000 --> 09:25.000]  But now, Mueller probing collusion, obstruction, financial crimes. We knew this was coming because there was never any Russia collusion.
[09:25.000 --> 09:35.000]  But now the entire Trump family, the entire Trump entourage, the entire Trump company, and the entire Trump campaign, can we find a bounce check?
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  If we find somebody we think might have said something wrong to an FBI dragnet, we always told you it wouldn't be Russia.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  Because there was nothing there except Trump Jr. trying to find corruption on Hillary, which is like trying to find a blade of grass in the middle of a giant prairie.
[09:53.000 --> 10:03.000]  It's everywhere. It's trying to find water at the seaside. Mueller probing collusion, obstruction, financial crimes.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  Right. But you know what, swamp creatures? You can run, but you can't hide.
[10:07.000 --> 10:15.000]  Because you get more and more governors, more and more statehouse members, more and more members of Congress switching to Republican.
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  And they're not switching to Rhino. They're not switching to Neocon. As the Neocons hold on for dear life along with the Democrats.
[10:22.000 --> 10:29.000]  No, they're switching to Libertarian Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Donald Trump style.
[10:29.000 --> 10:39.000]  And you are so scared. And the big cherry on top we learn from the Daily Caller and Breitbart News as well,
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.000]  HR McMaster fired National Security Council official for pinning memo on globalist.
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.000]  They go back and they data mine it and they find out, oh, you wrote an article how globalism is out live with Islam.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  It's publicly out live. So is the Vatican. And then, oh, we can't have you here. You're fired.
[10:58.000 --> 10:58.000]  And that ties in with this new article from Jack
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  White House to staffers. If you like info wars or Milo, you're fired.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  That's the new litmus test that if you share any info wars articles, you're fired.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  And I guess if you write memos and write articles for Breitbart, you're fired too.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  McMaster is definitely a bootlicker of the globalist.
[11:27.000 --> 11:55.000]  Trump, after Flynn left, tried to get five other people to sign on, and they wouldn't.
[11:55.000 --> 12:07.000]  He is the president
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.600]  kill free market and absolutely enslave us. That they see themselves as elites over us
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.920]  and our families and the whole deep state, Panoptagon, high-tech AI spy group. And they
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.200]  know that their time is running short because what they've established is totally unelected,
[12:42.200 --> 12:49.320]  totally authoritarian, and deeply allied with orthodox, radical, Wahhabist Islam. And Trump
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.000]  has rolled back their Arab Spring. Trump has rolled back their Christian killing failed
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.800]  state extravaganza, their jihad with his own Americana culture, but also military crusade,
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.720]  not to take the Middle East, but to simply roll back the Islamist turn-lushed on the non-radical
[13:08.720 --> 13:16.320]  Muslim and Christian areas of that area of the world. Meanwhile, Debbie Washington-Schultz says
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.840]  she doesn't regret standing by her arrested IT staffer and trying to cover up whatever's on those
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.760]  laptops. So no wonder they're so desperate in the district of criminals, in the district of the
[13:27.760 --> 13:36.960]  swamp things, deep in the swamp, Mueller desperate. Is there a snooping about for the perfect Democratic
[13:36.960 --> 13:44.400]  Party grand jury that could indict a ham sandwich and are now preparing to come out with all their
[13:44.400 --> 13:58.160]  fake charges, all their fake charges, all their fake hoaxes to then prepare the Congress for the
[13:58.160 --> 14:04.080]  impeachment and to say to the House, look, this grand jury found this. And because the president
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.200]  is above the law, except for Congress moving with impeachment, we demand you move forward after we
[14:09.200 --> 14:17.120]  found some campaign impropriety or some finance information or something they can twist to sell
[14:17.120 --> 14:24.960]  the public. Sort of a fraud happened as if we don't remember the entire gigantor witch hunt
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.520]  was supposedly the entire time
[14:29.520 --> 14:41.360]  about Russia. But as that evaporates, as that hoax trails away, now it moves to collusion,
[14:41.360 --> 14:49.680]  obstruction, financial crimes. But just remember, ladies and gentlemen, that Hillary and all of
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.520]  her corruption, all of her Russia and China dealings and missile secrets and North Korean
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.640]  reactors and stealing the money from the Haitian children on and on and on. Remember all the crimes,
[14:58.640 --> 15:06.720]  the illegal servers, the dead staffers, the fixing the debates, the fixing the polls, all of it,
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.040]  the legions of crimes. But now Mueller, the man of wholesomeness, the good person that
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.080]  stood by and covered it all up. He's trying to crucify this president because his president's
[15:18.080 --> 15:25.200]  a patriot and is standing against Orthodox Islam. Are there moderate rebels in Syria? Sure. Maybe
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.640]  there are unicorns in Detroit, too. Listen to this video, Senator McCain, of a Syrian,
[15:31.280 --> 15:37.440]  it looks like a fighter fighter jet being shot out of the sky. Listen to what said they say afterwards.
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.120]  I have a problem helping those people out of there screaming that after a hit.
[15:49.120 --> 15:56.800]  Do you have a problem with an American Christian saying thank God, thank God? That's what they're
[15:56.800 --> 16:02.000]  saying. Come on. Of course they are Muslims, but they're moderates and I guarantee you that
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.760]  they are moderates. I know them and I've been with them. Every place that I went, every person that
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.840]  I spoke to, I asked this question to them and without hesitation they said there are no moderate
[16:13.840 --> 16:20.160]  rebels. Who are these moderate rebels that people keep speaking of? Regardless of the name of these
[16:20.160 --> 16:26.240]  groups, the strongest fighting force on the ground in Syria is Al Nusrah or Al Qaeda and ISIS. That
[16:26.240 --> 16:31.600]  is a fact. When Senator Carter was here before this committee in July, he testified that there were
[16:31.600 --> 16:39.360]  only about 60 Syrian fighters that had been trained in our train and equip program and
[16:39.360 --> 16:46.800]  reinserted. We've heard reports about the attacks on those individuals when they were reinserted
[16:46.800 --> 16:52.400]  back into Syria. Can you tell us what the total number of trained fighters remains?
[16:55.520 --> 17:04.800]  It's a small number and the ones that are in the fight is we're talking four or five.
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.960]  Now in a move that should be celebrated rather than demonized, President Trump has pulled the
[17:10.960 --> 17:17.600]  plug on the support for these mythical moderates. The red flag was raised due to, as the weekly
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.800]  standard reports, earlier this year, President Donald Trump was shown a disturbing video of
[17:22.800 --> 17:29.120]  Syrian rebels beheading a child near the city of Aleppo. It had caused a minor stir in the press
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.640]  as the fighters belonged to the Nour al-Din al-Zanqi movement, a group that had been supported by
[17:34.640 --> 17:41.520]  the CIA as part of its rebel aid program. It is a scene reminiscent of the Islamic state's snuff
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.440]  videos, except this wasn't the work of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's men. The murderers were supposed
[17:47.440 --> 17:54.080]  to be the good guys, our allies. It is now well known that Obama's State Department spent vast
[17:54.080 --> 18:00.240]  sums of taxpayer dollars to pull the wool over the American public's eyes on the moderate rebel
[18:00.240 --> 18:06.160]  myth. Obama's State Department even went as far as embarrassing itself with his Center for Strategic
[18:06.160 --> 18:16.160]  Counterterrorism Communications Propaganda piece.
[18:16.160 --> 18:28.640]  The radio listeners are showing images of unbelievable atrocities committed by McCain's
[18:29.440 --> 18:34.880]  Obama and Hillary's forces, suicide bombings, killings of Catholic grace nuns,
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.320]  enslaving little children. Congress wants to give Trump State Department 80 million dollars to
[18:40.320 --> 18:47.440]  counter ISIS and Russian propaganda, but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has refused the propaganda
[18:47.440 --> 18:52.720]  funds that would embolden the enemy and endanger diplomacy with the Russians. Aside from the
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.400]  globalist failing propaganda attack through their mockingbird media appendages, the federal
[18:58.400 --> 19:03.680]  government's flailing propaganda wing, the broadcasting board of governors and its elitist
[19:03.680 --> 19:11.120]  taxpayer siphoning child, Voice of America, continues to get its rear end handed to it by its nemesis

[24:31.360 --> 24:37.040]  The full John Bowne report, breaking down Trump's seeing the beheading video and it moving him to
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.880]  one of opposed ISIS and al-Qaeda even more, is a very important piece. Every once in a while we
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.160]  have a computer hiccup. About 30 seconds to break that happen but the full report is up on
[24:48.160 --> 24:55.360]  infowars.com. And McMaster and all these other people like Kelly are actually in the news going
[24:55.360 --> 25:02.080]  along with the media's narrative that the president is a bumbling booby, a bumbling buffoon who is
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.280]  emotional and makes quick decisions and that you know made up because he read it in Breitbart
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.680]  that the NSA is spying on the president. Well the New York Times had bragged that that was the
[25:13.680 --> 25:20.720]  case. That's admitted. And folks that have talked to the president tell me that he didn't know that
[25:20.720 --> 25:28.240]  Arpaio had been found guilty by a judge, no jury, of contempt and was facing six months in jail.
[25:29.040 --> 25:31.840]  That he didn't know they're trying to prosecute Julian Assange.
[25:33.520 --> 25:39.680]  That is one of his biggest supporters and who he's praised because Trump now more than ever is not
[25:39.680 --> 25:43.600]  getting the hundreds of letters a day. He's not getting the phone calls from his friends and
[25:43.600 --> 25:50.000]  family and neighbors and calling who he wants to on a cell phone to ask questions. He is now
[25:50.000 --> 26:02.000]  isolated by McMaster's, by Kelly and by Mattis. And we know that McMaster's bad news. I don't
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.640]  know about Mattis. I don't know about Kelly. The jury's still out. But this is a serious,
[26:08.640 --> 26:17.920]  serious situation because he doesn't know how he's being set up. But every time he ends up finding
[26:17.920 --> 26:24.560]  out what's happening, he's able to defeat it. So now more than ever, out in the street and on
[26:24.560 --> 26:34.080]  Twitter and through talk radio, we've all got to communicate to President Trump because the enemy,
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.320]  the globalist, are fighting as hard as they can to keep the American people from getting through
[26:38.320 --> 26:43.840]  to him. And they're trying to demoralize the president. And they're trying to basically
[26:43.840 --> 26:50.640]  break his will and break our will. Coming up the next segment, I'm going to show you the new news
[26:50.640 --> 26:59.280]  week cover where they show Trump as the lazy president that's got nothing done. A total inversion
[26:59.280 --> 27:03.840]  of reality. The same news week that told you Hillary Clinton won the election. So we're going to be
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.360]  going over that. We're going to go over this new so-called grand jury. We're going to go over
[27:09.360 --> 27:13.680]  we're going to go over Cernovich being correct months ago when he talked about the purge that was
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.560]  coming and how it was all run by McMaster. That's now all been confirmed. Cernovich is on target.
[27:20.880 --> 27:29.680]  It's all coming up. But first, Jim Mars died a few days ago at age 74. And hours after we learned
[27:29.680 --> 27:35.280]  he died, I put out a short eulogy. And I am intending to air some large excerpts next week
[27:35.280 --> 27:39.600]  from interviews we did with Mr. Mars, some of his more important work because he was a good friend
[27:39.600 --> 27:44.480]  of mine and a fellow Texan. But I thought right now I would go ahead and air that little piece I
[27:44.480 --> 27:50.800]  put together Wednesday evening when I learned the news that we're going to come back and get into
[27:50.800 --> 27:56.320]  all the news. But here's that Jim Mars piece. I got some bad news today from my good friend,
[27:57.040 --> 28:05.200]  George Norrie. It was that Jim Mars had suddenly died today. And I did a little bit of checking
[28:05.200 --> 28:13.280]  and found out that indeed that is the case. Jim died at 74 years of age, was born back in 1943.
[28:14.320 --> 28:20.640]  A classic Texan. He'd been a reporter for the Fort Worth Star Telegram even before he finished
[28:20.640 --> 28:27.440]  college. He knew Jack Ruby, went to the same club as he did. He talked the first college course on
[28:27.440 --> 28:34.640]  the JFK assassination. He wrote countless New York Times bestselling books. A true investigative
[28:34.640 --> 28:41.600]  journalist, but also a fun guy to get a big old plate of Mexican food with and drink some beer.
[28:42.320 --> 28:50.240]  So I'm really, really sad that he's gone, but his work and his family and his great wife Carol
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.800]  will continue on and hopefully I can get her to come on the broadcast in the next few weeks. And
[28:55.600 --> 29:02.080]  I remember the great work of Jim Mars. But Jim Mars at 74 years of age has made the jump into
[29:02.080 --> 29:08.560]  hyperspace and is now at another level. But as I said, his work continues on. There are so many
[29:08.560 --> 29:13.840]  videos, so many articles, so many films, so many books, so many interviews I've done with him
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.080]  and documentaries I made with him that the few clips we're about to play just won't do it justice.
[29:20.080 --> 29:25.280]  So don't worry. Throughout the week of next week, we'll be hearing excerpts of Jim Mars interviews
[29:25.280 --> 29:30.080]  on my syndicated broadcast. George Norrie was able to interview him just last night.
[29:30.080 --> 29:36.000]  So we never know how long our friends and loved ones are going to be with us, but
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.120]  it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. And I certainly love the
[29:41.120 --> 29:47.920]  good cheer, humor and wit of Jim Mars. So for myself and all your fans, Jim, happy trails,
[29:47.920 --> 29:53.600]  my friend, Viocadillos. All right, folks, we'll be right back on the other side. We'll also look
[29:53.600 --> 29:58.000]  at how they're trying to kill the Trump recovery and admitting they are. We're on the march,

[33:39.360 --> 33:44.720]  year and a year or two years. Let's give me a little bit of a time to to run things but a year
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.280]  into office you'll be saying wow I remember that interview. He said he was going to do it and he did
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.360]  a great job. You'll be very proud of our country. So while with her you probably read it. It was a
[33:53.360 --> 34:00.000]  drudge. Who's great by the way. Drudge is amazing. But the story in drudge and big story it's all
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.560]  over the place now. They're swimming across and big bags of stuff. Strucks swimming across
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.880]  the river. Swimming right across. We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.040]  They're jumping in. They just jumped in the rafts. They're coming up one two three
[34:17.040 --> 34:24.880]  four. They have big statues and actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified
[34:24.880 --> 34:28.800]  because they thought they were going to be killed because they're showing this on camera. The guys
[34:28.800 --> 34:39.920]  carrying bags of stuff. It was drugs. Thank you. Donald Trump. I hope you can help uncripple America.
[34:39.920 --> 34:43.440]  Thank you so much sir. You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that. Thank you.
[34:43.440 --> 34:50.800]  Thank you very much rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[34:50.800 --> 34:59.280]  It's Alex Jones is with me. Jason Carroll joins joins me now from New York from Elkhorn with
[35:05.040 --> 35:11.680]  our moral obligation to protect our planet. I think one of the kind of the things that
[35:11.680 --> 35:16.560]  we really need to be looking at this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist info wars.com
[35:16.560 --> 35:20.080]  info wars.com. Bill Clinton is a rapist. Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[35:20.080 --> 35:27.280]  So we have on a shirt uh with really a good fit of an offensive image certainly to the police
[35:27.280 --> 35:51.760]  officers. Here's the problem. I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential
[35:51.760 --> 35:55.040]  campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist info wars.com.
[35:55.040 --> 36:09.520]  Nobody can dispute the fact that we need if you look at Bill Clinton far worse minor words and
[36:09.520 --> 36:14.880]  his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics
[36:15.520 --> 36:20.960]  in this nation that's been so abusive to women. Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[36:20.960 --> 36:30.560]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women. Here's the talking point that they've got on CNN, MSNBC,
[36:30.560 --> 36:36.480]  all the comedy shows, all the newspapers and Fox News. I was just watching Fox News two minutes
[36:36.480 --> 36:42.160]  ago during the break and they had this panel of women on there and they were all saying well
[36:42.160 --> 36:49.360]  he's underwater now with his base. He's losing his base. It's a good thing he's out there speaking
[36:49.360 --> 36:55.120]  at town halls and things because Trump's really unpopular. You know he's the most unpopular
[36:55.120 --> 37:02.960]  president ever. They might as well say his approval rating zero just like they did during the
[37:02.960 --> 37:08.800]  campaign. They said that Hillary was 15 to 20 points ahead and Hillary was supposedly had a
[37:08.800 --> 37:16.400]  Bernie Sanders and so she lost all those primaries and they just gave his delegates to her the
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.840]  super delegates and the Republicans said we're going to give the delegates to other Republicans.
[37:21.840 --> 37:27.680]  We're going to give them to Ted Cruz and the Republican base said no you're not and so you
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.240]  went to their campaign events and you went to the town halls and you told them you better stop it.
[37:34.480 --> 37:39.680]  Soros is trying to fund AstroTurf, fake grassroots all over the country to go out and stir up
[37:39.680 --> 37:48.960]  troubles, spew racist garbage, get in non-Neocon, non-Rino Republicans' faces and that's what
[37:48.960 --> 37:57.120]  they're doing. They are running around the country getting in patriots faces trying to intimidate us
[37:57.120 --> 38:02.560]  and they're totally synthetic. They're totally false grassroots and we know that
[38:02.560 --> 38:10.480]  and all over the world countries are recognizing that George Soros is trying to overthrow their
[38:10.480 --> 38:18.720]  nations. It's just a fact and these criminals have gotten away with so much for so long
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.440]  that they believe that they are invincible. They want to bring the entire Western world down
[38:29.440 --> 38:36.560]  so they can bring in their replacement which is total tyranny. Much was made yesterday in the
[38:36.560 --> 38:42.560]  fun two hours I had with Milo Yiannopoulos in studio and he'd never seen the actual
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.200]  Madam President Newsweek and I finally got the mail a few weeks ago that I've been making a big
[38:47.200 --> 38:54.400]  deal out of because it is. It has how she won, where she won, why she won, how horrible Trump was,
[38:54.400 --> 39:02.000]  how she was going to govern. Here's photos of her on election night winning their fake photos.
[39:02.000 --> 39:10.640]  I mean the whole thing is just an example, a roadmap to total deception and they're disdain
[39:10.640 --> 39:16.400]  for you. So just remember that. They know there's a political realignment in this country
[39:16.400 --> 39:23.680]  and they're shelling the hoax that Trump has lost his base just like they did during the campaign
[39:24.480 --> 39:28.800]  just like they did once he was president-elect just like they tried to stop the electors from
[39:28.800 --> 39:36.800]  being seated telling you that there's an indictment coming and there's a grand jury coming but
[39:36.800 --> 39:42.800]  there's an impeachment coming and that Trump's going to be removed suddenly from office.
[39:42.800 --> 39:51.040]  There's going to be a coup the next month or two. They're trying to get you ready
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.880]  and they're trying to get your support for him dented ahead of them busting a cap in his butt
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.440]  or drugging him or saying he had a stroke
[40:04.400 --> 40:06.720]  or detonating a car bomb outside the White House.
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.720]  Let me tell you something.
[40:13.040 --> 40:16.480]  When they make their move on Trump they're going to make it on everybody.
[40:17.520 --> 40:20.400]  Look at Steve Watson's article up on infowars.com.
[40:22.240 --> 40:31.840]  Newsweek cover depicts Trump as lazy boy. Quote imagine how bad he'd feel if he did any work
[40:31.840 --> 40:38.480]  and it goes on to say he's demoralized he's depressed so that you then by extension feel
[40:38.480 --> 40:44.960]  depressed they're trying to tell you your leader is on the edge of collapse your icon your figurehead
[40:44.960 --> 40:50.080]  is about to give up and he's a lazy slob that never did anything in his life
[40:52.080 --> 40:58.560]  and so lay down gi you're never going to see your sweetheart again. This is Tokyo Rose
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.960]  broadcasting from Tokyo letting all the U.S. sailors and all the Marines and all the soldiers

[54:55.360 --> 55:05.680]  totally outworked the other side we won because millions of patriotic americans voted to take back
[55:05.680 --> 55:18.880]  their country have you seen any russians in west virginia or ohio or pennsylvania

[56:22.640 --> 56:31.200]  this is the far side chat we'll have to decide they can continue their obsession with the russian

[56:56.480 --> 57:05.520]  chats with studio audiences he must do a weekly rally like he's doing and he must bring people in
[57:05.520 --> 57:12.000]  and give speeches in the white house every day to take control the narrative and all of us must
[57:12.720 --> 57:17.440]  understand this is the big battle for america's future this is yet against total criminals

[59:12.880 --> 59:19.280]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid

[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.080]  everyone hates him his base is turning against him and then we can go get the corporate numbers
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:16.480]  the inside numbers the bot numbers uh the computer numbers just like we did during the campaign
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:24.560]  and it shows trump is popular as he's ever been except for maybe inauguration day and nomination day
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.520]  i mean those were his all-time highs
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:37.040]  but all the ai systems predicted his win and then you just see the numbers online and the support
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:45.760]  it's only intensified i saw his support dip big time when he supported the bad version of obama
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.440]  care bill because he was lied to about what was in it and then he came out and said i was lied to
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.080]  and then by the fourth version it was something rand paul said was good and you notice the
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.800]  republicans wouldn't pass it because they wanted to screw people the republican leadership the freedom
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:07.440]  clock has supported it remember this trump will win the election as more popular than obama
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:16.160]  ai system finds reliable ai system predicts trump will win by the polls are wrong about trump again
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:27.040]  the hill the polls miss trump we ask pollsters why a group of major pollsters just released an
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.480]  autopsy report to explain why the polls were such a disaster they were that way because both parties
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.480]  got together and decided to engage in fraud and not call each other on it just like the democrats
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:46.560]  have all gotten together and have agreed to just engage in criminal activity with the media and to
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.920]  just do things they've never done before because it's seen as acceptable to be completely criminal
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:00.400]  in this jihad of trying to keep the sleeping giant from awakening the lily pussians are in full

[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:24.800]  coming up because they've got a new spin out i need to pull it from yesterday's stack
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:31.600]  where they have the headline from cnn that trump's killing the state department money to fight
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:38.000]  isis propaganda he read what obama signed it's a ministry of truth the target info wars breitbart
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  and the president's supporters it has nothing to do with isis but again the media lies and says why
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.240]  won't tillison spin the money used of counter foreign propaganda like isis when they're the ones
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:58.880]  that were always backing isis and it's trump crushing isis again they're just absolute lying
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:05.040]  scum that just hope you're stupid and are praying and working overtime to defeat us well they're

[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.760]  it's general McMaster that is the big globalist in the white house the head of the national
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:58.640]  security advisor the president and they are purging anybody who wrote against globalism
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:05.040]  that wrote about globalism being allied with orthodox islam he is purging anybody who does not
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.920]  want to have basically a war with russia and we know for a fact that he has isolated the president
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.920]  and he's even bragging in major publications that they have isolated the president and are
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.080]  keeping information from getting to him the same thing with general kelly so this is a serious
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:32.560]  serious situation they have banned info wars in the white house they have taken away our press passes
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  the president did not even know in a conversation with someone very close to me a few days ago
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.680]  that sheriff arpaio has been convicted by a judge of contempt and is facing six months in prison
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.440]  he didn't know that they're criminally going after assange we really likes and who helped
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:56.560]  get him elected obviously it's amazing but despite all that tpp's been killed the carbon
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:03.440]  tax has been killed 69 of the illegals have been reduced coming across the border four trillion
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.560]  in the stock market four hundred plus billion in new jobs a million new jobs but the federal
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.320]  reserves come out and said we're gonna pop the bubble so we see open economic warfare against
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:23.760]  america and i have a stack of headlines here where trump warns of dangerous low in russia relations
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.360]  trump's plan to fight isis with putin isn't just futile it's dangerous that was in february isis
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:37.280]  is now in less than two cities and has basically been defeated and of course our military five
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.360]  years ago made a deal with russia to start defeating al-qaeda and isis and countermanded obama
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.720]  so the real russia connection is that russia morally with our military said no one began
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.960]  to crush these wahhabist groups we have that trump will win the election i remember all that
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.800]  the bot showed it now the same bot show he's as popular as ever but the polls all say he's super
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:11.680]  unpopular as al gore and as clapper and brennan go on tv and say there will be a coup in the next
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.280]  few months we're not waiting for impeachment or this stupid grand jury they've convened in the swamp
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:24.400]  so joining us till about 45 after is alexander dugan he's a best-selling author researcher
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.080]  started one of the most influential political parties in russia and he wrote the best-selling
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:40.320]  book the fourth political theory geopolitical.ru or 4pt.su and he joins us i really appreciate
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:47.680]  him joining us today to talk about all this and and to understand why this hollywood hate russia
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.760]  so much and hate america because i've talked to top hollywood producers they say that it's a hatred
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:12:00.480]  of christians and why naturally do we see as i had see patrinic on a few days ago an alliance
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.760]  between the united states and russia would be common sense in the world today the resources
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:12.000]  the christian culture the rise about to be three billion muslims in just a decade we're at 1.5 right
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.560]  now uh the globalists have allied with the most radical forms you can see the math of where this
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.600]  is going so we should naturally be allied but that's not what they want they want to make russia the
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:30.880]  number one enemy they want to paralyze the president where if he doesn't accept all these
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.640]  soros operations to destabilize and overthrow countries around russia and in russia that he's
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.760]  a russian agent he can't even go to dinner at the g20 and sit 30 feet from putin and wave at him
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:49.520]  they go oh my gosh you waved at him another secret meeting at a g20 meeting this is crazy now the public
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.360]  isn't buying it in polls but the deep state doesn't care they're using it as the excuse to prepare
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:02.080]  a cog overthrow ladies and gentlemen this is a dangerous dangerous time and trump warns this new
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:08.400]  low is dangerous for the whole planet as we need russia to deal with with korea and so much more
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.640]  so alexander thank you so much for joining us alexander duggan geopolitical.ru you've got the
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.920]  floor my friend let's go through who the globalist are what their aims are why they hate the united
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.120]  states and russia so much and is there any way to stop them before they trigger world war three
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:38.560]  hi alex i'm really happy to to be broadcasted in united states because i think that your station
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:45.280]  and your channel and your heroic struggle is a unique unique possibility unique momentum
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:55.440]  to to to say the truth that nobody wants to hear and first of all i think that globalists need
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:04.240]  enemy but not the right enemy because the the right enemy of globalists are they themselves
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:15.840]  because they are going to destroy humanity to exchange the humankind by artificial intelligence
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:25.360]  by kind of cyborgs and they try to to destroy all kind of links of the humanity with its
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:34.880]  essence and that is in the distance that is the very very negative absolutely negative satanic plan
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.760]  and they need in order to keep attention elsewhere they need some enemy and they have designated
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:53.440]  russia as enemy number one it helps for them to deplace attention from the real crimes they
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:04.000]  commit and in the case of tram that is trying to reaffirm reassert america and to regain its
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:14.000]  almost lost popularity and the greatness restored the greatest they try to intimidate him by
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:25.040]  completely false accusation and hoaxes of russian intervention in its elections so they globalists
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:31.520]  they try to control everybody they try they want to divide the people and the countries
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:40.720]  not because some of countries or regimes are wrong or commit some horrible acts but because
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:48.480]  in the agenda of globalists they should be exposed as such because they serve for their
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:59.440]  creation of global world government and russia plays here the role of of the neck of the enemy
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:08.960]  of global enemy when our president is very democratic and very reasonable very very realistic
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:18.560]  pragmatic leader but he refuses globalization he refuses world government he try to he tries to
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:27.760]  to defend to affirm to conserve and reaffirm and strengthen russian sovereignty that's all
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:37.440]  and that is why they hate us and they try to use russia against tram in order to to limit his
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:47.120]  liberty to limit his freedom that was that that strategy used before of the election and now
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:56.480]  president trump he is obliged to to to say i have nothing to do with russian i didn't
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:08.240]  uh mean that thing uh meeting putin and so on and so on that is idea to to um deprive american
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:16.560]  president of its freedom and liberty to create independent and sovereign politics of his own
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:24.320]  country absolutely alexander duggan is our guest he's one of the top cultural leaders
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:30.480]  with the resurgence of russia uh really to its roots from research i mean i would even say pre
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:36.960]  you know xarist basically christian uh you know european uh western slash eastern roots coming
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:43.520]  together and the globalists are absolutely insanely hateful of russia and i've done an analysis
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:50.000]  of putin he's been reforming he's been cutting back the corruption he's been arresting the oligarchs
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.040]  he's been empowering programs for the family he's been promoting christianity he's been promoting
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:02.480]  sovereignty and he's been exposing through national shows uh not against technology but how
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:08.160]  technology is being used to enslave people by the technocrats and has been opposing the wicked plan
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:14.880]  of devos that is anti-american anti-russian anti-human and quite frankly now we see more of this from
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.720]  trump but this isn't like something he got from putin or he got from me this is the truth of what
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.440]  we face so let's talk about vietnam air putin himself and why the globalist hate him they're
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:31.520]  also obsessed with him it's leaked that uh i mean uh hillary's obsessed with him basically in love
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:37.200]  with him uh in in the wiki league she was just beside herself uh meghan kelly behind the scenes
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.160]  began it was shuttering with sexual pleasure basically uh whenever i'm serious when she talked
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:50.080]  about putin i mean why are they so obsessed with putin so i think the putin uh he plays
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:19:00.880]  the role of um of supporter we in russian christian orthodoxy have idea of a greek concept of
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:09.040]  supporter uh in greek katechan uh the some figure symbolical figure icon that's a defender
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:16.880]  yes defender defender exactly uh in greek that that means exactly supporter but defender that
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:25.760]  is right the right word and this defender is the last obstacle of uh coming of antichrist
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:34.480]  that not the dog that doesn't let antichrist uh regime to be installed on the planetarium level
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:43.120]  and putin uh is obstacle for globalization for fulfillment of the wicked plans of globalists
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.640]  and by the way i agree with you and they say their technocracy their one world government
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:53.920]  that putin's in the way now trump pops up and the only truth to american russian collusion is
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:59.520]  i sense the same spirit of humanity not wanting to be enslaved and and it's really the spirit of
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:07.200]  christ all over the world is rising up against this antichrist spirit exactly exactly that
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:16.800]  is a metaphysical battle not only political manipulation and trump represent uh more or
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:23.440]  less the same line he he has no context with putin he had he has no collisions with russia
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.680]  for for more than that i but metaphysically metaphysically they see the force trying to
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:36.000]  destroy and enslave and turn us over to radical islam and so metaphysically the enemy sees them as
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.720]  the same because because it is the same spirit yes and that is the truth in all that because
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:51.360]  they are more or less on the same on the same side of the battle but this battle is not political
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:59.120]  that has nothing to do with short or superficial interests national interests and so on the battle
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:06.240]  is much deeper than that in putin plays here the role of defender defender of christian
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:15.840]  civilization of tradition society the defender of human nature because it globalists try now to
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:24.080]  to replay this nature bar they're they wage war against common sense yes yes exactly and what is
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:33.520]  important i have got information that russian oligarchs they have a kind of supported financially
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:44.320]  hillary so uh that that was completely opposite to the the thing the globalists pretend uh russia um in
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:51.600]  material world economically you are still infested by the same globalist we are yes yes exactly we
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:22:00.400]  have as well russian swamp and this swamp has uh helped to hillary to win and that was the failure
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:09.040]  but ours on the spiritual level on the metaphysical level we all of us russian people and our president
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:18.880]  myself we were on the side of trump but that was purely in the world of ideas technically russian
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:27.040]  oligarchs much more supported than the subvention hillary and that is the paradox they use trump
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:35.360]  to be manipulated by russia in the situation when themselves they were supported financially by
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:42.640]  russian oligarchs that represents the same globalist network as in united states so now
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:50.800]  i think they try to put the conflict between our great nations in order to to create a kind of
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:57.920]  struggle a kind of fight against the false goal against in the false scenario now we should be
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:05.840]  united in order to to fight against globalist elite that tries to tries to manipulate russians
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:12.080]  as well as americans we are on completely our peoples are on in the same and the same on the
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:21.280]  same side side of the front line and the globalist understanding that that will signify the end for
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.000]  their plans that try to divide us i know you started the very popular nationalist movement
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.240]  decades ago and but the media sometimes can twist things but i remember seeing reports five ten
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.280]  years ago that you were kind of a spiritual advisor to trump uh i mean not to trump to putin
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.920]  uh that that that that you know he'd read your books and thought that they were interesting
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.440]  i just want to try to get an idea for somebody that actually knows putin but also lives in russia
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.120]  about the real mindset of putin because people say oh he's this former kgb guy or whatever but we
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.600]  know he was there during the reforms kicking a lot of the globalist oligarchs out getting your
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.040]  sovereignty back the proofs and the pudding separately i read that he was baptized as a child
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.360]  his family was part of the large russian movement that was crypto christian that you know kept the
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.640]  faith and continued on and you judge a tree by its fruits today he's been a huge supporter of
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:20.640]  bringing a orthodoxy back to russia and bringing the birthrate back up and and and you're proving
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.520]  he wants life fighting against all the abortions fighting against the destruction of the family
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:32.480]  that's what putin's doing not killing babies like the globalists are pushing so so i mean how true
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.040]  is that that you're a high-level advisor to putin i know you don't want to brag about it and specifically
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.480]  a spiritual advisor and can you give us a view into the mindset of latimer putin and his worldview
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:53.840]  first of all latimer putin has his own worldview that is not so much ideological it is the kind
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:25:04.640]  he represents more or less what russian people think he represents russian soul he is not so much
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:14.960]  ideologically following some special kind of theory but he is inclined naturally for conservative
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:26.560]  vision he is christian he is very proud of russian history he feels himself first of all russian
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:33.920]  that is very important because that means that he doesn't feel himself globalist he
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:43.600]  doesn't feel himself a kind of cosmopolitan he represents our culture our people and he
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:50.800]  he doesn't stop this feelings this emotion and our and our country he is not ideologically
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:58.800]  national he is rather realist and pragmatic in his in his politics he is very pragmatical very
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:07.680]  rational i would say rational man but he is russian and that defines his inner and deep and that is
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:14.080]  exactly the same way trump is so it's a return to common sense a return to cultural nationalist
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:23.760]  with a christian base yes so that is the real similarity between him and trump putin is could
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:32.720]  be considered to be russian trump as well as trump could be considered american putin not because
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:38.800]  they are accused of authoritarian rule or something like that they're individually very different
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:45.120]  but they reflect what our people want they're not out to get their country they have a sense of
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:50.640]  roots to the nation to the culture they're not soulless globalists who notice have never have
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.920]  children are totally about destroying anything independent anything family because they're
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:03.520]  satanic trump and putin you're saying are not satanic absolutely because now to be normal to be
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.720]  natural that represent a kind of challenge that represent a kind of heroic act because globalist
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:19.680]  they control mass media global media global economical corporation they try to to impose
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:26.480]  on the humanity not only on russian people or american people on the humanity they try to import
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:33.520]  their own agenda they're our values that has nothing have nothing to do with normal christian
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:44.960]  traditional human values that is completely postmodern black strategy to to destroy humanity
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:53.280]  it replaces but some some other species so they use in that all kind of radical movements for
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:01.120]  example they use not only far left groups as soros does but as well radical jihadist groups
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:08.960]  they try they create the false goals they they try to oppose the people and nations but their
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:17.920]  goal is against normality and people and trump they are normal they represent not ideological
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:24.080]  special ideological circles or special world vision they represent the peoples and that
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:31.520]  very important they they could be called populist but populist in the positive way because populist
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:38.880]  is the person that reflects what the people wants while the majority of the people exactly they're
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.800]  not elitist trying to change the programming of humanity god system and play god they are living
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:51.760]  in it and are part of it and so that's why this our artificial synthetic world government transhumanist
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.920]  movement has openly declared war on men and women they're they're teaching in america in schools
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:04.080]  don't have men and women it's hurtful to others they are in open warfare saying humanity's ugly
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.600]  that they're gonna replace us when we come back i want to get into your book i want to get into
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.800]  the subject you want to cover with the american people and also get your take on what is it like
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.800]  to watch what they're doing to trump uh because you know putin rightfully said there is a war
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.760]  against trump by the deep state it is going into high gear they are publicly on tv saying they're
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:27.600]  getting ready to killing which is meaning they're normalizing it so there's not riots uh if if they
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.760]  do kill trump i mean the sky's the limit clearly they're planning a war with russia uh it is just
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.120]  beyond psychotic meanwhile you've got them blaming russia for north korea when it's the clintons that
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:44.080]  gave the missiles and the reactors to north korea uh we're gonna talk about it all with alexander

[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:25.280]  of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.040]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and

[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:38.000]  exact same oligarchs and groups that russia was controlled by for 80 years and major universities
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.240]  brag about that admitting that globalism is a form of modern cultural and spiritual colonization
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:51.040]  by devil worshiping pedophile ranks i mean you look at hollywood you look at the globalist you
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:57.520]  look at the very same groups that run hollywood in 1917 doing the bolshevik revolution taking over

[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:10.720]  stuff it's the very same spirit and communist china to a great degree has been under this for
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.280]  60 something years and it's somewhat coming out of it but it's it's just a nightmare scenario

[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:49.040]  that first identified that he's even trying to keep don jr out of politics and defending his dad

[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:34.080]  alexander dugin uh advisor to uh president putin over in russia best selling author
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:40.480]  leader of a uh nationalist party that's been growing the last few decades somebody hated by msm
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:46.000]  i don't want to say he's like the alex jones over in in russia but the media is always attacking
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.880]  putin kind of through him saying look what alexander said and of course misrepresenting and look
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:55.280]  you know this is the crazy advisor to putin kind of the same thing they do to trump
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:02.000]  just knowing that dugin represents a big base of smart informed russians that know what's happening
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:08.160]  and have a nationalist global view and understanding the real threat so it's not that we're plagiarizing
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.800]  each other that we're saying similar things he wrote a lot of this 30 years ago i was
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.720]  familiar with his work till about 10 years ago it's that we're seeing the same thing
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.680]  we're seeing the same thing so alexander you've got the floor the next 10 minutes let's let's
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.360]  roll through your book the fourth political turning that's been translated into english and
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.880]  many other languages and uh any other predictions or advice for president trump and his supporters
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:43.040]  so um i think that first political theory um it is something that is beyond uh liberalism
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:50.240]  communism and fascism so my idea uh when i have started to develop this um this political theory
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:58.960]  uh is precisely that uh liberalism communism and fascism are not enough we need to to to
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:06.320]  to search the different approach in order to resolve the crisis is in our in order to oppose
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:15.120]  globalism because globalization is a kind of very special uh special ideology that tries to
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:26.240]  to to cut all links of human individual with collective identity with uh charge with nation
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:35.040]  with people with ethnic with tradition and to this gender as well the gender politics is that
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:46.560]  um now actual weapon of the same globalist uh ultra-liberalist um theory but when we start
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:57.600]  to create to oppose to liberalism we are falling into the trap we are either uh are going or uh to
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:05.360]  uh communism that is false completely because it's the branch of the same roots or uh we uh
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:13.600]  i'm bracing the kind of nationalism or fascism that is as well the wrong way so and uh globalist
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:18.800]  they use this attitude because they accuse everybody who is against them to be or
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:28.000]  or whether either communists or nationalists or fascists or communists so in order to to answer
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:39.360]  to this attack ideological attack of liberals and globalists um i was my friend french philosopher
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:47.440]  alan debinois the leader of new rights so-called new right movement in europe we have uh elaborated
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:55.360]  uh force political theory that is against liberalism against globalization first of all
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.320]  and that is it is essence at the most important core of this force political theory but at the
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:11.600]  same time we uh we refuse being qualified as communist or fascist or to be communist reading
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:18.400]  your book isn't it traditionalist common sense pro-human being what we are and transcending
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:25.920]  all the fake political labels they use to confuse people more or less but what is important now that
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:36.800]  the battle is is between the natural human being and artificial creations of the modern europe that
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:45.520]  is exactly the devil plan to destroy the human essence of the humanity and replace the humanity
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:55.040]  by cyborgs by artificial intellect intelligence and so on but in order to bring the the robots
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:05.920]  in our life they turn the humans into the robots and that is why they try to cut any kind of links
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:13.680]  and ties with the normal human traditions with the religious world vision with
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:25.040]  normal gender or sexist and all kind what makes us human because we are human because
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:33.760]  we belong to some some community traditional community organic historical community so and
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:43.040]  when uh the liberals they try to cut all these ties and after that because the human will be
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:50.720]  already robots or completely identical with robots they could be easily replaced by natural
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:57.120]  exactly they're preparing us in their own words to interface with a system that's designed to
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.520]  destroy us but they're going to tell us that we're about to transcend but first they have to make the
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:07.120]  world so ugly and incentivize us joining with their system that's why they want to put us into an
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.600]  artificial system first so that we don't recognize my increments that were being killed exactly and
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:22.320]  they accuse us to be conservative akai because we defend natural values because for for them
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:28.560]  nature is something that should be overcome that should be should be controlled should be destroyed
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:38.640]  finally and force political theory it is a kind of superstructure over this natural protest
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:48.720]  over this populist revolt because this revolt it is on the base of the feelings of that something
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:55.680]  is going wrong and force political theory tries to to clear the way the vision for the future
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:03.680]  because um that that is very that is a danger when we begin to to struggle against liberalism
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:11.840]  we very easily we are going to the old and in in official in effective alternative as
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:21.520]  communism or fashion so we need to to create to imagine new kind of anti-liberalism that shouldn't
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:27.280]  be communist or fascist that is the essence of force political theory and that is precisely as
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:37.600]  you have said the only way to save that the human essence from this globalist globalist strategy
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:44.720]  that but um we have on our side the absolute majority of humanity but in the political
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:55.440]  globalist elite we are minority so the people like Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump are minority
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:03.120]  that's in the in the political circles that represent absolute majority of the of the
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.040]  humanity that is that we have a minority in government and power structures a majority
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:15.360]  and the people worldwide know prima facie common sense let me ask you this then i mean basically
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.960]  it's a pro-human movement but the globalists call themselves the humanists but really they're
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.880]  trying to end humanity in their own admissions so i mean it's almost like we need a real pro-human
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:32.320]  movement and it's going to become clearer as they try to displace us with robots with machines
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:40.640]  that this is just a grip of crazy people so that is that is very important things because
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:49.600]  we need to revise what human is now the human is in the center of of discussion because the
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:59.200]  continuation of the same globalist strategy will signify in the next time in the very very near
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:07.760]  time to all the humanity the end of the human and that idea of globalists they they try to
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:17.520]  replace the humanity by post-human by transhumanity without notizing that the idea is that there are
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:26.160]  no witnesses there there's a process is so-called natural process the progress the development
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:33.360]  and so on that is something that is going by itself that is not artificial that is normal
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:40.400]  that is natural but that is not normal at and that is not natural that is the kind
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:50.560]  deliberate strategy and they and they try to eliminate the witnesses i think that that Putin
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:59.360]  and Trump are two witnesses of what is going on they and they represent the the peoples and they
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:07.440]  are encircled by globalists the situation you have described in your show when Trump is encircled
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:15.280]  by deep-state groups or globalists per globalist personalities is exactly the same as in Russia
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:24.320]  so if we represent Russia as full-scale Putin's rule it is not correct Putin is isolated in the
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:33.680]  personality encircled by the by the people they are more or less the same as in in in American
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:39.120]  political elites and that is the problem uh that is because they're weak because top globalists
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:43.440]  will threaten they'll get your family they don't anything and most people are cowards and go along
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:49.760]  with it and in closing that's the that's yeah that is there have been groups that have always
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.160]  tried to dominate and totally enslave humanity and now they've got the machines they believe they
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.440]  can do it because they want to play god they don't like the fact the psychopaths that other humans
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:05.360]  aren't totally controllable and seek for freedom like a plant seeks the sun and so that's why they
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:10.880]  want to end humanity because they believe we're incompatible with their vision this is the main
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:17.040]  issue and i look at the traders that join the system the john olivers and people who clearly
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.240]  aren't totally evil like hillary clinton and i look at them selling themselves out can't they
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.440]  intellectually see what they've done don't they have a struggle within themselves to defeat this
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:33.360]  evil when it's admittedly so evil and it's admittedly so anti-human don't their ancestors
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:39.440]  their very genetics cry out to resist it what are these people missing that know this is an evil
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:47.200]  master plan and join it believing their winners when it's obviously so anti-human and is a lie
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:52.560]  and that they're conning themselves the only way to win is to fight this they're delusional
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:48:02.320]  why don't they understand that their idea the idea of globalists or what is human is completely
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:12.400]  wrong but now they little by little they already stop to appeal to the humanism and they appeal to
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:22.320]  post-humanism or trans-humanism it is more in the mood of of the progress so the humanism
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:35.360]  belong to us and they they they use this world rarely now because humanism that is too limited
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:42.960]  and their opinion by human nature and they try to transcend to transgress human nature on our
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:49.120]  shoulders idea absolutely it's always the same the spirit that possesses them says kill humanity
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.360]  and I'll give you the keys to everything when we've already been given the keys by God but we
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:49:00.080]  have to go through the steps and it's pure evil we're facing but the goodness is I believe humanity
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:06.480]  is beginning to awaken from a great slumber I think a new turning is happening just in in
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.480]  brief Alexander do you agree with that Dr. Alexander Dugan and then I want to invite you back for a
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.800]  full hour you can send us exhibits if you'd like to do a whole walkthrough of your book the fourth
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.400]  political theory and share more with us but just where would you say we are in this fight briefly
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:33.040]  so I think that now the idea the image of the defender that represent that the final obstacle
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:42.080]  to an antichrist to come it is very very good sign of our struggle and in that situation
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:48.800]  there is no difference between the West and the East between Europe and Asia between United States
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:56.240]  and Russia we are all in the same in the same struggle it is first of all spiritual struggle
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:04.400]  that is the struggle for the meaning of what is human because they have us they make it they've
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:12.560]  made usurpation of the meaning the semantic core of what is human right they're assaulting the very
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:17.840]  core of that which shows how alien this is and the great litmus test is someone for life is someone
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:24.400]  a lover of humanity or someone a hater of it and we have to understand that that is the litmus test
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:29.600]  for for for any of these people are they traditionalist because you'll always notice
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.160]  any Christ spirit is always anti-traditionalist it's always trying to twist what humanity is
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:40.800]  Alexander Dugan thank you so much doctor for joining us I look forward to speaking to you again soon

[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:33.040]  he's a he's a Psy Hirsch and his sources are incredible I mean I can't even keep track of
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:39.600]  all of his not predictions because when we said previous is out Kelly's in it wasn't our prediction
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:46.080]  coming through we have sources and I just got a call before the show saying stop being so specific
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:51.360]  I've not been the enemy already knows but we'll just leave it at that and notice so msm doesn't
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:55.280]  attack us anymore about our sources they just try to ignore it and they have watched them post
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.200]  article last week going okay Cernovich and Alex keep guessing a lot of stuff but you know they're
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:04.240]  just they just guess a lot of stuff so they get lucky uh yeah right well here's Cernovich a
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:11.680]  month ago White House head of personnel to purge Trump supporters from the staff here it is now
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:18.480]  this week purge McMaster fires two uh bannonites on national security council for criticizing
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:25.040]  globalism and it's all happening a info wars band they don't let the anybody give it to the
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:29.520]  president they say if you do you're fired because they don't want him to see articles
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:36.800]  where Al Gore's on tv saying they're getting ready to kill the president or where bannon uh
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:45.360]  you know is out there defending him or Breitbart is or we have people like Brennan and Clapper on
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:50.560]  tv talking about a coup coming they don't want the president getting that info and I know people
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.360]  that have talked to the president at length the president doesn't know any of this stuff folks
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:59.520]  he basically only watches Hannity now he's so busy they don't they don't have him surf the
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:04.160]  internet at night anymore he's getting national security briefings joining us is Mike Cernovich
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:09.920]  from medium and of course twitter and facebook mic uh wow where are we right now in this ongoing
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:17.040]  purge against liberty lovers and the preparations for a coup I mean it's bad McMaster as I started
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:23.280]  out in april he started purging anybody who was wrote remotely america first anybody who actually
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.800]  cared about america he had said that we make we need to get rid of all of the the trump people
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:35.360]  and bring in obama holdovers and then he said you can't even call people obama holdovers
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:40.800]  so right now we are in a war for the future of our nation and McMaster is the greatest
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:46.800]  national security threat facing america day one you let it all out you've been completely
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:55.440]  on target let's go over it right so I noticed that occasionally people would be fired on the
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:00.320]  unusual pretext so they have security clearance is pulled and actually you and I began developing
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:06.240]  this story way back in april because what we noticed is if he couldn't outright fire a person he
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:12.560]  would pull that person security clearance which effectively sidelines anybody at the nsc and
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.560]  then I started to notice a wait a minute robin townlee was a war hero why did he have his clearance
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.960]  pulled and I started calling around and really working you know doing real journalism rather
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.840]  than just doing what most people in media do which is blindly repeat whatever they're told
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:33.200]  people go oh yeah McMaster is going to get rid of anybody who believes in america first who believes
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.240]  in america is pro trump he wants to purge all those guys so he's taking away the security
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:43.680]  and by the way I should add he's been in the news admittedly through public affairs and other
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:50.560]  publications saying get cernovich shot him down stop cernovich uh stop info wars were now being told
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:56.400]  I mean this is a creepy guy who thinks he's the president and he is obsessed with stopping you

[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.960]  sources about how much they hate us and how they want to shut us down and how they want to get the
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:01.600]  president how they're preparing a coup against him uh and you know how they're trying to basically
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:07.920]  just affect it where uh no one resists when they do killing and then you read where they're firing
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:13.440]  anybody that ever wrote an article against globalism and and and just to see how big master
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.800]  trump couldn't get anybody to take the job till he got big master and trump's only problem is
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.200]  he doesn't understand that that some of these generals can be benedict arnold's what do you
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:28.560]  know about kelly what do you know about the other guys are they all on board uh with this i mean
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.840]  trump didn't even know till folks talked to him a few nights ago that mr president they say they're
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:38.560]  going to remove you in the next month two months and it's not going to be uh judicial it's not going
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.840]  to be the congress uh they're planning on a sudden removal sir a coup and the president's like well
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:49.600]  where is this get me that info and then you try to get the info to him and it black holes they're
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:54.080]  they're redirecting the emails the phone calls i mean i'm sorry i just can't shut up about this
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.960]  go we're in the middle of something beyond any movie like sort of it yes so you and i have been
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:04.560]  squeezed out so what i can tell you now so trump used to read my stuff and listen to your stuff
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:10.720]  kelly has stopped that the only person now that can get to trump is hannity and that is why there's
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:16.000]  a massive campaign now to have hannity um fire hannity's a campaign they're trying to do anything
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:22.160]  including framing him for misconduct to remove him so that's right right now son hannity is one of
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.840]  the most important people in america because he's the only lifeline we've got the president and the
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:32.720]  president's acting on it and kelly's like it's horrible he watches hannity and then does something
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:38.480]  about it right exactly two of the most important people you know other than you obviously in info
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:45.040]  wars sarah carter and sean hannity right now they are the ones you know sarah carter breaks
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:50.160]  really big stories she goes on hannity and talks about him trump is getting that information now
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:55.680]  the very important stories from sarah carter and sean hannity so the media is going after
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:00.400]  hannity very hard the deep state is going after hannity they want to get him kicked off a television
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:03.840]  they're going to do anything they can to stop and the good news is limbaugh now admits there's a plan
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:07.760]  to kill trump so everybody's getting hardcore right now and people should be getting hardcore
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:13.040]  well laura ingraham is tweeting about mcmaster remember you and i have been talking about
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.840]  mcmaster since april early april nobody else want to talk about it now it's the number one
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.040]  story on breitbart and we're not tooting our horn people need to know why they hate us because
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:29.120]  sernovich and myself are patient zero sernovich particularly uh in fact get him first you know
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.320]  i'm joking it's just this is not fun to be super preeminent in this but it's our duty we're doing
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:40.960]  it of course i'm joking but but this isn't a game right in the adl is going after me claiming i'm
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.320]  doing code word of antisemitism they're trying to wind up a nut yeah yeah exactly but meanwhile
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:53.120]  mcmaster has been purging jews from the nsc one guy he's jewish he went to bar mitzvah in israel
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:59.280]  he had adam lovincher had a security clearance pulled where is the adl so he's been getting rid
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.400]  of all kinds of jewish people and pro-israel people but they're going after me and ben garrison
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:10.240]  cartoons because we're telling the truth about soros a nazi collaborator but it's really starting
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.400]  to backfire on them where they're even calling holocaust you know survivors who had families
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:19.520]  that were survivors they're calling them nazis now i mean this is getting to be crazy yeah like
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:25.280]  lucian wintrich he's a grandson of holocaust survivors forward magazine created a list of people
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:30.400]  they added me on the same list as the alatola community i was i i can't you we're now in the
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:35.040]  world of pure farce wait but what they're really trying to do is get us murdered there's no reason
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.200]  to put me on a list with the ai tola but but it shows how precarious mcmaster is we got preemus
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:46.960]  we got spicer who are far less worse we're going to get mcmaster that matter if i'm pushing daisies

[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.200]  going to kill the president month or two we're going to remove him i mean this is so sinister
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.680]  and a lot of people are going well i'm going to sit on the fence and fine you know let them kill
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.920]  trump they're going to go after everybody folks they know the country's awakening they're going
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:16.160]  to they're they're going they're trying to kill the stock market right now they're these people
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:21.760]  are criminal we will defeat them if we stand up and have honor and i got to say i've been mad at
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:28.240]  some of the republican talk show host but rush limbaugh laura ingram people like michael savage
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:33.840]  i've been mad at him but people like john hennedy they're saying world government they want to kill
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:38.480]  the president they hate america they're with that they're with radical islam they're planning to do it
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:43.440]  now it's a deep state coup you've got lou dobbs coming out saying clear and present danger all
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:50.240]  saying the same term i i used signaling and i know the president is signaling and we understand
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:54.560]  so again though they're really going to try it just like i tried to steal the nomination
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:59.520]  just like i tried to block it with the faithless uh you know electors the good news is they're a
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:05.280]  bunch of failures and the real deep state that actually does the killing is to a man basically
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.720]  not for this the problem is they're still going to attempt it how do you see them doing this sir
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:15.280]  and i agree we should organize rallies all over the country and one big one there's google headquarters
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.600]  here in austin um i know they're trying to draw me out to go to one of these events and i know why
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:26.000]  but i just got to do it uh but i it's just it's just so crazy the war we're in and people later
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.800]  even if we win or lose are going to look back and wish they'd done something baby wish you'd
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.480]  done something just like patrick henry said because we're in the thick of it turn of it
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:39.120]  so we're going to macadam well yeah if they ban us from youtube that's when trump will be killed
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:43.760]  there's no question about it so prior number one is and i know i know that the people on the right
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.080]  are people like you don't like to march and do protests we have to we don't have any other
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:52.400]  choice it is life or death they're going to kill us they're going to kill him they're going to kill
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.880]  everybody destroy our livelihoods destroy our families destroy our nations we need to come up
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:00.640]  with oh and that's why they got all the top left is having the post writers saying their physical
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.080]  attacks coming they say we've got our guns we're going to kill you and they're allowed to do it
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:08.000]  they're weaponing up they're loading the what they don't know how to use them and that's what's crazy
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.760]  i've war game once they start this they're we they're going to be devastated and they don't
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:19.120]  understand the humid and the patriots and the veterans have been making a list marking it twice
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:24.160]  who's naughty and nice they don't they think we kicked their butt in the election i mean if there
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:28.320]  is a civil war started but 20 things going to happen then we're going to macadam well if there's
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:34.000]  a civil war it'll be bad for them but it's bad for everybody you have daughters i have daughters
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.080]  innocent people are going to be harmed so what we need to do is before we can let the left
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:42.880]  start the civil war we need to just march on these tech companies show up let them know we're not
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:48.080]  going to tolerate the censorship fight back hard people should protest in front of zuckerberg's house
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:56.400]  in kawaii let's do it i'm down we got to get everybody out there and we just have a big huge
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:02.000]  thousands of people all and we should have a hundred thousand dollar contest it's not about the
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.280]  money but i want to be a prize a hundred thousand dollar contest in the next week for whoever can
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:14.000]  get it legally and lawfully at google open houses or or or facebook events live and have a legal
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.960]  lawful stunt to expose what they're doing use humat on the ground to let them know what we're
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:24.480]  going to do in the information war offensive what do you think i said well i said if we go to google
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:29.600]  i'm going to sternovich media you know maybe you can do this too we'll get buses we'll have a
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.000]  we got to do it alex we have to do so we have to get the people out there it's not enough to have
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.240]  people doing videos i don't care folks they are going to blow the president's head off they're
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:43.600]  going to bomb him they're getting ready so we yeah we need people showing up so whether that's a
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:48.160]  contest or can you believe how crazy the left is and and and all these globalists i mean they're
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:54.640]  really nuts yeah we we we have to so we have to get people out there knocking on doors holding
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:00.240]  signs protesting at these corporate offices so yeah let's think of a contest and we'll make it happen
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:04.480]  you know it's this weird coming of age of all these beta leftists that they really want a blood war
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.440]  they've really never been in one they've never even been in a fist fight and they're literally
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:18.160]  just frothing for this existential coming of age deal yeah they're delusional so yeah i want to go
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:22.880]  there you know again let's talk figure it out we need to make it happen we need to do well it's
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:26.400]  just like bill clinton's a rapist contest change the election we've had some others that have been
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:31.280]  affected but we need everybody just to turbo charge just get on live tv folks just call in to
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:36.880]  c-span just rattle their cage because they mean to kill the president leon macadoo thank you mike
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.200]  serenity you're on in 43 minutes thank you Alex wow leon macadoo with us for the rest of the hour
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.920]  leon macadoo at leon macadoo again great info wars reporter there with her grandma taking care of her
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:51.120]  in florida on an extended hiatus we love her joining us and the reports she's been filing leon
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:55.120]  what do you make i know you've got a bunch of stories you want to get into suicide texting case
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.880]  sets bad precedent we're going to get into a bunch of news on that subject but what do you
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:04.480]  make of just the insane level we've gotten to all because trump wants to repeal obama care and cut
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:10.000]  taxes right well we knew that they weren't going to take this lying down and they tried to put out
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.640]  the dirty dossier on trump they came up with nothing and typically they're not going to put
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.720]  people in positions of power unless they can be blackmail they can be controlled they can threaten
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:23.680]  their family and so i really think that that's what's going on with trump right now and i don't know
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:28.320]  if he brought mic master in thinking that it was going to help legitimize his administration
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:34.480]  but who better to legitimize a coup and haul off the president than your three star general
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:40.320]  national security advisor that's what i think is just insane who is he positioning around him
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:45.120]  the very people are going to legitimize the coup and you have the country celebrating the
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:50.320]  fact that we might be experiencing a deep state coup i think they're on the news normalizing it
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.760]  and saying we're going to have to remove him and it's not going to it's going to be sudden there's
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:56.720]  not going to be impeachment and just not going to let that always they're going to let the president
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:01.680]  get up there during impeachment and defend himself it'll make him a martyr they're going to put him
[02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:06.160]  they're going to either hit him with drugs that bring damages him and say he collapsed and then
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:11.600]  have this whole new emergency election thing or they're just going to bust a cap at him right and
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:16.400]  there's no way now that he would be able to fire a Mueller because of course he's got this grand jury
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.960]  going with this russia probe he doesn't have his attorney general there to protect him to ensure
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.960]  that this russia probe stays within the confines of the original investigation we've got an article
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.960]  up at info wars that they're actually interviewing people who are tenants of trump so this is
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:38.640]  definitely going beyond the scope of the original investigation absolutely and so they're gonna find
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:44.480]  something to either blackmail trump with or to legitimize his takedown and have you
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:48.400]  harass enough tenants you're going to run into some mentally ill person that doesn't like prompt
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:54.560]  that'll say oh yeah i'm a russian spy they gave me the i mean it's total garbage they're out there
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:59.120]  getting their fake what this is everything together just a bunch of slobbering ugly evil

[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:46.240]  of this are poor liberal democrats who trump's trying to help but they don't want to be helped leon
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:52.240]  they want to be slaves well it's just so incredible it kind of underscores that it doesn't matter the
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:57.360]  information that is being shared it's it's the source of the information that's being targeted
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:02.000]  if you're going to share a drudge report link then you can't you're not allowed to do that now
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.880]  it's because it's so powerful drudge report was so powerful and had such an impact on the election
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:12.160]  info wars mike zernovich all of these people we just had the new york times put out an article
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:18.080]  about the the new right and how they're paul joseph watson's photo was the big picture there on the
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:23.760]  new york times basically lamenting the fact that they're so powerful on the radio and youtube
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:28.400]  and that the left has not been able to take over these markets so we've got to regulate them and
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:34.320]  then destroy them ultimately since the left is unable to to gain traction in these markets
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:40.080]  and since the right has they have to be destroyed watson said that that was an absolute bat signal
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:48.320]  to youtube to start the purge when i sent him that article leon remember right after the election
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:54.640]  they got mad the media did at facebook that had done so much censoring and said you didn't do enough
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:59.360]  he goes i promise i'll do more like you're a hero when you do more censorship again we just joined
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:06.160]  us this end breaking eric trump uh donald jr too were seeing it happen with the president they're
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:11.760]  censoring their twitter and not letting them share drudge links to the good job numbers coming in
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:17.040]  saying it's sensitive or hateful then i saw another article saying the president's not allowed to
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:21.920]  talk about the economy and another weird statement saying that's illegal just like he's not allowed
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:28.240]  to have dinner with putin at the g20 that's illegal i mean these people are crazy and then
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:33.440]  they actually come out with an article going huh looks like uh russia and the cold war is ramping
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.720]  up again what happened gee i wonder if it's been the months and months nearly a year now of absolute
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:43.600]  russia hysteria it's like they're creating all this chaos and then when a nuke goes off they're
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:48.560]  going to go huh i wonder who pushed that button and by the way eric it's not just interesting
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:53.360]  that they're censoring the job numbers it's criminal it's unbelievable i can't believe how
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:30:02.640]  calmly eric takes all this we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:06.720]  network
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.960]  staunch anti federalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would become a monster
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:17.040]  that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but that it would become a
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:22.640]  tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:28.160]  not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:33.440]  but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:38.240]  patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the
[02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:43.440]  transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything the government does
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:48.400]  at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:53.120]  even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked back and said
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:57.840]  when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different liberty sir
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:04.560]  was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:10.080]  liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david night it's not just our water we need to filter it's not
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:14.480]  just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:20.560]  the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:25.600]  the same team based right here in america that brought you the elective pure groundbreaking
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:30.720]  water filtration systems have now developed elective pure breeze whether it's your home or
[02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:36.080]  office yo it's yourself your co-workers your family your children to the best job you can
[02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:41.040]  to purify your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:46.320]  doing things that mitigate or avoid most the toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:53.360]  the elective pure breeze would be a steal at 300 400 500 dollars one of these systems can keep 800
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:57.600]  square feet incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally putting in throughout my house
[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:03.440]  replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:10.800]  revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com as most of you already know i am a voracious consumer
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:16.080]  of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came
[02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:22.080]  across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:27.920]  in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:33.360]  bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:40.400]  develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood
[02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:47.120]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just

[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:23.520]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war now let's be clear the big tech giants
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:29.440]  are on record the last six months saying they're preparing strategies to bring in chinese net style
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:34.480]  censorship to america and you've had facebook google and others working with the kindness chinese
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:41.920]  along with microsoft to help perfect new systems in china now eric trump and others are getting
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:46.160]  censored more and more they're not letting positive tweets come to the top of trump's feed they've
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:52.720]  been not letting people like trump tweets it'll just artificially make it go to a negative so it
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:57.840]  doesn't just block you it it falsely votes for you kind of like the electronic voting machines
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.400]  that voted for hillary in those five states she stole that's been confirmed she tried to break
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:09.120]  into six others because she's the madame president newsweek said so well now we notice in the live
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:15.040]  feed of eric trump that it said this has been blocked as sensitive or controversial or a racist
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:21.200]  material and leon and jack was subject to a right shot down with us the rest of the hour right now
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:31.440]  and then boom jobs jobs jobs eric trump there's the censored tweet a link to the drudge report
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.160]  with mainstream news articles admitting massive job increases a million plus new jobs in the last
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:43.920]  six months 200 plus thousand in just the last month and then all the other good numbers and top
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:49.520]  analysts saying you know even though the feds raising rates the trump recovery is barreling over
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:55.920]  this and then greenspan comes out and says no it's going to crash they're trying to keep obama
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.960]  carrying to crash it they're trying to stop tax cuts to crash it they're failing because of
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:07.520]  prosperity and people voting with their dollars and taking action and i want to salute you america
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:13.840]  this is so incredible this is so incredible to be in the middle of this epic fight and zack has a
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:20.000]  great point he's one of our producers this is a classic shadow band youtube announces we don't
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.840]  like what you say we're going to put you into phantom zone nobody can see your video you can't
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:29.920]  share it but if you've got the exact link well then you can give it to your little group that's the

[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:40.960]  see what you tweeted youtube takes steps to censor controversial aka conservative content
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:46.320]  we're going back to leon macadoo here in a moment we've all got to use twitter and facebook to point
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:50.480]  out this is happening so they've always gone after really little people and just kicked them off
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:55.200]  because they didn't have a voice now they're going after the biggest trump and if they can censor him
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:01.760]  remember the headlines twitter made ban trump remember that the president may be banned off twitter
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:07.040]  well then everybody else can be banned they're coming they're coming they're coming they're

[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:21.600]  criminal info is coming out with debbie washington hillary and all of it and now they're trying to
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.640]  get a justice department and it'll prosecute and they're fighting for their wicked corrupt evil
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:33.760]  lives right now so pray for trump pray for info wars pray for an awakening but also take action
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:39.520]  does that give us your take on this incredible news we just tweeted it at real alec shone's
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:47.360]  screenshot of the tweet of a drudge link to articles about the jobs numbers nothing positive
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:54.480]  about the president can be said it must be blocked they'll block anything including official jobs
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:37:00.960]  numbers that's what they don't want you to know is the good news it's all lies that he's lazy they
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:05.200]  didn't get anything done that's the cover of the new fake news week that he didn't get anything done
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:14.160]  he's lazy zack don't make your point well we're gonna fade zack up here in just a moment always
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:17.440]  wanted to get the crew on but it's just a herculean effort i'm not allowed to do
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:24.400]  okay let's get him up to the podium we're gonna eat this once and for all here on air
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:28.000]  okay i don't care what it takes the we're gonna start getting the crew on the show we're just
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:33.600]  gonna do it so i put a full studio in there seven eight microphones cameras whole nine yards this is
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:38.480]  the final piece of the equation we're breaking the will of the gremlin in that room right now
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:42.720]  okay yeah let's go ahead zack make your point okay so the point i was trying to make before
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:51.600]  was the fact that it's the perfect example of a shadow band if you go overhead and notice that on
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:58.400]  the page itself if we go ahead and put up the the tweet if you notice that when it's shown up on the
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:03.360]  drudge report the link itself you could see it because whoever the account is that took the
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:09.440]  screen grab is following him normally a verified account proves that someone on twitter will always
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:15.840]  have their content shown on twitter but if you notice that when you go to the other screenshot
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:19.200]  hold on a second let me switch over to it sure go ahead and do that we're gonna do this together
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:26.000]  now we're gonna get the crew and use that studio yes so you see there it's not followed and it's
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:31.040]  blocked off so it's a perfect example of if you're not following them on twitter even if it's verified
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:36.560]  or not you'll notice that it's completely blocked so you have to be a follower so it's a way of them
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:40.960]  to only show that only a certain group of people are allowed to see that specific tweet and first
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:47.440]  they segregate you into these electronic ghettos yeah and then they completely shut you off exactly
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:52.800]  so it's just one of many ways that they're going to use just kind of like a siphoning of the echo
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:58.560]  chamber system that they were using in facebook where the news was getting cycled to be specifically
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.640]  for you the same thing with the twitter the users are going to have tweets that are only going to
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:07.120]  be seen by people that only follow those specific because if we show democrat party cult members
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:12.080]  that the economy is coming back and then he had a good repeal bill uh or that good things are
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.160]  happening or that isis was defeated they're not allowed to see that they're supposed to see news
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:20.640]  week where everything's horrible and nothing's good and the president's a failure yep and the
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.640]  worst part about it is that this is just about jobs it's i mean it could be worse if it was about
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:29.440]  extremist content or about anything that was racially charged but this is literally just a link
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:32.960]  on the top left of drugs and they're testing testing testing because they don't want us to
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:38.560]  challenge all their lies land macadoo we've got psobic here with this white house sources
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:43.280]  info wars has been completely banned giving trump info wars is banned anybody that speaks out against
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:48.560]  globalism is fired anyone who ever wrote about globalism is fired that's in Breitbart uh today
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:53.440]  by McMaster what do you make of this this just shows that all the talk of coup that they say
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:57.760]  is coming soon they're getting ready for the big censorship once they murder the president
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:03.200]  right well of course and we know the obama administration set the precedent of targeting
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:08.880]  journalists coming after leakers um james reizen actually put an article out back in December saying
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:14.240]  look if trump starts to target journalists well we have obama to thank for that and i know at the
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:18.880]  time we were really i myself i was really concerned that it was going to be hillary clinton who was
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:24.400]  going to be the the next dictator in charge that would be taking the precedent set by obama and
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:29.840]  taking it a step further to target her uh her political enemies and her enemies there and the
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:35.680]  press which would be us and of course the dark heart alex jones um and and so now we're seeing
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:40.800]  the cnn and these others they're kind of rallying around McMaster and putting out these stories about
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:46.640]  how he is now being targeted by the alt right and the conservative media and so they're rallying
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:53.360]  around McMaster um so it'll be interesting to see if indeed this purge happens of of the new
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:41:01.040]  media of the alt media how it will be celebrated by the free and independent press there uh that's
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:06.800]  supposed to be helping our country helping to check those in power will they celebrate the fact
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:13.280]  that the deep state and these other agencies are able to shut us down or will they stand up for us
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:18.080]  and do what's right and stand up for the first amendment exactly i came to twitter late we only
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:21.440]  got about two million followers on our different accounts right now that's still pretty good but

[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:03.600]  jack posovic stay right there leon macadam jack posovic of course launched one of the biggest
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:08.800]  grassroots trump organizations he works up there on the capital started to do more and more work
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:17.760]  with us and jack posovic is on uh twitter at jack posovic p o s o b i e c or citizens for trump dot
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:23.920]  com and he's got the intel serna which broke the big purge months ago of mcmasters that's now
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:30.000]  confirmed now the news story by jack posovic white house to staffers if you like info wars or milo
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:37.920]  you're fired and i confirmed uh that kelly's firing anybody that it draws to hand the president a piece
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:44.400]  of news saying quote he'll go with anything like the nsa was spying on him under obama which has
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:50.080]  been admitted so they are isolating him right now jack posovic the censorship we're seeing more
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:55.760]  censorship the last month than we've seen the the last decade and this is clearly just a test
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:01.360]  they are accelerating they are accelerating it exponentially as i predicted they would ahead
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:07.120]  of the coup they say is coming jack posovic you're absolutely right alex and this is a story that
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:12.640]  would actually landed in my lap uh a few months ago i wanted to run it down because it sounded
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:17.760]  completely egregious to me he said why would the white house when it's dealing with so many leaks
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:23.200]  of classified intelligence when it's dealing with so many uh some of these interns that are recording
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:27.440]  private speeches of white house officials like jared kushner leaking that to the media why would
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:32.160]  they care so much about what the interns and the lower level staffers are posting on their facebook
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:36.800]  okay you like something by alex jones you shared something by info wars why would that be an issue
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.120]  and now we're realizing that the reason they're clamping down on this is because they're trying
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:47.200]  to keep it away from the president they don't want the president seeing this news they don't
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:52.560]  want the president seeing any information outside of what they give to him outside of what they
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:57.280]  show they can demoralize him he's not been demoralized the spirits are high but the intel
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:02.720]  is they wanted to moralize him cut him off before they start drugging him and they don't want our
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:07.760]  intel about the coup getting to him as well they're desperate to cut him off from his base
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:13.120]  that's exactly what it is alex and thankfully he still does have that cell phone he still
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:17.920]  does have communications with other people that he can get out to but anyone in the staff they've
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:22.400]  found that it's been supportive of trump a trump loyalist or that is you know this is a way they
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:27.120]  can find you they say we are going to go to your social media pages we're going to go to your
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:30.560]  facebook's we're going to go to your twitter's we're going to see who you're following we're
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:34.720]  going to see who you're liking we're going to see here you're sharing this is how and on the flip
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:40.000]  side i kind of look at this from the perspective of this is how scared they are of independent
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:46.080]  new media and real journalism this is the power of the truth because they have to do anything they
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:51.200]  can they're spending 24 hours a day trying to prevent the truth from getting to where it needs
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:57.520]  to be because that's how much of a threat that info wars and independent new media journalists
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:01.680]  are to these deep staters and the coup that they're trying to perpetrate on president trump
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:06.400]  and let's talk about treason leon i want you to pop in on this this is breitbart yesterday
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:09.840]  a pop official and national security council was fired last month by national security
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:14.320]  advisor h. r. mcmaster reportedly after he argued in a memo that president trump's administration
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:19.040]  is under sustained attack from globalists and islamists well i mean that's the groups that
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.680]  are out there funding domestically against him uh peter higgins a former pentagon official who
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:28.320]  served in the nsc strategic planning office the director of strategic planning was fired
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:33.280]  on july 21st the atlantic first reported that's the globalist enemy uh mouthpiece
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.120]  celebrating bringing down a high-level patriot who's telling the president the sky's blue he's
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.160]  under total globalist islamic attack the globalists have declared war on him in all their main
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:49.520]  publications the memo was written in late may describe threats the administration by globalist
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:55.680]  bankers deep state and islamicists that mcmaster works with globalists and islamicists recognize
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:00.320]  that their versions to succeed america both as an ideal and a national political identity
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:06.720]  must be destroyed totally true oh my gosh get rid of him immediately he's a good person let's
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:10.960]  continue right here like why do they why do they want info wars band folks because we're americans
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:14.560]  we're not cowards and we're not going down without a fight higgins was called the white
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:18.880]  house council's office two weeks ago and asked about the memo oh my gosh we caught you it's not
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:22.400]  that he's a you know with the russians it's that he's a patriot later that week he was told by
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:27.520]  mcmaster deputy he was losing his job which they never told trump about the memo compared what
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:31.840]  trump administration was facing to a malice insurgency well that's what they model it after
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:37.840]  in malice insurgencies the formation of the counter state they built their counter state see
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:42.640]  their shadow government is essential to seizing state power the memo said functioning as a hostile
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:48.640]  complete state acting within the existing state that is a memo on mcmaster but we must get
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:52.720]  this to the president because the left is aligned with the islamist organization at local national
[02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:58.400]  international levels recognition should be given to the fact that the they seamlessly uh
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:05.760]  interoperate through coordinated synchronized interactive narratives yes this is the truth
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:11.200]  this is the key transmission that would bring them all down right here leon macadoo we've got
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:17.840]  to get this to the president isn't it incredible that that they would fire him immediately and
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:22.000]  other people as well that would actually be trying to get this type of information out and
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.240]  obviously there's something going on that is against the president's agenda when there are
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:34.880]  continual leaks 126 days of his presidency and 125 leaks have happened some of those actually
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:40.080]  threatening our national security obviously there are people working against the president's agenda
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:45.840]  and it's quite frightening that we are totally aligned with radical islam it's everywhere exactly
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:51.600]  leon this is the whole plan this is the takeover and they're arming against us when they kill
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:56.800]  trap they're coming after everybody else sorry leon go ahead well and i was trying to find an
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:02.480]  article uh that i saw earlier this morning but it was it was like 20 people israel should fear
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:08.000]  more than linda sarsour and it was naming people that were actually jewish so you should jewish
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.200]  people linda sarsour family's in prison and then all the rest of it is good and she wants to have
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:19.280]  a jihad she's liberal she's good right and they've all aligned themselves with her maybe when she
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:24.640]  made her a little jihad comment everyone kind of quieted down senator have you seen the bbc running
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:33.280]  women in full burk is saying this is good except it i've got a bomb under here that was pretty weird
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:37.040]  well i mean it's clear they're going to make their run but i think they've been exposed i think
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:41.760]  they're uh jack i mean i think they've gone too far and the fact that everybody at the pentagon
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:46.000]  basically knows what this fellow was just saying game over man go ahead kill the president well now
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.320]  that they've fired him it's actually backfired because now more people are reading the memo that
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:54.560]  he wrote it's actually getting out to a wider audience because they went and fired him now
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.800]  people are saying oh what's in the memo that fired him globalist and jihadist yeah that's what i
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:02.880]  believe too why is this guy fired that's right i think i want the full memo published on info
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:08.560]  wars this is the memo that scares me master and the traders this memo will bring down the traders
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:14.880]  mcmasters doesn't want you deep state doesn't want you to read this memo i mean talk about traders
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:20.880]  you've got mcmaster granting susan rice her same level of security clearance at the same time trump
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:26.960]  is actively saying we need to find the leakers i'm being surveilled oh no you're not that's a big lie
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:31.760]  how are you gonna lie to the people no they they wire tapped trump tower and so at the same time
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:37.440]  the trump trump is saying this to the american people mcmaster is saying i don't think susan rice
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:42.480]  did anything wrong i'm gonna i'm gonna allow her to still have her same level of security clearance
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:48.160]  it's it's insane why are the neocons surrounding trump what do they have on him what's happening
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:52.880]  well again david admit the memo as i've said on air without the memo the bolshevik same globalist
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:59.360]  operatives they created a state within a state for years in russia only controlled uh moscow and then
[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:03.280]  they got everybody through time to turn in their guns through propaganda then they slaughtered millions
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:08.480]  of people so they admit that it is a malice strategy that's what the weathermen taught obama
[02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:14.160]  they are all carrying out a malice strategy with deep staters and cowards like mcmasters and others
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:18.560]  that trump pick they get approached by deep state they get scared and they join with it because they
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:23.040]  want to play golf and do whatever while we're being carted off to death camps and you know potbelly
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:27.040]  liberals are kicking our brains out and raping our families literally that's what the left talks
[02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:30.880]  about how they're gonna rape us how they're gonna murder us how they're gonna have all these little
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:36.080]  nobodies this is their existential dream of power is to run around defecating on everybody
[02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:41.280]  well people need to look no further than venezuela and what happened that's the exact
[02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:45.280]  same thing that they did there just several years ago they got rid of the guns everyone
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:50.560]  turning your guns because we want to be a peaceful nation and then just about a year or so later we
[02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:56.800]  saw the total collapse there where the government was actually purging people who are eating dogs
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:01.440]  and giraffes out of the zoo purging them because they don't have the guns or anything to fight back
[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:06.800]  they've got the whole corporate media they got hollywood they got the vatican they got the eu
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:12.000]  and they claim the russians are the reason that we're doing this we recognize the globalist enemy
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:16.080]  and it knows there's a total awakening so it wants to violently bring back the clock
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:21.920]  purge everybody they're never gonna get away with it this is america and you may have turned a lot
[02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:26.960]  of people into brain dead zombies but it's like saying this is sparta there is still a giant contingent
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:32.560]  of people of every race color and creed that are information warfare defeating you and if it goes
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:37.280]  physical once they kick off that alarm bell they're going to run false flags try to make us look like
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:42.160]  the bad guys we all know it's them we're going to move forward against the globalist and against
[02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:49.280]  their operatives and we are going to sweep and clear the enemy go ahead besobic yeah they only
[02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:54.160]  shows their hand every even so more when the minute you start telling the truth they try to slap you
[02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:59.200]  down the minute they start sharing anything that has a headline that's anti them they try to ban it
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:04.080]  they are going to be forcing at their hand so much that they're showing us they're exposing us
[02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:08.320]  what their actual plans are they're come they're trying to ban us they're trying to shut us down
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:12.960]  they're trying to fire people for speaking the truth that's only going to mean we're not the
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:20.080]  radical saying all this they're on c-span but the aspen institute with wolf blitzer brennan
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:25.360]  and clapper saying a violent overthrow is coming in the next few months don't wait for impeachment
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:30.400]  we're now moving and then al gore goes on the late lake show and says the same thing i mean they are
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:37.280]  they are doing it yeah they're doing it but they don't understand that the american people that
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:42.640]  voted for donald trump voted against them voted against these things and they don't understand
[02:53:42.640 --> 02:53:48.880]  that the massive amounts of people that are sick and tired of washington dc and the elites
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:54.400]  vastly outnumber anyone that they have on their side no one is listening to these people anymore
[02:53:54.400 --> 02:54:00.000]  and no one is going to uh obey these people when they're told to do anything further what's the word
[02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:04.320]  this mcmaster guy i know he couldn't get an international security guy he got mcmaster
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:08.240]  because he was in a successful tank battle or something and then i look into mcmaster
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:13.120]  and he's got all these i mean i understand i can hardly run my operation i got great people
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:17.280]  but it's it's hard to get people you know to to run i could imagine having four thousand employees
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:22.320]  and then millions of people under you like trump but i mean this mcmaster and people i mean they are
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:28.320]  just absolutely countermanning the president all the time doing whatever they want purging
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:33.680]  patriots now let's get more into the specifics of how you learned about what how they're using
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:40.000]  info wars or milo as a litmus test right so one of the things that i heard was this first started
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:46.080]  out by hearing it from people uh this uh the staffer by the name of janet toner now she works in
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:50.320]  the presidential personnel office under a guy by the name of johnny de stephano who i whose name
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:54.880]  i know has been heard on info wars quite a bit uh for being a never trump or a former john bainer
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:55:00.560]  staffer who is in there uh this woman janet toner she is also a member of the establishment her
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:05.600]  family is very tied in with the bush dynasty uh her husband has worked for cnn has worked for the
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:10.560]  bushes on numerous campaigns she's been department of education department of energy she's tied to no
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:16.000]  child left behind the whole nine yards so why is a person like this with that kind of pedigree
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:22.480]  even put into a place where she's overseeing the hiring of junior staff at the white house the
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:28.160]  hiring of interns being in charge of that she has actually been heard uh personally speaking
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:33.760]  speaking out against alex jones against mylo enopolis against info wars in the white house
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:38.560]  saying to people just almost wantonly that if you're liking them if you're sharing them we are
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:43.680]  going to dismiss you this is not the place for you interns and other staff have been described has
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:48.000]  said that it's described as a chilling effect because these are people who are coming in there
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.840]  many of the times you know they they support the president they support their country they want to
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:55.760]  do a good job they're someone who's coming out of college they're thinking oh my goodness i'm here
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:00.720]  at the white house i just hope i do well and then they're wondering why are you worried about my
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:05.200]  facebook so much i'm not doing anything bad on there yet maybe i have a party picture or something
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:09.360]  like that but why is me sharing news with a headline that says info wars dot com on it
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:13.680]  such a threat and let's be clear now they won't let the president share his links now they won't
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:19.200]  let his son when it's jobs numbers it's incredible jack mesubic i'm going to come back to you in a
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:23.760]  moment leon uh there was other points other stories you wanted to get into let's spend a few minutes
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:27.920]  also shifting gears into this other story that you gave me that was so interesting
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:34.240]  yeah and let's not forget i just wanted to just bookend what jack was talking about it was the
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:38.640]  reality lee winner they didn't check her social media accounts when she was this huge bernie
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:45.040]  supporter and i just leaking intel so you know it's not the people who actually care about this
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:49.440]  country that are trying to systematically take it down from within um so they need to take a
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:54.800]  long look at themselves but i also wanted to talk about a story that happened yesterday the
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:57:00.160]  20 year old girl that encouraged her boyfriend to get back in his truck and finish off the
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:04.640]  suicide that he had been telling her uh she urged her boyfriend via text message to go
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:10.160]  ahead and carry out a suicide she was a juvenile at the time so the judge gave her a more lenient
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:16.160]  sentence but now what this means words kill it's not just your actions that kill but this
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:20.720]  sets the precedent that now words that you put out there political correctness because now you
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:24.480]  can joke and say fine if you think there's too many humans kill yourself well somebody kills
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:29.120]  themselves now i go to jail because i use that as a verbal flourish again you're right that's the
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:35.280]  political correctness now right or trying to say uh the guy that went into the pizza shop they tried
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:39.840]  to pin that on you where do we where do we stop where does this end where they can say oh well
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:44.880]  you encourage that so now you're going to go to jail they're setting a very dangerous precedent
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:50.480]  here even legal analysts say this should have never even gone to a judge um yeah thanks for
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:54.960]  giving her this is pure judicial activism because a lot of times boyfriends and girls or whatever it's
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:58.080]  well known i'll say i'll commit suicide if you don't come back to me that's a standard deal
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:02.800]  she's like oh yeah go finish it off then not knowing it happens and now she's gonna 15 months in
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:06.880]  jail for not you know oh you're gonna commit suicide yeah right go go ahead do it i mean i mean you
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:11.200]  know that's one way some cops will say to have somebody not do it is like you're begging them
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:15.680]  to come off you go okay fine go ahead and do it i'm gonna cry and say you don't love me and come
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:19.680]  that's actually a tactic sometimes they do jump the cop gets in trouble but the point is
[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:24.080]  is that it doesn't matter it's your free speech well think about all the people i mean i hope
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:28.880]  George Soros kills himself i do i'm sorry i don't wish any harm upon him but i want him to stop
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:33.120]  hurting people i'm sorry leah go ahead well think about all the people that are on the internet
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:38.080]  encouraging people who are live streaming encouraging them to kill themselves or commit crimes or
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:43.120]  drink and drive i mean this is a lot of people could be affected by this ruling absolutely i mean i
[02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:46.720]  hope all Nazi collaborators kill themselves or at least just stop trying to kill everybody else
[02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:51.760]  absolutely all right we'll be right back to finish up with jack wasubic and then Mike Cernovich

[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:39.360]  they're going for broke they wouldn't be engaged in censorship of this level on youtube facebook
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:44.720]  twitter of the president's son of the president himself of jack besovik mike sternovich everybody
[03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:49.200]  else if they weren't meaning to go for broke and they're saying don't worry a big event's coming
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.040]  we're going to remove the president it's going to be sudden and our sources have talked to the
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:59.680]  folks in congress others they say no it's going to be violent it's going to be physical and then
[03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:04.640]  we're just sitting here watching them get ready it's crazy jack besovik what is your word you're
[03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:10.960]  getting in dc on this well uh clearly they're isolating the president ahead of this what is
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:16.880]  your take your view your intel your gut level uh on the situation right now well there's two
[03:01:16.880 --> 03:01:21.840]  levels right now and it seems that both are fighting over the uh then the culprit of the in
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:27.360]  the current state being hr mcmaster so he's being one of the highest level plants the deep state
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:31.200]  is had in there and make no mistake that's essentially what he is when they got rid of flin
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:37.200]  they made sure to get their man in and it was hr mcmaster we've now seen him purging uh trump
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:42.320]  loyalists up and down now i'm hearing different things from different people i'm hearing some
[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:47.360]  people saying that hr mcmaster's welcome has been worn out and he's on you know he might be looking
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:53.520]  at a promotion and maybe moving out of the white house i'm also hearing that he's going to stay
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:57.920]  he's been told by uh by members of the administration that they don't want to see too much turnover
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:04.000]  they just lost ryan's previous that he's going to go to but my hope is my hope is that general kelly
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.720]  the new chief of staff who was in there for previous i hope that he's are going to understand
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:13.920]  that hr mcmaster these decisions that he's been making are outside of the chain of command
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:18.640]  he's not going to trump for any of this stuff he's not going to trump for any of these decisions
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:23.920]  he's making he's making them unilaterally and the last time i checked four stars which is what kelly
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:28.320]  has had was more than three which is what mcmaster has plus he's the chief of staff he's the chief
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:33.040]  of staff right and he's the chief of staff so he outranks him in terms of that chain of command
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.800]  as well but even in the military hierarchy he doesn't outrank him so i'm hoping that there's
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:41.600]  going to be a nucleus there where he understands that this guy is acting unilaterally and that
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:46.880]  whether or not kelly is essentially understanding of the deep state construct the counter state
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:50.800]  which is trying to block everything that trump is doing he's going to understand that this is
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:56.320]  someone that's acting outside of the purview of the president and hopefully if we can use now we
[03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:00.240]  can't use facebook and twitter to get to get information to the president but we're going to
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:05.840]  be able to wait to use our encrypted communications dead drops if we have to we are going to get info
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:10.080]  worst truth into the white house into the president we're going to get it to the senior staff or
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:13.440]  we're going to make sure they know that these people are coming for them that they're making
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:18.400]  these decisions not in your best interest not in the interest of the country or the administration
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:23.520]  they're trying to curtail you they're trying to stop the america first maga movement and we're
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:27.680]  going to be doing everything they can we can to get that information to people that need it
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:34.320]  i don't know of a strong enough response in the information war to them openly saying kill
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:40.800]  trump kill his family overthrow him major publications saying co g coup the president
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:44.160]  that's why they're running this russian era to say oh we don't do impeachment we just kill him
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:51.440]  i mean what should trump do to brennan uh and people like that on tv saying this i mean that's a
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:56.480]  clear and present danger right there i mean i i just can't sit here and put up with this anymore
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:02.640]  yeah where is the special prosecutor for brennan for rice where is the special prosecutor for uh
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:07.760]  any of these individuals that have been caught leaking and unmasking where is the special prosecutor
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:12.240]  for all of the abuses of the intelligence infrastructure the intelligence community
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:17.280]  that we see now have come out starting in the obama administration and now being carried on
[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:22.480]  by the whole right briefly what do you make of this swamp thing i mean isn't it perfect that the
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:27.920]  the grand jury is being born out of the swamp yeah the grand jury it's a joke the people they're
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:31.360]  going to a grand jury there's an old there's an old saying about grand juries that you can
[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:35.920]  that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich if you wanted it to because they only hear from one
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:41.120]  side they only hear from the prosecution this is being done as a witch hunt and it's only being done
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:45.440]  because uh muhler doesn't have any facts or evidence of his own so he's going to say well
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:50.240]  i'm not indicting the grand jury's indicting based on the evidence sure exactly which is incredible
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:56.000]  all right jack was so big great job tell folks how they follow you on twitter yeah my name jack j c k

[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:23.200]  pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving

[03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:18.800]  four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment
[03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:24.320]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition
[03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:29.840]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[03:06:29.840 --> 03:06:35.600]  were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:42.000]  want to get out of here so cernovich has got a lot to cover a lot to break down but i just wanted to
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:48.400]  ask him this is so transparent and they're accelerating their fake investigation because
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:53.200]  they know trumps irrevocably damaging their globalist takeover they're trying to cover up the good
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:59.440]  economy since you were on uh giving us a prelude of what was coming up we now learn that eric
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:06.240]  trump's twitter linking drudge with just jobs numbers was called extremist and banned we've
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:10.080]  we've retweeted it at real alex jones i'm going to get paul to tweet it i hope you'll tweet it
[03:10:10.080 --> 03:10:14.320]  there at your great twitter account but i mean what happened what happened there i haven't heard
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:19.120]  that one yet yes they're just blocking uh not letting you read what's in the body of the tweet
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:23.920]  uh saying that it's sensitive uh you know it's bad this tweet's not available because it includes
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:30.000]  uh potentially sensitive content wow that's on your twitter account i gotta retweet that right
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:36.240]  now it really goes to show why we have to we have to show up in real time we have to start
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:41.920]  protesting we have to use more elinsky like tactics even though we thought we didn't want to
[03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:46.560]  we have to start showing up we can't trust talk about it on the internet anymore we got we got
[03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:51.920]  to show up in a big way human intelligence we got to get people everywhere all the time there's
[03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:57.760]  there there's not much time where people know me know that i'm not somebody who's a very frantic
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:11:03.760]  person i'm always grounded and i say that there is not much time not only for america but for
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:09.440]  trump's life and for our own lives i totally agree i mean what does it signify to you to have
[03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:14.640]  brennan and clapper together on the stage saying oh no blitzer we're not going to impeach
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:18.960]  see the next month or two we're going to remove him suddenly and then to have our inside sources
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:22.880]  in congress saying that a few days before and then to have them all of the news saying kill
[03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:27.360]  trump then have al gorgob things aren't going well with trump he'll be out in a few months
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:32.240]  everybody needs to be calm i mean these people are crazy and then they intend to declare the
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:38.960]  whole last election fraudulent have federalized homeland security have a new soviet style reign
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:43.760]  of terror with new elections this is what the democrats are going to do by being the party
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:51.760]  out of power and by people hating their globalism wow and not only that but the grand jury is proof
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:57.280]  that there's no evidence of russia collusion because mueller is now expanding the probe
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:03.600]  into finances whatever that means completely unrelated to the election tax records business
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:08.800]  records anything trump had done the reason is that's proof there is no russia collusion
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:13.680]  and for wars did not collude with anybody my service didn't collude with anybody we even
[03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:17.520]  include with each other we didn't even know each other until relatively recently so not
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:21.440]  only were we not colluding with anybody in russia we weren't even colluding among
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:25.440]  we just don't like a bunch of foreign banks trying to make us poor break down our borders
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:30.960]  in free speech and bring in authoritarianism you know we're normal americans yeah regular
[03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:36.960]  americans so-called flyover state the kind of people who talked directly to the working americans
[03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:41.520]  who can't pay their bills they have no hope the opiate epidemic the obesity epidemic
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:47.520]  the spiritual bankruptcy but so the grand jury thing is a very serious thing because it proves
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:52.560]  that mueller's investigation is now unlawful and unconstitutional because he's exceeded
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:58.160]  his job he was supposed to go after russia he cannot find anything about russia so now he's
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:01.520]  going to get a grand jury and i'll tell you what's going to happen and by the way they admit now
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:08.560]  it's finances it's it's his family it's his companies it's the whole campaign a huge dragnet
[03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:15.600]  going and talking to people at prompt properties to harass them and hopefully find something
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:20.880]  i mean can you believe this well that's the whole point because there was no russia collusion
[03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:25.040]  there there is nothing so what do they got away you said this you're a lawyer as well you said
[03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:28.880]  this three months ago so did roger stone it's all happening exactly as we knew it would
[03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:33.920]  happen yeah yeah no we predicted this would happen you can't find any actual evidence of
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:38.880]  collusion so here's the way a grand jury subpoena works you don't you're not going to find anything
[03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:43.600]  but they're going to try to set perjury traps with people so they'll say hey alex what did
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:48.960]  you have for breakfast and you'll say light cereal they'll go no actually you had eggs
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:54.560]  that morning you have committed fraud this is perjury we're going to uh charge you for that so
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:58.880]  the federal law is lying to a federal officer which isn't constitutional but that's what they
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:03.600]  always get innocent people on and it could be immaterial too that's what a lot of people don't
[03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:08.320]  know this entire Mueller group is democrats they gave 99.8 percent of their money to it
[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:13.680]  two of them were fired by trump right and the reason cnn won't have real lawyers on there
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:19.600]  to talk about these issues are because the truth is that if you lie to a federal agent or to a
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:25.440]  grand jury even if it's accidental even if it's not material even it's something about how many
[03:14:25.440 --> 03:14:31.040]  text messages did you get or how much money did you spend on lunch something that has nothing
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:35.040]  to do with the only answer to this is you twisted lie about everything i'm not talking to you
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:42.000]  no lord no i've told people that repeatedly that the only answer to a subpoena is thank you sir have
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:46.880]  a great day talk to my lawyer thank you have a great day talk to my lawyer that's the only answer
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:51.600]  for anybody the flip side to that though and they'll be our friend come on you're not the subject of
[03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:59.920]  this no don't destroy america on somebody else's time well you know actually we don't think there's
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:06.240]  anything about you alex that is dangerous we just have to clear this investigation but if you don't
[03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:11.200]  talk to us then we might actually think you're hiding something so do you have something to hide
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:16.160]  come on just talk to us we're good friends we'll have a cup of coffee a diet coke maybe a little
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:20.480]  barbecue wait wait why are you hiding to have something that's how they play these mind games
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:26.480]  on people yeah you guys are hiding your criminal activity against this country exactly keep pushing
[03:15:26.480 --> 03:15:31.920]  keep pushing exactly that's exactly so talk to my lawyer talk to my lawyer talk to my lawyer
[03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:35.840]  the problem a lot of people are going to run into you is that they are not wealthy enough
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:40.800]  to hire the kind of lawyers that you need for these investigations the lawyers that you need for
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:46.720]  this kind of stuff 500 to 750 dollars an hour 25 thousand dollar retainer just for the grand jury
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:51.920]  subpoena to go in there and to make sure that they don't get you into a perjury trap so there are
[03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:56.560]  a lot of people on the campaign who don't know they're gonna they're gonna fish for weak-minded
[03:15:56.560 --> 03:16:00.960]  people just it basically like they do with you know for fake informants and just have a makeup
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:06.320]  crap that and so trump what does trump got to do now because the word is it's not sessions fault he's
[03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:12.160]  under pure mutiny no one's following his orders no one's following trumps orders what it shows how
[03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:16.560]  scared they are that none of my articles or your articles get to trump they fear that more than
[03:16:16.560 --> 03:16:22.160]  anything because trump didn't even know that they talked about removing him from office until somebody
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:28.880]  talked to him two nights ago that he didn't even know they're openly calling for his death right
[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:34.480]  the answer is you have to fire Mueller now Mueller was appointed to investigate collusion the election
[03:16:34.480 --> 03:16:38.960]  involving russia the grand you should have done it weeks ago because now they got this bill where
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:44.080]  you supposedly can't do it he's got this stupid grand jury i mean that literally came out of the
[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:50.640]  swamp a big old fat alligator just spit this thing out exactly so you have to there there's no
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:56.080]  alternative now it's life or death he has to fire Mueller he has he what he should just do is do it
[03:16:56.080 --> 03:17:00.800]  all at three in the morning i want to learn dieted for all the stuff and they'd be in a bag man for
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:07.520]  uranium well that's what mula would do if they had any integrity the uranium deal the guys are
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:14.080]  clinton swamp thing the author book well yeah he was a bag man for her just like combi was the private
[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:22.000]  server umma says he's this iconic truth detector and they also say trumps lazy and they also say
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:29.040]  hillary's the president yeah i like how they say trump is lazy and then they go oh my god he's doing
[03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:35.440]  too much he's too chaotic you got to pick one either he's lazy in the open border devastated tpp

[03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:56.400]  lazy lazy yeah so sunday night he needs to at three in the morning issue an executive order
[03:17:56.400 --> 03:18:04.080]  parting julia pardoning julina sange and offering him refuge in america fire mcmaster fire muller fire
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:11.280]  margaret uh peter lane and brian hook in the state department and go for it from the public
[03:18:11.280 --> 03:18:15.840]  affairs whining about you insert of it keeps listing who our people are that are blocking
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:21.440]  all the trump people they even admit it knowing trumps not reading public affairs yeah yeah
[03:18:21.440 --> 03:18:26.320]  that's what's amazing too is how i i'm a journalist and i'm doing journalism and they're going well
[03:18:26.320 --> 03:18:31.040]  do you think you're harassing people wait you mean by writing them articles how am i harassing
[03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:37.040]  anybody by truthfully reporting about what's going on in the halls of power and why am i being attacked
[03:18:37.040 --> 03:18:40.880]  by other you know journalists when i'm the one doing journalism i don't go after people and say
[03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:43.760]  well why are you right of course they're not journalists i'm gonna let you take over here
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:47.760]  let's get this break see him more time what about cy hearst coming out going okay yeah
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:52.000]  seth rich is the guy i've talked to the fbi i've talked to home last year seth rich is the leaker
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:57.760]  they all know it it's all true i mean that's cy hearst yeah i don't know i haven't been following
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:03.120]  the seth rich stuff closely because so many other people are looking into it but nothing about that
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:08.480]  case would surprise me some people claim that he was with one of the awan brothers near around the
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:13.200]  time that uh he was murdered i don't know about that either there are a lot of great people looking
[03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:19.280]  into it though but with seth rich i'm being very cautious because i've been told that there are a
[03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:24.480]  lot of people feeding fake news kind of the same thing with pizza gate they're taking an investigation
[03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:31.040]  to one thing and they're ceding in false information in an effort to try to trip us up again so with
[03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:35.200]  with seth rich i'm keeping my distance a little bit because i do know that deep state operatives
[03:19:35.200 --> 03:19:39.360]  i agree i agree but he was shot in the back so it's okay to report on it we've got this thing where
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:42.560]  media tells us not to before you take over because i didn't do this last hour briefly

[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:39.120]  wow that explains it because those live streams that do 10 or 20 000 views all the time those
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:44.400]  those would do big numbers and sometimes you know 50 000 live our facebook does like 200
[03:24:44.400 --> 03:24:48.080]  exactly and and we put out the live one which they then try to claim copyright songs we always kill
[03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:52.320]  that and put out an edited down one because they'll even claim commercial music you know that some
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:56.880]  company runs for chevy you know oh that's our music from the chevy ad they'll hit it so so what
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:01.520]  we do is we we have to put out another stream with the ads cut out before the bots go back over
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:04.640]  and so our regular one gets about a hundred thousand it's just one of our little feeds
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:09.280]  and then you're right the repost gets about 20 000 and and and so they're shutting it all down
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:14.400]  well yeah well i mean your youtube the youtube live i remember because i'd watch the things
[03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:20.160]  it would be 10 to 20 000 simultaneous viewers just on the one youtube stream 10 or 20 000 people
[03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:25.120]  all watching simultaneously they just killed that yeah they said for punishment i can have to show
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:32.880]  people that the email they said for punishment um you you uh and they even told us specifically uh
[03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:36.640]  you know you're not to talk about sandy hook i can't even come on and say like i told me and
[03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:41.760]  kelly i think it happened they want to just misrepresent what i said put a straw man out
[03:25:41.760 --> 03:25:47.600]  and then not let me even respond wow they'll probably ban my channel just even saying and i
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:52.480]  i have no free speech on youtube now they've officially told me dude that is actually insane
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:57.120]  i that that makes total sense and that explains why well you got the document three months ago
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:02.960]  where they hired a company for millions to delist us man well that's devastating though i so that
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:06.960]  and now they want to make so now you can't live stream and now they want to make it so people
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:12.080]  can't even find your videos there you're gonna be putting some kind of ghetto or something well
[03:26:12.080 --> 03:26:17.760]  what i'm telling everybody is this this is really starting a new youtube channel grab our feed from
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:23.600]  info wars dot com forward slash show uh and then just restream it folks don't let them stop you
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:29.520]  yeah that's that's actually the way to do that's why i did the live stream right now is
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:34.800]  i figured well if i couldn't do it if i was done please please mike we think exactly the same
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:38.240]  effect i meant to call you a few weeks ago about this and ask you to put out our streams until i
[03:26:38.240 --> 03:26:42.960]  guess they ban you i don't care who does it i don't care about the month just like you monetization
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:48.400]  means i just want to be able to defeat them they're openly planning the murder of the president yeah
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:53.520]  there's actually a channel on youtube that gets more videos than i get and all they do is they
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:58.080]  take my videos with you and my periscopes and they upload them and i'm like good i hope you
[03:26:58.080 --> 03:27:03.440]  monitor them pick up the live stream i want everybody streaming the show okay yeah then
[03:27:03.440 --> 03:27:07.680]  we got to figure something out then this is this is bad out this is why they want to there's a
[03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:13.920]  military coup you you talked about that letter right from 50 democrats in congress said that the
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:19.120]  military should disobey trump and not not to listen to him i saw that it's just all tell folks about
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:25.760]  that okay yeah so i just thought i just saw this myself now there was a letter again from the senate
[03:27:25.760 --> 03:27:32.160]  this is the very top of my twitter feed now i just tweeted it 50 plus house democrats are urging
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:38.800]  the secretary of defense and the joint chief of staff not to comply with trump's chen transgender
[03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:44.800]  troops ban this is they're telling them to ignore it this is um you know that the your production
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:48.320]  team can find the letter it's right on my twitter that's total mutiny which is already
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:53.280]  happening the deep state already is in mutiny and already created their own shadow government now
[03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:59.040]  they're bringing it out with pr things like this to set the precedent for the public rollout yeah
[03:27:59.040 --> 03:28:04.720]  you can read the letter they're they're telling the secretary defense to commit a coup this is a
[03:28:04.720 --> 03:28:10.480]  coup you you the trump is a commander in chief love him or hate him vote him out but you can't
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:16.000]  tell them to disobey a lawful a direct order that is a as a crime by the way we've gone from don't
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:20.960]  ask go tell a few years ago to we're making him wear red high heels in the army and saying we're
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:25.280]  gonna have battle trannies it's meant to destroy the military as robots come in in five years to
[03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:29.600]  replace the troops the and this ties into the breitbart article a charming master fire national
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:34.080]  security council official for pinning memo on globalist how they've created a new deep state
[03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:40.640]  with the muslims using a malice insurgency model of a state within a state to then move forward
[03:28:40.640 --> 03:28:45.520]  with the overthrow of the president and because he exposed basically what the master is planning

[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:40.160]  of information it's gonna be used stone and own shroyer now but i agree we need more people in
[03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:44.960]  the war room we need to hire this guy he's been fired out of the white house and out of the pentagon
[03:29:44.960 --> 03:29:50.240]  for telling the truth we need him at the info war it's not a stigma working with us folks it's a
[03:29:50.240 --> 03:29:58.800]  badge of honor i'm gonna shut up let's turn this take over right now we're on the march the empires
[03:29:58.800 --> 03:30:10.000]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network james madison the father of the bill of rights
[03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:16.080]  wrote where an excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his
[03:30:16.080 --> 03:30:21.760]  opinions in his person in his faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we
[03:30:21.760 --> 03:30:26.560]  have an excess of power in washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we
[03:30:26.560 --> 03:30:32.640]  remove that power from washington to our local communities to the individual that is the ultimate
[03:30:32.640 --> 03:30:38.800]  concern the concentration of power the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders
[03:30:38.800 --> 03:30:42.800]  of this country it was why the anti-fetalists opposed the constitution they believe they put
[03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:47.280]  safeguards in the constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as james madison
[03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:52.240]  also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own
[03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:57.680]  governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives arm yourself with the information
[03:30:57.680 --> 03:31:02.800]  of what your rulers are doing of what the real constraints upon them are only then will you have
[03:31:02.800 --> 03:31:08.720]  the courage to nullify their actions friend for wars dot com i'm david night alex jones here to tell

[03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:45.440]  jones we got a lot to talk about today as you may or may not have known i launched a big new site
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:53.520]  called McMaster leaks dot com and McMaster facts dot com and what this is going to offer is sort of a
[03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:59.600]  clearinghouse about all the information about McMaster that the media doesn't want people to know
[03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:05.200]  about and i've already gotten a lot of calls about that website cnn called me about it the the
[03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:11.600]  anti defamation league has now accused me of anti-semitism because if you look at the image
[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:18.080]  on McMaster facts dot com you can see that i you know have george soros up there and they're saying
[03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:24.160]  well that's like a code word for anti-semitism because you know because me like when do i ever
[03:34:24.160 --> 03:34:29.920]  hide what i have to think when does anybody ever accuse mike cernovich of not sharing his opinion
[03:34:29.920 --> 03:34:33.360]  if i didn't like some group of people i would just say i didn't like them what are they going to do
[03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:38.160]  you know they always try to ban me and frame me for things i don't even do so they've said by
[03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:42.960]  having soros as a puppet for McMaster and portray us and then of course i have the soddies as the
[03:34:42.960 --> 03:34:49.120]  puppet for soros then this is some kind of weird code or whatever so i think it's interesting but
[03:34:49.760 --> 03:34:56.320]  the site has been a really big success i've been asked about it by every major news outlet newsweek
[03:34:56.320 --> 03:35:03.040]  is doing a report on it cnn is doing a big report on it and of course of course i'm the bad guy
[03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:08.800]  right they're calling it a harassment website i'm not kidding you you can't make this kind of stuff
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:16.560]  up they are saying that mike cernovich a journalist working out of his home in southern california
[03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:26.000]  who hangs out with his eight-month-old daughter with an iphone in a laptop is bullying hr mcmaster
[03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:33.600]  the national security advisor the national security advisor is afraid of me exposing him
[03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:40.000]  and let's tell you why he's afraid of me he's afraid of me because it's been reported now so i
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:46.240]  can say he has a major alcohol problem with every meal two martinis a full bottle of wine sometimes
[03:35:46.240 --> 03:35:51.760]  two bottles of wine he really likes california red wine so if you want to you know cozy up to
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:57.440]  McMaster who knows what kind of services you can get out of him if you bring him some california
[03:35:57.440 --> 03:36:05.360]  red now granted i enjoy a glass of tool wine and i myself so i'm not judging why i am two martinis
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:09.360]  and one or two bottles of wine is a lot of booze i mean let's just be honest if you're taking down
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:15.600]  two vodka martinis and one or two bottles of wine that's a lot of booze that isn't a few you
[03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:21.680]  know glasses that's gonna put you in bed at night yeah exactly right that's a real real tranquilizer
[03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:27.920]  and the bigger issue is that he is entrusted with all of our national security secrets so
[03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:32.480]  is he getting drunk and running his mouth well as a matter of fact he was again this is all being
[03:36:32.480 --> 03:36:37.760]  reported or it should be i don't know i maybe just scoop somebody i never know i because i know so
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:41.920]  much going on that i'm always you know holding back because i don't know if i'm scooping people
[03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:48.400]  but he gets really drunk and will insult and denigrate trump around anybody who'll listen this
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:54.480]  is his m o he's a total boozer total part of your which is again fine you know but if you
[03:36:54.480 --> 03:36:57.920]  want to be the national security advisor that can't be allowed because he gets patted on the
[03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:06.080]  head in dc i mean he is a true loser a true nobody a true pawn uh of patreus yeah and there's a lot
[03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:11.760]  of rumors too that he's engaging in um activities with a colleague that shouldn't be happening they
[03:37:11.760 --> 03:37:17.520]  they were seeing sharing a dessert with dinner so we don't know quite fully what's going on there
[03:37:17.520 --> 03:37:22.080]  but i've heard a lot of rumors which again could be a national security threat because that could
[03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:28.480]  make him subject to blackmail so we know he's a hard partier a big boozer likes to share desserts
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:33.280]  with a certain female colleague he you know they're spooning each other you know the lava cake or
[03:37:33.280 --> 03:37:40.640]  whatever and we know they like to bash trump so this is why cnn is going after me and the deep
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:45.840]  state is going after me they're they're saying oh cernovich is a anti-semite for having george
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:52.160]  soros is a puppet of the thawedies but wait a minute mic master has said that if you're
[03:37:52.160 --> 03:37:58.400]  jewish and you're pro-israel you cannot go to israel because he said that you can't trust
[03:37:58.400 --> 03:38:04.320]  jews who visit israel they might be a top security clearance risk because maybe there's by the way
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:12.080]  israel has officially listed soros as a threat exactly yeah soros is anti-israel that's the whole
[03:38:12.080 --> 03:38:18.800]  point but the soros is deep state and deep state is now targeting israel and targeting anybody who
[03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:23.040]  is pro-israel and that's what mcmass has been doing and that's because they've merged with the
[03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:28.160]  islamic group that's what's in this memo that mcmaster fired the guy over exact i mean rich higgins
[03:38:28.160 --> 03:38:33.200]  that thing was a work of genius you know and rosie gray of the atlantic got the scoop you know i was
[03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:38.080]  even told her i was very because she was interviewing me today for something and i even said like i don't
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:44.720]  get jealous often i'm glad that she got that scoop but i wish i to have that because that memo was
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:48.560]  powerful stuff i would have you know i really would have wanted to share that but i'm glad it
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:54.160]  got out through a mainstream outlet because then it really went through right so speaking of rich
[03:38:54.160 --> 03:39:00.160]  higgins there's an article i sent to the great production team i have been listed along with the
[03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:08.080]  itola community as a threat to the jewish people you cannot make this up the jewish forward daily
[03:39:08.080 --> 03:39:14.800]  publication has listed people who are a threat to jews and they're putting me in the same group as
[03:39:14.800 --> 03:39:20.880]  the itola community how does that make any sense right i don't even i don't even hardly talk about
[03:39:20.880 --> 03:39:25.920]  zionism or anything it isn't an issue i even talk about that much but it's mcmaster who is actually
[03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:32.960]  purging the nsc of all the jewish people and it's mcmaster who is discriminating against pro-israeli
[03:39:32.960 --> 03:39:39.280]  jews and telling them that you can't be here so i am now on another hit list by an anti defamation
[03:39:39.280 --> 03:39:47.680]  lefting organization and the article the forward magazine article says 19 people or 18 people jews
[03:39:47.680 --> 03:39:56.560]  should worry about more than linda sarsar i mean seriously think about that that they are now actively
[03:39:56.560 --> 03:40:04.320]  the forward is literally now a plo front yeah they're they're advocating for her and saying people
[03:40:04.320 --> 03:40:10.000]  like she called for jihad the overthrow of israel has family in prison in israel literally is funded
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:15.440]  by soros the nazi and then here's the forward these 20 great in fact print me that article i saw that
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:21.920]  this morning the 20th oh my gosh yeah so i thought it was a joke i didn't know that was a real publication
[03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:26.160]  i thought it was like the onion or something and then friends of mine were like no that's actually
[03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:30.480]  a real a real publication i thought it was the onion because no no no the forward the forward
[03:40:30.480 --> 03:40:36.240]  is the biggest jewish publication in the us is it really okay yeah i thought it was a satire site
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:41.040]  because they list me along with well they pretty much is now they call trump anti-semitic
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:46.240]  yeah bannon was on there sebastian gorka was on there several jewish people are on them i'm in
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:51.280]  there all the time and they're and they're defending linda sarsar who supports female
[03:40:51.280 --> 03:40:56.720]  general mutilation supports terrorism against israel views israel is a segregated state
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:01.840]  and an unlawful occupier and i thought that's hilarious you're on the list that's hilarious
[03:41:02.400 --> 03:41:09.040]  next to the ayatollah right that's why i thought it was a prank i didn't think it was actually a
[03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:14.000]  real website i go what i told a commandee that to me that was where you know when you troll you
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:19.520]  have to be subtle because if you troll too much you give it away and when they put me above the
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:24.320]  ayatollah commandee i go god this is like a prank website or something like that and apparently it's
[03:41:24.320 --> 03:41:28.160]  a real website well here's the good news i know i said i was going but i'm always sitting here and
[03:41:28.160 --> 03:41:34.160]  listen what they seem strong in some ways weak in others but they're freaking out openly calling
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:40.880]  for coups trying to have this fake swamp birth of this grand jury right out of the swamp they're
[03:41:40.880 --> 03:41:46.800]  never trying to hide it where does this go then i mean how are the globalists doing right now
[03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:52.800]  well they're they're hurting because that's why they're attacking us so violently and going after
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:57.680]  us so viciously because if they were if they were winning they would just leave us alone right if we
[03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:02.560]  were just random nobodies if we weren't important people but i mean they literally in bloomberg and
[03:42:02.560 --> 03:42:08.800]  ap admit they fear you particularly and your sources they they hate us they have a whole new
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:14.960]  comedy central show that's gonna air five nights a week about me misrepresenting who i am uh
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:18.400]  trevor noah has a new show a couple of days that they're announced coming out about me
[03:42:18.400 --> 03:42:24.320]  it's been in production for weeks they spent three weeks on this john oliver piece i mean what the
[03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:31.520]  well and who do you think is funding that the deep state as you know operation mockingbird
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:38.000]  the cia are the ones funding all exactly but it's so surreal don't they get the strizand effect or
[03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:43.200]  the the the sex pistols effect that they're trying to make us the dirty evil devil that no one's
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:48.320]  allowed to look at and then all it does is make us more avant-garde all week i get so many just
[03:42:48.320 --> 03:42:53.440]  like you do the high fives now are like i can't even walk down the street now every race color
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:59.200]  creed high fives every hundredth person says screw you russian hope you die you know but i mean
[03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:05.840]  i mean it's not working is what i'm saying well that's because most people fold most people don't
[03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:10.720]  know that as long as all eyes are on you once you have all eyes on you it doesn't mean what they
[03:43:10.720 --> 03:43:17.040]  said about you you now dictate the narrative and that is why to her credit um abby i think
[03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:23.680]  olsheimer she washington post i go wow this is actually a real article about alex jonesby
[03:43:23.680 --> 03:43:27.760]  now sure they call us conspiracy theorist or whatever whatever people they had to admit
[03:43:27.760 --> 03:43:33.440]  that we kept writing stories yeah exactly so i was like holy cow you know i got an honest
[03:43:33.440 --> 03:43:37.920]  journalism in the washington post about us and then new york times did an honest article on
[03:43:37.920 --> 03:43:44.400]  stefan malin you and paul joseph watson about how youtube is a new talk radio and so even the people
[03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:49.680]  who are you know younger and cover the stuff are starting to understand it and that is again why
[03:43:49.680 --> 03:43:53.680]  they want to get us all banned and shut down from oh you told me that's when we first you know turn
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:57.920]  to talk on the phone like a year ago but i've run into it now we're big reporters for big publications
[03:43:57.920 --> 03:44:02.400]  go listen i know a lot of what you say is true i hate it they rewrite it believe me we try to make
[03:44:02.400 --> 03:44:07.040]  it comical as a joke on the old guys that run this so a lot of us we see these articles that sound
[03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:12.000]  like a joke it's because they're actually sabotaging it for us because they feel bad
[03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:19.600]  yeah they don't most of the people that i'm meeting the under 30 people i'm actually optimistic
[03:44:19.600 --> 03:44:26.640]  about journalism america of the under 30 under 35 people because a lot of them they want to do real
[03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:32.080]  stories they're tired of going through twitter and finding a tweet and going oh my god do do a big
[03:44:32.080 --> 03:44:36.000]  story on what they find on reddit or what they find you know on twitter or something they want to
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:41.520]  actually do human interest stuff talk to people see how people work meet their family find out of
[03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:47.200]  people are conflicted find out the pros and cons they want to do the really deep kind of rich
[03:44:47.200 --> 03:44:53.360]  look into people in the media the people under 35 they're bored with uh with well let's expand on that
[03:44:53.360 --> 03:44:57.040]  though when you know when they came out the new york times article a few months ago a big cover
[03:44:57.040 --> 03:45:00.720]  story about how dangerous info wars now big we are a bunch of censorship started they pulled some of
[03:45:00.720 --> 03:45:05.920]  our advertising the same thing with this thing about talk radio and you and paul and and malinu
[03:45:05.920 --> 03:45:10.480]  dominating and and and all this then the it's like they're targeting us but it's this weird
[03:45:10.480 --> 03:45:16.640]  paradox where they admit we're huge and popular but then they try to censor us while they then
[03:45:16.640 --> 03:45:22.560]  try to create the straw man that we are and that is beyond cheating that and then and then again
[03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:27.760]  even the new york times admits that youtube is using algorithms to block us what they even admit
[03:45:27.760 --> 03:45:31.680]  they're censoring us and that we're rock stars and i want the audience to know it's not about me
[03:45:31.680 --> 03:45:35.600]  being a cool rock star they're trying to kill me they're coming after everybody you know so this
[03:45:35.600 --> 03:45:40.800]  is a death battle they're trying to kill the prez if they get him believe me i'm next believe me
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:45.520]  rand paul's next believe me matt drudge is next believe me mike sernovich is next i mean believe
[03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:52.240]  me michael savages that we're this is not a game people this is not a game they're coming after us
[03:45:52.240 --> 03:45:57.520]  they're scum have you been to an antifa event the little sorry sernovich skip this break
[03:45:58.880 --> 03:46:04.000]  no no stay on i mean it's always more fun but because we you know i don't invite me on i just
[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:10.160]  can't it's so real don't people get this isn't a game well they're getting it people are starting
[03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:15.760]  to get it i mean but i mean they're funding the most radical muslims on purpose to murder christians
[03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:21.600]  in mass well they're murdering jews now too which is what i don't understand right where they're
[03:46:21.600 --> 03:46:27.600]  supporting people like linda sarsar who supports palestinian terrorism against jews and i'm thinking
[03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:31.840]  you're worried about a bin garrison the most inoffensive guy that you'll ever meet the nicest
[03:46:31.840 --> 03:46:36.000]  guy in the world he was really like hurt he was like well wait a minute i don't understand why
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:40.800]  they're even doing this and i go well ben you're not used to your important ben you're the voice
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:47.360]  you are the modern paul revere of editorial cartoons and they want to scare you and ruin your life
[03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:52.480]  yeah i mean he'll be remembered as maybe the greatest political cartoonist in world history
[03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:58.160]  certainly u.s history he's already the greatest of our generation and they realize the value of
[03:46:58.160 --> 03:47:04.640]  culture and art that's why they're so triggered by that mcmaster fax website that's why i commissioned
[03:47:04.640 --> 03:47:09.920]  and and again we are you know listener supportive you're supported all that money goes back out i
[03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:15.120]  paid ben garrison to do that cartoon i didn't say oh ben you know your friend of mine cut me a break
[03:47:15.120 --> 03:47:20.480]  i said i love ben garrison i want to support your work i funded all kinds of you know work
[03:47:20.480 --> 03:47:24.640]  from him original commission so the money that comes in from the people that goes right back
[03:47:24.640 --> 03:47:28.640]  out to the community because we have to fund by the way i've said this i haven't done it because
[03:47:28.640 --> 03:47:33.680]  everybody's so busy i want to call him today i want to partner with him in the store funder operation
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:38.800]  fund him and and think big and sell all his posters sell his work i talked about that months ago we
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:43.920]  need to do that the audience needs to then celebrate his art hang in their homes hang in their businesses
[03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:48.880]  this is a culture war and the globalists want to control the art in the culture we must not let
[03:47:48.880 --> 03:47:54.080]  them control it and everybody should go to ben garrison site and buy his material because he took
[03:47:54.080 --> 03:48:00.000]  a pay cut getting kicked off major newspapers when he started backing trump yeah he has the book in
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:05.600]  the info war store dot com the 2016 presidential collection i actually have that book myself i
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:10.000]  bought it it's good and that's why people always say how can you support what we do when i go to
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:16.480]  just go to info war store dot com 1776 sale going on right now uh some of the best products let's
[03:48:16.480 --> 03:48:21.120]  talk about how we support you because you know people attack you because you're so successful
[03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:24.640]  they hate it and then they bitch you complain that you do fundraisers and then change the world with
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:29.520]  it but i want you to come out with some products some t-shirts i was even saying you need some
[03:48:29.520 --> 03:48:34.960]  supplements you are already on it developing a really good one so again i want competition i
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:41.120]  want wealth i want success i want to take over the globalist system defeat it turn america back
[03:48:41.120 --> 03:48:45.520]  on in the renaissance because i want the life extension technology that comes out of a renaissance
[03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:50.400]  i want the big nice roads and the big nice hotels and the golf courses and the culture and the
[03:48:50.400 --> 03:48:55.840]  churches and the goodness and the wealth and the success and i want it now i don't want islam
[03:48:55.840 --> 03:49:01.040]  ruling my life i don't want a bunch of devil worshiping liberals obsessed with my kids sexualizing
[03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:06.960]  them and they want a war they've got one and that's the problem and that's what they do all the time
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:12.480]  is they want to take over art culture and they want to make it debased so the cia of course had
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:17.280]  funded the modern art movement the debased modern art that we have now that was the cia operation
[03:49:17.280 --> 03:49:22.720]  but it was a conspiracy theory everything we owe that's classified i don't know if you got this
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:29.520]  message but i've been in touch with i won't name who it is a very very very big time big time author
[03:49:29.520 --> 03:49:34.160]  wants to do a book with you you know we we have so much to talk about i don't even keep track of
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:38.960]  it where i want to just catch up with it it would be like the history according to alex jones
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:45.360]  and then show how everything you said was actually proven later on as right and and have everything
[03:49:45.360 --> 03:49:48.640]  documented everything and i don't know why that's why they're attacking us and misrepresenting what
[03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:52.880]  we said was straw men is because they're scared that everything you've been saying is documented
[03:49:52.880 --> 03:49:57.520]  what i've been saying is coming true it isn't that they just reported now gay frogs are real i was
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:50:02.240]  reading scientific reports 20 years ago but again people are like wow it just came true it's in the
[03:50:02.240 --> 03:50:07.280]  newspaper no we're winning they can't hold it back anymore let me ask you this skip the break guys
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:11.920]  how are they going to have a deep state coup which they admit they're doing killing the president
[03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:15.360]  and then not get caught people say why are they being public coups are supposed to be secret
[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:20.560]  no they plan on doing it like they're heroes they're never going to get away with this sort of it if
[03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:25.760]  they kill trump i believe it makes our movement even more powerful i hope they don't though what
[03:50:25.760 --> 03:50:31.280]  do you think mike yeah that's what they don't understand is they're not used to people actually
[03:50:31.280 --> 03:50:35.760]  standing up to them and not giving in they're used to you go after somebody like they're going
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:41.040]  after scare moochie right the they're really trying to attack him because he's a charismatic voice
[03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:45.520]  for freedom for entrepreneurialism even though i don't agree with him and he shuts up and goes
[03:50:45.520 --> 03:50:50.240]  and then he shuts up and goes away no he needs to be more public that's what i've told him actually
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:54.560]  i said look mooch you got to do your press conferences right now you're the hottest thing
[03:50:54.560 --> 03:51:00.320]  and i say that too this is what a lot of people don't realize mooch it likes dine to be pal he
[03:51:00.320 --> 03:51:04.880]  likes mcmaster but you don't have to agree with everything that i say i want that's the thing i
[03:51:04.880 --> 03:51:09.840]  want diversity less the problem mooch is smart but didn't get that the swamp guys were smiling to
[03:51:09.840 --> 03:51:14.400]  his face but slit his throat because we know mcmaster went directly to trump and said you
[03:51:14.400 --> 03:51:19.920]  must get rid of mooch jared actually did that this hasn't been reported i was i'll just break all my
[03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:24.080]  news i mean i have stories piled up i don't have time to write i'm gonna have to hire a full-time
[03:51:24.080 --> 03:51:29.200]  writer just to tell him my stories to write him up no it was actually jared who got mooch fired i
[03:51:29.200 --> 03:51:33.440]  know he was a big part of it know this yeah mooch didn't know it it was jared himself
[03:51:33.440 --> 03:51:38.960]  who conspired to get mooch fired they only brought him in because now you're usually a defender of
[03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:45.760]  cushion or somewhat wow go ahead yeah so you know roger had mentioned that mooch was brought in to
[03:51:46.560 --> 03:51:54.240]  take out rents now that is right but mooch didn't know that mooch thought he was coming in
[03:51:54.880 --> 03:51:59.680]  to be the communications director and i broke that story of course with the mooch memo where his
[03:51:59.680 --> 03:52:05.680]  whole communication strategy was laid out i broke that story every news outlet and the world covered
[03:52:05.680 --> 03:52:10.160]  it and to their credit they credited me for having the memo so i actually had mooch's full
[03:52:10.160 --> 03:52:17.760]  communication strategy so roger stone is absolutely right mooch was brought in to take out rents
[03:52:17.760 --> 03:52:23.840]  previous but that's not what mooch thought mooch thought he was going in there to completely change
[03:52:23.840 --> 03:52:27.920]  it was a wish list of you alex everything that we've talked about he was going to do
[03:52:27.920 --> 03:52:33.760]  build a content void run the white house like a news network create their own content do go pros
[03:52:33.760 --> 03:52:38.720]  do live everything that you and i he was the savior of white house communications and Trump would
[03:52:38.720 --> 03:52:44.400]  have totally won for sure with this strategy oh the russia stuff would be over two weeks with mooch
[03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:48.080]  and we wouldn't be talking about russia anymore two weeks with mooch and we'd be talking about
[03:52:48.080 --> 03:52:54.080]  whatever as you know he was on fire too behind the scenes yeah and he has a remarkable charisma
[03:52:54.080 --> 03:52:59.280]  he's an entrepreneur and again the broader point is i don't agree with him on a lot of things but
[03:52:59.280 --> 03:53:05.200]  i was gonna magnify the president so here's the 85 trillion dollar deal how do we get that strategy
[03:53:05.200 --> 03:53:10.880]  memo back to the president and and who is going to carry that ball now who is good who is left up
[03:53:10.880 --> 03:53:17.360]  there there are there nobody has but mooch has he has the it factor he has the x factor nobody
[03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:22.000]  can do mooch except maybe something like you or you know something like me but we have to run our
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:27.840]  own media stuff out here we somebody like laura ingram there's nobody though steven miller did a
[03:53:27.840 --> 03:53:33.680]  great job so maybe steven miller sarah huckabee bring in a somebody from one american news network
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:39.440]  maybe a former executive they um mooch was going to bring in bob shine who was at fox news they
[03:53:39.440 --> 03:53:43.920]  need to bring in somebody and say how are we gonna get the awan brother story out we need to bring
[03:53:43.920 --> 03:53:47.920]  in production they need to bring in news editors they had to bring on people that have news brains
[03:53:47.920 --> 03:53:52.160]  and understand what the attack we're looking at because trump knows how to instinctively tackle
[03:53:52.160 --> 03:53:57.600]  it but he can't tackle it all he's got to have a cadre of people around him well i mean you
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:03.040]  can't keep up with everything i didn't even know about that military coup letter sent by the democrats
[03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:08.000]  i didn't know about that and i'm i live news right i'm practically plugged in as we move
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:12.080]  towards their attempted coup why are they saying the next month or two and now we're two weeks in
[03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:16.880]  that they're gonna do their coup i mean are they trying to like get trump to move against them or
[03:54:16.880 --> 03:54:23.360]  what's going on well they're trying to scare away anybody who's fighting back that's what this grand
[03:54:23.360 --> 03:54:27.760]  jury is they're acting big they're acting bad they're acting like trumps on his way out that's why
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:33.440]  we need these congressional hearings on uh on keep going sorry no i mean that's what they're
[03:54:33.440 --> 03:54:39.440]  trying to that's why they got rid of um rich higgins and as we're calling and derrick harvey
[03:54:39.440 --> 03:54:44.640]  that they sending a message they go it doesn't matter if you're a decorated war veteran as
[03:54:44.640 --> 03:54:49.280]  derrick harvey was doesn't matter if you're an expert on the middle east it doesn't matter if
[03:54:49.280 --> 03:54:55.280]  you're an expert on national security we're gonna take out everybody so you worms watching you scum
[03:54:55.280 --> 03:55:00.240]  and fly over country that we hate and we loathe and we want to destroy your families and get your

[03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:20.960]  we can take out any of you that's what this is ultimately about it is declaring martial law
[03:55:20.960 --> 03:55:29.600]  declaring war on americans wow absolutely keep ranting sernovich it's very very important now
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:34.000]  it's for people to recognize that and to listen at home because people don't get what is at stake
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:40.880]  anymore i tell people go back to me from 15 years i never even cared i all i cared about five years
[03:55:40.880 --> 03:55:45.680]  ago was going to pool parties in las vegas i thought why would anybody care about politics why would

[03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:55.440]  and listen to house music and everything i didn't care about it was all dumb it was all pointless
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:56:02.080]  but then i realized that the deep state and sorrows and patreous and McMaster they want
[03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:07.680]  terrorism in america because that is how they control people so if you're you if you're like me

[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:24.160]  in all the great religions from buddhism to christianity to islam before it was corrupted
[03:58:24.160 --> 03:58:29.600]  by the jihadists to judieism what we have an opportunity to serve millions of people
[03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:34.000]  and every time they attack us we are actually acting as and quite frankly from a from a selfish
[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:38.960]  perspective we get even stronger and it is it is incredible servant which incredible job my friend
