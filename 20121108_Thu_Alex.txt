[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:29.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:29.640 --> 00:37.000]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is Thursday the eighth day of November
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.680]  2012 we are now two days in the aftermath of the reelection of the rock
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.920]  Hussain Obama the stock market dropped yesterday more than it has dropped in
[00:46.920 --> 00:51.920]  the previous year at any time more than 300 points will continue to track the
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.200]  latest numbers on the stock market today in fact when we come back in the next
[00:56.200 --> 01:03.760]  segment we will give you those latest numbers we are at the precipice of
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.520]  absolutely diving into deep tyranny and we've been easing into it on the
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.280]  slippery slope for a long time but we've gone down the slippery slope and then
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.360]  the slope ends at a cliff and we're hearing a lot about the fiscal cliff
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.000]  that's how they've maneuvered Europe into we've got to have tax increases or
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.080]  everything will implode and then you get tax increases and the money goes to
[01:25.080 --> 01:30.280]  offshore banks and it's the same thing now happening here in the US the
[01:30.280 --> 01:34.920]  globalists have handbooks they have playbooks they have programs they launch
[01:34.920 --> 01:38.720]  when we come back I'm going to break down exactly how they're maneuvering us
[01:38.720 --> 01:42.640]  into this tyranny not just here in the US but in every major country in the
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.880]  world that's run by this global corporate management system they've
[01:45.880 --> 01:51.240]  developed it it is scientific it is almost impossible to beat if you're not
[01:51.240 --> 01:55.960]  aware of it if people get mass awareness to the tricks and the scams and the
[01:55.960 --> 02:02.240]  games it's like a magician's trick well you can't see it until you're told by
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.000]  the magician in slow motion you're like oh how did I not see that before and it's
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.400]  the same thing here the exact same scenario is now taking place and I want
[02:16.400 --> 02:19.720]  to break down how some of these tricks there's so many tricks but they're
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.520]  integrated I ought to write a book about the tricks of the New World Order the
[02:23.520 --> 02:27.960]  globalist playbook and and because there's there's really only 30 or 40
[02:27.960 --> 02:32.240]  tricks there's different permutations of each trick and I've noticed these
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.880]  different programs and their minions just run the same programs in fact most
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.240]  their minions are compartmentalized as well and don't have the big picture they
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.360]  just know their little scam and what gets them ahead and what they were taught
[02:44.360 --> 02:49.160]  so we're reverse engineering this whole thing got some really bad news for
[02:49.160 --> 02:53.520]  people I know that we knew it was coming but I had said and others have said
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.240]  that hey if Obama gets back in you know at least we'll know what we're facing
[02:57.240 --> 03:00.680]  and they're gonna put it in high gear but be careful what you wish for well I
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.560]  didn't wish for it but it's a foregone conclusion basically now they are
[03:04.560 --> 03:08.640]  announcing that they're gonna try to physically make you turn in your
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.040]  semi-automatic handguns and rifles this is absolute declaration of war against
[03:14.040 --> 03:17.480]  the American people by the globalists that occupy this country I have that
[03:17.480 --> 03:21.440]  stack of news I have the engineered collapse of the economy all those
[03:21.440 --> 03:27.000]  collapsing it are posing as saviors and and you know all our sources almost all
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.200]  of them are saying that they're gonna really implode things by the end of the
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.360]  year to panic everyone into accepting this banker dictatorship that Europe has
[03:35.360 --> 03:38.720]  already gone under and they even call it a banking dictatorship and all the
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.920]  financial publications so it is just out in the open but the police are given
[03:43.920 --> 03:46.720]  intelligence files that if you talk about it you're a terrorist and it
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.480]  doesn't exist showing how dumb they think the police are it's kind of like TV
[03:50.480 --> 03:53.280]  shows saying there's no conspiracies but then the globalists admit their
[03:53.280 --> 03:56.160]  conspiracies and financial publications because they know there's
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.000]  different audiences they're talking to so we're gonna be going over that the
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.720]  latest on the hurricane they're now I don't know nine days into the aftermath
[04:04.720 --> 04:12.000]  and still millions without power people without gas people without fuel and the
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.240]  worst-hit areas obviously are been disarmed so there's a lot of looting
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.280]  going on that the media is trying to cover up so we're gonna be breaking all
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.000]  of that down today but it's on they're gonna shut down over a thousand power
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.160]  plants your power prices will explode and there will be rolling blackouts
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.240]  nationwide that's that's been announced all over the country just get used to
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.800]  like a terrible country not having power it's on purpose but we're under
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.200]  military attack we're under military globalist occupation the public is

[08:55.040 --> 08:59.600]  purported but I do think we're going to see the new world order who believes the
[08:59.600 --> 09:07.240]  new age is beginning and the new age they want is a new dark age we are going
[09:07.240 --> 09:11.320]  to see expanded wars and conflicts those will be called peace actions we are

[09:15.320 --> 09:23.880]  bringing us under agenda 21 okay I want listeners tuning in to understand
[09:23.880 --> 09:31.200]  something things are moving very very quickly and we are seeing an engineered
[09:31.200 --> 09:35.640]  financial collapse in slow motion right now we're gonna be getting into that and
[09:35.640 --> 09:44.040]  the stock market plunging when Obama was reelected and we're also going to give
[09:44.040 --> 09:53.640]  you the latest stock market numbers but I don't want to just get up here on air
[09:53.640 --> 10:05.560]  and talk about this jumping from issue to issue and not have it sink
[10:05.560 --> 10:16.640]  in with people that this is engineered planned laid-out orchestrated beta tested
[10:16.640 --> 10:22.720]  in third world and old first world
[10:23.080 --> 10:30.680]  old world type nations this is a program that we're going under a program of
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.960]  disarmament a program of enslavement a program of atomization having our
[10:35.960 --> 10:40.440]  families and communities broken up a program of being impoverished
[10:40.440 --> 10:45.280]  scientifically the globalists have written their agenda 21 papers their
[10:45.280 --> 10:53.600]  club of Rome papers their university papers this is all public the geo

[11:25.240 --> 11:30.040]  years ago has hundreds of footnotes and an online bibliography what is the end
[11:30.040 --> 11:35.720]  game calm for every minute of the film documented with links to the globalist
[11:35.720 --> 11:43.920]  own reports we are in a artificial environment more and more the old
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.720]  natural environment is being phased out the general public is in a programmed
[11:48.720 --> 11:57.160]  trance state from watching television the overt propaganda on television if you
[11:57.160 --> 12:00.000]  would have shown someone just 20 years ago they would have thought they were
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.640]  hallucinating with all these different TV shows now showing four-year-olds on
[12:05.640 --> 12:14.720]  HBO engaging in simulated sexual acts with these children beauty pageant
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.480]  shows with little girls wearing shirts talking about sexual acts they want to
[12:18.480 --> 12:26.280]  do to people pedophilia is now being mainline in front of everyone just
[12:26.280 --> 12:31.560]  absolute evil is being pumped out there so everyone becomes overwhelmed and
[12:31.560 --> 12:38.800]  confused and goes into a kind of psychological catatonic learned
[12:38.800 --> 12:46.120]  helplessness normalcy bias where the overton window is moved so far towards
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.880]  hell that you would think that a nightmare is better than what you're
[12:50.880 --> 12:57.760]  living in they are just absolutely traumatizing the public mind ahead of
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.520]  all the other evil that is about to be turned loose open torture being promoted
[13:02.520 --> 13:07.000]  in in dozens of different programs in Europe in the US with that we've listed
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.120]  and gone over from 24 to you name it where people torture children in front
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.480]  of their parents to make the terrorist talk and that that's a good moral thing
[13:16.480 --> 13:25.560]  to do all of this is being done to just absolutely prepare the public for mass
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.720]  arrest forced labor camps and hell on earth and the total breaking of the
[13:30.720 --> 13:36.720]  United States in Europe so that we can be brought under total control so the
[13:36.720 --> 13:45.040]  globalist can release not soft kill but hard kill bio weapons on Asia on Africa
[13:45.040 --> 13:52.960]  and on Latin America those of you out there whites and people who think
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.800]  there's a death of the West happening and you are scared of the giant
[13:57.800 --> 14:03.360]  populations that aren't a white in this world well careful what you asked for
[14:03.360 --> 14:07.280]  because if the New World Order goes into its next phase they're gonna wipe out
[14:07.280 --> 14:12.360]  almost all of Africa almost all of Latin America and almost all of Asia and
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.320]  Asia is gonna get upset and Russia is gonna get upset there's probably gonna
[14:16.320 --> 14:21.080]  be a nuclear war if the globalist launched this plan it might be a year
[14:21.080 --> 14:26.000]  from now more likely it's 10 years out I can see all the preparation that's
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.480]  going on and before that can happen they've got to get our guns and before
[14:31.480 --> 14:35.800]  they can do that they've got to break you and bankrupt you so you accept a
[14:35.800 --> 14:41.320]  casualist society and they've got to have smaller bio releases of things like
[14:41.320 --> 14:50.560]  SARS and things like airborne bird flu's to scare you into the new quarantine
[14:50.560 --> 14:55.480]  tyranny they're doing mass inoculation drills nationwide they're bringing back
[14:55.480 --> 15:00.720]  the model states health emergency powers act for total conditioning and
[15:00.720 --> 15:04.880]  understand when you try to vote this out you're not gonna be able to in most
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.560]  cases because more than half the country now has put in totally fraudulent
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.800]  electronic voting machines proven to engage in fraud and caught engaging in
[15:14.800 --> 15:17.800]  fraud and here's what's worse Bev Harris has broken this down and reports
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.600]  she's done we're co-leading them all together for articles and info wars.com
[15:21.600 --> 15:27.600]  and prison planet.com of the next few days in more than seven states they
[15:27.600 --> 15:34.080]  announced winners before the votes of that day had even been counted and you
[15:34.080 --> 15:37.840]  say well why would they do something so openly fraudulent to why would they put
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.160]  four-year-olds on HBO and I won't even show this but it made national news a
[15:42.160 --> 15:49.480]  few months ago with sex toys putting them in their mouths and the crew keeps
[15:49.480 --> 15:53.560]  bringing me articles with all these new kids shows going you got to do a report
[15:53.560 --> 15:57.440]  on this because I don't watch television very often mainline television I watch
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.200]  excerpts online and they were bringing me all these news articles and show me
[16:02.200 --> 16:05.400]  videos this morning and I'm like are you joking and I went to the official
[16:05.400 --> 16:13.720]  websites of these TV shows showing small children wearing shirts saying things I
[16:13.720 --> 16:21.080]  will not even say on the air and it's a psych warfare operation this is all
[16:21.080 --> 16:25.880]  being done ladies and gentlemen because if they can destroy children and if they
[16:25.880 --> 16:31.160]  can set the precedent to hurt children they can do anything and then so what if
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.480]  Jerry Sandusky is running a giant child rape operation for the government so
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.920]  what if the big BBC presenter with the royal family is running a giant child
[16:38.920 --> 16:44.960]  rape operation surveil so what they're gonna come and have you arrested and
[16:44.960 --> 16:51.000]  they're gonna take your kids CPS giant pedophile army on record worldwide
[16:51.000 --> 16:58.040]  child protective services and the evil is about to manifest okay you think you've
[16:58.040 --> 17:05.040]  seen evil so far it is going to be a literal nightmare and our only hope is
[17:05.040 --> 17:10.680]  getting the word out now like life and death because it is life and death and
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.000]  standing firm against this because they're moving now on all fronts
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.320]  churches everywhere Baptist Methodist Catholic Presbyterian you name it are in
[17:20.320 --> 17:23.280]  all over the country you can pull these articles up saying do whatever the
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.160]  government says take your shots turn your guns in they're removing crosses out
[17:27.160 --> 17:33.520]  of major churches saying it's offensive to people it is all happening right now

[34:48.520 --> 34:53.640]  all the other scientific polls we know that the system is now going to say
[34:53.640 --> 34:58.840]  hey you're voting to turn your guns in hey you're voting to have carbon taxes
[34:58.840 --> 35:02.760]  hey you support this you want this well let me explain something
[35:02.760 --> 35:06.360]  hey it's a fraud and these machines are a scam so i say it's a legitimate and the
[35:06.360 --> 35:09.960]  proof's there when all these you know different things the globalists are doing
[35:11.400 --> 35:14.040]  and they'll do some things they're not worried about because they know you're
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.960]  going to legalize marijuana so they're now going to decriminalize it and claim
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.960]  the machines voted the will of the people so you think it's legitimate they'll give
[35:21.960 --> 35:25.400]  you your gay marriage so you think that you know the machines are working right
[35:25.400 --> 35:27.880]  they'll give you the stuff that doesn't matter to them
[35:30.680 --> 35:36.440]  but there is fraud this is a fraud and now they're coming out
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.160]  and i've got the stack of news here we're talking Reuters AP you name it
[35:44.920 --> 35:49.560]  and they are going yep the UN treaty is going ahead to ban small arms semi-auto
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.920]  and diane feinstein is met and they're going to introduce legislation and they've
[35:54.920 --> 36:01.240]  got a bigger majority in the senate now if anybody really believes that and they are
[36:01.240 --> 36:08.840]  going to come and ban not ban importation not ban manufacture they are going to ban
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.640]  semi-auto handguns and rifles just like obama said that's what an assault rifle is
[36:13.640 --> 36:20.280]  you got a deer rifle gas powered that that doesn't mean gasoline for people that don't
[36:20.280 --> 36:24.200]  own guns that means the cartridge gases are used to eject the shell
[36:26.760 --> 36:30.840]  you're going to turn your gun in that is in the news today they said under the proposal
[36:30.840 --> 36:36.360]  you will quote turn your guns into the federal authorities and folks when they try that there
[36:36.360 --> 36:45.000]  will be civil unrest and resistance you can guarantee and then it's going to be off of the races
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.440]  and that's part of the globalist plan i mean i'm telling you this could happen a month from now
[36:48.440 --> 36:52.840]  it could happen in two years from now or we could back these people off but they are coming
[36:52.840 --> 36:57.640]  for the guns they are coming for the guns they're going to shut down private sales that's their
[36:57.640 --> 37:03.560]  dream to your neighbors and people they are already having the atf send for now two years
[37:03.560 --> 37:10.120]  gun shops we've broken the news here years ago people couldn't believe the letters when
[37:10.120 --> 37:13.640]  they first saw them outside of law the atf saying what they could sell and what they couldn't
[37:13.640 --> 37:18.760]  not a law they just said so you've seen rama manuel say when he was in the white house
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.600]  that they're just going to put you on a no gun buy list no judge or jury like a no fly list
[37:23.960 --> 37:27.400]  they've seen the irs say they're just going to turn your credit cards off and turn your bank
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.400]  accounts off and order your employers you can't work there or they're going to come after you
[37:31.400 --> 37:37.720]  they're crooks it's authoritarianism it's capital controls it's everything that happened under musolini
[37:37.720 --> 37:47.240]  hitler lennon stalin malsay tongue whole pot the kenner rouge it's everything that went on under
[37:47.240 --> 37:51.880]  napoleon it's everything that julius seizer would do when he took over an area i mean folks we've
[37:51.880 --> 37:59.880]  seen all this and it's bad when they start gearing stuff up like this it's bad and you know what
[37:59.880 --> 38:03.800]  they're letting us know they're going to shut down most of the cold power plants in the country
[38:03.800 --> 38:08.600]  prices are just going to explode and they're going to sit there and say don't worry we've got uh
[38:08.600 --> 38:12.840]  uh incentives for people we're going to give you a bigger welfare check to pay for your power
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.480]  and that'll be devalued and oh thank you see they turn it off and then they give you the solution
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.520]  which is a noose around your neck you remember christ matthews came out and said that the thank
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.160]  god for the storm how great it was because it helped get obama elected if you even believe that
[38:27.160 --> 38:32.200]  and michael more came out in second and even why because it makes them the savior it doesn't
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.280]  matter if government isn't helping people and is just out arresting people and writing tickets
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.560]  in new york and new jersey it doesn't matter if they've gotten in the way of people defending
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.080]  themselves it doesn't matter if they're hunting people down they're on the news with baseball
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.120]  basketball protective property it doesn't matter because they said they're going to take care of you
[38:50.120 --> 38:56.200]  and again these globalists hate that's why they've got all these reality shows making people who are
[38:56.200 --> 39:05.160]  rural look bad or who are in the south look bad it's all about demonizing anybody who doesn't trust
[39:05.160 --> 39:11.080]  a government or anybody that's been through a reconstruction anybody who's been i mean even
[39:11.080 --> 39:17.720]  though it was 140 years ago and you could debate north south who was right it was really manipulated
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.320]  from the outside both sides were played off against each other by british intelligence that's in the
[39:21.320 --> 39:25.480]  mainline history books but not put on the nightly news or the mainline tv shows with history that's
[39:25.480 --> 39:32.760]  not history the truth is the south went their occupation went through being arrested raped
[39:32.760 --> 39:38.280]  homes burned down all of it and so there's that paranoia the media calls it and so that's why
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.200]  they're demonizing it and selling obama you notice there's been this archetype that he's
[39:42.200 --> 39:48.200]  abraham lincoln and then he will stop the civil unrest and then if there's any problems he's
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.280]  going to clamp down on the states and now he's been reelected and we see that iconography he's
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.600]  abraham lincoln he's abraham lincoln abraham lincoln's good abraham lincoln's good abraham lincoln
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.960]  arrested over 300 newspaper editors he he arrested how many members of congress he arrested governors
[40:03.560 --> 40:09.240]  they suspended habeas corpus and they and the war department was able to loot and rob the economy
[40:09.240 --> 40:13.880]  in the north while british intelligence manipulated the south into the war while massing troops in
[40:13.880 --> 40:19.080]  the north threatening to invade the north out of canada and then the the czar came over with
[40:19.080 --> 40:23.320]  his navy and said i will attack you if you attack them that's the only reason the us didn't get taken
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.360]  by england and then linked up with the south who was being suckered into all this i mean these
[40:28.360 --> 40:37.240]  people are sophisticated ladies and gentlemen and i can now see all the iconography all the icons
[40:37.240 --> 40:43.160]  all of the archetypes all of it being brought into focus and they are announcing they're coming
[40:43.160 --> 40:49.080]  for your guns in the middle of an economic meltdown and and again the next step in the
[40:49.080 --> 40:55.160]  economic meltdown it's been gradual now there'll be a big drop you can see him getting it ready in
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.320]  in in the next six months or so maybe even sooner and they're saying oh my gosh we gotta do something
[41:01.320 --> 41:08.600]  don't worry the mega banks they've got a plan raise carbon taxes raise a passive vat tax that
[41:08.600 --> 41:13.320]  tracks every part of the economy while keeping all the other taxes it'll all be selectively
[41:13.320 --> 41:19.640]  enforced globalists will be exempt further consolidating the economy further imploding
[41:19.640 --> 41:26.360]  the economy and then they can hand out money and stimulus to certain insiders and and also
[41:26.360 --> 41:32.360]  opposes the saviors while they strangle it's like a boa that's wrapped around a wild pig in the
[41:32.360 --> 41:38.920]  jungle crushing it talking to it sweetly telling i love you i'm gonna save you i know it hurts
[41:39.640 --> 41:47.240]  just relax and go with it okay i'm here to help you folks they ain't here to help us okay let me
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.440]  just let me just mayday this out to you all the gullible little starry-eyed idiots out there
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.440]  and all the people that work for the system this is this is death and destruction okay
[41:58.440 --> 42:03.320]  the people running our government ordered torture in camps all over the world and black sites
[42:04.280 --> 42:07.800]  okay hellraiser type stuff you cannot sign on to this
[42:09.560 --> 42:14.200]  you know they'll they'll they take women's babies every day in every major city with no
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.560]  criminal records about a third of the time it's a false positive that's come out in the news
[42:18.280 --> 42:22.280]  they're even taking lawyers kids they're even taking wealthy people's kids now because that
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.120]  gets the top dollar if they if they don't have any health problems or if they're the right color
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.960]  or and i talk to these people it's happened to you see at the news as well
[42:31.240 --> 42:37.560]  they give you a false positive for painkillers or marijuana or whatever it is
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.480]  and they come in and take your kid and they say you were abusing the child in your womb on these
[42:43.480 --> 42:49.320]  drugs but they say until the moment the child's born you can chop them up and they say oh but
[42:49.320 --> 42:55.800]  it's a woman's right see it's all they all phrase it one way when it's actually the other you see it
[42:55.800 --> 43:01.720]  oh women stood up they got obama elected women are like well and they cling to abortion like it's
[43:01.720 --> 43:07.720]  their their their buoy because most of them have had one and so they're not ever going to say it was
[43:07.720 --> 43:13.640]  wrong and so now they're saying hey why don't we just kill kids up to age three guys put up a major
[43:13.640 --> 43:19.800]  bioethics a major medical journal um calls for killing children up to age three who are healthy
[43:19.800 --> 43:23.720]  by the way that came out a few months ago we we broke it no one believed it for a week and then
[43:23.720 --> 43:27.160]  mainstream media carried it because it was so incredible they're like this is the the the
[43:27.160 --> 43:33.080]  prestigious bioethics journal came out with a paper that they published and said it was great
[43:33.080 --> 43:38.280]  saying let's kill people up to age three that's always been the plan and oh there are the death
[43:38.280 --> 43:45.400]  panels now so i'm here to tell you they're going to come out a the voting machines are fraud but
[43:45.400 --> 43:51.320]  even if the voting machines were real which they've been proven not to be you can have 51% say that
[43:51.320 --> 43:56.360]  i've got to go be your slave in a republic everyone's rights are protected so you can't vote someone's
[43:56.360 --> 44:01.960]  rights away you can come out and say oh we have a poll that no one wants to know what's in the food
[44:05.880 --> 44:11.960]  did you hear me on that and then try to spin it that people really don't want that but no one's
[44:11.960 --> 44:18.040]  buying into that fraud so a the machines are fraudulent b you can't force people to do what you
[44:18.040 --> 44:24.200]  want just because you say somebody voted for it if it's in the bill of rights which is basically
[44:24.200 --> 44:30.920]  covers the entire field so we must get the word out that we're not a democracy we are a republic
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.760]  a democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner the bill of rights and constitution
[44:40.280 --> 44:45.960]  was never fully realized but people pointed out liberties that were enshrined there that were
[44:45.960 --> 44:51.960]  not given there but that were simply pointed out there to demand more and more freedom and here we
[44:51.960 --> 44:58.520]  are today so the system acts like all of these things they're pushing are civil rights when really
[44:59.400 --> 45:07.320]  it's just political football issues that they can toss back and forth while they destroy the economy
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.600]  while they pick the winners and losers while the crony capitalists take over and socialize and
[45:12.600 --> 45:18.840]  communicate and bring in this communitarian system so that we're all quote in one pool
[45:18.840 --> 45:25.560]  so we can all be individually dictated to by the collective because quote our actions affect them
[45:25.560 --> 45:32.840]  in the collective you understand that trap oh well your kids you know gonna have a health problem
[45:32.840 --> 45:37.640]  in 50 years if we don't eat the diet the government says is healthy which happens to be gmo and
[45:37.640 --> 45:43.080]  aspartame and all this and so the parents you can't pack a school lunch now because you can't be
[45:43.080 --> 45:49.960]  trusted you see how that works if you know if if if people want to live in this authoritarianism
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.480]  you don't know what it's like people that think it's cutesy to be friends with the system and
[45:55.480 --> 46:01.080]  feel like well i accept the system so i'm part of it that's make believe that's like walking out
[46:01.080 --> 46:08.280]  if you lived in europe to a speed train point in say the black forest of germany where they have
[46:08.280 --> 46:14.680]  trains that go 220 miles an hour on their routes they can go upwards of 300 or let's say outside
[46:14.680 --> 46:18.760]  tokyo where they got trains that go 300 and let's just and there's no fence around it
[46:19.800 --> 46:23.000]  and you just walk out there and the birds are tweeting and you look at your watch and you know
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.440]  the trial and the trains are on time in japan and yeah and it's coming and you see and you go well
[46:28.440 --> 46:33.880]  i'm just going to make believe the trains my friend and you see it you know coming at about a
[46:33.880 --> 46:37.880]  thousand yards away in seconds it's going to be there and you step out and you see the headlights
[46:37.880 --> 46:45.240]  and you go my friend my baby folks it ain't your friend it ain't your baby it's a machine it is going
[46:45.240 --> 47:00.600]  to splatter you like a bug on its on its titanium bumper why is japan allowed to have that why is
[47:00.600 --> 47:04.280]  germany they've been taken over by the globalist bombed out and taken over a long time ago tricked
[47:04.280 --> 47:09.720]  to get into a war so they get to have the high tech test market where the globalists in singapore
[47:09.720 --> 47:13.960]  or other areas or communist china where they're fully in control you can have the technological
[47:13.960 --> 47:21.320]  development they're not even having debates in china about cloning humans it's on they're not even
[47:21.320 --> 47:25.640]  having debates about animals with 25 different you know other animals in them and they're parts
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.720]  human they're not even having debates they just don't they admit they're doing it they just don't
[47:29.720 --> 47:36.440]  show it to you because that'll freak you out they don't even they don't even mince words they're
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.760]  now announcing earlier in the week much a newspaper said yeah we need one child policies
[47:40.760 --> 47:44.280]  in europe in the u.s. but we're going to start with with a two-child policy
[47:45.320 --> 47:50.360]  just being announced just like that and i've had my wife at least four times she comes home and
[47:50.360 --> 47:57.240]  talks about being at a upscale grocery store and trendies come over women and say and get upset
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.160]  and of course they're jealous and angry because my kids are just literally gifts from god and look
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.360]  like kids out of like you know a fairy tale nursery rhyme or something you know with the
[48:06.360 --> 48:13.400]  blonde brown hair and the red cheeks and the green eyes and the point is is that and they walk
[48:13.400 --> 48:16.920]  over these these these women that have joined the system they got power on the system you know
[48:16.920 --> 48:22.680]  they're 45 and can't have kids and hate their boyfriend who walks behind them you see this now
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.920]  this is the new the men are submissive the women walk in front they're hyperharmoned the men are
[48:26.920 --> 48:30.920]  given female hormones the women have receptors designed to be aggressive with their hormones
[48:30.920 --> 48:34.920]  the men have receptors designed to be passive and the woman's walking in front and her husband
[48:34.920 --> 48:41.480]  her boyfriend's right there what are you doing with three kids man oh and my wife just laughs at
[48:41.480 --> 48:47.800]  him but these are acolytes these are priestesses of our death they are no longer the great heart of
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.720]  humanity they are now the they are now the winches of satan they are now the enforcers of death
[48:53.720 --> 48:59.640]  their sacrament is dead babies their sacrament is black scorched earth their sacrament is hell poured
[48:59.640 --> 49:07.800]  out and the stench of rotten flesh their wombs are temples of satan that's who they are that's
[49:07.800 --> 49:14.120]  what they want and you will get it you will die early of cancer you will be you will be you will
[49:14.120 --> 49:20.360]  be trendy and you will be dissolved in a vat of acid because it's bad to burn your body and bad to be
[49:20.360 --> 49:29.960]  interred you will have it all you will have what you want you will have your day of hell
[49:30.920 --> 49:38.200]  you will have it all i haven't even gotten into the news yet but i am just beside myself at the
[49:38.200 --> 49:46.440]  open evil i'll be honest i um i try to not watch mainstream television i try to not tune into the
[49:46.440 --> 49:53.640]  mainline propaganda because i only main i mainly focus on news not popular culture and the news
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.440]  is bad enough but it's only targeting 25 percent of the population or less who think they're
[49:58.440 --> 50:06.440]  intelligentsia because they read this twisted propaganda the rest 75 percent or so are in
[50:06.440 --> 50:13.080]  suspended disbelief sitting in front of televisions being bombarded with high-tech propaganda
[50:13.080 --> 50:19.800]  and being prepared to not have a survival instinct and to flip their survival's instinct
[50:19.800 --> 50:25.160]  into a nihilistic death instinct and that's now pretty much been successfully flipped
[50:26.840 --> 50:32.600]  to where life is seen as death and death is seen as life where evil and stench is seen as beauty
[50:32.600 --> 50:41.000]  and beauty and exhilaration and enlightenment is seen as hell so the flip is now happening
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.480]  and i need to focus more on popular culture because that's where the baptism of stench is
[50:47.480 --> 50:53.880]  occurring that's where the the the the the the titan of death is being released that's where the
[50:53.880 --> 50:58.040]  real destruction is happening we'll tell you about them coming after your guns when we come back
[50:58.040 --> 51:02.920]  they're coming they said they're gonna kill you if you don't turn them in we just had a terrible
[51:02.920 --> 51:08.680]  storm in the east but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm we have the most devastating
[51:08.680 --> 51:13.560]  economic condition since the great depression america's worst drought in agricultural history
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.680]  and what about the presidential election this perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's
[51:18.680 --> 51:23.800]  food supply e-foods direct is preparing for the shortages and you had better do the same
[51:23.800 --> 51:29.080]  i can warn you but i can't feed you you know that e-foods is the best tasting and safest food on
[51:29.080 --> 51:34.120]  the planet we all need a bunch of storable and usable food from e-foods direct none of us wants

[55:44.520 --> 55:50.120]  with with a carbon tax on everything that puts out carbon dioxide listing it as a toxic waste
[55:50.120 --> 55:56.200]  even though congress wouldn't pass the law three years ago obama's just implementing it and and

[57:04.840 --> 57:10.680]  they're busy at meetings but they say as much as a foot uh california senator and long-time gun
[57:10.680 --> 57:18.680]  hater diane feinstein legal staff held meetings on friday with ftb atf legal staff to discuss a new
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.000]  this is last week before the election assault weapons ban madame feinstein would be looking to
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.160]  push through congress and president obama wins election it's now been released the same pretty
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.800]  good intelligence says the items that would lead to a ban would include pistol grips high-capacity
[57:33.800 --> 57:40.280]  magazines eliminate any grandfathering and ban cells of weapons in possession so that's the the gun
[57:40.280 --> 57:47.720]  show loophole ban as they call it uh and just go on to then try to implement california style
[57:47.720 --> 57:53.400]  movements and that's what shooting wire has said that's what the nr a said uh it's got links to

[58:06.920 --> 58:11.800]  where they admit that their interpretation of the implementation says civilian ownership of
[58:11.800 --> 58:17.240]  firearms will be abolished because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state that
[58:17.240 --> 58:20.200]  that's their quote i don't say it's legitimate for the state to have the monopoly of power that's
[58:20.200 --> 58:28.360]  called total tyranny called despotism and they're now announcing that un celebrates uh obama

[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:06.920]  you didn't like obama you must agree with all the republicans no obama's a big liar he's a globalist
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:12.760]  and he plans to shut down our economy to bankrupt us under government control just like they said
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:18.120]  hey the storm's great it makes you dependent now michael morris agreed with uh what christ matthew
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:25.000]  said thanking god for the storm they want to control and run your life sharecroppers the guy
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.880]  that owns the sharecropping field never wants the sharecroppers to get enough money to be able to get
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.720]  off the uh plantation and you got to buy everything from the company store when blacks went out of
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:43.000]  slavery at the end of uh you know 1867 or so they just became sharecroppers well they were
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.080]  now just like all the white slaves and there were many history books written about how it was even
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:54.200]  worse because now they could even drop it down more than people that were complete slaves because
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:59.560]  now you could compete and compete and compete and make them sign a contract to live as sharecroppers
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:07.960]  to work for starvation wages because again you had to buy everything from the company store you
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:14.440]  know the old uh black blues uh hymnal we ought to pull up the lyrics or find an old uh you know
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:24.280]  80 year old 80 year old recording of i owe my soul to the company store that's in a nutshell what
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:32.280]  globalism what crony capitalism what monopoly new world order ism is and they're here and they're
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:38.600]  imploding the world economy right now by design so they can play the part of the saviors and get
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:44.760]  us all back on the plantation okay that's what the romans developed over 2000 years ago that's
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:50.280]  what we're now going under right now scientific version of it though and they're bombarding
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:58.200]  with the most degenerate anti-family anti-liberty messages anti-founding fathers anti-gun pro-pedophilia
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.160]  all over these shows on hbo and you name it with little girls i'm gonna do a report on it probably
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.040]  tomorrow uh i wasn't even aware it was this bad they were showing me where they've got little kids

[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.600]  shows in the country a lot of you know what i'm talking about you're like why is this happening
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.680]  to totally just overthrow everything where no one even knows what's going on anymore
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:26.360]  where they can get away with murder i want to hear from obama supporters how this is a great

[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:36.200]  strutting your stuff right now i mean i had a guy calling yesterday and and and would just total
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.240]  satisfaction and tell me that you know the age of the white man was over and i was a white guy
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:52.040]  and it the age of the white man how about the age of reason where where where you don't like

[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.640]  hear from the obama supporters tell me how great it's going to be to be like chicago in new york
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.960]  when they ban our guns that's now being announced tell me how great it is to have a thousand plus

[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.920]  the environmental movement isn't a eugenics movement meant to create a managed economy by
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:27.560]  the elites tell me again why general electric and others pay zero taxes but they're about to bring
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.680]  the general tax up to over 40 for somebody that actually works just just the income tax not all
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:38.360]  the dozens of others tell me again about how things work tell me again about how your electric car is
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.280]  good but a gas car is bad when the electric car is coming from a coal power plant the power
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.520]  tell me tell me why i'm bad because i spend 18 hours a day studying and researching and you

[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.720]  but look at this article out of the telegram dot com here in the u.s by mark blazes says outdoors
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:44.120]  paranoia of gun control victimizing obama he goes on to say obama has made no such attempt to try
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:51.080]  to restrict guns in any way and he goes on to say uh but sportsmen are being lied to by the safari
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:58.040]  club in the nra now folks obama when he was a state senator and a u.s senator said he does not
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.400]  believe and we've played these clips it's on record that anyone should be able to own guns
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:11.560]  except government and obama said in his uh second debate he wants to ban all semi-autos including
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:17.480]  handguns and where he's from in chicago they have a total gun ban for the citizens unless you jump
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:22.840]  through 85 million hoops it's basically impossible new york's totally ban guns new york city all over
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:28.280]  the world they just keep restricting restricting register confiscate look at england look at australia
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.240]  and then they finally get rid of the gun clubs where your gun is kept in a locker and now they've
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:39.160]  banned fox hunting and so foxes i saw this article go into people's houses and kill their babies
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:44.120]  foxes get big folks are but i mean they're in the dog family they're not dogs they're close
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:50.680]  to and they are meaner than a box of rattlesnakes a barrel of rattlesnakes and now they're just
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.240]  killing people's cats they're killing people's little dogs all over australia when i hike i see
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:02.760]  my cat's gone my cat my cat where's my cat we need to be able to find the cat and i talk to people
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.160]  who see their little dogs and cats being eaten by coyotes but then the environmentalists say but
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.880]  they shouldn't allow controlled hunts of the coyotes when there's giant green belts coming into
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.760]  austin and there's packs of wild dogs and they're even killing people's big dogs and
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.000]  this is what happens when you remove the predators you become the prey it's like
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.560]  mountain lions killing people and and and that's what they want these totally domesticated people
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:32.520]  everywhere the globalists are in control they take everyone's firearms this is what they want
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.800]  and diane feinstein has now come out and said yes last year they had what five bills that would ban
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:42.040]  semi-autos and now they say they think they've got the votes they got more votes in the senate
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.800]  they're saying obama may do stuff with executive order like he's going to do on cyber security
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  if we let see they're trying to go into the radar right now but if we don't stay on top of them
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.520]  they're going to go you have a right to own guns we just have a right to restrict your ownership
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:06.280]  of firearms so uh that's what's happening uh on that front i mean here it is fox news gun control
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:12.680]  treaty uh will reveal gun laws obama really supports well i mean we did analysis uh that
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:18.600]  we've done analysis curtain emo just did another story at info wars dot com it says in the un gun
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:24.840]  treaty that civilians won't be able to own guns it says that other governments will come and help
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:31.800]  other governments disarm their people i mean it's all there i've had bob daisy in with an hour long

[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.240]  that don't believe in either one of the parties that's like 50 of the public now and major polls
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:21.080]  don't see through the illusion the illusion yeah please tell me you're a comedian this is an act
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:27.400]  because you are the funniest person on radio right now so you are you're having an appeal to peer
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:35.240]  pressure uh like like aha you're funny aha look at him childlike i mean you think your opinion
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:44.200]  has any effect on on the facts oh my god oh my god so that's all you can do all you can do
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:52.040]  all you can do guys type it in type in members of the house call for return of fairness doctrine
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:57.320]  and and and so we'll also put that up on screen forum here i can do it right here uh you know
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.680]  congressman calls for return to fairness doctrine just you you can put it up there
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.840]  i mean there you go uh what they want is quote equal time and that means you take official
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.720]  feeds and then you only sit there and report establishment news and you can't say i mean
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:17.320]  they're trying to tell churches let me ask you this question sir do you believe churches should be able
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:24.760]  to um say that they don't agree with things that the government's doing
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.720]  church free speech everyone does you do i do everyone does uh no they actually tell churches
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.440]  that under 501c3 they don't have any uh free speech i know i thought that's what you asked
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.320]  yes but if i thought they could and they should be able to i do think should it be able to well
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:40.840]  yeah because it's called the first amendment do you think that's just a quote from my website
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.720]  can you quote the uh first amendment please congressman knows that i'm going to paraphrase
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:54.600]  the congress we can make no law um inferior on the uh on religion and free speech i can't
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:58.280]  really do that and the reason you know it is because i guess you've been listening to the show that's
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:05.240]  good you know i i listen to actual radio not a comedian but really it's a comedian let me just
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:10.680]  stop you we have an article bombshell leaked un treaty does ban guns and since this came out in
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.640]  july a month later they did release it we had the proper treaty you can go check our subsections to
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:20.680]  the treaty and we have links to forbs uh their analysis saying yes it does indeed call for ban
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:28.200]  on guns but then we have links to the subsections outlaws most types of shotguns uh greater reporting
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:34.280]  burdens on gun shops in southwest border states outside of law uh and and and and calls for the
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:42.120]  civilian abolition of a farm's ownership and it's literally come at 13 page articles sir with
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:47.160]  hyperlinks to the treaty and to uh all of the statements i mean are you still saying i'm lying
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.640]  look tell you what i gotta go this is not true work you go home with the x-files we're
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:48:00.760]  attending foil hats those are the reality have stuff to do buy jackass so uh x-files uh let me
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.520]  ask you a question have you heard all the mainstream news admitting that the u.s government sprayed
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:13.160]  radiologicals on us cities like st lewis oh he hung up un agreement should have all gun owners
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:18.760]  up in arms forbs and it goes on to say it does ban your firearms that's forbs and then they link to
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:24.920]  the quotes i i just you know i gave you abc news i gave you forbs i mean abc absolutely hates guns
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:29.960]  hates me nightline attacks us listen you're not gonna stop us okay and when you try to come get
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.480]  our guns everybody knows you you people we're not taking your guns i mean at waco they said this is
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:42.520]  not an assault as the tank was ramming into it shooting the people and uh i mean we're in a
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.520]  lot of trouble here folks paul watson's coming up and i'm just gonna get to him in the next hour
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.200]  this is so important the news he's got uh but let's continue here uh with robert in california
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:58.680]  he's watching on prism planet tv as well robert uh tell me i i guess obama's a great guy and i'm
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:05.240]  bad go ahead well i like obama better because uh i'm in the military and i've noticed a lot of
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:11.400]  people they're not even in reality and so if romney would have got elected he's no better and um
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.440]  they would have just come back to sleep and they're playing uh fantasy football so you like obama
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.360]  because he i mean he'll get the party really started you like him because he's gonna get this
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:26.440]  thing going quicker yeah we're fighting against truth and lies it's not about left or right
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:32.760]  uh blue or red and uh that's what i learned from watching your show it's all about knowing the truth
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:39.160]  and right now people are just lost and so i mean just we need to elect the devil as president because
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.200]  whatever it can get you know get it down there where it needs to go because it's gotta get worse
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:50.440]  before it gets better in my opinion yeah i agree with that but if we rot too long though they will
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:54.920]  win but then it's still horrible to see the evil i mean they're announcing they're gonna try to ban
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:00.760]  semi-autos right now on the news and this guy's calling up saying no we're not uh and and again
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:05.720]  that's a tactic by the establishment i don't think it was a tactic by him these obama supporters
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:12.360]  and government lovers are so trusting and starry eyed he actually believes it i mean so i mean
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.440]  these people are zombies well alex you uh you remember that the era of the white man is over
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.080]  yeah i'm like talking about coal power plants are going to be shut down and the guy called in and

[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:06.600]  almost two to one in some cases well three to one with golden sacks that they gave mit not because
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.640]  mit was good but because obama was the guy again and now they say oh they don't like obama so they
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:15.160]  plunged the market they're plunging it because they're getting ready to get you to accept a

[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:35.080]  listen you understand what i just said wall street put more money into him than romney not because

[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.700]  I'm gonna ask you one last question. Have you ever actually listened to my show?
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:15.300]  So to the truth, you are speaking polarized and Puerto Rican, poor, poisoned rhetoric every day.
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:17.300]  And it's down in this country apart.
[02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:19.300]  Do I need to be shut down?
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.800]  Hey, it's freedom of speech. Just like I'm speaking.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:26.460]  But people need to know that every day you are speaking polarized and poisoned rhetoric.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.460]  It's just like a cancer. You cannot...
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:32.900]  I'm like a laser beam burning out the cancer, honey.
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:40.400]  You know what? You know what? I know. I've done the research. I know I'm right.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.900]  And I'm sorry for you. You sound so dumb down. You've been drinking fluoride your whole life.
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:49.900]  I bet you were on baby formula brought up. I bet your brain is probably half the size it should have developed.
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:53.900]  And I'm sorry the globalist did this to you. And ma'am, I'm gonna fight for you, okay?
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:56.900]  I love you. I'm serious. I'm gonna fight for you.

[02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:10.900]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:17.900]  Alright, Mike Adams is coming in to spend a long segment with us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:26.900]  Breaking down Prop 37, do you really believe that the people in California who were two to one in polls wanting to label their food as GMO?
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:33.900]  Do you really believe that the electronic voting machines let them vote and that they voted to not have the food labeled when everything else is labeled?
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:38.900]  That is coming up. I am going to shake the show up and I've said that.
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:43.900]  I'm going to start taking calls from socialists and communists and Obama supporters.
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:47.900]  We've got more of them and I'm going to tell you, it's very entertaining.
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:59.900]  To hear them read off a Democratic Party script and deny they want our guns and deny there's tax increases or deny there's death panels and then we can play their own people calling for it.
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:04.900]  It really illustrates how dumb you've got to be to openly want socialism.
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:09.900]  It doesn't mean the Republicans are good either. They're dumb enough to think the Republican Party is going to save them.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:15.900]  But at least they think freedom is good and guns are good and abortions bad. They get suckered by a corrupt system.
[02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:19.900]  But we're going to have to admit how much trouble we're in or have no hope.
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:22.900]  Now, I told you 10 years ago, because I saw C-SPAN, they said they were going to do it.
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:25.900]  Everybody's like, oh, they're never going to do that. And now they do.
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:32.900]  Highway checkpoints with TSA. The TSA now certifies police as if they're God.
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:36.900]  They go certified, actually trained, bonded people that you've now had a federal course.
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:40.900]  You can now stick your hands down people's pants without warrants. It's like a magic wand.
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:46.900]  Now, the TSA is now taking people to the private group rooms to abuse them and strip search them and radiate them.
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:52.900]  They're moving the radiator machines, which they admit have been killing people to the smaller airports that haven't had a chance to be barbecued yet
[02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:56.900]  and moving a new form of radiation emitting machine out. The major studies show hurts people.
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:00.900]  You can look those up. So all of that is happening and going on.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:05.900]  And Paul Watson a couple of months ago, he said, shouldn't we do what you and others called for a couple of years ago,
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:10.900]  the national opt out. And also because the TSA is on website admits you're allowed to film them.
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:15.900]  You're just not allowed to cause a disturbance. But they lie and say, oh, I'm going to arrest you if you do that.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:18.900]  Oh, I'm going to, you know, whatever, try to take your film.
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:24.900]  I'm saying, and we say in the article Paul wrote a month ago, that do it at your own risk, though, if you believe in freedom.
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:28.900]  I know we're going to go out and do it. It's film the TSA and opt out of the naked body scanners.
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:34.900]  And I think Paul, you should get a report as part of that article that I know you're going to relink.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:40.900]  An article we're putting out in about 30 minutes with some other big breaking news to the last article about the national opt out film campaign.
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:48.900]  And maybe I create text that I can have my graphics crew create a nice flyer with quotes out of New York Times Associated Press,
[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:57.900]  with scientists saying the machines give you cancer, both the old ones and the new ones, and then have folks hand that out, you know, to people at the airport.
[02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:03.900]  And they'll say no soliciting. You say, oh, I was just warning someone, you know, go hand a few out when they say leave, you know, don't confront them leave.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:07.900]  And of course, they may break your neck for it. I mean, the country's not free anymore.
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:14.900]  But Dondi had a bunch of TSA people recognizing when he was flying back from Rhode Island to see his family, who wanted to take care of him during the storm.
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:25.900]  And he said they all surrounded him, asked for autographs, said they love the show, and that this is just a job for them and they don't like being told to do what they're doing.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:28.900]  And that's an important point I want to make now and go to Watson.
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:38.900]  Whatever you do, whatever you do, this is so important.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:44.900]  Understand that we tend to blame the TSA at a primitive animal level. I do that too.
[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:50.900]  Everywhere I go, they want my autograph and they say, look, I've been here five years. It's the job I've got. It's actually pretty good paying.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:54.900]  I try to, you know, we try to not follow things. We want to unionize.
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:59.900]  And it's the supervisors. Well, that's who likes to abuse. That's who likes to rob.
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:02.900]  That's who they keep catching, robbing everybody. That's who they put in.
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:11.900]  We've had insider TSA people blow the whistle and they recognize their voices and came after them where they actually, you heard the news say they don't do the background checks.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:15.900]  I don't know. They do them and then hire you when you're some type of criminal.
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:20.900]  Hitler did this. Stalin did this. Lenin did this. Mao did this. This is how they do it.
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:27.900]  So yes, we cannot blame the TSA in the final equation because that just makes the better ones end up leaving and then all you've got is the bad.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:38.900]  That's part of the plan. In the final equation, it is the Congress who acts like they don't know about it when they did this and the executive branch and Obama who's accelerated it.
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:45.900]  Let me tell you, his Justice Department, Big Sis, that woman is the one in their haunt showing that the in your pants and all the humiliation.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:53.900]  It turns out they do that to the male. They've been settling the lawsuits that the man, the man of the Justice Department say it's ruled by a bunch of crazed women.
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:59.900]  And we know about those type of cults. Janet Reno ran one of those. A lot of sheriff departments get taken over by it.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:03.900]  So the point is, is that it's not the sexual preference, folks.
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:08.900]  It's that the weird variant of some of those type of people always does this.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:16.900]  Now, I'm done ranting. Watson, you know, a lot of Lou Rockwell picked it up. A lot of other sites picked it up. We're thankful.
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:22.900]  Everybody needs to get Watson's press release. He's going to put back out today and get it and send it to everyone.
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:34.900]  And Paul, you should add, like I said, you know, just some news blurbs like, you know, where the scientists said it causes cancer and then the cancer clusters and then, you know, Boston Herald or Boston Globe.
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:42.900]  I know it was in both or associated press. So just hand that out and then the and then the website URL or a QR code.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:47.900]  We'll add that later to the flyer so people can go check it and find out we're not lying.
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:53.900]  And plus the TSA agents are rebelling and saying they can't even find people dumb enough now to be around the machines.
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:59.900]  And we knew that was the breaking point. They couldn't find people evil or dumb enough to live in the microwave ovens all day.
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:04.900]  And so that's why they're starting to pull them out. And if we beat them on this, we beat them on everything.
[02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:09.900]  If you let one aunt stand up, they might all stand up. You know about that.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:15.900]  Okay. And we're at the tipping point right now. That's why the enemy is throwing everything at us right now.
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:22.900]  We're going to win if you play out an effort. And so again, he also has some breaking news, big breaking news.
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:29.900]  He conducted a national poll that will be out about 45 minutes into the hour here about 30 minutes.
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:33.900]  We had to get approval. That's how you do it from Harris from these big polling agencies.
[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:37.900]  They have to see how you present their polling data. They certify you presented it right.
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:44.900]  We've been green lighted. I'm sure this will be a drudge plump at the mighty drudge report because it is breaking news.
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:48.900]  Wait till you hear this breaking news. All right, Paul, I'm chomping at the bit.
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:53.900]  First of infowars nightly news. Great researcher. All star info warrior. I know you'll like to be praised,
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:57.900]  but you are absolutely awesome. Just like McBreen and others. The whole crew is just incredible.
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:06.900]  Paul, tell us about the opt out film day and then give us a little forte of what's coming up in the big news release.
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:14.900]  Well, the URL is infowars.com slash opt out. And what this is is it's designed to be part of what you've talked about many times before,
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:24.900]  which is a new civil rights movement for the 21st century. Because, you know, we keep hearing people talk about this fiscal cliff,
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:34.900]  when in fact we've already fallen off the freedom cliff and we're already desperately trying to inflate our parachute because most of our freedoms are gone.
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:38.900]  And if we don't take a stand now, they're all going to be gone. That's going to be at the end of it.
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:48.900]  You know, it's like that Reagan speech where he said a time for choosing, you know, if we lose freedom here, there's no place to run to America's the last stand on Earth.
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:57.900]  If it goes there, it goes everywhere. So it's November 19 to 26. That's the week when we're asking everybody who cares about their freedom,
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:03.900]  who is traveling or even if they're not traveling, as he said, they can hand out the flyers. There's already one flyer up there.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:11.900]  We're going to make more. And rather than being part of the problem, they can be part of the solution in making a stand for dignity.
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:18.900]  Because if we don't stop this now, and this poll emphasizes the fact, it's going to be a very dark place in five, ten years time,
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:30.900]  because Alex, 30% or about a third of American adults would probably willingly march into a concentration camp with a smile on their face.
[02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:35.900]  That's how bad it's got. Tell people briefly about the Harris poll.
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:45.900]  Well, it's, we asked people, it was all based off this South Park episode that gave me the idea because they satirized it as, you know,
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:51.900]  would the TSA next be in restaurant restrooms conducting anal probes of people visiting restaurants?
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:53.900]  Look inside you, yeah.
[02:16:53.900 --> 02:17:02.900]  Yeah. So it was a big joke and I put it out as a satire piece on YouTube and a lot of people believed that it was an actual news story that the TSA-
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:04.900]  And so they wanted to be probed, yes.
[02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:08.900]  Yeah. So that completely shocked me. So it gave us the idea for the poll.
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:16.900]  So basically, we commissioned a poll with Harris and they asked over 2000 Americans five questions about the TSA.
[02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:25.900]  One of which was, would you be willing to undergo a TSA body cavity search in order to fly?
[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:30.900]  Now bear in mind, a body cavity search is the very worst intrusive search.
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:36.900]  They do it to dangerous prisoners going into jail and I'm not going to explain the details because it's disgusting.
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:41.900]  They only do it in high security generally and up to maximum.
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:48.900]  You only get it going into lower security because I went and looked it up when you're first being brought into your prison term.
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:51.900]  It is unbelievable.
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:18:00.900]  So one third, one third of Americans would be willing to undergo a body cavity search in order to fly.
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:08.900]  So they'd be willing to go into a back room or even in public with a TSA agent, have them perform that duty in order to fly.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:14.900]  One third of Americans, I thought it'd be about 10% max. It's 30%.
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:19.900]  Yeah. Well, you remember when you had the idea of a few weeks ago to do the poll, I said, I bet 30%.
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:24.900]  And we had an argument about that. Do you remember me saying 30% will go for it?
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:27.900]  Yeah. I mean, I thought 10% max.
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:33.900]  You know why? It's always 30%. 30% is it always will do anything they're told. They just love it.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:46.900]  But it gets even worse because then we asked if it was reasonable or unreasonable for anybody to obey a law, obey a command given by a TSA agent,
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:49.900]  not only in an airport, but any public place.
[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:52.900]  So this basically makes a TSA agent God.
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:19:05.900]  He can tell you to wash his car if he wants to, to obey any command given by a TSA agent. Is that reasonable or unreasonable to pass a law to make that the case?
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:18.900]  57% of Americans said it was completely or somewhat reasonable that TSA agents should be given the power to have Americans obey their every command.
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:25.900]  And that's only two of the questions, though. You've got four more little juicies, including taser bracelets.
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:39.900]  Oh, yeah. Even more Americans, 35% would be willing to accept a taser bracelet, which would give them an electric shock performed by, you know, TSA agent or an airline staff member.
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:45.900]  If they were accused of being a terrorist to incapacitate them, 35% would accept that.
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:51.900]  And obviously you're going to have an addendum article under it showing they really are planning the tasers and stuff, right? Or is that in your article?
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:53.900]  That's in the article, yeah.
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:20:01.900]  Okay. Approved by Harris as well. He had to get an approval before he used it. So that's coming up. Stay there. Moral national opt-out day.
[02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:06.900]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:16.900]  Coming back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of young Jevite products. Aaron Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:21.900]  We're going to show you some before and afters. Aaron, break down what happened. Your story.
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:27.900]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results. It just didn't happen.
[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:30.900]  Then I saw what you were doing with infowarsteam.com.
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:38.900]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy. I wanted that nutrition. Didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals.
[02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:46.900]  But the products did that for me. I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods.
[02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:59.900]  And they don't even advertise it as weight loss. I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to infowarsteam.com, sign up as a distributor, and get wholesale pricing discounts at infowarsteam.com.
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:05.900]  American gardeners and fellow patriots make the right choice with your money, time, and your family food supply.

[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:38.900]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:45.900]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:59.900]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:07.900]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in a coming disaster and may not survive without?
[02:23:07.900 --> 02:23:17.900]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the US and you have got to be prepared. Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:29.900]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis, then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:39.900]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical items you should hoard now before it's too late.
[02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:49.900]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after a disaster and may not survive without.
[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:59.900]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever. Again, that's 37items.com.
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:28.900]  It became a big deal and now everyone started saying, I opt out. So TSA started saying, okay, you're allowed to opt out because people were just saying no.
[02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:45.900]  And then you educated them about the radiation. I want to create like some factoid blurbs out of newspapers and, you know, the newspaper, the date that it was there, maybe five or six quotes, which then when they tell you that the radiation isn't going to hurt you in the new machines, you just hand them the paper.
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:52.900]  You need to add that. And I wanted some banners a month ago when we first pushed this up, but I don't think that ever happened or materialized. That's all they were made.
[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:58.900]  So Paul, you need to make maybe infowars.com forward slash TSA.
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:04.900]  In fact, I'll tell the IT guys to do that if you're unable to make that URL, but I think you can as a permanent page.
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:09.900]  And then we can just have your article with the flyer and all the info right there in one spot.
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:15.900]  You can also add at the bottom of the article you're about to publish on the poll, a link to the original article.
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:19.900]  Can we put that article up for people to find out about the opt out campaign, the one you were showing earlier, Dan?
[02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:24.900]  Paul, give us the headline on that so people can search it themselves and find it.
[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:31.900]  Well, it's infowars.com slash opt out. The headline is New National Anti-TSA Campaign Opt Out and Film Week.
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:35.900]  And I've just posted it in featured news on info wars. So it's right there at the top.
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:39.900]  All right, folks, retweet it. This is an action alert. We're going to beat this together.
[02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:43.900]  We're already forcing them to take the high powered X-rays out and put in the microwave ovens instead.
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:50.900]  We're going to expose those. Paul, great job. Finish up with the, we'll cover this obviously as it happens.
[02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:53.900]  And we're doing this for a week. Give people the date again.
[02:25:53.900 --> 02:26:01.900]  It's November 19 to 26. It's about opting out of the naked body scanners, opting out of the ridiculous obedience training policies,
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:06.900]  handing out flyers, filming the security procedures as long as you don't interrupt with them.
[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:10.900]  The TSA's own website says it's fine to do that. Upload your clip to YouTube.
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:14.900]  Send it to the email that's on this infowars.com slash opt out page.
[02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:19.900]  And we're going to, we're going to generate massive media attention just like the 2010 campaign did.
[02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:23.900]  And we're going to try and change things for good. This is not a one time protest.
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:27.900]  This is about a whole new civil rights movement for the 21st century.
[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:31.900]  And it's just the first shot in that battle.
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:36.900]  Well done. And I just love the initiative. You had this idea to kick this back off since no one's done it.
[02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:42.900]  And you had the idea to do the national poll. Let's finish up with, tell people about the other.
[02:26:42.900 --> 02:26:45.900]  Go through all six of the questions. Then you're going to go off the show.
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:49.900]  Mike Adams is going to come in and you're going to publish the big article.
[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:52.900]  Well, there were, there were five questions.
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:27:00.900]  The other one was if they're a Democrat or Republican and funnily enough, in some cases, the Republicans are more willing to accept this kind of stuff.
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:04.900]  They were more willing to accept the electric shock bracer, for example.
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:10.900]  The other question was basically considering the threat posed by terrorists,
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:18.900]  is it acceptable for the TSA to touch your genitals, which they're already doing as part of their policy?
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:28.900]  So 35% of American adults found it completely or somewhat acceptable for the TSA to be touching their genitals.
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:35.900]  65% didn't. But then if you get, if you drill down into the actual figures,
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:42.900]  12% to 9% Republicans to Democrats were likely to find it completely acceptable.
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:51.900]  About more than one in 10 Republicans like the fact that the TSA is touching their genitals and overall 35% find it acceptable.
[02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:54.900]  So that was one of the other questions.
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:58.900]  And then the other one was, is the TSA doing a good job?
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:04.900]  Which of course there was a Gallup poll recently which found that a slim majority thought they were doing a good job.
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:11.900]  Our poll found that 77% of Americans thought the TSA was doing an excellent good or fair job.
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:14.900]  Most of them are in the middle, they say fair job.
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:20.900]  23% of Americans thought the TSA was doing a not very good job or a bad job.
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:25.900]  But the thing about it is only 9% thought the TSA was doing a bad job.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.900]  Yeah, well that's because of who these polls, polls.
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:34.900]  I mean, they inherently use landlines and it's mainly only really old ladies that like to get on the phone and talk on landline.
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:38.900]  I've looked at the demographics, so really old ladies and people on welfare.
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:44.900]  And by and large, they just like, I'm running old, they just like to say whatever, whatever, whatever goes along to get along.
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:49.900]  Well, actually they did a cross spread of ages, so this is everybody.
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:50.900]  Really?
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:52.900]  They gave them off, right?
[02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:58.900]  Because they gave a breakdown when they said that, you know, you got 18 to 35 and the ages kept going up.
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:04.900]  And actually a lot, I found in a lot of questions, the young people were more likely to support this kind of stuff.
[02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:11.900]  Well, that shows I'm wrong. I mean, a lot of these polls, they end up going after old folks who they find are more compliant in certain demographics.
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:14.900]  But I know Harris is very respected, that's why we used them.
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:17.900]  And wow, so 10% love their slavery.
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:21.900]  Funny, I can go out on the street and almost everybody I talk to doesn't like the TSA.
[02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:26.900]  I know the Texas State House doesn't, they unanimously voted to stop the groping.
[02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:31.900]  Well, it's interesting, when they poll frequent flyers, they always say they hate the TSA.
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:37.900]  So I guess a lot of people just don't fly or, you know, they just love, they love being slaves, basically.
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:41.900]  When is the article going up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com?
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:43.900]  It's going up in about 10 minutes.
[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:49.900]  All right, everybody, get it, get it out to everybody and get the national opt out situation flyer.
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:53.900]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:30:01.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:07.900]  We just had a terrible storm in the east, but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:11.900]  We have the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression.
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:15.900]  America's worst drought in agricultural history and what about the presidential election?
[02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:19.900]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:23.900]  eFoodsDirect is preparing for the shortages and you had better do the same.
[02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:25.900]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:33.900]  We all need a bunch of storable and usable food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:30:33.900 --> 02:30:37.900]  None of us wants to be standing in a bread line trading our freedom for food.
[02:30:37.900 --> 02:30:41.900]  Anyone who doesn't take control of their uncertain future has to be just a little bit nuts.

[02:30:55.900 --> 02:31:21.900]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:30.900]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:35.900]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:39.900]  And here's the best news, a remarkable fall truckload sale going on right now

[02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:24.900]  Well, Eric Holder is announcing, guess what? He's going to stay on now.
[02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:32.900]  He's going to leave, but hey, he's going to stay on. Also up at infoworks.com, another front yard garden deemed illegal.
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:35.900]  Even though there's no law, you don't trust people to grow plants.
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:39.900]  Globalists pull out all the stops to grab guns after Obama victory.
[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:43.900]  They're announcing and they're on CNN. They want to ban all the semi-autos physically.
[02:33:43.900 --> 02:33:46.900]  Diane Feinstein's announced they want physical turn in.
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:52.900]  We have all of it proven that you heard a guy with talking points earlier saying I was crazy and laughing and saying conspiracy theory.
[02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:55.900]  You know what? I am crazy. Crazy like a fox, bub.
[02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:59.900]  And you're right. We're going to beat you. You're not going to get our guns.
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:03.900]  So you think you're powerful because you're part of the system.
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:05.900]  You should be the only one that's allowed to have a gun.
[02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:08.900]  Well, think again. So those articles are all up there.
[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:12.900]  Obama continues to wage aggressive war on whistleblowers to protect his secret drone war.
[02:34:12.900 --> 02:34:14.900]  Yeah, let's arrest people that legally blow the whistle.
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:19.900]  That's just more of the, and again, that woman when she called in earlier and people missed it,
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:22.900]  she said, we got to rear that call tomorrow. We have time.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:27.900]  She said, she said, your guy lost my guy lost.
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:35.900]  I said, it'd be good if folks voted for Romney only because his rhetoric was better when it came to being pro gun, anti abortion, things like that, from my view.
[02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:39.900]  But I know he's a new world order. The thing is, there's such chumps.
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:45.900]  And Mike Adams is doing the nightly news tonight, but he's going to throw it to me a couple times too,
[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:50.900]  because I'm going to do a report where the UN says they want to ban your guns and where Obama has said it.
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:54.900]  I'm going to get that together for that fellow. I showed him some news articles, ABC News saying it,
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:58.900]  but we're going to show you a bunch with that guy saying I was a liar or crazy.
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:02.900]  Just to illustrate how these people operate.
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:07.900]  And then we're going to also do a report on aspartame isn't almost all the gum now.
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:09.900]  And Melissa Melton did a report on one company doing it.
[02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:11.900]  Why not show them all so she's going to be in there with me as well.
[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:15.900]  Go on to Mike Adams in a moment to give me kind of a little preview of what's coming up tonight.
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:19.900]  Briefly, Watson, finish up the point. You had a few other points to make.
[02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:21.900]  It's infowars.com.
[02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:24.900]  You guys are one step ahead of me. There is a URL.
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:27.900]  Twitter it out to everybody. It's already got flyers.
[02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:31.900]  We're going to put up more flyers about both types of machines giving you cancer.
[02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:34.900]  And it's the 19th of the 26th during that key travel time.
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:40.900]  Even if you hand out five of these flyers like, hey, check this out, sir, or hand it to the TSA,
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:43.900]  it'll have a huge effect on them.
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:45.900]  And we're going to exercise our right to film them as well.
[02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:50.900]  They lie and say it's the law that you can't when their own sides force them to admit that it's the law that you can film them.
[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:53.900]  So Watson, what was the other point you were going to make?
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:36:01.900]  Well, just the fact that if Americans can be convinced through, you know, obedience training to put up with this level of intrusion, they'll accept anything.
[02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:05.900]  And another thing is, you know, the people who say, oh, let's just boycott the airlines.
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:08.900]  Well, that's part of the problem. That's not part of the solution.
[02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:15.900]  They're sacrificing the rights and mobility as a substitute for the rights of privacy and to be treated with dignity.
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:18.900]  So we shouldn't have to trade one for the other.
[02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:26.900]  Plus they admit it's a beachhead dog training facility to normalize the criminal activity to roll out nationwide, which has already begun.
[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:30.900]  Exactly. I mean, trade in one for the other is just a losing strategy.
[02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:32.900]  You're going to keep doing that later on down the line.
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:41.900]  So you can only win by standing up and saying enough is enough. And the people who've done that have helped push back some of these invasive TSA policies.
[02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:48.900]  The TSA aren't just in airports. They're everywhere, prom nights, music concerts, subways, bus stations everywhere.
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:52.900]  They're spreading everywhere and, you know, boycotting the airlines is not going to solve it.
[02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:55.900]  That's part of the problem, not the solution.
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:37:03.900]  Well, well articulated, the new civil rights movement, the real civil rights movement, they got us all fighting with each other while we're all losing our liberties.
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:07.900]  That's the real issue. Find out more at infowars.com.
[02:37:07.900 --> 02:37:09.900]  We've done that for Prison Planet, too.
[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:11.900]  Prisonplanet.com.
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:14.900]  Because whatever we do for info wars, we do for Prison Planet.
[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:17.900]  And so great job, Paul Watson.
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:24.900]  Ten minutes from now, our big Harris poll where people say they want proctology exams, electroshock, everything.
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:30.900]  Unbelievable. That'll be red linked at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. Thank you, Paul.
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:31.900]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:36.900]  All right, there he goes. By the way, we're going to premiere this film.
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:40.900]  If people want the DVD, that's great. That supports us.
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:45.900]  Plus, you have a hard copy in the IRS, plus the expanded extras from the world expert on securing your home.
[02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:48.900]  The best-selling author of the secure home, Joel Scalzen.
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:54.900]  Marine Corps fighter pilot, anti-new-world best-selling author, strategic relocation expert.
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:58.900]  I've actually used his advice on a lot of what I've done. It is second to none.
[02:37:58.900 --> 02:38:04.900]  And I integrated him with James Leslie Rawls and others' information. We sell his books, too.
[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:10.900]  But you can get the new film with myself and Joel Scalzen, the incredible graphics and breakdown at infowars.com.
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:13.900]  And you can get strategic relocation and the secure home, all of it right there.
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.900]  And there's inexpensive plans. There's expensive plans.
[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:22.900]  It's not about just running to the country. It's about the city you live in, the best escape routes, roads people don't really know about, don't use,
[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:25.900]  the main threats you're going to face, what countries are safer.
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:28.900]  He says the U.S. is probably best. It's the world's so bad.
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:31.900]  You've learned that, Mike Adams, living in other countries.
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:35.900]  Joel's the top of the world, Africa, Latin America, Asia.
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:37.900]  He really gives you a brain trust.
[02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:40.900]  We're going to premiere it tonight for PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers.
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:46.900]  So after the hour-long nightly news, we're going to have the film premiere tonight, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:50.900]  So if you are not a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber, what are you waiting for?
[02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:53.900]  Your 15 cents a day gives you six memberships.
[02:38:53.900 --> 02:38:57.900]  Six people can use the same username and passcode.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:02.900]  And you know what? Our servers have been working so good, used to we couldn't do more than that, we had problems.
[02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:05.900]  I want it boosted to 10. It's now 10 memberships.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:12.900]  We're going to change it today. 10 memberships for a $5.95 a month.
[02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:16.900]  I don't know what that comes out to, but that's like 50 cents.
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:20.900]  59 cents per person, per membership.
[02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:26.900]  And just make a username and passcode that isn't the code to your bank safe or whatever.
[02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:29.900]  Make one up and then give it as an e-card.
[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:32.900]  Hey, here's your gift. I gave you one to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:37.900]  And with zombies out there, you know, friends and family, a lot of them won't even go look.
[02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.900]  So those that want to look will.
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:46.900]  You'll know if too many have used it because you'll go and sign up and it won't let you, you know, sign in while, you know, 10 other people are on.
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:50.900]  But then you just go get another membership if that really starts happening. That's what you want.
[02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:52.900]  So we're going to 10. We're going to 10.
[02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:57.900]  So that's less than a dollar per membership. 50 something cents per membership.
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:02.900]  59 cents. I have to ask Mike Adams for no basic arithmetic. I know I'm public school educated.
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:05.900]  The point is Mike's here to help me and the human computer.
[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:08.900]  The point is 15. I wouldn't even plan on this till just now.
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:14.900]  I just realized wait, the servers are a lot better now is because it's had problems over its, you know, 10 years or so of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:16.900]  And we appreciate you all being with us.
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:18.900]  But it's now world class. Thanks to the great IT crew.
[02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:23.900]  PrisonPlanet.tv 15 cents a day for 10 memberships.
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:25.900]  And we can change that right now.
[02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:28.900]  So we're turning it up to 10 memberships.
[02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:32.900]  You make the username and passcode. You then send an e-card saying here's your username and passcode.
[02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:35.900]  Here it is. Boom. One, you know, two seconds to log in.
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:37.900]  Takes about a minute to sign up. No excuse.
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:40.900]  And that money that comes in pays for the bandwidth.
[02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:43.900]  PrisonPlanet.tv. We're going to premiere that tonight.
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:45.900]  We're going to premiere it tonight.
[02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:48.900]  You can tell I got a lot more energy folks and I'm wound up because we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:50.900]  I mean, they're announced and they're coming after our guns.
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:54.900]  They're turning off the power plants. They're shutting down the gardens.
[02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:58.900]  I mean, and so I'm getting in combat mode right now.
[02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:01.900]  And so is everybody else. And I just found endless wells of energy.
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:05.900]  I was getting pretty burnt out, but now the war is gone to the next level.
[02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:08.900]  I'm ready to open a can of information warfare. You know what?
[02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:13.900]  Now the health ranger, Mike Adams, the preeminent now researcher out there.
[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:18.900]  He's been that for years, but nobody out there can even rival the amount of people he reaches
[02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:21.900]  and the great tireless analysis he engages.
[02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:25.900]  And he's going to be hosting the news tonight before strategic relocation premieres.
[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:27.900]  And I'm going to try to shut up here and give you the floor.
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:29.900]  Give a breakdown your take, Mike.
[02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:32.900]  I mean, Prop 37 a month ago, as you know, you wrote about it.
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:37.900]  Two to one in scientific polls was going to pass that you just have to put on a label at GMO.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:40.900]  Just like you got to put on a label if something's an artificial sweetener.
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:42.900]  They want to change that now, as you know.
[02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:46.900]  And now they're saying, no, the people voted almost 60% or whatever it was.
[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:49.900]  You give us that number I saw yesterday to not want to know what's in it.
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:52.900]  I don't believe that this is electronic voting machines.
[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:54.900]  Bev Harris, the expert is confirmed.
[02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:56.900]  Most states, they didn't even count votes.
[02:41:56.900 --> 02:41:58.900]  They just announced the winner.
[02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:00.900]  We've entered a new level of fraud.
[02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:06.900]  Mike Adams, the health ranger with all your contacts and all your moles in and outside of government.
[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:09.900]  What really happened with Prop 37?
[02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:11.900]  Prop 37, it was stolen, Alex.
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:15.900]  It was stolen through massive deception and fraud that I'll go into.
[02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:17.900]  I've got a lot of details for you on that.
[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:20.900]  I just spoke to the yes on 37 campaign this morning.
[02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:24.900]  But first, I've got another big announcement that I know you're going to be interested in.
[02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:26.900]  This was a big deal.
[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:31.900]  You know, the coverage of the Hurricane Sandy that we did.
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:36.900]  I wrote an article about preparedness and it went viral and it got picked up by the White House.
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:43.900]  And they contacted me and wanted me to come on and help promote their new preparedness product.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:49.900]  So I have a prototype with me right here. It's called Obama's preparedness kit in a can.
[02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:51.900]  And I want you to shake it.
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:53.900]  Alex, shake the can.
[02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:56.900]  You know what's in this can?
[02:42:56.900 --> 02:42:57.900]  What?
[02:42:57.900 --> 02:42:59.900]  A FEMA approved can opener.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:04.900]  And not only is there a can opener in the can, but after you open the can,
[02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:09.900]  and believe me, me and Obama are working together on this and we're trying to get your endorsement too.
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:15.900]  But once you open the can and the can opener can help other people open their cans,
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:19.900]  and then you can hold it out to beg for supplies from FEMA.
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:20.900]  It's brilliant.
[02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:22.900]  Oh my gosh, that is a genius. Let me see that.
[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:23.900]  I know.
[02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:27.900]  So they give you a can of the can opener, you open it and then you beg for supplies from FEMA.
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:30.900]  So this is the new Obama phone.
[02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:32.900]  He's going to do more Obama.
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:33.900]  Obama.
[02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:38.900]  We decided not to put phones in there because that would be complicated and not even to put food.
[02:43:38.900 --> 02:43:40.900]  Is this breaking here right now?
[02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:41.900]  This is breaking news.
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:43.900]  Folks, give us a document cam shot of this right over here.
[02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:44.900]  This is amazing.
[02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:45.900]  Did you figure it all out?
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:47.900]  That is the government.
[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:49.900]  You notice Chris Matthews.
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:51.900]  Here guys, document cam right here.
[02:43:51.900 --> 02:43:53.900]  I mean, this is absolutely amazing.
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:56.900]  Chris Matthews said the storm makes you dependent so he loves it.
[02:43:56.900 --> 02:44:00.900]  Michael Moore says it makes you dependent so he loves it.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:03.900]  Mike, the White House contacted you and you came.
[02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:05.900]  This is a genius idea.
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:06.900]  Obama.
[02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:09.900]  President Obama's preparing this kit in a single can.
[02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:14.900]  All you got to do to get this is to give your rights up and your guns up and bend over.
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:18.900]  Well, and also look skyward because we're going to airdrop these on crowds.
[02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:22.900]  And to save money, you know, to keep the Republicans happy, we're not going to use parachutes or anything.
[02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:29.900]  We're just going to have a cargo plane go over and just sort of push these out the back over crowds and protesters and whatever.
[02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:32.900]  And that's humanitarian, which is why we really...
[02:44:32.900 --> 02:44:38.900]  Oh, you could even put cluster bombs in it like when they kill hundreds to kill one innocent person.
[02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:39.900]  They call that peace.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:40.900]  You got a peace price.
[02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:48.900]  No, but we are going to have suicide pills in them because some people, the storm is too much stress and they have too much burden on the national infrastructure.
[02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:54.900]  So we want to give them an option, a loving option to eliminate their burden on society.
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:56.900]  And so, you know, suicide pills are coming.
[02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:03.900]  Did you hear that lady earlier say that I, you know, that, haha, your guy lost, you just see this feeling really good.
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:06.900]  Yeah, well, anyway, I hope you're listening.
[02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:07.900]  No, I think you're...
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:09.900]  Zoom in on that folks right there.
[02:45:09.900 --> 02:45:11.900]  This is exciting.
[02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:14.900]  And I noticed on the Obama can, it doesn't tell us if it's GMO.
[02:45:14.900 --> 02:45:15.900]  That's good.
[02:45:15.900 --> 02:45:16.900]  Well, no.
[02:45:16.900 --> 02:45:18.900]  And also, we've already done tests with FEMA.
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:21.900]  We found out this can can hold 47 cookies.
[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:25.900]  So, and a little bit of hot chocolate, too, which is what they brought to Hurricane Sandy.
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:26.900]  So if you...
[02:45:26.900 --> 02:45:36.900]  Oh, and for holiday storms, Alex, we're going to have religion neutral, gender neutral, green and red holiday cookies that FEMA puts in your cane.
[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:41.900]  But what if you eat the soy, the GMO soy, it'll make you sterile so you won't be a gender.
[02:45:41.900 --> 02:45:42.900]  Well, that's true.
[02:45:42.900 --> 02:45:50.900]  And there's a lining of BPA inside the can to accelerate the development of male breast tissue so that everybody can be a little more equal out there.
[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:53.900]  Well, the genitals are shrinking in the average Western male.
[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:54.900]  That's a good thing.
[02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:55.900]  And the sperm counts...
[02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:59.900]  They can't really get their job done when everything...the target's smaller.
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:02.900]  So it makes them more hand-held.
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:05.900]  You know, it's a hands-on job that they're working with there.
[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:08.900]  But anyway, Obama's preparedness kit in a can.
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:10.900]  We're looking for your endorsement, so...
[02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:11.900]  I endorse it.
[02:46:11.900 --> 02:46:12.900]  All right.
[02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:13.900]  Good.
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:14.900]  I think that's land of the free home of the brave.
[02:46:14.900 --> 02:46:15.900]  It's just a begging can.
[02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:16.900]  It's a begging can.
[02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:19.900]  I mean, people...this was a problem in her...
[02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:25.900]  So you go to Chuck E. Schumer and you cry, and then he says he's going to deliver it, but then the best part is they never put anything in it.
[02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:29.900]  Well, Alex's problem was people didn't have anything to beg with.
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:30.900]  All they had were their hands.
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:31.900]  Yeah.
[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:33.900]  That's not loving, you know.
[02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:35.900]  Mike Adams, you are a genius.
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:37.900]  Well, you know...
[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:42.900]  I like the baby formula you brought in last time that was seventy-some percent corn syrup and other sugars.
[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:43.900]  It was a lot of corn syrup.
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:47.900]  Because per CC size, the American size brain is not developing now.
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:48.900]  I think that's good, too.
[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:49.900]  Yeah.
[02:46:49.900 --> 02:46:50.900]  Well, maybe that'll fit in the can.
[02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:51.900]  Next, when they...when, you know, cannibalism...
[02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:53.900]  Well, they've said to make the environment better.
[02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:54.900]  They should make humans little.
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:55.900]  Remember?
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:56.900]  The scientists have been saying that.
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:57.900]  That's true.
[02:46:57.900 --> 02:46:58.900]  So we...
[02:46:58.900 --> 02:46:59.900]  That's true.
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:02.900]  You go to the carnival and they've got that pole to see how tall you got to be to be able to round the ride.
[02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:04.900]  Now you got to be able to fit in the can or they...
[02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:05.900]  No.
[02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:06.900]  You're a genius.
[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:12.900]  Because the next round after the starvation kicks in from the government price controls, cannibalism in a can.
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:13.900]  That's the solution.
[02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:15.900]  We'll take the dead bodies and slice them up and put them in there.
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:16.900]  Soil and drain.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:19.900]  Well, the news in the 21 houses are about the size of that can.
[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:20.900]  You could live in the can.
[02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:22.900]  Maybe they're actually dropping housing.
[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:25.900]  You know, Jimmy Carter should get involved.
[02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:26.900]  Habitat for humanity...
[02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:28.900]  Hey, give me my can.
[02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:29.900]  You didn't build this?
[02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:30.900]  That's...
[02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:31.900]  You didn't build this can?
[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:32.900]  No, they sent it to me as a prototype.
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:33.900]  Yeah.
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:38.900]  But anyway, that's...that's...that's my, you know, gesture for preparedness right there.
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:40.900]  And so getting back to Prop 37...
[02:47:40.900 --> 02:47:45.900]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure the Californians didn't want to have J.M.O.L.S. and I believe that.
[02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:46.900]  Yeah.
[02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:53.900]  Well, so...so what really happened was the pre-election day vote, the early voting, was
[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:59.900]  causing...caused it to fail because Monsanto and the other companies had $45 million to bankroll
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:02.900]  this campaign of amazing deceptions in the days before...
[02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:05.900]  They sent letters out, I saw saying, we are the police.
[02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:06.900]  Vote no on this.
[02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:08.900]  They impersonated the FDA.
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:10.900]  That's a...that's a felony crime.
[02:48:10.900 --> 02:48:13.900]  They fabricated quotes from the FDA and emailed those out.
[02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:15.900]  Or, I mean, mailed them out physically.
[02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:22.900]  But the voting on election day would have passed the measure because by that time more people got informed.
[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:27.900]  So it was the early onslaught of bad, of misleading advertising that caused it to fail.
[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:31.900]  And then that creates kind of the push-pull thing where, oh, it's failing.
[02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:33.900]  Tween Mons will not go vote.
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:37.900]  Also, I noticed all over the country, they never even counted the election day stuff.
[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:40.900]  They just said, well, early trended this way, we're announcing the winner.
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:41.900]  Yeah, they did that.
[02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:51.900]  But the good news in this, Alex, is awareness is sky-high and Washington state now is looking at another ballot measure that would require labeling GMOs.
[02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:59.900]  So through your efforts and our efforts and all the grassroots people out there, there were over 10,000 volunteers for this GMO labeling campaign.
[02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:01.900]  The massive social media presence.
[02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:02.900]  I mean, it was huge.
[02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:08.900]  I mean, celebrities and everybody all over the country, cooks and chefs and children, were pro-GMO labeling.
[02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:16.900]  But somehow these corporations managed to get 4 million Californians to go to the ballot box and vote that I don't want to know what I'm eating.
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:18.900]  Yeah, but the machines have been proven a known fraud.
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:19.900]  Of course.
[02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:22.900]  I mean, so I don't believe any of it.
[02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:23.900]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:30.900]  I don't believe that Californians voted that they didn't want to know if something was GMO.
[02:49:30.900 --> 02:49:33.900]  A lot of people didn't know what it was even about.
[02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:34.900]  Frankly, they just weren't informed.
[02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:39.900]  But I saw in the news where they sent out letters saying we are the police association.
[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:40.900]  Yes.
[02:49:40.900 --> 02:49:41.900]  And it wasn't even the police association.
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:44.900]  No, they impersonated multiple organizations.
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:46.900]  They created multiple front groups.
[02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:47.900]  They pulled every dirty trick in the book.
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:51.900]  Well, that's what the UN does, is they create fake NGOs.
[02:49:51.900 --> 02:49:55.900]  Well, one of the key voting areas was just in the Bay Area.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:50:01.900]  And there was a tractor trailer that got turned over and blocked seven lanes of traffic into the voting area.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:03.900]  A friend of mine was actually on the highway.
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:05.900]  Because they knew San Francisco would push it over the edge.
[02:50:05.900 --> 02:50:06.900]  Yes.
[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:07.900]  And he almost got arrested.
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:14.900]  He was handcuffed and marched off the highway for taking pictures of this tractor trailer rig that was turned over to block all seven lanes.
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:15.900]  Oh, my God.
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:16.900]  I mean, I have a photo of it.
[02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:18.900]  It's blurry, but it's there.
[02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:19.900]  Incredible.
[02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:20.900]  No, that's what they do.
[02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:21.900]  Yeah, they try everything.
[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:24.900]  I mean, there's nothing they won't try.
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:25.900]  Think about it.
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:30.900]  These are the companies that created DDT, Agent Orange, every point.
[02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:32.900]  But it's not just, it's not that they're eugenicists.
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:34.900]  It's that this is their mission.
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:36.900]  We're fighting a military force.
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:37.900]  We're not just saying that, folks.
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:39.900]  This is military precision.
[02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:43.900]  Well, that's why we need more preparedness kit in a can.
[02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:45.900]  Is that what I'm going through?
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:46.900]  No, no, it is.
[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:47.900]  I love it.
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:50.900]  You got to prepare in advance, folks.
[02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:51.900]  This is the answer.
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:53.900]  This is your begging can.
[02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:56.900]  This is the birthright of all Americans is to put a can out.

[02:54:29.900 --> 02:54:32.900]  It's very entertaining and I don't mean to be mean.
[02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:35.900]  I love hearing it. I love Romney from him.
[02:54:35.900 --> 02:54:39.900]  Mike Adams. By the way, the provocation right on time.
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:44.900]  First on CNN, Iran jet fires on U.S. drone international waters.
[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:54.900]  Barbara Starr and Iranian SU-25 fighter jets fired on an unarmed U.S. Air Force Predator drone in the Persian Gulf last week.
[02:54:54.900 --> 02:54:59.900]  CNN has learned. Oh my gosh. And notice the economy is plunging right now.
[02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:02.900]  They're announcing their gun control. They're victim disarmament.
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:04.900]  They're announcing shutting down the power plants.
[02:55:04.900 --> 02:55:09.900]  I mean, we're now got Obama and the Fast and Furious crew for four years not facing reelection.
[02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:11.900]  It is hammer time.
[02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:15.900]  They think they have a mandate now to continue their gang criminality.
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:19.900]  And, you know, I'm really concerned about this UN small arms treaty.
[02:55:19.900 --> 02:55:25.900]  I'm concerned about Senator Feinstein saying that she wants now national legislation to turn in all your firearms.
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:30.900]  It says we're not going to ban. She's saying we're not going to ban the sale work.
[02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:32.900]  You're going to turn them into quote authorities.
[02:55:32.900 --> 02:55:34.900]  mainstream news.
[02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:37.900]  Yeah, I think her slogan should be.
[02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:42.900]  We shouldn't have firearms on the street when you need them most, you know, right after Hurricane Sandy.
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:44.900]  How are these people supposed to protect themselves from the looters?
[02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:48.900]  When the cops see people on the news with their bows and arrows, they go and find them and arrest them.
[02:55:48.900 --> 02:55:50.900]  It's like you will not protect yourself.
[02:55:50.900 --> 02:55:57.900]  It's absolutely the same. Look, you know, here in Texas, I, you know, I talk to people all over the place,
[02:55:57.900 --> 02:55:59.900]  farmers, ranchers, people out there.
[02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:05.900]  Every one of them says to me, I mean, people that come over to do work on my property, for example, you know, plumber, electricity.
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:06.900]  These aren't even listeners.
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:07.900]  No, they're not listeners.
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:08.900]  They don't even know who I am.
[02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:09.900]  They're committed, aren't they?
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:11.900]  They all tell me that.
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:12.900]  And they're sad about it.
[02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:14.900]  They're sad about it, but they're ready for war.
[02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:16.900]  Well, in a sense, they really are.
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:20.900]  They're just saying no one is going to come to Texas and take our guns.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:23.900]  And they start describing to me what they own, what they have.
[02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:25.900]  And it's, they're set.
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:28.900]  And let's say if just a few percentage people fight back, it's over.
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:29.900]  But the globalists want that.
[02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:31.900]  They want to start a civil war.
[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:33.900]  They're going to bring us into a depression.
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:37.900]  And you notice right after he gets elected, the very banks that put him in, quote, oh, they voted.
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:38.900]  The big banks will like Obama.
[02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:45.900]  No, no, no, this is part of the plan so they can push the VAT and the carbon tax, which they're saying, give us taxes and we'll fix the economy.
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:46.900]  Oh, it's incredible.
[02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:55.900]  But what's also clear is the Fed is going to keep creating money to buy the debt, which is going to put us into a cycle of currency devaluation and price inflation.
[02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:57.900]  And you know what's going to happen.
[02:56:57.900 --> 02:57:06.900]  Obama is going to kick in price controls at sooner or later and the price controls will cause widespread shortages of food nationwide, which is even better to riots.
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:08.900]  And then you'll get it from exactly.
[02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:10.900]  And this is a plan, the IMF World Bank plan.
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:11.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:16.900]  Sticklets when he left 10, 10 years ago, the plan got, they do this in countries.
[02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:19.900]  They've got a whole plan and they roll it out.
[02:57:19.900 --> 02:57:21.900]  And if it works, they're going to do it.
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:23.900]  And that's the excuse for martial law.
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:28.900]  And then martial law is the cover for mass genocide under what I'm calling Obamianism.
[02:57:28.900 --> 02:57:31.900]  And I think I've heard that word on your show Obama.
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:32.900]  No, no, no.
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:33.900]  Obamianism.
[02:57:33.900 --> 02:57:34.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:34.900 --> 02:57:35.900]  Obamianism.
[02:57:35.900 --> 02:57:36.900]  Obamianism.
[02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:37.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:38.900]  Obamianism.
[02:57:38.900 --> 02:57:42.900]  And if you look at, for example, the Cultural Revolution in China in 1966, I believe the Obamianism revolution.
[02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.900]  Well, and they use it for mass genocide.
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:45.900]  They do it everywhere.
[02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:46.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:47.900]  It's history.
[02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:48.900]  Tell us about it.
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:50.900]  Well, they target the groups that are political enemies.
[02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:52.900]  They target farmers.
[02:57:52.900 --> 02:57:58.100]  targeted in China academics they target scientists sometimes anyone who's

[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:57.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.520 --> 03:00:13.520]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:17.520]  all right I was gonna do this little overdrive addendum because I wanted to
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:21.760]  talk about the Jesse Ventura TV show that I have not seen until well really
[03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:26.520]  this morning I'm so tired from doing 10 hours broadcast day before I went to bed
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:32.880]  early I watch it this morning watch it pretty much twice and you know I really
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:38.640]  analyzed it I like Jesse Ventura a lot and I obviously like David Ike a lot
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:44.240]  they're both friends of mine and my wife watching it as I hadn't told her what
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:46.600]  went on and I said to her this morning I said what do you think of that she was
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:50.280]  well I don't know why you have David Ike on who I like she said and her nice to
[03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:52.760]  him and say you think he's really interesting and then you kind of talked
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:56.400]  bad about him on the show and I said exactly I said I don't know how to handle
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:01.960]  this because technically you know true TV took away that for 11 months and
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:06.240]  re-edited it but Ventura didn't believe and got mad to you after after he talked
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:10.020]  to me but you know you've got little stuff in the show like we went to Alex
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:13.440]  Jones one of the biggest critics of David Ike well that's not the case but I
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:17.680]  guess that was the bent so I was trying to be fair and balanced saying I used to
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.400]  not like him used to call the third in the punch pole but a lot of what he's
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:24.360]  talked about come true well it's just I used to I used to you know call her the
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:28.440]  punch pole cut you know and I understand what those shows they talked to you for
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:31.960]  20 minutes about somebody they cut it down to you know 30 seconds it it's
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:35.440]  just that it's not even really a controversy I'm probably making it one
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:40.160]  it's just that I like David Ike and and I don't know if everything he sings true
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:43.080]  I think he believes it I think he gets people thinking and I think he's a
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:46.640]  trailblazer in many ways and so that's why it's kind of conflicting and then I
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:52.480]  like Jesse Ventura so I don't like seeing the two in a big split that said
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:55.160]  that was almost a year and a half ago that was shot you notice it's just now
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:02:01.660]  aired last night and so I mean I saw Ventura shooting that machine gun in the
[03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:06.360]  show he looks so cool I saw the footage also saw it and he looks so cool they
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:09.680]  cut that out and didn't even it show that you know the sound of the guns or
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:15.880]  anything I mean it was I mean I'm just gonna tell you Time Warner is it's still
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:18.840]  entertaining but but they're really even making it more hokey and dumbing it
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:23.400]  down and that's why they've had it for 11 months to change it you know they
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:26.640]  took it away we weren't even sure it was gonna air they're airing it after the
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:32.320]  election and so I blame Time Warner for what happened you know because I
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:35.200]  genuinely you know said well I didn't used to really like David Ike I thought
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:38.720]  it was making people feel desperate and like it was all four aliens but now I
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:42.320]  see it it's just people's mind outside the box well just turns into you know
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:48.400]  basically only the negative stuff I said it up in there and it's distorted from
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:53.320]  what I really thought but I don't blame the the people that you know actually
[03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:57.000]  were there shooting it that's just what Time Warner turned it into and and so
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.400]  that's why it doesn't make sense that I mean it's David Ike on my show and
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:05.240]  then they asked well what did you say about him 15 years ago I called him a
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.560]  turd in the punch bowl but then it's like I called the turd in the punch bowl
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:15.200]  so but you know what I apologize the buck stops with me I apologize to David Ike
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:20.520]  for how it turned out with me it's my fault because I should have known that
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:24.320]  even if I did two seasons that turned out to be incredibly fair and awesome
[03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:28.520]  that if Time Warner could have taken it over at any time and kind of jumbled
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:31.560]  things to where it looked like I don't like David Ike because I mean it's like
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:34.720]  one of his biggest critics Alex Jones you know as the voiceover I know that's
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:38.200]  what they gave Jesse to read after the fact because he just cut the audio like
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:41.520]  two weeks ago they weren't even gonna air it for a while you know it sat there
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:46.840]  for 11 months it was shot last year so there it is but you know what I'm not
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:51.280]  gonna blame anybody I went and I was part of that show I went and I did it two
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:56.000]  great seasons they killed the TSA episode this year they blocked the
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.480]  Homeland Security episode after it aired once and that got removed so I mean they
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:02.920]  took it over the globalist took it over and there's still be some good that
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:06.440]  comes out of the show Jesse Ventura is a real deal real guy he doesn't know who
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:10.240]  David Ike is and David was trying to go into these long you know breakdowns and
[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:14.520]  and Ventura Ventura on the show was yelling it you know Ty and Sean
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:17.680]  Stone saying I don't believe this what it is he signed on to the show then
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:21.760]  these were the episodes Ventura goes fine but I'm gonna I don't if I disagree
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:24.640]  with something I'm gonna say it so that's I think you're gonna see that in
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:28.040]  this year's episodes that cuz I'm like oh yeah David it's gonna be an open
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:30.360]  interview because that's what they thought and then Ventura is just like
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:34.240]  this is pure crud so I think it's part of the process and so everybody's good
[03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:40.200]  David's good they're all good Time Warner bad and that's the inside scoop of
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:44.760]  what happened but I still said enough trying to be you know fair and balanced
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:49.120]  and when I said to where it could be me snipped together so it's my fault there
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:53.200]  you go Alex Jones' fault I'm sorry to all the Obama people recent others get
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:56.160]  their numbers if we can I'm gonna put you back on the show start of the show
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:05:04.880]  tomorrow 11 a.m. Central the big TSA article has gone up at info wars.com
