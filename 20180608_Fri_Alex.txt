[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. Yeah! They thought they could
[00:13.560 --> 00:18.260]  take America down. They thought they could have a G7 summit in Canada and rub America's
[00:18.260 --> 00:26.480]  face in the dirt. And Trump said, no! America will lead the world, not your globalist confab
[00:26.480 --> 00:31.520]  of a bunch of cronies who want to sell humanity down the drain. Now I'm fired up today and
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.040]  President Trump is fired up today and Alex Jones is fired up today on this Friday, June
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.520]  8th, 2018. We now go live to Alex Jones on the road. Alex, how refreshing is it to see
[00:42.520 --> 00:47.840]  a president that essentially flips the bird to the globalist at the G7 summit? That's
[00:47.840 --> 00:50.840]  right. Coming up in the next segment, we will play the clip. He seems to be going out to
[00:50.840 --> 00:55.440]  Marine One helicopter to take off to the G7. And he pointed out that he's trying to play
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.560]  nice with Trudeau. He's trying to play nice with McCrime and others, but he tore into
[00:59.560 --> 01:04.920]  him and said, listen, Russia should be in the G7 back to G8. They were taken out five
[01:04.920 --> 01:10.240]  years ago by Obama and the globalist. Whether you like it or not, this is the only place
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.440]  Trump's been behind on. He was ahead of it during the campaign, the clear alliance that
[01:14.440 --> 01:19.040]  the Patriots in the Pentagon, there's bad guys there too. There's three different fashions
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.200]  really, but there's two dominant ones. The Patriots in the Pentagon, so we should link
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.840]  up with Russia. They've got incredible resources, four times our land mass, more resources than
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.560]  even Africa. They've become a Christian nation. They've got lower taxes than us. We should
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.760]  link up. But geographically, we'll control the whole planet. We can stop communist China.
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.640]  We can block the giant Islamic invasion, but basically the globalist plan, but no, no,
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.680]  no, that's why the whole Russiagate thing had to start was to basically block the illegal
[01:49.680 --> 01:55.160]  spying they were doing on Trump and to sit there and project it. Russia was the enemy,
[01:55.160 --> 01:59.960]  not communist China that the globalist are allied with. So Trump now, for a year and
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.560]  a half, the only place he's really been lacking is that he allowed them to basically put him
[02:04.560 --> 02:10.080]  into a position where normally a US president within one month of being in office would
[02:10.080 --> 02:16.840]  have met with the leader of Mexico, the leader of Canada, the leader of the UK, then China,
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.680]  then Russia. That's generally the order of importance or so. You see, first meet with
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.160]  your regional neighbors, but no, that's not happened over a year and a half after this
[02:25.160 --> 02:28.880]  historic time of him being in office, always saying, oh, I'll meet with him in a month.
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.320]  I'll meet with him in a month. It's never happened because of the optics, but now with
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.680]  a big peace deal with Kim Jong-un already arriving in Singapore, you know, ahead of
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.920]  that coming up with the Bilderberg group and the EU and so much trouble with Trump approvals
[02:43.920 --> 02:49.640]  ratings, searching even in staged polls for the economy coming back with all these great
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.800]  things that are happening with double digit gains with black Americans supporting Trump
[02:54.800 --> 03:00.280]  with all of these exciting things happening. Trump feels the confidence now to throw down
[03:00.280 --> 03:06.160]  the gauntlet and basically call out the whole criminal cabal inside the FBI to call out
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.120]  the illegal spying to call out the situation with Russia and say it's time for Russia
[03:11.120 --> 03:16.200]  to be back in the G seven, making up the G eight. It's time to actually start building
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.520]  a constructive future. So peace is breaking out. The globalist having worldwide strategy
[03:21.520 --> 03:27.000]  of tension. That's the scientific military industrial complex, geopolitical part loss
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.680]  or nomenclature. They want a strategy of global tension crises so that they can keep humanity
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.880]  under their control, instead of having a world based on constructive economic systems moving
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.680]  forward. Still, there'll be military issues. There'll still be all sorts of problems, but
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.960]  humanity faces so many big problems that if we don't focus together, we can really work
[03:46.960 --> 03:51.840]  together as individual nations with the common goals that we aspire through a free market
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.120]  of ideas for. Most top analysts agree that we will not become a type one civilization,
[03:57.120 --> 04:01.440]  meaning non viable outside of this planet and probably destroying ourselves or at least
[04:01.440 --> 04:07.080]  knocking ourselves back into a new dark age. So ladies and gentlemen, the globalist had
[04:07.080 --> 04:12.040]  decided on a post industrial world for 99% of us in a breakaway civilization for themselves.
[04:12.040 --> 04:18.000]  They decided on neo feudalism as a way of control. That is now being rejected across
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.480]  the planet with elections this week all over the world in Canada, in Germany, in Italy,
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.560]  everywhere. Super hardcore patriots that talk just like yours truly, that talk just like
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.480]  Donald Trump, that talk just like Ron Paul. We are literally taking the planet back right
[04:36.480 --> 04:42.640]  now intellectually, culturally, militarily and the vampires are in a full panic mode.
[04:42.640 --> 04:47.720]  All right, when we come back on the other side, it's going to be Alex Jones breaking

[06:25.280 --> 06:33.040]  The energy of liberty rising worldwide here on this Friday, June 8, 2018. Welcome to the
[06:33.040 --> 06:38.040]  Alex Jones show. We're going to be going to Alex Jones here just momentarily, but loaded
[06:38.040 --> 06:43.480]  schedule for you. Not just a ton of important news that we need to get to. We also have
[06:43.480 --> 06:49.120]  a loaded guest schedule that you're not going to want to miss today. So today is the day.
[06:49.120 --> 06:53.320]  Share that link with your family and friends. Tell your friends and family about infowarstore.com.
[06:53.320 --> 06:57.760]  Tell them about the Alex Jones show. Share that link. They're blocking us on the internet.
[06:57.760 --> 07:02.480]  They're blocking us on social media. So we need you, the human intelligence to share
[07:02.480 --> 07:08.000]  today's link while we break it all down with these expert guests. So again, Alex Jones
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.960]  taking over here in just a minute. Then he's going to be interviewing Howard Kaplan for
[07:12.960 --> 07:18.760]  the remainder of the first hour. Austin Fletcher from Fleckis Talks joins me in the second
[07:18.760 --> 07:22.800]  hour. He's got all these great videos where he goes out on the streets and just shows
[07:22.800 --> 07:28.200]  the liberal indoctrination brainwashing for what it is. Leo Zagami then joins me at 1230
[07:28.200 --> 07:32.760]  Central. He's going to be talking about the populist nationalist uprising in Italy as
[07:32.760 --> 07:37.400]  well as what's going on with the Bilderberg group, which is meeting in Turin. Christopher
[07:37.400 --> 07:42.520]  Noweem will join me at the one o'clock hour to discuss everything President Trump has
[07:42.520 --> 07:48.200]  done for the veterans. We remember what the VA hospitals were like when Trump took over.
[07:48.200 --> 07:52.240]  Actually they're coming back now and the veterans are very grateful for that. He just signed
[07:52.240 --> 07:55.920]  a new deal this week. Christopher Noweem was part of that. He's going to break that down
[07:55.920 --> 08:00.800]  for us in the third hour. And then Dan Lyman also from Turin, Italy, covering the Bilderberg
[08:00.800 --> 08:06.600]  group for Infowars Europe will be joining me then before Dr. Nick Begich, an expert on
[08:06.600 --> 08:11.280]  all things globalism and Bilderberg group, takes over the fourth hour. But now I throw
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.800]  to Alex Jones to update you on all the breaking news right now when it comes to President
[08:15.800 --> 08:18.120]  Trump, the G7 and the globalist collapsing.
[08:18.120 --> 08:22.960]  That's right. And just this morning, Rob Reiner on the view, the guy that says we're
[08:22.960 --> 08:27.200]  in the middle of a revolution against America, the guy that says we should shut down conservative
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.520]  and libertarian and Christian voices, a truly monstrous globalist that put out all those
[08:31.520 --> 08:38.840]  fake videos with Morgan Friedman saying Trump's a Russian agent, all of that garbage. He went
[08:38.840 --> 08:42.920]  on and said, oh, we get our news from Alex Jones. That's the problem of America is in
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.920]  so much trouble. They get their news from Infowars. And the truth is, I'm on a family
[08:47.920 --> 08:57.240]  vacation, a work vacation part of the time. I have never been mobbed so much as I am right
[08:57.240 --> 09:06.520]  now by locals, by black people, by white people, by Coptic Christians, by Hispanic folks who
[09:06.520 --> 09:13.400]  are big Omar Navarro fans, by the way. It is unbelievable that I can be sitting under
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.680]  a cabana with a towel on my head. And people recognize my voice and just come in and shake
[09:18.680 --> 09:24.800]  my hand. It's amazing. And it shows how awake people are. And so whatever the globalists
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.800]  are doing to Infowars, the signal has already gone out. The dominoes are already falling.
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.240]  We're talking about nationalist patriots winning elections in dozens of countries the last
[09:35.240 --> 09:41.920]  year. And now it's accelerating all over the planet. People want freedom. People want liberty.
[09:41.920 --> 09:50.640]  Global elections in Canada, elections in Spain, elections in Italy, just elections everywhere.
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.400]  It's also happening in Latin America. People are pulling out of globalism. They're recognizing
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.440]  the multinational corporations as anti-free market and predatory. This is a big day now.
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.560]  That said, Trump obviously getting on Marine One this morning, sent shockwaves around the
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.040]  world under the hearts of the neocons and the globalists and the neoliberals when he
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.920]  said, listen, I don't care what Trudeau, I don't care what Macron, I don't care what
[10:15.920 --> 10:21.680]  other people say. We're bringing Russia back in to the G7. Again, five years ago, Obama
[10:21.680 --> 10:28.440]  and others had him taken out. And again, one of Trump's only failings is that he let them
[10:28.440 --> 10:32.600]  bully him into a position of not meeting with Putin for a year and a half officially. Normally,
[10:32.600 --> 10:35.960]  that's one of the most important countries you meet with. They have nuclear weapons.
[10:35.960 --> 10:42.560]  They're a large nation, a big trading partner, very strategic. Obviously, all this Russia,
[10:42.560 --> 10:48.960]  Russia, Russia made up, Fable has kept from that, but now strong on the eve of him meeting
[10:48.960 --> 10:54.680]  with the North Korean dictator to try to end that whole regime and merge the two and phase
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.480]  out one of the greatest evils in history. With all the other big accomplishments happening,
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.720]  as Spygate being one of the top stories and bringing the deep state to its knees with
[11:03.720 --> 11:10.400]  all of this, now Trump is making his move, mostly saying, listen, all over Europe, all
[11:10.400 --> 11:13.720]  over the world, people understand that Russia's been given a raw deal, understand that Russia's
[11:13.720 --> 11:18.240]  reformed, they understand that the very same globalist forces that took over Russia a hundred
[11:18.240 --> 11:25.760]  years ago, literally 102 years ago now, are the enemy. And that humanity's waking up to
[11:25.760 --> 11:31.440]  these eugenicist social engineers, and we're waking up to atheism and anti-family garbage.
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.360]  And all of this being a prepackaged, admitted system of the robber barons to con the newly
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.960]  freed serfs of Europe and Russia back into slavery, but that's all declassified, that's
[11:40.960 --> 11:41.960]  all public.
[11:41.960 --> 11:46.680]  So here's Trump saying, I don't care what these other people say, Russia should be in
[11:46.680 --> 11:51.760]  this, Russia shouldn't be cut out. So he's making up for the year and a half of being
[11:51.760 --> 11:57.000]  on the defensive, boldly coming in, which I said when he first got elected, I said, your
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.280]  first meeting ought to be with Russia, to just get it out in the open, to say it's
[12:00.280 --> 12:03.880]  absolutely ridiculous. I'm the president, other presidents met with Russian leaders
[12:03.880 --> 12:08.200]  back when they were Communist dictatorship. I'm allowed to meet with whoever I want, isn't
[12:08.200 --> 12:12.040]  it good? We both got nuclear weapons, let's be friends and move forward. But he didn't
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.160]  do that. But now he's doing it boldly, so history's happening, I can't wait to see
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.320]  what's going to happen in the next two and a half years. So let's go ahead and play
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.800]  a clip of the president just a few hours ago.
[12:21.800 --> 12:27.080]  Russia should be in this meeting. Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in
[12:27.080 --> 12:33.680]  the meeting? And I would recommend, and it's up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting,
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.640]  it should be a part of it. You know, whether you like it or not, and it may not be politically
[12:39.640 --> 12:46.840]  correct, but we have a world to run. And in the G7, which used to be the G8, they threw
[12:46.840 --> 12:53.560]  Russia out, they should let Russia come back in, because we should have Russia at the negotiating
[12:53.560 --> 12:54.560]  table.
[12:54.560 --> 13:02.160]  And the president goes on from there to lay it out. This is total, complete common sense.
[13:02.160 --> 13:06.680]  It's reality. They got 10,000 nuclear weapons. They've been battling radical Islam. They
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.560]  were the first country to help us after 9-11. And they are really wanting to come to the
[13:11.560 --> 13:15.880]  table economically, and they want investment. They know that 90% of the investment's been
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.720]  in the third world in China. They know that the US hasn't had investment in its own country.
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.640]  They know that Russia was put under similar systems of economic control because we're
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.960]  Christian, and because we're supposed to be broken. We have all the documents. We have
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.800]  Obama calling us bitter clingers. We have them calling us flyover country. There is
[13:33.800 --> 13:41.600]  an existential will to dominate Western culture by the megabanks, by the big tax-free foundations,
[13:41.600 --> 13:46.680]  by the Jeff Bezos, by the Tim Cooks, by the Bill and Melinda Gates of the world, by the
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.240]  Warren Buffets. All these stinking monsters, look it up, are the biggest recipients of
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.240]  banker bailouts, the biggest recipients of corporate welfare, the biggest recipients
[13:56.240 --> 14:02.000]  of tax-free operations. They are monsters. Their domestic money goes in tax-free foundations.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.280]  They can use however they want. Their foreign operations pay zero tax, or in the case of
[14:07.280 --> 14:15.920]  Google, 0.3%. This is the reality. I pay total, looking at all the taxes I pay every year,
[14:15.920 --> 14:23.720]  34% of the money that comes in that I keep for my family is paid into taxes. There's
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.280]  no loopholes for Alex Jones, who's got close to 100 people employed, from the janitors
[14:29.280 --> 14:35.640]  to the packing crew, to the legal folks, to the camera crew operators, to the webmasters,
[14:35.640 --> 14:42.240]  to the video editors, to the writers, to the reporters, to the producers, to everybody.
[14:42.240 --> 14:50.640]  No, no, no. Not there, not there. And I'm somebody, again, who puts 95% of the money
[14:50.640 --> 14:55.720]  back in the company. And I'm somebody that then saves some of the other money to battle
[14:55.720 --> 15:00.640]  the legal attacks I knew were coming years ago. People say, how are you expanding still?
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.440]  How are you fighting all this? Because, ladies and gentlemen, I do all this from a military
[15:05.440 --> 15:10.480]  perspective of long-term war. And I'm just going to leave it at that. But we do need
[15:10.480 --> 15:15.080]  your support more than ever, because we are now going into reserves to continue the expansion
[15:15.080 --> 15:19.880]  in the face of the enemy. And we will crush them. We will break their back. We see victory
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.480]  within sight on every level. We see the spirit of humanity awakening, but it's going to
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.920]  take prayer. It's going to take vigilance. It's going to take action on the streets.
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.840]  It's going to take action online. It's going to take never backing down, never giving in.
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.040]  And it's going to take wear and t-shirts out in the open to say, in FullWars.com, or Trump
[15:36.040 --> 15:40.120]  Pence 2020. It's going to take exercising your free speech. It's going to take calling
[15:40.120 --> 15:43.320]  in the C-SPAN, going and speaking of the city council. It's going to take going and
[15:43.320 --> 15:46.200]  finding out what's happening at your local public school, what they're teaching the young
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.960]  people. The left and the globalists have invaded every corner of our society, the church.
[15:51.960 --> 15:58.480]  They are trying to sell us on absolute security. Within these bubbles they control, we're
[15:58.480 --> 15:59.480]  already...
[15:59.480 --> 16:02.600]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[20:13.920 --> 20:24.280]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[20:24.280 --> 20:30.200]  And now Republicans, you're the Alex Jones party. There is literally nothing too stupid
[20:30.200 --> 20:35.120]  and conspiratorial that you will not swallow. Some tweeted terrible just found out that
[20:35.120 --> 20:40.600]  Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is
[20:40.600 --> 20:45.840]  McCarthyism. And other one, how low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very
[20:45.840 --> 20:49.920]  sacred election process? And this weekend we saw another example of that when White House
[20:49.920 --> 20:54.240]  counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked if she had any proof or Trump's outlandish claim
[20:54.240 --> 20:59.080]  that Obama wiretapped him during the campaign and offered this bizarre answer. How does
[20:59.080 --> 21:04.480]  he know that his phone was actually tapped? Let me answer that globally. He's the President
[21:04.480 --> 21:08.560]  of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.
[21:08.560 --> 21:13.240]  He is suggesting a U.S. president enlisted a foreign intelligence service to spy on a
[21:13.240 --> 21:17.200]  political adversary. That is the explosive charge. This is a serious allegation. This
[21:17.200 --> 21:22.680]  might be the most serious allegation any president has made against a previous president.
[21:22.680 --> 21:27.240]  But this is a very serious allegation for a sitting president to make about his predecessors.
[21:27.240 --> 21:32.040]  The craziest thing about Trump calling for an investigation without any evidence. Zero
[21:32.040 --> 21:36.160]  evidence. Trump has not produced a shred of evidence. There was no evidence for Trump's
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.600]  claims. The evidence did not come. So where did Trump get his info? From the CIA? From
[21:41.600 --> 21:47.600]  the FBI? Where are you getting this information? From a very reputable source. What? The FBI?
[21:47.600 --> 21:54.080]  The CIA? Infowars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You know he's legit? This bizarre
[21:54.080 --> 21:58.840]  circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped which
[21:58.840 --> 22:04.760]  developed on this kind of fringe right wing media. And then after his tweet storm, Infowars
[22:04.760 --> 22:07.480]  then started saying, well look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our
[22:07.480 --> 22:12.800]  story, misreading our story. And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president
[22:12.800 --> 22:18.320]  are citing info wars. So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend
[22:18.320 --> 22:24.240]  another bizarre right wing fringe theory. The crazier it gets, the more they like it.
[22:24.240 --> 22:29.440]  That's their jam. And we are back live. Alex Jones here via the phone on the road. I want
[22:29.440 --> 22:34.080]  to show you're in the Central Texas News Center. A bunch of powerful guests coming up. In fact,
[22:34.080 --> 22:39.000]  the next guest is the key to bring down the whole globalist operation even faster and
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.760]  a lot less bloody. But first, you just saw a few of the clips of them in the last year
[22:44.760 --> 22:48.880]  and a half saying Trump's completely insane, no one was spying on him, even though they
[22:48.880 --> 22:53.520]  had admitted that they were spying on him. And even though nine months ago they put out
[22:53.520 --> 22:59.360]  a inspector general's report saying three times they were approached and given false
[22:59.360 --> 23:03.800]  information to give them warrants in parallel construction against Trump, which is totally
[23:03.800 --> 23:13.520]  illegal. So when you have the inspector general report of the courts coming out, issuing these
[23:13.520 --> 23:18.840]  things, you know, you've got a serious, serious issue when the federal courts are saying we
[23:18.840 --> 23:25.240]  have major fraud going on. When Trump was only six months into office, they went public.
[23:25.240 --> 23:30.960]  So here's the big niche. Let me just tune in. You just heard them saying that no one's
[23:30.960 --> 23:35.240]  spying on Trump. Now, remember, once they had to admit he was being spied on and Clapper
[23:35.240 --> 23:39.120]  went on the view three weeks ago and they all had to come out admitted. He went, well,
[23:39.120 --> 23:44.520]  we are spying. We were spying. I don't like to call it that. And then Bill Maher and people
[23:44.520 --> 23:48.160]  said, well, we weren't spying on him, but we were watching you because you're a damn
[23:48.160 --> 23:53.520]  Russian agent. So that's their game. Oh, Jones's source that we were spying on Trump
[23:53.520 --> 24:00.120]  was the New York Times story that he misread. I mean, you know, that he lied about hoping
[24:00.120 --> 24:05.840]  you don't go read the story. Or if you do, it's that Jedi mind trick of you crazy person.
[24:05.840 --> 24:10.520]  We weren't spying on you. We were just spying on you because you're full of dirty Russians.
[24:10.520 --> 24:16.800]  I mean, that's the level of the mind control we're dealing with. So what is in fours big
[24:16.800 --> 24:21.600]  crime? Why are we the most hated by the globalist? It's because we have a memory. And I know
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.600]  I keep saying this every day because it's the key to everything. Resistance standing
[24:26.600 --> 24:32.160]  up, having the truth, right on your side and having a memory. And look, people have memories
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.720]  for stuff they like. I know guys that don't baseball scores from 60 years ago for no reason.
[24:36.720 --> 24:41.560]  I don't know people to know, you know, what, how many yards the Terry Bradshaw through
[24:41.560 --> 24:47.920]  four and Super Bowl, whatever. But they don't know about the three branches of government
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.280]  and they don't remember any of these political things because that's that boring adult stuff.
[24:52.280 --> 24:56.120]  Who wants to know about that? Well, our brains are designed to know about that. So, Rob
[24:56.120 --> 25:01.080]  Reiner, a guy with hundreds of millions of dollars who claims he's a socialist and a
[25:01.080 --> 25:04.920]  communist, has come out and said we're in a revolution against America and against the
[25:04.920 --> 25:10.560]  Midwest. And then we're in the final revolution and we're going to crush the American people.
[25:10.560 --> 25:14.480]  This guy came out of the view and said, oh my God, we're in trouble because we get our
[25:14.480 --> 25:20.760]  news from Alex Jones. Well, no, you don't get your news. You get your way back machine.
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.520]  You get your memory. All we do is point out what is really going on, what they said they
[25:25.520 --> 25:31.000]  would do versus what they did. Now, Trump loves that because Trump has about a 95 percent
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.280]  score on what he's actually delivered on and the promises he's kept. And we've been
[25:36.280 --> 25:41.640]  real mad at him on the few things he went back on. That said, ladies and gentlemen,
[25:41.640 --> 25:48.120]  the Democrats have basically a 100 score for lying. And it's not failure. They do it by
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.040]  design. They're globalists. They're henchmen. And now the Republican establishment and the
[25:52.040 --> 25:56.320]  Democratic establishment are being removed. And so they're panicking. So here's me head,
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.160]  Mr. Rob Reiner, panicking, saying, oh my God, they get their news from M-Full Wars. Here
[26:01.160 --> 26:02.660]  it is.
[26:02.660 --> 26:08.520]  But this is the first time we've had a president that's supported by mainstream media. I mean,
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.680]  Fox's mainstream media. And there's, you know, between that and Breitbart and Sinclair
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.640]  and Alex Jones, there are 40 percent of the country are getting their news only there.
[26:18.640 --> 26:23.000]  But there are also people getting their news from MSNBC, the other that are left-leaning.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  So, you know, just to balance it out.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.400]  No, no, that's true. That is true. But you can't penetrate that 40 percent and you can
[26:29.400 --> 26:33.600]  win elections with 40 percent. You don't need to move them.
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.200]  Okay. So what he's saying is we need to be shut down. And of course he's misrepresenting
[26:38.200 --> 26:41.880]  as well. It's way above 40 percent to get their news from different sources. Mainstream
[26:41.880 --> 26:47.280]  media is imploding. All their ratings are in the tank. CNN has flatlined. That's the
[26:47.280 --> 26:53.000]  reality. And so he's up there saying, oh, my God, because of Sinclair, because of Breitbart,
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.040]  you know, obviously it's really drug-report. Because of all of this, oh, my God, we can't
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.000]  win. He's sickening everyone on us saying, we're the problem. Yeah, we are the problem.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.360]  For liars, we're here reminding people that you said Obama care would be free. That you
[27:07.360 --> 27:11.000]  said it would be the cost of a cable bill. Then you said we keep our doctors. We're here
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.240]  reminding you that Obama couldn't get a 3 percent growth rate. Trump's about to announce
[27:15.240 --> 27:18.840]  a 4 percent. Reminding that they couldn't get peace deals in North Korea, we're probably
[27:18.840 --> 27:23.200]  about to see one. Reminding you that we could fix the VA because you set it up by design
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.560]  to basically kill people. You guys have the nation tied down. You've been preying on us
[27:28.560 --> 27:32.480]  for all these years. And now humanity has awoken and you don't know what to do because
[27:32.480 --> 27:38.120]  I'm gonna play clips of them saying the intelligence agencies are gonna get Trump. We've been spying
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.120]  on him. We know he's a Russian agent. Then Trump calls their bluff. They go, we never
[27:42.120 --> 27:47.480]  said that. We never said that. We're gonna remind people, meet Ed, what a dirty, filthy,
[27:47.480 --> 27:54.160]  the class warfare rich man you are that is a soulless piece of crap, racist piece of filth
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.960]  that uses racism to control people with your dirty globalist systems. You think you're
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.560]  better than all the rest of us. You're not better than all the rest of us. And all you
[28:02.560 --> 28:08.600]  New World Order globalists that want to ally yourself with radical Islam and want to implode
[28:08.600 --> 28:13.120]  the first world and all you left is to even want to sacrifice Israel, the altar of your
[28:13.120 --> 28:19.400]  whole Islamic jihad with that devil pedophile Pope. It's all coming down. All the popes
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.000]  top men have been indicted and are now in trial. The dozens of them, does the deputy
[28:24.000 --> 28:31.120]  Pope on down are all being arrested right now. You're all being arrested. And we come
[28:31.120 --> 28:36.360]  back, I'll give you my take on Anthony Bordeaux and what really happened with him on the other
[28:36.360 --> 28:41.320]  side. And then we have a gentleman that is the keys to victory straight ahead who went
[28:41.320 --> 28:48.360]  to the Pennsylvania event where here Clinton was meeting and brought up Mr. Epstein, the
[28:48.360 --> 28:53.360]  lead to express Harvey Weinstein and the convicted pedophile operations and the slave
[28:53.360 --> 28:58.520]  islands, all the confirmed stuff, not speculation. You know, not things we can't prove, but

[32:00.160 --> 32:05.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[32:05.320 --> 32:10.240]  here in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater, and we
[32:10.240 --> 32:17.080]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[32:17.080 --> 32:22.280]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed
[32:22.280 --> 32:28.560]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was
[32:28.560 --> 32:34.080]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested
[32:34.080 --> 32:39.160]  the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[32:39.160 --> 32:45.960]  safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter
[32:45.960 --> 32:51.600]  on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.040]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[32:57.040 --> 33:10.720]  filtration system will purify it.
[33:10.720 --> 33:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much. Alex Jones from the road. I'll
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.880]  show you the studio. We have a very, very special guest. We're on Bill Clinton in this
[33:40.880 --> 33:49.040]  particular fashion. We'll be going to him in a moment. We can't extend this free shipping
[33:49.040 --> 33:55.360]  sale much longer with our bestselling items at M4Store.com. In fact, we can only run it
[33:55.360 --> 34:01.640]  a few more days, maybe four or five days max. We're also running out of some of our bestselling
[34:01.640 --> 34:08.160]  items like our amazing Neutropic Rainforce. It's $19.95. Leading competitors are $60 and
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.120]  aren't even as good. It's a great deal normally at $39.95. Rainforce, you've never tried it.
[34:13.120 --> 34:19.680]  This is a great opportunity. $19.95. It is amazing. Also, alpha power is 50% off. If
[34:19.680 --> 34:25.160]  you don't know what it's done for me and so many others for stamina, focus, libido. It
[34:25.160 --> 34:29.440]  does so many things. It does not grow your hair back. They did a news review of it saying
[34:29.440 --> 34:34.560]  I said that and said I was a liar. Would you not say that? But you'll read the thousands
[34:34.560 --> 34:40.800]  and thousands of reviews per item to see what it's done for other people. X2, even though
[34:40.800 --> 34:46.960]  we're having trouble sourcing the deep earth crystals of the good halogen iodine, I am
[34:46.960 --> 34:54.320]  blowing out the stockpile of it we have at least for another few days at 50% off. Then
[34:54.320 --> 34:58.280]  after that, it's going to go back to full price until we secure more of it or until
[34:58.280 --> 35:06.440]  we have to have a new formulation. Get your X2 right now as well as M4slife.com, M4store.com
[35:06.440 --> 35:13.520]  or AAA-253-3139. Thank you all for helping fund the Second American Global Revolution.
[35:13.520 --> 35:21.960]  Again, M4slife.com, M4store.com is changing history. This model could defeat the major
[35:21.960 --> 35:29.120]  global corporations that only fund globalism and fake neocon garbage, the left in that
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.080]  whole system. All of the universities are funded by the richest, most powerful corporations
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.480]  in the world. What you see at the universities, the anti-American, anti-capitalism, anti-free
[35:38.480 --> 35:49.280]  market, anti-family, pro-radical Islamic, pro-pedophile garbage, the anti-mother, anti-father agenda,
[35:49.280 --> 35:55.720]  the whole anti-human agenda is globalist run to stun humanity, to turn off our self-defense
[35:55.720 --> 36:01.320]  mechanisms, to turn off our survival mechanism and put us into a catatonic state of globalist
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.040]  control. The fact that you are out there financing us, the fact that you're out there supporting
[36:06.040 --> 36:10.520]  us, the fact that you're out there buying the products, the fact that you are out there
[36:10.520 --> 36:14.960]  taking action and praying for us and spreading the links, the articles is changing the world
[36:14.960 --> 36:20.000]  that you're seeing it happen and I salute you and thank you, but we have more than 20
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.160]  items at 50% off at M4store.com and I am extending the Memorial Day special that's become the
[36:27.160 --> 36:33.920]  beginning of summer, super special until, I think until summer actually began. What
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.680]  is that like? The 26th or so, but here's the key. A lot of these items are set to sell
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.720]  out, so I will keep some of the items up there at 50% off that we've got plenty of in stock
[36:43.720 --> 36:51.560]  but stuff that's about to sell out or that's getting low. Like the X2, like the Brain Force,
[36:51.560 --> 36:55.640]  like the Alpha Power, things like that are only going to be for a few more days. We've
[36:55.640 --> 37:02.200]  got plenty of new Red Pill Plus. Now with energy, it's amazing. M4store.com, M4slife.com
[37:02.200 --> 37:10.800]  or triple-A253-3139, so please take advantage of that. Now, bring an old employer in here
[37:10.800 --> 37:14.480]  for this segment, the next, and then that little segment after that before his next
[37:14.480 --> 37:21.760]  guest comes on. Owen, I cannot stress enough how Howard Kaplan from Pennsylvania who's about
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.840]  to join you, how he's changed the world, it no doubt pushed it over the top one in the
[37:26.840 --> 37:30.680]  election that hundreds and hundreds of people during live events pointed out that Bill Clinton
[37:30.680 --> 37:37.440]  has settled rape cases and that Hillary protected pedophiles. Folks doing that changed the world.
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.840]  They were trying to project lies on the Trump. We took back the narrative with the truth.
[37:41.840 --> 37:46.560]  Well, I've said that if folks go out to Bill Clinton's book signings and Comey signings
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.240]  and Hillary's events and all of them, like he's coming to do this Sunday in Austin,
[37:50.240 --> 37:54.160]  oh, you're going to be there outside, but folks that get tickets that go in, the courage
[37:54.160 --> 37:59.320]  of standing in that hostile crowd and saying, Jeffrey Epstein, what you did, the Leader
[37:59.320 --> 38:04.400]  Express, convicted pedophiles, all of this is so powerful and what this gentleman has
[38:04.400 --> 38:10.600]  done, I feel in my gut is the next catalyst for others to do, just like that first young
[38:10.600 --> 38:14.600]  man that jumped over the fence, and I'm not saying you should do that, but he jumped up
[38:14.600 --> 38:21.880]  to the fence while during Fox being live on the street about six months before the election
[38:21.880 --> 38:33.840]  with then weekend show with now weeknight host and getting up there with Tucker Carlson
[38:33.840 --> 38:39.080]  and saying, Bill Clinton's a ripist with that T-shirt on. That began the Domino's following
[38:39.080 --> 38:44.360]  and I believe that Howard has begun the Domino's following. So here's a few minutes of him
[38:44.360 --> 38:49.400]  just a few nights ago, and we need to have this video go mega viral confronting Bill
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.880]  Clinton with facts and the hissing crowd and the hissing security people saying he's
[38:53.880 --> 38:58.360]  a liar when all of it is 100% true. Here it is.
[38:58.360 --> 39:06.200]  Why didn't you fly on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express 26 times? 26 times, Bill. What were
[39:06.200 --> 39:14.400]  you doing on Jeffrey Epstein's plane? He knows James Patterson knows who Jeffrey Epstein
[39:14.400 --> 39:26.200]  is. Child sex trafficker, you flew on 26 times. What do you got nothing to say? You know
[39:26.200 --> 39:32.200]  he did it. James, tell him who it is. This isn't him. He's not, it's not no concession.
[39:32.200 --> 39:47.720]  Not for questions. Okay. You wrote a book on Jeff 26 times, Bill. You didn't investigate
[39:47.720 --> 40:01.200]  it. Look it up. Jeffrey Epstein. Who cares? Yeah. Yeah. We know, Bill. We know, Bill.
[40:01.200 --> 40:11.400]  Come on. Yeah, have a good time, folks. Jeffrey Epstein.
[40:11.400 --> 40:20.680]  Okay. So again, we're gonna play more of the clip coming up, but this is how you do it.
[40:20.680 --> 40:24.200]  This is how you force the issue out. This is how you reach out to people. This is how
[40:24.200 --> 40:28.120]  you change the world. So Howard, we salute you. We commend you. I'm gonna let you take
[40:28.120 --> 40:31.840]  over here with Owen, but you're a hero, my friend. I mean, what it takes to do that,
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.960]  I've done similar things myself. And when you go into a nest of these people, I mean,
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.400]  quite a few of them even know the agenda and are on board whether it's true or evil. So
[40:40.400 --> 40:48.520]  we commend you for going into that den of evil. Thank you very much, Alex. Again, why did
[40:48.520 --> 40:52.400]  you decide to do this? What was in your heart? I mean, I'm gonna describe what it was like
[40:52.400 --> 40:59.800]  to be there in front of that creature. I've done similar events with Hillary and Joe
[40:59.800 --> 41:05.440]  Biden. So, you know, when I saw that Bill was coming around, it was just another opportunity.
[41:05.440 --> 41:11.240]  I live in Philadelphia, so there's a lot of events that come to Philadelphia. I can get
[41:11.240 --> 41:18.000]  to D.C. I can get to New York. And it just seemed like the thing to do.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.320]  Well, the House of Clinton is key to the whole blackmailing operation. It's going down right
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.680]  now. The fact that we can accelerate the complete collapse, the better for the world, the better
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.840]  for the country. Again, this is a domino effect of your new listener. The whole globalist
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.360]  system uses pedophilia and sex crimes as control. That's all coming out now. Trump's
[41:35.360 --> 41:41.600]  rolling that up. So, I'm gonna turn things over to you, my friend, and to Owen. Just
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.000]  an amazing job because, again, if you challenge others to go out and do what you've done,
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.080]  if people do this in Austin, out on the street, if we take full control of the narrative from
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.680]  these monsters that want to destroy our families and who are so brazen, he'll go down. He's
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.080]  far worse than Bill Cosby, far worse than Harvey Weinstein. And I risked my life point
[42:00.080 --> 42:03.320]  blank to get in their face. That's why they're coming after me right now. And I'm glad to
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.240]  do it for the children. I'm not a hero. I'm just a survival instinct. But you're a hero
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.640]  as well. And we are together here, my friend, in this fight. So, Howard, please continue
[42:11.640 --> 42:14.760]  and God bless both of you and God bless the entire crew.
[42:14.760 --> 42:17.800]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[42:17.800 --> 42:22.240]  All right. So, we're actually about to go to a break here. So, we'll get more into this
[42:22.240 --> 42:28.240]  with Howard on the other side. But here's why this is so key. If Hillary Clinton can
[42:28.240 --> 42:35.440]  go to a rally in front of 500 people and have nobody stand up, she thinks humans are a joke.
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.880]  She thinks she can step on your face. If Bill Clinton can go to a book tour and have thousands
[42:39.880 --> 42:44.880]  of people attend and nobody stand up for him, the criminal that he is, they think humans
[42:44.880 --> 42:48.720]  are a joke. They think America is a joke. So, that's why standing up to these people
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.320]  and letting them know we're not taking it anymore. You're not getting away with this
[42:53.320 --> 42:59.880]  anymore. That is the key to this. Resistance is victory.
[42:59.880 --> 43:05.000]  Fueling your body is hard work. That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily

[44:03.400 --> 44:09.600]  in Fuller's life. It'd take hours. Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[44:09.600 --> 44:14.440]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the handita.

[44:53.800 --> 45:01.160]  the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.040]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia. You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[45:06.040 --> 45:12.840]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now. I remember back when InfoWars
[45:12.840 --> 45:17.640]  and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the
[45:17.640 --> 45:21.560]  page on my dial-up internet. And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[45:21.560 --> 45:25.880]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests. And I've been using your product since
[45:25.880 --> 45:30.760]  the first iteration of survival shield. And since then, I'm on the X2, the super male
[45:30.760 --> 45:36.600]  vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body. It's all amazing. Thank you, brother.
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.640]  Yeah. And I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.040]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit. And it's just the more
[45:46.040 --> 45:51.080]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God. And I wanted to say that
[45:51.080 --> 45:55.800]  it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 17,
[45:55.800 --> 46:05.080]  176, world one. Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship
[46:05.080 --> 46:11.800]  is descending down over the UK. They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize
[46:11.800 --> 46:17.880]  Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.120]  what's happening in the UK. Seeing an end and many others are calling for info wars to be shut
[46:22.120 --> 46:28.200]  down, taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship,
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.880]  brainwash young people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies
[46:33.880 --> 46:38.440]  so they don't actually hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world
[46:38.440 --> 46:44.520]  by globalist. It is so critical that you go to info wars.com, slash newsletter and sign up for
[46:44.520 --> 46:49.720]  the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you. And so the sensors can bully their way in
[46:49.720 --> 46:55.400]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society that is critical
[46:55.400 --> 47:21.400]  to this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[47:21.400 --> 47:38.520]  Let me explain the significance of doing what Howard Kaplan did at the Bill Clinton book tour,
[47:39.160 --> 47:43.800]  what we're doing this Sunday at 6pm central outside of Bass Concert Hall here for Bill
[47:43.800 --> 47:51.000]  Clinton's book tour in Austin, Texas. What many of this audience did during the presidential election
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.880]  cycle going to Hillary Clinton events and shouting Bill Clinton is rapist.
[47:57.400 --> 48:00.200]  Do you want to know where people like Hillary Clinton derive
[48:01.160 --> 48:07.560]  much of their arrogance and hubris that you can see in that face right there?
[48:07.560 --> 48:18.280]  It's because they can get away with massive crimes from what they did to Haiti to petty
[48:18.280 --> 48:25.160]  crimes like stealing silver, silverware and furniture from the White House on their departure
[48:25.160 --> 48:32.680]  from the White House. And then they can go in front of a crowd of people and give a speech
[48:32.680 --> 48:38.680]  and have everyone in that crowd totally brainwashed, totally dilapidated and won't stand up to them.
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.240]  That's where they get their hubris. It's like a bully. A bully in school who goes around bullying
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.160]  everybody and nobody stands up to him just going to keep bullying people, going to walk around the
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.760]  cafeteria picking on people like they own the place. But as soon as that one individual stands up,
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.160]  all of a sudden another individual stands up, all of a sudden another individual stands up,
[48:59.160 --> 49:03.880]  all of a sudden the whole school stands up and that bully is no more. So that's why this is so key.
[49:04.840 --> 49:10.520]  Now, Howard Kaplan, the video has gone viral, confronts Bill Clinton at his book signing event.
[49:11.080 --> 49:17.720]  Now, what you saw Howard do, Howard, can you imagine though, just with how powerful your video
[49:17.720 --> 49:21.640]  is, can you imagine if there were six or seven other people in that audience and then after you
[49:21.640 --> 49:25.880]  stood up and said it, someone else stood up and said it and then a third person stood up and said
[49:25.880 --> 49:34.280]  it? I mean, that's game changing. That's world changing. That's my dream, Owen, to have 10,
[49:34.280 --> 49:42.040]  20, 30 people escort me out and then the next one gets up and the next one gets up and people
[49:42.040 --> 49:52.440]  can do this, man. It's not that difficult. And how do we get people to understand what this is
[49:52.440 --> 49:57.560]  really about? This isn't about Howard Kaplan and going and celebrating and patting himself on the
[49:57.560 --> 50:04.360]  back because he got a viral video. This is about Howard Kaplan standing up for truth and showing
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.880]  other Americans that they can do the same thing. That's what this is about. And like you said,
[50:09.880 --> 50:15.480]  if Howard Kaplan does it, okay, it gets a viral video, maybe it inspires others. If six, seven
[50:15.480 --> 50:20.840]  people in that audience do it, all of a sudden you just change the narrative of the event.
[50:20.840 --> 50:25.400]  You just changed the game of Bill Clinton's event. Now all of a sudden it became a Me Too
[50:25.400 --> 50:29.880]  protest. Now all of a sudden the story is seven people protest Bill Clinton. Then at the next
[50:29.880 --> 50:33.800]  event, there's 10. Then at the next event, there's 20. And that's, I think, the snowball you're
[50:33.800 --> 50:40.760]  trying to get rolling. Absolutely. Absolutely. This has nothing to do with me. It's about
[50:40.760 --> 50:47.880]  confronting these people and letting them know that the game is over. And particularly when it
[50:47.880 --> 50:53.800]  comes to Epstein, you know, the, the, you know, today's show wants to bring up Monica Lewinsky
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.920]  and people think that was a tough question. That wasn't a tough question. Why, why you flew on Jeffrey
[50:58.920 --> 51:06.360]  Epstein's airplane 26 times ditching Secret Service. That's a tough question because he has no answer.
[51:07.480 --> 51:10.840]  And of course he doesn't. And all they do is they just escort you out of the building.
[51:11.880 --> 51:16.840]  But I'm just curious because when I watched that at the end of that video, there were people saying,
[51:16.840 --> 51:22.120]  oh, you're insane. You're insane. My response is, no, he's the only sane one in the crowd.
[51:22.120 --> 51:26.680]  He is the only sane one there. He's the only one that still has a brain. He's the only one that
[51:26.680 --> 51:32.680]  still has a memory. He's the only one that still has courage. And I just wonder, was there anyone
[51:32.680 --> 51:36.840]  there in that crowd that even asked you about what you were doing? Was there anyone that was
[51:36.840 --> 51:41.720]  curious about what you were talking about? Or did they all just go right into the brainwash state
[51:41.720 --> 51:49.000]  of mind and say, oh, he's insane. Oh, how rude. Well, well, the crowd shouts you down and that's
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.440]  to be expected. The guy who called me insane was actually Secret Service. He was younger.
[51:54.440 --> 51:59.560]  But, you know, there were, I guess I had contact with about three or four Secret Service and they
[51:59.560 --> 52:03.640]  were, they were all very respectful of the guy, the gentleman who escorted me out. He was Secret
[52:03.640 --> 52:08.680]  Service. He, you know, I was really surprised because I didn't realize it until afterward.
[52:08.680 --> 52:15.240]  He said, sir, please sit down. And I just expected automatically to get kicked out. I didn't even
[52:15.240 --> 52:21.480]  realize I had the opportunity to sit back down until like after the fact. But, you know,
[52:22.280 --> 52:28.280]  no nobody in there was going to get up and support me, even if they, but I kind of got the feeling
[52:28.280 --> 52:33.240]  that, you know, people were like, what is he talking about? So hopefully, you know, I'm not
[52:33.240 --> 52:39.160]  doing it for the crowd, you know, but hopefully somebody would go back and, you know, look up,
[52:39.160 --> 52:42.920]  you know, Jeffrey Epstein, because they probably don't even know about it.
[52:42.920 --> 52:47.160]  No, that's actually interesting. I noticed how he said, please sit down. And I wasn't sure if,
[52:47.160 --> 52:51.160]  if he, if he forced you to get out or what happened there. So I'm glad that you kind of
[52:51.160 --> 52:54.760]  clarified that. But they probably would, they may have kicked you out eventually.
[52:55.800 --> 52:59.720]  But the Secret Service, I mean, I would imagine I would have gotten up again. I would have gotten
[52:59.720 --> 53:04.680]  up again. So they would have kicked me out. Sure. Right. Now, and I would imagine, I mean, we've had,
[53:04.680 --> 53:09.160]  you know, experiences with Secret Service. Obviously, everybody within Secret Service
[53:09.160 --> 53:14.520]  is their own individual outside of whatever their work is. But, you know, we've had Secret Service
[53:14.520 --> 53:18.120]  that, I mean, they, they know what's going on. You know, I mean, they know what's going on.
[53:18.120 --> 53:21.240]  They do their research. They know what their job is and who they're protecting.
[53:22.200 --> 53:27.560]  And they obviously do it well, no matter who the, who the protector or who they're supposed to protect.
[53:27.560 --> 53:32.120]  But it's interesting to me how you're saying the one guy though was young saying that you were insane.
[53:33.480 --> 53:39.880]  Yeah. He was a younger Secret Service agent. I would imagine he may end up having a conversation
[53:39.880 --> 53:42.920]  with some of the elder statesmen there of the Secret Service and they might say,
[53:42.920 --> 53:45.480]  hey, you know, that guy's not as insane as you think, dude.
[53:46.600 --> 53:51.320]  Right. Well, I would, I would hope so. You know, one thing I found very interesting when I went
[53:51.320 --> 53:56.760]  in, because I've seen Bill Clinton confronted, you know, several times and, and he always comes
[53:56.760 --> 54:02.680]  back at people. One years ago, somebody confronted him about being a Bohemian Grove and Bill got
[54:02.680 --> 54:09.320]  all snarky on stage. So I was expecting Bill to get up and say something, you know, to me.
[54:09.880 --> 54:16.120]  And what, what he did, he, he leaned over and he was whispering to James Patterson and James,
[54:16.120 --> 54:21.800]  you can't hear it in the video, but James Patterson actually responded because James Patterson
[54:21.800 --> 54:29.960]  wrote a book about Epstein a couple of years ago that he co-authored a book and he, James Patterson
[54:29.960 --> 54:33.960]  said something about how it's been investigated and there was nothing there. So James Patterson
[54:33.960 --> 54:41.240]  knows he was on the plane, but he says nothing inappropriate happened and which is, you know,
[54:41.240 --> 54:45.720]  26 times. I mean, it's, it's absurd. Well, how does he, what does that mean? How does he know
[54:45.720 --> 54:51.000]  nothing inappropriate? He wasn't on the plane. Exactly. He doesn't, he doesn't know. He doesn't
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.680]  know. That's the thing. And he's saying it like it's some kind of fact, like he was there.
[54:55.240 --> 54:59.560]  It is a good point you make. Usually Bill Clinton responds to this. I mean, we saw it multiple
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.360]  times during the presidential campaigning. He saw it multiple times after he will respond. He
[55:04.360 --> 55:07.720]  actually will respond to the audience. Even, even when he does some of these interviews, I mean,
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.240]  I even gave him credit for standing up for himself. I'm not saying I agreed with him.
[55:11.240 --> 55:14.680]  I even gave him credit in the one interview, I think with CBS Boston, where he's getting
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.920]  called out for the me too stuff. He even stood up for himself there. He even kind of stood up and
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.480]  said, you know, screw you basically. So it is amazing. It seems like this is the first time
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.760]  where Bill has ever kind of been crippled, if you will, by, for thought or response,
[55:29.320 --> 55:32.680]  bringing up the Epstein deal. I think that really shows you that's his Achilles heel.
[55:33.800 --> 55:41.480]  Yeah. Absolutely. And then having James Patterson speak for him, I mean, I was, I was, I was
[55:41.480 --> 55:47.320]  definitely, definitely surprised. I was waiting, I was waiting for him to come, to come back at me.
[55:47.320 --> 55:50.120]  And it just never happened.
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.800]  Well, and you just got to wonder what James Patterson's motivation in this whole deal is.
[55:56.600 --> 56:01.080]  You know, is he trying to sell books? Is he friends with Bill? I don't know the nature of his
[56:01.080 --> 56:06.760]  Jeffrey Epstein book or, or why he wrote that. But now all of a sudden, you know, it's like
[56:07.400 --> 56:10.760]  Patterson, do you realize what you're even standing up for here? I mean, like you said,
[56:10.760 --> 56:15.000]  you have to assume the guy written a book on Epstein, he has to know about the low leader
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.360]  express. He has to know about Bill Clinton ditching secret service to get on that plane 26 times on
[56:20.360 --> 56:26.600]  record. I mean, right. And if he knows that, well, then why is he up there acting like you're crazy
[56:26.600 --> 56:33.560]  for even bringing it up? I couldn't agree more. And I didn't find out, you know, you know, in this
[56:33.560 --> 56:39.160]  whole thing, James Patterson to me was just going to be, you know, an innocent bystander and all
[56:39.160 --> 56:45.160]  this. And a few days before the event, I was, I was looking up James Patterson lived like a
[56:45.160 --> 56:51.400]  mile from Jeffrey Epstein in Palm Beach. So he became very interested in the case. And he wrote
[56:51.400 --> 56:57.560]  the book. I'm like, wow, there's a James Patterson connection here. I mean, that just, you know,
[56:57.560 --> 57:02.760]  that just changed the game for me. And, uh, you know, so, you know, it changed what I was going
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.960]  to do when I was going to talk to James Patterson about it also. I mean, it's come on, but that
[57:07.960 --> 57:13.320]  does kind of give the perfect opportunity to bring up the Epstein Island because Patterson's
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.040]  covered it. Clinton's, you know, flown on the plane. So it is a good opportunity. Well, Howard

[59:53.320 --> 59:59.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:59.800 --> 01:00:17.800]  Okay, I want to get to this clip of Dick Painter or Richard Painter last night on Tucker Carlson.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.840]  Now look, I just have to say, Eric Swalwell, Adam Schiff and now Richard Painter,
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:31.160]  they're all running for Congress, obviously Schiff and Swalwell are already in. But the absolute
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:39.080]  lunacy of these people, I wouldn't care if it wasn't for the fact they're in our government
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.480]  and running for government. Look at how dumb. I'm serious, folks. Look at how straight up
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.680]  dumb Richard Painter is running as a Democrat. I think it's in Minnesota for Senate now.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:59.160]  Now look at what he did on Tucker Carlson last night. This has to be perhaps the dumbest man to
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:06.120]  ever run for government. Listen to this. We know that an FBI and CIA informant on the government
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.440]  payroll, making quite a bit of money from the government, made contact with at least three
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.640]  members of the Trump campaign during the campaign, gathered information from them surreptitiously
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.200]  and passed it back to the Obama administration. Now, you can argue that was justified and I'm
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:28.440]  open-minded, but that's spying. Tell me why it's not spying. The Speaker of the House of Representatives
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.800]  has already talked about this. Paul Ryan, Representative Gowdy, Richard Burr over in the
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.280]  United States Senate Intelligence Committee, and there is a consensus on Republicans and Democrats
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.160]  because they have seen the relevant information, including a lot of them have seen the classified
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.520]  information, which I have not seen, and neither has Fox News seen the classified information.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.200]  And I don't know if this is the news channel or the fiction channel, but we need to focus on
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.240]  that. I pause it right there. Now, he actually claims, or I'm sorry, the Democrats actually
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.640]  claim to have seen that information, but regardless, I want to explain some of you.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:11.480]  This is not satire. This guy's serious. This is Richard Painter, a candidate for Senate.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:17.080]  Richard Painter, the crew points out he talks like the guy, the cockroach guy in Men in Black.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.080]  How is this guy going to win a seat? That's what I'm saying. It's like, how does somebody vote for
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.560]  Eric Swalwell? How does somebody vote for Adam Schiff? How does somebody vote for Nancy Pelosi?
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.240]  We got another video of Nancy Pelosi. I mean, I almost feel bad. I don't even want to cover
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:43.240]  the videos anymore. Every other speech she gives, she's like having a seizure mid-speech. She's about
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:49.400]  to win again. So guys, just fast forward in that video to more of Richard Dick Painter here. Just
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.960]  listen to this guy. This is the type of people we have running for our government. This is so
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:02.600]  embarrassing. This is so pathetic. Let's go back. Hold on. So if you would, please stop with the
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:09.400]  invective and explain to me again slowly why, given the fact set that I just presented to you,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.400]  and I think we can agree that that's true, that that's not spying. No, I don't think we can.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.360]  Under what circumstances would that not be spying? Well, the Speaker of the United States House of
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.760]  Representatives has looked at the facts and Richard Burr over in the Senate in intelligence
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.240]  parroting the same thing, including the classified information, which I have not seen. So what do
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.840]  you think? Hold on. Okay. You've already said that. Hold on. I understand you're repeating yourself
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.880]  and you've just confirmed that whatever Republican leaders say you believe is a little odd you're
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.800]  running as a Democrat in another conversation. But suggest to me what they might know. Hold on.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:49.240]  Suggest to me what they might know. Just speculate if you would. Just go crazy. All right. That's
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.240]  Richard Painter. You've seen the ignorance there. This guy's pathetic. This guy's pathetic. People
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.200]  will vote for that man. Now let's go to Nancy Pelosi, guys. Let's go to clip eight. Listen to Nancy Pelosi.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:05.000]  The president pulled his punch on low prescription drug prices. The president was going to reduce the
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.040]  debt. The Republicans are going to reduce the deficit and reduce the national debt and good
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.680]  paying jobs in America's communities. This morning, the Republicans are meeting on immigration.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:19.320]  Lord knows what will come out with that. Well, hopefully the Lord knows. We've been praying
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:26.520]  very hard on it to also point out the intensity factor that is out there where Democrats are
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:37.080]  maybe 15 points, something like 63. No. 47 is it? I've had concerns about China in three areas.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:46.600]  Certainly the disparity. All right, Nancy. So you got Nancy Pelosi, Diane Feinstein, Adam Schiff,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.160]  Eric Swalwell, Richard Painter. I mean, these are the Democrats, folks. These are the dumbest,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.160]  most pathetic people in this country, and they represent the Democrat party, and people will
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:02.360]  vote for them. Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home. But

[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.720]  All right, Austin Fletcher of Fleckis talks is about to be joining us.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:27.640]  Every video the guy puts out is just gold. And the most recent video,
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.880]  he goes out on the streets and he talks to people about MS 13. Boy, it's amazing what you can get
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:40.520]  liberals to say if you just bring up virtue signaling. Check out Austin Fleckis, Fleckis
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:45.480]  talks most recent video. Did you hear him call MS 13 animals? Yes, I did. What did you think about
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:50.040]  that? I think he's a pig. He's just an animal. I mean, you know, you smell your own, I guess.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.800]  Maybe not all people in that group are animals. No, they're not animals at all. They're human
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.280]  being just like all of us. I think he's a pig. He's just using that as an excuse to,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.200]  I don't know, justify his being such a racist. And then this week, Trump made the comment about MS
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.240]  13 being animals. You hear about that? It's so painful. What do you think about that?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.320]  I think he's criticizing his own American people. What can you say about this guy? He's the animal.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.360]  Would you agree that not all MS 13 members are animals? Absolutely. Cool. And then,
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.480]  it kind of, yeah, exactly. It's just like a negative, always negative in the news, always
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.760]  negative in the news. The guys that are running around gang banging and killing people, they're
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:30.120]  animals. You know, but the rest of the gang, it's a big gang, you know? Absolutely.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:43.880]  All right. I'll tell you, Austin, you know, it is funny, like it's funny and we laugh at this
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:49.400]  stuff. We laugh at Richard Painter, who goes on tire. Paul Ryan of the Republican Party,
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:54.520]  well, you know, tell us his community, you know, Aaron Burr, I got into a duel in 1806.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:01.960]  Gold tie. Vote for me. And it's funny. And these people are pathetic. We laugh at Nancy Pelosi.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.400]  She can't even do simple math. But these are, we, I mean, it's like, but at some gut level,
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:14.040]  when I face the reality that these people are real, that we have to actually vote against these
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.120]  people, stop these people from getting power. I mean, it's like, I can't decide whether I should
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:24.520]  laugh at this or it's like a punch to my gut. Yeah, I feel the same way. And I'm, I feel like
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.960]  it's a punch to the gut a lot of times. And people with that last video, a lot of them say,
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.680]  oh, you probably interviewed a ton of people and picks the five people that actually supported MS
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:41.080]  13. And Owen, I swear to you, those are the five people I interviewed. Those were the five reactions.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.680]  I went five for five. Every single person I asked MS 13, are they animals? Every single person I
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:52.760]  asked in West Hollywood said no. So it's scary. We're in a really weird spot right now where
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:58.680]  the left, just to spite Trump is doubling down on things that are in no way at all American or
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:05.080]  American values. But it goes beyond that. I mean, I understand at this point, why somebody would
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.520]  go against American values, given all the propaganda, propaganda in the education system, the propaganda
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:15.400]  in the media. So at least I can reason with that. I can sit here and I can say, okay, here's how you
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:21.320]  landed to that conclusion. I understand it. But here's what I don't understand. You've got this
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.600]  multiple times, you even see this on mainstream media, where they'll say, or for example, go back,
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.520]  in fact, just in fact, go back to the first clip of this video, go back, start the video over for
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:37.320]  the first guy, listen to what this guy says, just listen to him. Do you hear him call MS 13 animals?
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.720]  Yes, I judge. Think about that. I think he's a pig. Okay, there you go. Pause it right there.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.760]  Pause it right there. Excuse me, that lady. So it's one thing for me to, I understand you,
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.520]  okay, you hate America, you've learned that, whatever. This woman says Trump is bad for calling MS
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:10:00.360]  13 animals. And then she calls Trump a pig. What is that? That's beyond brainwashing,
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.720]  that's beyond propaganda. That's like, learn stupidity or like inherent stupidity. I don't
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:12.760]  even know how to measure this. Yeah, and I think one of the only reasons the left is able to get
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.120]  away with these ridiculous stories, these ridiculous claims is because their base audience has such a
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.880]  short attention span. So they basically engineered like the perfect resistor in a way. It's people
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.880]  with short attention spans, people that don't actually pay attention to politics. A lot of
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.520]  times they think they're educated because they went to college and are in debt. And for that reason,
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.320]  they feel like they're oppressed and they know more than everybody. And a lot of what we're seeing
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.280]  now I think is going beyond politics. I think it's basically becoming down to good versus evil.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.080]  And I think it's coming down to establishment versus anti-establishment. And it's scary to see
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.600]  the left head in this direction because not too long ago liberals were the ones who were for free
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.200]  speech, who were against censorship, who wanted to expose government corruption. And now we're
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.400]  seeing them side with things that I don't think anyone should ever side with. And it's just at a
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:08.760]  base level, you know, un-American, anti-American. Well, and they even go do interviews out on the
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.400]  street where they say they'd rather date an MS-13 gang member than a Trump supporter. And again,
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:20.520]  it's just like, again, that I can measure up to, okay, that's the propaganda. That's the fake news.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.640]  I can see how they could reach that conclusion. Again, though, it's like, it goes beyond propaganda
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:31.160]  and brainwashing to a point where you're so unintellectual and so stupid that you would say
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.520]  Trump is bad for calling people an animal, he's a pig. I mean, and that's what you deal with out here.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.920]  And I don't know what to do. I mean, good and evil, right and wrong. I mean,
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.160]  I don't even know what to say. How do you possibly? So that's just a vote now in America. And there's
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.920]  probably millions of people like that woman. That's just a vote now in America. It's like,
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.960]  we have to realize we're voting against that. I think that you put it rightly. They have created,
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.160]  they have manufactured with the propaganda and the brainwashing, a perfect ignorant class of,
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:06.600]  quote unquote, resistors who think they're fighting the establishment that are actually the front
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:12.600]  lines for the establishment and people need to understand these people exist. They're now voter
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.720]  blocks in these big cities. You have to go out and vote. Those people will control our destiny
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:24.040]  if we don't go out and vote. Exactly. And you're absolutely right. It does come down to the vote,
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:30.760]  but I think the good news is every time the left takes a stand and supports MS 13 or,
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.680]  you know, promotes the Me Too movement. Meanwhile, they're all sexual predators in
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.400]  Hollywood. And every time they take a stand and contradict themselves, I think their audience
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.200]  shrinks just a little bit. And it's the people in the middle, the rational people, the centrists,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.240]  the independence, the maybe even classical liberals who are now looking around and saying,
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:55.320]  wait, why is my party defending MS 13? Why are we pretending that Hollywood is in a toxic culture?
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.520]  And these are the people that are going to start heading to the right, just like we're seeing,
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.800]  you know, across the board. So while the far left will always be the far left and the protesters
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.000]  will always be pretty much brainwashed and convinced that Trump is the devil himself,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.800]  everyone else in the middle who is somewhat rational will start waking up. And their audience,
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.960]  I think, is shrinking by the day for that reason. Well, I think you're definitely right. The only
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.960]  concern I have, and while it's harder to do this on a national level to rig a presidential election,
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.200]  they tried it. But in these local elections, I mean, these electronic voting machines,
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.440]  that's their last line of defense. I mean, that's their ace in the hole, man. I mean,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.160]  how does Maxine Waters get 10 people to show up at her last campaign event? You can't even make this
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:45.160]  up. 10 people show up at Maxine Waters' campaign event just 48 hours before the primary voting,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:51.720]  and then she gets 40,000 people to vote for her? I'm sorry, folks. That doesn't add up.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.600]  You don't have to be a kook to do that math. Now, Nancy Pelosi might not be able to do that
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.600]  math, but I hope you're smarter than Nancy Pelosi. So again, how is it, and we can get more into
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.880]  this on the other side, 10 people show up to a Maxine Waters' final campaign event 48 hours
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.000]  before the primary votes, and then 40,000 people show up to vote for her instead of Omar Navarro,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.760]  who actually gets crowds, who actually has a following locally and nationally? I mean,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.200]  I don't even believe it, but that's what we have going on. So, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:31.800]  I don't know what the answer is when it comes to making sure that these votes are tallyed properly
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.880]  other than following the law at which most states have, you have to have a paper ballot.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.760]  Now here in Texas, they just totally ignore laws like that. And that's when why David Knight goes
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.720]  to talk to the commissioner of voting here. He literally runs away and hides in his office
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.480]  because they won't answer the question as to why they're breaking the law. So we're going to get
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.840]  more to that on the other side with Austin Fletcher. But in the meantime, ladies and gentlemen,

[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.240]  we in congress stand by israel in congress we speak with one voice on the subject of israel
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.200]  that's trump that's nancy polosi i take the constitution you get the point you can see the
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:58.360]  full video on fleckis talks youtube channel again though you know and look i'm not even you know
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:03.720]  this is this is actually an easy thing that you can go out and do this video is actually kind of less
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.880]  i think exposing how ignorant these people are than the other videos where they you know compare
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:16.840]  trump to a pig but he's bad for saying ms-13 is animals because this that to me that austin actually
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:21.800]  falls on the politicians that lie to these people see again i can reason with that i can understand
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.520]  how they how they can come to that i can reason and understand how they would reach that conclusion
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.360]  and think that that's only trump that said that because it's their own party that lies to them
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.560]  it's the democrats that lie to them it's the democrats that talk out of both sides of their
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:39.320]  mouth so i can understand how they could confuse that issue and be deceived in that video but again
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:44.920]  though do you think that this even wakes people up to understand how much they've been conned i mean
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:49.320]  that's obviously the goal but do you think it works on these people or do they just go right back
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:55.160]  to hating trump i think yeah that is definitely the goal whether or not it works kind of comes down
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:59.880]  to the echo chambers and what people are actually seeing online i think the echo chambers at this
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.600]  point have been structured in a way where the conservatives see the conservative stuff and
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:09.240]  the liberals see liberal stuff and that just kind of creates an atmosphere where you meet
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.400]  someone with opposing views it's hard to understand where they come from it's hard to believe how
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:18.360]  someone could you know get to the mental place where they love trump or they hate trump depending
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:24.200]  on what side you're on so i hope it gets to them like a video like this my goal was to just have
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:29.400]  people realize that politics in the most in the most recent election in the past year or actually
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.200]  two years at this point is completely changing it used to be something different it used to be
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:39.400]  something people could agree to disagree on but now politics is heading in direction where you're
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.960]  either you know for america or against america and i hope with this video people see hey brock
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:51.240]  obama made some comments a few years ago that would be deemed racist or insensitive today or
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:56.600]  hey nancy polosi was you know used to be an advocate for um stronger immigration i'm a
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:02.040]  stronger immigration reform and um you know securing the border at certain points and when
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:08.600]  they hear these things i just hope that they realize that politics now has become so obsessed
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:16.200]  with trump that they would rather take on anti-american values and anti-american policies just to
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.080]  spite the guy so i just want to expose that that and to the people i just want people to realize
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:26.360]  that they've hated the man so much that they're ignoring what this country is all about and what
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:34.280]  this country could be well and i look at these people and especially in that last video they
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.280]  don't really seem politically charged i mean you're talking to the guys out there dressed like
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.680]  superheroes right they're doing their whole street thing they don't really seem politically charged
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.640]  they're not really coming into this like angry at trump or fired up about their politics right
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:52.360]  and you can tell that they're just general people and they may not be politically inclined any
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:59.640]  which way but they do absorb you know the culture they do absorb the mainstream message they do get
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:04.760]  the trickle down propaganda whether or not they intentionally ingested or not and you can kind
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:10.920]  of tell though that they just go with it there is no foundation for their beliefs it's just what
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:16.120]  they've been taught what they've learned via the trickle down propaganda and this is why it's dangerous
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:22.120]  for both sides really it's dangerous for america because these people vote these weak minded people
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:28.760]  vote that fall for propaganda and fall for lies go out and vote with an absent mind and that's the
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.280]  democrat voter base just look at the videos you do you prove that but it's also dangerous for
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:42.440]  the democrats because if and i don't know what it is but if that zeitgeist breaks for them
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:50.040]  if that skeleton key to their mind opens it finally their game is over because somebody
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.320]  like that obviously weak minded can be easily swayed whether or not it whether or not they
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:59.000]  absorb it or not is the different issue that i guess is the question because they're obviously
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.560]  weak minded they can obviously swayed but do they still have the ability to think for themselves
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.280]  do they still still have the ability to look deeper with critical thinking and say oh wow
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.680]  i was deceived by this propaganda i need to go back and look so it's kind of dangerous on both
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:17.240]  ends it's dangerous for america that you have these weak minded uninformed voters that are the
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.800]  democrat voter base but it's also dangerous for the democrats because they're so weak minded and
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:28.200]  fragile they really could be flipped like that if whatever the proper formula is given to them i
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:34.520]  truly believe yeah i totally agree with you i think the far left and the radicals and the antithas
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:40.680]  of the world um they'll always be far left and they'll never come around but i think the most
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.800]  valuable people in that group in the left leaning group are the people in the middle who just don't
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.360]  follow politics and that's the quote they use oh i don't follow politics and that used to be me for
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:57.080]  a while too in college i thought obama was great because he was hope and changed first black president
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.360]  united the country and i thought wow that's who we should elect and i really didn't do any research
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.480]  i didn't actually look into it i read headlines i was on twitter and i kind of just got the feel
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:13.640]  for politics and i think the feel for politics is an outdated way to do it and it's a harmful way to
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.720]  do american politics and i think those are the people that are waking up so a lot of the people
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:22.920]  on the conservative side especially were left leaning at one point a lot of people that are my age
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.240]  maybe you could attest to this too maybe years back you thought you were a liberal only because
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.480]  you didn't do the full deep dive but once you actually looked into the things and the policies
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.360]  and the politicians you start leaning conservative and i think most conservatives come from a
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.720]  liberal place at some point in their life and i think most liberals or most leftists were liberals
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.800]  and leftists their entire lives yeah i mean i don't know if i would ever put necessarily a liberal
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.360]  identity on it but i think it's the same thing as you you know what they what the old saying goes
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.560]  if you're not a liberal by 20 you don't have a heart if you're not a conservative by 30 you
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.720]  don't have a brain i think it goes to what you're saying like the same thing actually i mean when
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:02.120]  i was in college it's the same thing i was liberal on social issues like okay you know i don't care
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.560]  what people do sexually uh i blame the guns i thought the guns were the problem because that's
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.400]  what the propaganda you know was put in front of me and then you got to do the research you
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:16.280]  understand it better but even then i remember going around just because i was such a cynic and i've
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.840]  always liked to be devil's advocate i remember going around university Missouri 2008 and and
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.000]  i even felt probably on the liberal perspective but i remember going around not really falling
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.680]  for obama not really believing in it because i hated politicians and i would just ask people i
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:33.000]  would say because they all loved obama i would say would you vote for a prisoner of war instead
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.680]  of obama and they all said yes and i go really cuz mccain's a prisoner of war and they're like oh
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.600]  really i didn't even know that so it just shows how ignorant these people are austin fletcher thank

[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:27.480]  to take back the nation it's oh and shawyer you're listening to the alex jones show leo zagami is
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:34.760]  about to join me leo zagami dot com is where you can find all of his reports and stories and before
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.320]  i get to leo we're going to talk about the nationalist uprising in italy talk about the
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.960]  bill de berg group and what they're meeting on right now but before i get to leo who's an expert
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:47.800]  on those two things i just have to get this off my chest because it's really bothering me
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.800]  and it all comes back to the same issue i was talking about from unfortunately and this is just
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.800]  what we this is the the common nomenclature the left versus the right where just look at the
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:06.440]  blatant double standards that the left has right now but it's not even a double standard this is like
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.240]  i don't even know how to this is beyond mental illness this is like
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:19.480]  beyond brainwashing it's like almost like a controlled mind slave seriously that's how it
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:25.080]  looks like that is the only thing i can think of to describe this where anybody could consider this
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:32.200]  path of thinking to be rational and logical the only way is if you are a mind slave think about
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:39.160]  this so you've got the spying on the trump campaign story right okay they say they spied on the trump
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.560]  campaign they didn't they did they didn't they did okay they did but we won't call it spying
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.160]  well whatever they justify it and they say we were spying on trump for his protection he should
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:55.400]  be thanking the fbi but if that was the case why didn't they spy on hillary clinton who had the
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.480]  open servers illegal servers with classified information on it but then more importantly
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:07.560]  and this when it comes to the mind slave aspect how then are you going to say that you spied on
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:14.120]  trump for his protection but he's the target and he's the enemy think about that how do you hold
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:20.840]  those two thoughts in your mind and consider it to be rational it's impossible if trump is the bad
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.600]  guy and the target of the investigation which is what you claim then why are you saying you're
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:33.240]  there to protect him if you're investigating a bank robber okay and you're spying on the bank robber
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.800]  and they say look you illegally spied on the bank robber you don't say i was spying on the bank
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:44.440]  robber for his protection no that's insane this is what they're saying these are mind slaves and
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:51.880]  again they say trump was attempting to get intelligence from russia well or or he was
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.720]  in communication with putin to get intelligence on hillary from russia well if that's the case
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.440]  why are all these random meetings being scheduled with don jr and avonka trump and russian lawyers
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.680]  why wouldn't trump just be speaking to putin directly so again there's no rationale there
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.280]  but think about this they say trump is bad for wanting to get intelligence from russia which
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:17.080]  he never did and they say that eric swalwell and the rest of the democrats say trump needs to be
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.560]  turned into the fbi for trying to get information from russia but wait a second again you take a
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:29.320]  step back hillary clinton the democrat party and the mainstream media literally all took information
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:35.880]  from russia in the face of the russian dossier do you see the madness here there's the tweet
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.640]  if you're in a campaign for federal office and a foreign agent offers you dirt on your opponent
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.840]  you should tell the fbi well what if you're in a campaign for federal office and you pay a foreign
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:51.000]  agent for information on your opponent then what that's what hillary clinton did so this this this
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.200]  russian spygate trump madness has really reached levels beyond proportion anyone who still believes
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.880]  this stuff i now consider a mined slave no longer brainwashed no longer ignorant literal
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:06.760]  mined slaves now that i have that off my chest let's bring in leo zigami now leo feel free to
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:13.080]  comment on what i just laid out or you have a story right now at leo zigami dot com builder
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:19.400]  burgers arrive in italy to take orders from the vatican they sent the cardinal down there to have
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:25.480]  a secret meeting with the builder burgers what do you think was discussed at that meeting what do
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:42.280]  you think is on the vatican's mind right now okay um leo um i'm not sure what's going on here
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:47.400]  we're not hearing leo zigami guys so okay there we go leo all right leo what do you think is going
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:53.240]  on what is the vatican trying to get out to the builder burgers right now well the vatican has a
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:59.480]  lot to explain on their presence there that's why mario borgetzio from the northern league who is
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:07.480]  their friend of mine actually have his card here wrote just a letter to the pope he's a european
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:16.840]  parliament member of the northern league and he is asking the pope to basically explain why his
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:24.360]  secretary of state is number two in command is with these people because there is no reason why
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:31.080]  secretary of state of the vatican should be amongst all these powerful elitarians if not to support
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:37.560]  them in reality uh paroline is bringing a very strong message of support from the pope
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:45.800]  which is against populism is against what they define as fake news which in reality is real news
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:53.000]  and all this is happening now silenced by the majority of the italian media because we had a
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.880]  couple of articles when the builder burgers arrived on the 6th of june but after that all the main
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:07.400]  media tv radio newspapers have been completely silent about this meeting apart from the locals
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:14.440]  from turing who of course were shocked in knowing that they had a meeting of the builder burgers in
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:22.200]  front of their house and even the people who are from the five star movement in power in the city of
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:26.440]  turing because the city of turing has a mayor from the five star movement which is one of the two
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:33.960]  populist organization which has helped this populist uprising in italy they're asking questions
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.480]  because there is not been many answers apart from the fact that of course there is a massive
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:47.160]  security operation in place and even salvini the minister of interior of the northern league has
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:53.080]  not yet talked about it so i i called my friends from the northern league at their headquarters
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.280]  earlier on this afternoon to know what was happening and they said that they are waiting
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:04.760]  for salvini studying very well the situation because he wants to make a public announcement
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.400]  about it in the meantime though manio borgetzio who is a well-known politician from the northern
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:16.920]  league has already made his his idea known that basically the pope shouldn't participate to this
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:23.160]  kind of meeting and he should explain to his believers to his followers why he he has sent
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.880]  parolee in there but we know why he sent the parolee in there he sent parolee in there to
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:35.880]  cosplay against donald j trump before the midterms elections and of course what is happening also at
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:44.600]  the g7 is very important also here in italy because our new prime minister konte has immediately
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:53.160]  supported with the tweet donald j trump and his open invitation for russia to rejoin the group
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:41:01.720]  and become again the g8 so josep konte is amongst the the only probably the only one
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.680]  apart from trump who supports this idea well actually i just want to say that prime minister
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:12.200]  abe from japan has also has also come out and said that too so you've got italy japan the united
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.280]  states all calling for russia to be back into the summit and i'm just curious though because
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:22.760]  and leo he knows what he's talking about with this stuff and and sometimes for new audience members
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.840]  you know this may seem a little bit out there but this is the reality of the situation and i just
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:33.240]  want to take it to another level here leo the secret societies have different plantations
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:40.040]  or means to control the world population politics has been one of those means they're losing politics
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.600]  right now they're losing their ability to control the politics so i'm curious because i kind of think
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.320]  there might be something else to this visit to the bill de berg group from the vatican i think that
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.680]  they may be realizing that they cannot revive their political stranglehold on the world and so
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.280]  now they're trying to figure out how they can rearmament their control over history and the
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.320]  secret history of humanity and the secret history that the vatican knows about what are your thoughts
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.360]  on the potential of the vatican sending this representation to the bill de berg group to
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.240]  see how they can maintain their control on the secret human history just in 30 seconds we'll
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:20.680]  get more into this on the other side one of the devices used to keep the control that is being
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:28.040]  discussed right now the bill de berg is quantum computers they will be used to control everybody
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:35.320]  through 5g so 5g and quantum computers are in discussion at the moment at the bill de berg meeting
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.520]  okay we're going to get into that and more on the other side but that is key with the ai being
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:45.960]  rolled out right now the 5g being rolled out right now they of course trying to create the one world
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:51.800]  government which would be all controlled by the ai 5g so that's on the other side that's what the
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.960]  bill de berg group wants sovereign countries and sovereign citizens are standing up though

[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.800]  be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:14.920]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:21.160]  rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:27.560]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:33.480]  heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:39.960]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:46.200]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:51.800]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.440]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it

[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.960]  going to take over right here i'm going to try to be as calm as i can as i've got four pages of
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:36.760]  notes so i'm here ladies and gentlemen covering undoubtedly some of the most dangerous information
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:42.360]  i've ever covered on air there's a reason they want to shut down info wars and it's because
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:50.200]  they know that we're able to put out countervailing narratives to what they officially said anthony
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:56.440]  bordain tony bordain is one of the most popular tv hosts in the world he's the only successful
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:04.280]  thing on cnn he dominated netflix he has a little nine-year-old daughter he just got remarried
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:12.040]  and then he dies in a crappy hotel room in paris and cnn's brian stelter is the first to tell us
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:17.960]  that he died of suicide hanging himself now i knew he'd been critical of hillary
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:22.760]  said that uh you know that that she shouldn't have basically defended weinstein
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.000]  said it was shameful i knew he talked about joked about feeding trump himlock
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.160]  and i thought you know a lot of these rich powerful hollywood folks from a suicide maybe he
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.640]  did commit suicide but i said the fact that he had a lot of powerful enemies he should at least be
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:47.080]  investigating i said that in a tweet i got a call from my source who is even willing for me to now
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:54.120]  say who he is but he was very emotional and he'd already let me in on this a few months ago and
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.200]  he's actually already talked about this on air but i'm just not going to do that at this point
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:06.600]  i'm going to shoot an hd report as soon as i'm done here and i'm going to then reach out to some
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:14.440]  other people but here's the bottom line i was told several months ago that a bunch of other big
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:20.520]  people are going to start going public and then of course you saw kanya and then a few weeks ago
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.800]  we said that even more big cultural icons some of the biggest ones in media some of the biggest
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:31.640]  people in culture were going to be going public and so this morning when i woke up and i had seen
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:37.640]  that tony bordain had committed suicide supposedly i went what is it about that what was it in the
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:43.400]  news what so i was sitting there search engineering for like an hour well what was it why was it
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:48.600]  about the bordain and then all of a sudden the producer calls me about an hour ago and said
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:54.280]  right i forgot off air with you guys and said you have got to call you this source he's really upset
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:51:02.280]  right now and i went oh my gosh he's talked about it on air ladies and gentlemen
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:16.600]  this bordain was a powerful cultural figure had more dain had learned about the big awakening
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.240]  that was happening and he had met with elon musk who's already very good friends with
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:32.440]  us in marocco in marrakesh at a big solar farm experimental farm and i'll just leave it at that
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:42.600]  and they had taped an 11 and a half minute episode of the upcoming tv series that he was
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:47.320]  wrapping up in paris this is two months ago nobody knows this and i'm laying these facts
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:54.200]  as people understand he was in marocco on a big vista at a wind farm i'm gonna leave it at that
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:59.880]  i've talked to folks that were there i've been authorized to tell you more maybe i just should
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:07.480]  but i'm gonna stop right there for now and musk and them had a had a cognet west of it
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:17.640]  and bordain was planning to basically do a cognet west but just about the whole global
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:22.200]  awakening everything that was about to happen and it's believed that this is a message directly
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.920]  to elon musk who's been coming out talking about the mainstream media the globalist
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:34.760]  how they're planning an ai a technocracy takeover and so i can't tell you without getting
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:40.120]  into too much specifics but i've specifically been on the phone with spacex and individuals
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:47.480]  at the center of the musk operation um in the last hour so i'm authorized to say that at this point
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:54.520]  and i told folks i said we have to go public a part of this we're all in danger and there's a
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:59.240]  lot of stuff behind the scenes some sabotage and stuff going on as well that we've become aware of
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:05.080]  even inside info wars right now they're making big moves right now ladies and gentlemen and i want
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:13.960]  everybody to understand that this is real this is for all the marbles and um it is just unbelievable
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:20.040]  i mean i've got like five six pages and notes here it is also believed that just like with
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:26.600]  stanley cubrick dying i know his daughter well his protege right before they were going to have
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:33.800]  the fungal cut of i's why shut they cut 24 minutes out it's the same thing here uh the cnn and then
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:40.120]  the parent company that sold it to him his company they're now looking for pressure
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:51.640]  from the 0.0 company to not release the new series but to make it a retrospective
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:54:00.120]  of looking back on bordain also they do not have to release not just this episode but once he decided
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:05.000]  to do this with elon musk this was two months ago they shot dozens and dozens of other segments
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:11.160]  that he then began working in the whole awakening around the world and bordain had decided to go
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:19.240]  the kanye west route and that is 100 from people there with him meeting with him
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:26.680]  um elon musk hold on yards elon musk is in complete danger right now again if he hangs

[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.880]  to be here at this moment my wife just walked in here honey i've just got contact from spacex
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:17.240]  just talked to him all on the phone they definitely killed uh tony bordain but that's what they think
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.480]  and they message the musk he's gonna go public the kanye west you believe this oh i just walked
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:28.920]  to the hotel room anyways i've got to work all day now uh it is it is just unbelievable and
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:35.160]  i mean that's where we are as a country it's where we are as a world this is a big message
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.640]  everybody shut your mouth you're dead and this is them coming out of the woodwork you know they
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.600]  can't kill trump so they did the next best thing and i mean just think about it 61 just remarry
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:52.520]  totally happy nine-year-old daughter uh you know little daughter and that's what's going on and
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:58.440]  people's families are being threatened all this stuff is going on and but evil is in its death
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:05.240]  rows right now and this evil satanic system i was also told you scared of anybody who is seen as
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:11.480]  outside the system or seen as like a world traveler or seen as an independent type good guru okay
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:16.920]  they don't like musk they totally hating those who's exposing the ai computers the world government
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:22.200]  how the globalist worship ai i told you that you know any game that's really what they believe uh
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.000]  they they they didn't like the way uh tony was going talking about about the clintons and others
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.600]  i talked to folks that are again our friends with him spent a lot of time with him the him and musker
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.960]  gotten very very close they've been friends for years and he wasn't quote having any of it and a
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.520]  lot of this is classified a lot of this stuff's secret so i couldn't even be told all of it
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:49.080]  but i was already aware of the meeting i was already aware of the fact that this production
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:59.560]  was coming out from um marocco from marrakesh and so this is just um unprecedented he was about to
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:05.400]  be part of the bigger plan and so they're very upset about what is in these episodes not just
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:11.720]  the one with elon two months ago in marrakesh marocco but whatever got kicked off after that
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.720]  and what bordain was saying and what bordain was saying that he was going to do
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:21.640]  and the fact that he had been coming out against weinstein and the clintons they saw him as too
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:31.800]  powerful and off the reservation and again it's just completely out of context for him to die
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:38.520]  like this and for them to instantly say it's a suicide no investigation um we're gonna go to break
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:46.760]  in a few minutes also um joe rogan was brought up i like joe i'm real busy i see some of his podcast

[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:36.680]  wow to be clear ladies and gentlemen i was told by the sources involved with space sacks and
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:43.560]  he won musk very high level uh people that work directly with musk uh on a routine basis that
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:49.480]  he was out quietly as an emissary trying to get other people to go public like khanye west did
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:54.840]  and kim kardash and all these other people realize the power they have is these as these
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:03.400]  reality tv stars and hip hop stars and bordain had basically been gotten on board and had this
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:09.000]  you know they were i mean he's already really good friends with you on musk and that this basically
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  happened and i also can tell everybody um that zero point zero and the companies and cnn
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:23.320]  if any of them want to say this is it true or any of them think they're going to edit anything
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:32.680]  and stop what we're doing folks have the 11 minute 50 second or whatever it is clip it's 11
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:40.280]  you know 11 50 i said 11 30 earlier we have the clip we have the approved segment with helan musk
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:50.520]  and with mr bordain and the khanye west awakening and the khanye west type statements the bigger
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:57.000]  plan is talked about space travel a future for humans not a post industrial world not a
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.520]  technotronic microchip planet not the worshiping of the ai gods with humanity going to that level
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:09.800]  so go ahead and do anything to our sources do anything to me and it will be released
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:16.520]  that's a little tidbit i've got like five more pages here and quite frankly i hand wrote these i
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.040]  need to go type them up i need to really think about this i need to get this out but i as soon
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:28.280]  as i hung the phone up i called in and commandeered the program because this is huge and again
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.400]  i'm not a hundred percent saying he was killed i'm saying smart people that were friends with him
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.200]  i say he was happy he was great he was looking forward to his life he said he was the happiest
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:46.040]  ever he was doing jiu jitsu he was working out he said he was just he uh bordain said decades ago
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:51.080]  he was bummed out and unhappy and was unhealthy he said now he was just super healthy lost all
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:57.800]  this way was totally happy just remarried and they said that they believe that he was killed as a
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:05.480]  message to elon muskin to everybody else in the whole khanye west awakening movement you come out
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:13.880]  we're going to kill you so it is believed that he was killed at a block just like jim morrison
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:20.200]  and right there in that hotel room in some grungy crap whole place hanging himself supposedly
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:24.840]  leaving his nine-year-old daughter behind and all the rest of that who believes this
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.840]  who believes any of this it's so classic for people to come into your hotel room
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:41.960]  hang your ass and just kill you but you know what you're not going to stop because culture will speak
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:49.720]  and people are really going to want to know what happened here you know just take jone rivers what
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:55.480]  she said about the first lady and the fact that she's got shoulders like a linebacker
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.840]  and you know all the rest of it and think about how she was dead right after that
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:07.800]  the whole point is is these people don't play games and they think that they're going to intimidate
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:12.520]  everybody and they're so afraid just like obama's on record drudger portling to our story calling
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.840]  up jaycee and saying you get to every hip-hop rapper or music person you know and you tell them
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:23.080]  do not go to trump do not meet with trump do not do this we control culture this is about hollywood
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:31.320]  propping up it's control of culture and so that's what's going on here anthony or dane
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:39.000]  was about to go public it was about to join in the huge global awakening and the bigger plan and
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.680]  now he's dead and we're supposed to not talk about it or discuss it the most basic stuff
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:54.760]  the bryan skelter says well seen and you don't own but your board day of the truth is coming up

[02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:19.320]  so if you work with Elon musk at the highest levels
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:27.640]  and you shoot a tv show with him and and say mordain two months ago and mordain is really
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:33.320]  close friends you could say almost best friends with Elon musker was he died we're told by suicide
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:37.800]  just instantly that's the news open and shut go back to sleep nothing to see here move along
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:44.680]  and then i sit there and i talk to someone that told me mordain was going to be going public and
[02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:49.000]  told me to see Elon musk information was going to come out where they sit there in marrakesh
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.240]  talking about the future at a solar farm and how they talk about how there's a choice whether
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:59.720]  humanity is going to go into the future and we're going to build a world for humanity whether we're
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.880]  going to build one for the machines and the top technocrats have decided to get rid of humanity
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:11.000]  and Elon musk lays it out to mordain as he'd done privately already in mordain that has a
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:20.200]  transformation and an awakening on video and then he went on to take dozens of other segments
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:29.000]  in the next two months but now mordain is dead he had his own production company 0.0
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:35.800]  and now contractually he has the final cut edit but just one directors always want their final
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:43.480]  cut don't they but just like somebody else had the final cut who was his name stanley kubrick
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:50.360]  probably the greatest director ever and his daughter told me and me alone what really happened to her
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:55.240]  dad and i'm sworn to secrecy on it but i already knew a lot of it and you know she really co-directed
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:08:04.920]  some of his last films and what she told me was what we already know now don't and she told me
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:08.920]  she said the next few years you're going to become the biggest thing in the news they're going to try
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:14.120]  to destroy you they're going to come after you but it's not going to work and i met another lady
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:22.840]  a lady worth four billion dollars in time and she was going to leave it that told me the same
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:28.040]  thing six years ago these people know a lot folks and there's people in the system that are just as
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:33.800]  smart as we are smarter who don't want to be in the system but who have been terrorized their
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:40.280]  entire lives to keep them in this damn cult so you understand that ladies and gentlemen that
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.760]  kubrick was going to release eyes wide shut and tell you how it really works
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:52.760]  but they killed him and they cut 24 minutes out of it and ladies and gentlemen that's exactly
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:09:00.840]  where all of this points when stanley kubrick drops dead and there's no autopsy or tony bourdain
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:06.040]  drops dead and we're just told boom he's dead suicide that's it case closed when somebody
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.440]  worth you know 100 million dollars like bourdain when somebody who's a top culture person with
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:16.520]  the only people in mainstream media that still has any pull and they're throwing all the other
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:22.600]  ones overboard like charlie rose and then magically he dies we got a nine-year-old
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:29.880]  daughter and just got remarried and was told elon musk just days ago how happy he was and
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:33.480]  i was the best time i was live now he felt so good about what they were about to do
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:42.520]  you see the word is bourdain was inches from going to the white house
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:46.600]  and actually shaking trump's hand but it doesn't matter we're already winning aren't we
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.600]  this is a message to elon musk and i've been told it's a message to joe rogan
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.240]  and i've been told it's a message to me and all of you to shut up and lay down well you
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:03.800]  know what bill clinton's coming to town sunday and i would try to be out there demonstrating
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:08.200]  outside that everybody else is getting their tickets you imagine you go in there and you bring
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:14.520]  up jerry eppstein the way to express harvey windsfield on board the little kids getting flown
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:20.040]  out and some of the same islands have the nexium sex cult brought out to it one person gets up
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:24.600]  they get taken out another person gets up they get taken out imagine that happens everywhere
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:30.760]  these people need to understand we're ready to do whatever it takes they keep sending me messages
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:34.600]  hey we're suing you hey we're coming after you hey we're demonizing everywhere hey i get it
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:38.760]  i've seen the demonic look in your eyes i've seen the demonic look in your servant's eyes
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:45.640]  and i want to be all the way away from you is very powerful then garrison piece that he just did
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:53.240]  about bernie sanders and he took the bernie sanders minion and perfectly put him into cartoon form
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:11:00.600]  with this crazy cult like stare the guy's got this thing there in my face and turned it into a poster
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:05.400]  turned into an image that we can pull that up but i'm telling you when you look in the eyes of these
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:12.440]  people and they're giggling and they're laughing as a minion but above them is the cold dark steely
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:18.280]  frozen hatred of someone who wants to dominate you with their will and who has sworn themselves to
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.400]  turn themselves to evil and turn themselves over to it you realize you are dealing with pure satanism
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:29.240]  and people like portain and cognate and others who aren't inherently evil but have been around
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:34.440]  these elites and they know they don't want to be with jc and hillary they know they don't want
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:41.160]  to be with these people they know as it comes down to the wire of 5g and planetary sterilization
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:48.920]  and half the population dying of cancer they know that it's time to fight back and to live
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:55.480]  their life forces coming back it's always darkest right before the dawn and i'm going to collect
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.400]  myself and get all these documents together because this is history happened just like hillary
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:04.760]  called me the dark heart just like we helped all of us together re-engineer the reboot of 1776
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:09.400]  we don't act like we're important but all of us are important so of course i get the phone call
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:16.920]  to know what's really going on and i would advise elon musk as he's already done to go public about
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:21.480]  how the media is controlled and has to disdain and hates us and about the ai gods and the plan
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:27.800]  for exterminism and all the things he's already said elon has to go public right now with everything
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.560]  where they'll continue to manipulate his stockdown soros will buy it all up as he's already trying
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:40.520]  to do an awful takeover and they will end up killing elon so when they kill elon musk the
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:47.800]  south african super engineer because he was pro-human just remember that they'll tell you it was
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:55.000]  suicide and no investigation just like everybody else because as we are currently speaking they're
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.880]  sending a message to him and if he cowers they'll kill him for sure if he stands
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:05.080]  he will win they probably won't kill him but regardless humanity will make it all of us have
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:13.000]  to make that decision now but they were never going to let orday their prize because he had
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.760]  some soul he had some humanity he wasn't one of the dead mummies but he was still a modern leftist
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:28.120]  they can't have one of their prized weapons fall into humanity's hands and so like an old warship
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:33.480]  that they don't want to send back out to sea they blow it up in the harbor like an old cannon you
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:43.240]  spike so they'll ever fire again or an old sword you break that's what they did i mean that's way
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:47.800]  more plausible than oh he just committed suicide at the top of his career at 61 with a nine-year-old
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:54.600]  daughter just remarried totally happy telling people he'd never been happier i mean i talked to
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:14:03.400]  folks that you know hang out with him that they drink with him everything they say no way and i've
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:10.360]  got all these other notes here who is killing the culture kate spade and her billions magically dead
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.760]  and if it isn't suicide why is mental illness spreading why why is suicide up everywhere and
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.400]  the more TV we watch the more smartphones the more prozac we take you know going down that angle
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:28.440]  what's this what's the spirit there's an awakening right now ladies and gentlemen trump just came
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:33.000]  out and said we should meet with the russians this is insane why aren't they in the g7 anymore
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.160]  why don't we kick them out it should be the g8 it's all happening sanity is coming back
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:46.440]  into the world i've also been told we should look at trump at the fema meeting yesterday
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:51.960]  when he takes his water bottle off the table and puts it between his legs and it looks at
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:57.720]  pence and pence does the same thing as a signal that's a classified signal and i have not even
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:03.000]  been able to i'm not the i can't be told what the signal is but it deals with the whole child
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.640]  trafficking and the fact of the whole thing's going down that was a signal to people in the
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:11.640]  pentagon what trump did at that fema meeting yesterday when he takes the water bottle off the
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:18.760]  table folks want you to know that as well it looks at pence and he does it open and shut
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:25.400]  found dead as he's found dead we're told open and shut suicide nothing to see here go away

[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:31.240]  oh and shawyer you're listening to the alex jones show seth rich antonin scalia anthony bourdain
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:46.040]  you know i would say the safest thing you could do right now if you were uh
[02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:53.160]  elon musk kanya west type who wants to step out into the public sphere against the new world
[02:20:53.160 --> 02:21:02.520]  order against the mental slavery you better come out publicly before it's too late that's the answer
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:13.320]  to this now the same principle applies to the public protest like going to a bill clinton book tour
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:19.480]  and standing up and saying bill we know why you rode on the lolita express 26 times bill
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:26.680]  and if you have 10 people do that in succession at one event it's game over for them folks
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:34.440]  standing up to these people is the first step to victory and so that's why this sunday
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.920]  at 6 p.m outside bass concert hall here in austin texas we are having a hashtag me to protest
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:46.120]  if they're going to send people like bill clinton out there if they're going to send the globalist
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:55.400]  secret society operatives out there it's our duty to stand up in their face as a representation
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:22:02.680]  of we the people that are not going to let this country go to scum like the clintons and the obamas
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:11.800]  or even the bushes to be fair let's get leo zegami back on here because i want to put a cap
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:15.720]  on the conversation we were having before alex jones broke the big news on anthony bourdain
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:23.240]  with his sources leo how much stock would you put in my theory that the reason why the vatican
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:27.400]  is going to meet secretly with the bill the burgers is because they realize they're losing
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:32.360]  their stranglehold on the control of politics in the world but they want to make sure that they
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:38.600]  can cement their hold over history secret human history all the artifacts they have hidden at the
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:45.080]  vatican what do you think the odds are that that has something to do with this vatican meeting with
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:54.840]  the bill the berks well first of all anthony bourdain it was he had a girlfriend in italy who was
[02:22:54.840 --> 02:23:00.520]  very famous as a regento who was connected to this meet the woman because she didn't have
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:07.560]  so openly having wasted even in the last can so i wanted to just say that because of course
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:15.560]  it's news that shocks everybody but imagine if people like asia regento will turn in favor
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:22.920]  of donald j trump it would be the end of of the world for the liberals in any case regarding the
[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:30.600]  bill the berg and the vatican i was told in the last few minutes that they have been discussing
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:39.400]  the deal that the vatican broke with communist china which is quite incredible because apparently
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:48.600]  the vatican has accepted the official church the official catholic church promoted by the communist
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:56.360]  party in china this means the end of catholicism as we know in china but with the support of the
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:03.400]  vatican so this is something that are also disgusting in in in the meeting at the bill the
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:11.960]  berg club so there is also something connected with the china that the parolin is meant to transmit
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:17.960]  to the other mondial is present at the bill the berg meeting and if more people will become aware
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:24.440]  of what is happening like antony budeno many other artists things will change the world will change
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:32.440]  of course because we are in front of a dictatorship in the media uh hollywood which has been completely
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:39.240]  compromised by the liberals for a long time but things are gradually changing and i myself wrote
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:45.320]  a book about hollywood and the illuminati four years ago but if i was to rewrite it now i will
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:53.720]  probably have to add a whole new chapter with the arrival of donald j trump though people like jz are
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:25:01.960]  obviously uh scambags and criminals working for obama and for the new world order they're also
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:10.440]  satanist because it's true what alex just said these people are satanists jz even openly promotes
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:16.040]  the thought of alistair crawley and do what they will should be the whole of the law so there is a
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:21.720]  lot that we don't really know about these artists behind the scenes dedicate a lot of their time
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:30.360]  to sexual magic satanism and perverse behavior which of course brings them power so i have been
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:35.320]  writing about all this in my books for years and they are now available in the english language
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:43.640]  and at the same time i hope that people go into the study of these secret societies because like
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:51.880]  the bill the bad meeting is demonstrating now in turing these people are hiding uh themselves from
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:58.680]  the world even if now of course they have been exposed by people like us and so they're trying to
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:06.200]  have a different kind of approach they're still the same enemy that wants to keep in secret their
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:12.840]  plan for mondialism or this globalization which wants to shape a one world religion well let's
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:16.760]  hold on i want to hold it right there leo because i want to get into something with
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:22.360]  you here before before we let you go here in this next break let's kind of just roll this back a
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:28.120]  little bit and let's look at a jz or even a snoop dog and this is i mean people in american
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:34.920]  need to understand this now i'm not saying jay z or snoop dog is a cia operative but i'm saying that
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:42.840]  the cia had plans that basically built up m tv built up the rap industry with jay z with snoop
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:50.120]  dog and what did that do that created a culture for black people that was now all about gangsterism
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:56.440]  drug dealing pimping and being a schmuck where the black culture used to be about family god
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:02.840]  uh integrity the cia destroyed that with the jay z's and the snoop dogs now whether or not jay z and
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:08.520]  snoop dog or cia operatives you can have that debate but they are operatives now of the satanist
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:12.440]  new world order cult for whatever reason if they're blackmailed if they really believe in this stuff
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.440]  and you can see that in what they're doing now against trump and what they're doing now for
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:21.320]  the establishment but then how do you explain the other elements like the kanye west that aren't
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.360]  aren't are they not as blackmailable did they not go deep into the spirit cookings like the others
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:33.240]  did what is the difference there it depends from the handlers if their handlers have something on
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:40.120]  them or if they don't and also the capacity of the handlers of keeping them under their control
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:47.560]  so they not necessarily a cia part of the cia but they have hundreds who are in the intelligence
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:53.320]  community in the cia and the other agencies and they are subjects to black black they're blackmailable
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:59.160]  all the time because they are always given to perversion people like jay z snoop doggy dog
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:05.320]  have a tour the world with the help of military intelligence and i can so thank you so would you
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:14.440]  say that jay z jay z's cia handler is barry satoro aka barack obama well i can tell you one thing
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:21.240]  that both snoop doggy dog and jay z went to a concert in japan in okinawa i think it was around

[02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:37.640]  back by alex jones here just momentarily crazy times we are living in here folks truly crazy
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:48.040]  times i just wish that the average human more specifically the average american that actually
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:59.480]  has access to this information to this intelligence would actually engage themselves in the battle
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:08.520]  for the future instead of just being a sad stop that just walks through life day by day checking
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:16.920]  the sport scores tuning in to the favorite television station mindlessly going about the day
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:22.040]  oh this is just life on earth now just a brainwashed minion just going through life
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:31.320]  it's not our destiny it's not america's destiny and we're taking that destiny back to control
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:43.000]  our own future and to save it for humanity and so many people are dumbed down and numb
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:52.120]  when it comes to their mind that they'll easily scoff off the anthony bordain suicide story
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:35:00.120]  up suicide k done but when you look overall at the whole picture look at kate spade now was
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:05.080]  that genuine that appears to be a genuine suicide i mean i don't know but doesn't that create then
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:11.000]  the perfect environment to suicide somebody else oh suicide is already in the headlines
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.800]  a famous celebrity commit suicide oh perfect time let's take more day now oh yeah suicide
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:19.160]  but what about antonin scalia
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:26.280]  and the list just goes on and on from there i mean i i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go too
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:34.360]  into it folks but i mean you think uh michael jackson just died of natural causes you think
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:42.120]  that that man's life just naturally went that way ever listen to michael jackson's lyrics now you see
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:50.200]  why the doctor killed him but i digress because part of what we need to do is stand up to these people
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:56.760]  their biggest success their easiest path to victory is no resistance and that's what they want
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:01.560]  that's why they poison the food and water that's why they give you the mindless dribble on television
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:06.440]  that's why they give you the nancy poloses and the erics wall wells to represent you in government
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:17.000]  the dumbest of the dumb but when humans stand up when you realize you are in charge when you realize
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:25.640]  that you control your own destiny you have the power that's when you stand up in defiance that's
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:30.760]  when you stand up in resistance going along with the establishment narrative to hate trump
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:35.080]  that's being a brainwashed foot soldier of the new world order standing against that
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:42.840]  and calling out the scum when they come to your city that's true resistance that's why this sunday

[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:34.440]  go bullhorn them go get in their camera shot go scream at them at your fake news go get an interview
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:38.360]  pretending like you're gonna say what they want you to say and then say info wars dot com is real
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:44.280]  news we all know you're fake that's how you defeat these people so just understand
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:55.640]  resistance is a multifaceted issue we can call it out we can report on it we can show the double
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:00.920]  standards but you also have to stand you also have to take physical action you have to let
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:06.520]  these people know you're not backing down hillary and bill clinton get their hubris by the fact that
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:10.840]  they can go on these tours and nobody stands up to them they know they're blatant criminals
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:16.680]  and if you have all these people that sit there and hang on their every word that's where they get
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:24.200]  their power oh but if the people start to resist look at what happens to them they falter they look
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:32.360]  dead that's our victory that's our resistance now we're going to be hopefully organizing more
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.800]  this stuff hopefully citizens can take action into their own hands but on our end we're doing

[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:10.680]  and then saying why isn't russia here why are we doing these negotiations in these meetings without
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:15.720]  russia then japan's prime minister abe comes out and says trump is right why isn't russia here
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:20.600]  italy's new prime minister comes out and says trump is right why isn't russia here
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:29.640]  just breaking the globalist back i mean just just destroying their control over the world politics
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:34.600]  now uh-oh russia's at the table another nation that wants to be sovereign and free and not be a
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:39.000]  globalist country oh my gosh now america doesn't want to be a globalist country do you understand

[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:05.480]  be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:12.520]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:18.840]  rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:25.240]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:31.160]  heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:37.640]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:43.880]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:49.480]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.120]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it

[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:50.360]  my hotel room with uh an emergency transmission update that is absolutely critical now i want
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:58.120]  to be clear i got up because i'm here in hawaii at about four a.m and i noticed that a army
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:08.360]  source of mine uh had sent me a link that anthony bordeaux had just died and that they were saying
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:12.360]  it was a suicide out of the gates and that that was suspicious when they say something's a suicide
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:17.160]  when it's first announced they always say police are looking into it at least for a day or so and
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:21.080]  then you hear suicide whenever you hear it right away it's very suspicious and the individual i was
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:29.560]  talking to has been in the highest levels of security details protecting hillary clinton
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:35.240]  george w bush you name it and he thought it was very very suspicious uh bordeaux knew a lot of
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.760]  secrets he had become very very famous first writing you know a tell all book about this you
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:47.320]  know the secrets of being a top chef but i tweeted out that hey if i commit suicide i didn't commit
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:51.560]  suicide i was killed i said he was enemies you know more and more with the clinton's but i
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:55.400]  said he also said bad things about trump you know that he'd serve him hemlock as a joke
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:03.640]  but bordeaux was the only successful person on cnn bordeaux was uh superstar internationally
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:09.640]  and really respected he was becoming really good friends with elon musk well i got a
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:15.320]  emergency phone call from one of the producers saying one of our best sources
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:20.520]  was wants to talk to you he's really upset and it all clicked on went oh my god he told me
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:27.320]  off air months ago and on air just a few weeks ago that you look for other big hollywood icon type
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:33.320]  you know people he told me off air anthony bordeaux saying that he had helped produce
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:40.920]  with elon musk this individual works with space hacks in other areas this piece with bordeaux
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:47.880]  and that bordeaux had been challenged by elon musk to go public and to talk about his experiences
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:56.040]  and what he knew and to basically do a full kanya fully woke and so i knew about this and then it
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:02.120]  totally clicked you know this was about like six in the morning hawaii time i had time to wake up
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:08.040]  so i wrote a bunch of notes here you can see some of them are on hotel coasters and these are the
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:13.400]  notes that the gentleman you basically laid out to me and i know the gentleman is his family is
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:22.040]  well known and wealthy to say the least and he has been involved in army special operations armies
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:27.000]  psychological operations and he's even said i can say who he is now but i'm at this point
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:33.560]  i said i'm gonna give you some time to cool off before we do that right now this he told me this
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:39.160]  about an hour and a half ago right now he's in hot water with folks but we had to do this in case
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:47.480]  they try to kill him or myself because here's the bottom line or dane was 61 years old he had a
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:51.640]  happy nine-year-old daughter he'd just gotten remarried he'd never been happier he had been
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:56.040]  friends with elon musk for a long time so he was becoming best friends with musk musk is fully
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:01.960]  awake to globalism the new world order the whole brainwashing system the post-human system they're
[02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:06.120]  trying to set up he's been saying everything that i told you 20 years ago and i put an end game 11
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:10.120]  years ago not because he's following what i said but because that's what the globalist are planning
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:14.120]  he's been let in at the highest levels into their meetings because he's a you know high IQ
[02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:19.720]  guy and a multi-billionaire and now he's under Soros attack and others trying a hostile takeover so
[02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:25.720]  they were in marrakesh moranco two months ago kicking off the taping of his new season
[02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:33.000]  0.0 is the production company he owns his own show and musk and him had already been hanging out
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:38.360]  there in moranco for four or five days really you know discussing what was happening what was
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:45.640]  going on up on this big vista where they had this high-tech science lab connected to some of the
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:54.120]  leaders of moranco and so they're up there doing the shoot you'll remember a few months ago when
[02:51:54.120 --> 02:52:00.920]  one of our guests was from moranco that was all going on then in moranco then and they were discussing
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:06.120]  all these things and he was really deprogramming him and anthony bordeaux was kind of coming out of
[02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:12.680]  his shell the khanye west thing that started to happen and then more of his shows became this whole
[02:52:12.680 --> 02:52:17.560]  woke thing globally to what was happening in a pro-human future in pro-space exploration not a
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:25.080]  post-industrial world not a globalist depopulation planet not this thing where the ai gods take
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:29.160]  over that musk and others have warned about that that google and others are embracing and saying
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:35.800]  humans are bad we need to post human world so bordain has been anti-trump anti-hillary
[02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:40.120]  anti-weinstein you know he's really written things about Henry Kissinger that are true that
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:46.520]  are very bold for somebody who's respected by liberals and it's because he was seen as somebody
[02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:52.440]  even more than khanye west who could double trump's numbers with black voters he was seen as somebody
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:59.080]  to be the final domino to fall because he's so respected by liberals out there and he was showing
[02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:04.440]  sides of a conscience he was realizing what was happening he was aware of all the government sex
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:09.400]  trafficking and the things that were going on and he was beginning to talk about working that into
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:15.400]  his show he was working that into his show and the word has come down now we actually have the
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:22.120]  almost 12 minute video clip that is the episode in morocco but the 12 minutes sit down in the
[02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:27.400]  in the 45 minute you know hour long episode but 45 minutes is actual program actual show
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:37.080]  our sources have the 11 minute 50 second clip if they ever think that they're going to now
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:41.880]  grab it and make it all a retrospective about bordain and mix in his old episodes and change it
[02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:48.840]  they got nothing coming because bordain had final cut but his company didn't and so just like
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:53.080]  stanley cubrick put out eyes wide shut when he had the final cut done he had final cut power
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:59.800]  but he refused to cut 24 minutes he died instantly and i've talked to his daughter who was his
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:04.200]  protege and the stuff she told me was off record but let me just tell you it all fits together
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:10.760]  i've also talked to the linens and they told me he's off record but it all fits together just for
[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:15.640]  my information but i almost at this point almost don't want to know stuff in confidence anymore
[02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:21.480]  because it's like the narles barkley song well i was crazy not because i didn't know anything
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:28.040]  because i knew too much so that's all going on so i'm seen as one of the only venues where people
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:33.240]  could actually get this stuff out where people aren't scared and i've been told by the pentagon
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:38.680]  other patriots the highest levels that they fear trump they fear donald trump jr they fear matt
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:44.600]  drudge they feared anthony because he was starting to wake up to what was going on was so influential
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:52.520]  with the left and others and internationally was such a star and they fear yours truly and it's
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:57.720]  not like i'm proud to be saying this is very dangerous position to be in but they really
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:03.480]  fear almost more than anybody except trump right now elon musk and elon needs to go public i've
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:06.760]  already been saying that he's been going public against the media he's been going public against
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:12.680]  the ai takeover plan but elon this was a message to elon musk in fact this is the takeaway
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:18.360]  anthony or durr was getting ready to go public
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:23.240]  and said that he was pro-human bring the parties together don't hate trump
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:28.440]  let's work together let's have a human future let's not be a new genics an elon musk message of
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:33.560]  truth an alex jones message because this is the the truth kanye west in fact he specifically talked
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:38.840]  about the bigger plan it's like when i was loose ferakon's house two years ago he goes
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:44.280]  you know kanye comes by and he likes a bigger plan and they looked at me because i hadn't
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:49.080]  been let in on the code word yet and ferakon said what you want about him is a major game changer
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:57.560]  tea person just like bordur could be uh or or or you know you know any of these people um so
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:04.360]  so it's it's it's just absolutely mind-boggling right now to know this is going on and know this
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:08.680]  is happening i'ma try to be calm we come back from break no dr nick baggers has got a whole
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:13.400]  huge presentation ready for you his dad died mysterious plane crashes brother of course u.s
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:19.320]  senator but he's got a lot of big insight intel for you as you can see i was planning to not go
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:24.600]  on air anyone i was on this trip with my kids for eight days but we don't have a future if i don't
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:30.760]  do this so i will be here as much as i need to be i'm very humbled to be in this position to
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:35.240]  have this type of information but i have talked to the folks at spacex i have talked to people
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:42.040]  inside musk organization right there at the top of it uh and i am breaking down to you what is
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:49.320]  going on here cnn will absolutely be in dreaded fear that we i mean i was asked today i said
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.400]  should we release the 11 minute 50 second clip and i said let's hold off while you're hot right now
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:57.960]  while you're upset not gonna say you are yet they already know who you are and we're not going to
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:03.960]  release it 11 minute clip yet but the word is already is that they're going to grab these
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:08.360]  episodes because this is this big awakening already happening it hit a catalyst in morocco
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:13.560]  a few months ago uh and then now a chain reaction into this it's all happening everywhere across the
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:18.680]  world but but as these prominent people begin to wake up and go with humanity and go with life
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:23.160]  and go with pro-human there's an absolute panic by the globalists going on in there trying to
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:28.520]  send a message by going after bourdain you can clearly see that the threat and everybody else
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:32.440]  we'll be right back on the other side of this break this is an emergency
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:38.440]  global transmission newsports.com i'm alex jones we will continue to go in through and beyond

[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:39.640]  joining us on this live global friday transmission anthony bordain was one of the number one
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:45.880]  host of the world the only success he had he was branching out he was planning to do programs on
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:51.240]  child trafficking human sex trafficking he'd become best friends with elon musk he had spent close
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:59.480]  to a week in morocco two months ago at a private home with a scientific research facility and we
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:06.280]  have the 11 minute 52nd clip that they want cut out we're able to bring that to you it's been offered
[03:01:06.280 --> 03:01:12.440]  to us but we're not going to air that here at this point the cnn or anybody says we're lying about
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:16.920]  this we'll drop the hammer on you i won't drop the hammer on you somebody's going to drop the
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:21.560]  hammer on you they didn't want this clip to come out they didn't want this information to come out
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:26.760]  he was calling for a global awakening he was understanding that democrats are actually pro
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:32.040]  war they've been funding isis and al-qaeda he understood that the republican establishment
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:36.520]  was just as bad as well and that all these people claiming they were liberals weren't really liberals
[03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:42.600]  and that trump had a bigger plan a new renaissance plan and elon musk had convinced him of this and
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:49.000]  so bordain was preparing just like kanye west and just like kim kardashian to begin to reach out to
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:54.600]  trump just like she came to the white house last week on getting black people out of prison who were
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:02:02.280]  given racist sentences because of uh what color they were she has the perfect way for her to reach
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:06.680]  out to show that trump's good then have him move towards getting those laws changed which he's now
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:13.720]  announced the clinton's got it passed in 94 saying blacks were animals and needed to be made to heal
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:21.720]  like dogs remember that well well trump thinks that's wrong and so all this was about to happen
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:25.800]  and bordain was aware of what was happening the clintons were failing they were falling
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:29.400]  he was starting to come out and criticizing hillary he was starting to come out and criticize
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:37.320]  others like winstein and he was about to become not a conservative not even a nationalist he's
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:42.440]  a true international guy but in a good sense he really wants he wanted peace and love he'd
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:46.440]  spoken out against kissinger he's spoken out against you know he said i'll serve him locked to trump
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:50.200]  back when he was buying the bull but he was getting ready via
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:56.680]  via what was happening with elon musk to be a real leader and to go meet with trump and to go
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:02.440]  public that's really the big news here and now he's died mysteriously in a hotel room a crappy
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:05.960]  hotel room right when he just got remarried right when he has a nine-year-old daughter that's so
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:10.760]  happy right when he told elon musk and others that he's the happiest he's ever been this magically
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:18.120]  happens ladies and gentlemen the only guy only guy successful in their entire system and everybody
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:22.360]  liked him because he had you know a little bit of humanity to him compared to somebody like wolf
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:28.680]  blitzer somebody like brian stelter somebody like hillary clinton now he's dead now he's dead and they
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:36.280]  just say boom suicide boom move on boom that's it just don't look at it don't have a discussion
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:43.640]  nothing to see here that is ridiculous and i have from spacex sources is i'm sitting there
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:49.880]  you're ready to go have breakfast with my children because i'm six hours ahead from the east coast
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:55.800]  five hours ahead from central three hours ahead from pacific four hours ahead from mountain
[03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:02.920]  it's 903 here where i'm at 904 and i'm when i come back i'm just going to read these notes to ui
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:10.520]  rub i've got one two three four five six six seven pages of notes one of them is a coaster
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:17.160]  and it says uh culture will speak from the dead i dare them to say it's open and shut
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:22.680]  but also they said it was critical to play the clip but i never told you guys to do this of
[03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:28.040]  bordain and obama in vietnam when they first sit down and talk how much bordain didn't like obama
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:34.680]  and some of the things he told elon musk they knew that bordain knew things that he wasn't supposed
[03:04:34.680 --> 03:04:41.480]  to know and they didn't even tell me everything this is super dangerous i'm risking my life even
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:47.960]  telling you this stuff and that we have the clue go ahead and try me cnn and we'll drop the hammer

[03:06:29.640 --> 03:06:36.200]  dr nick baggage a scientist researcher major native lands leader his brother former u.s senator
[03:06:36.200 --> 03:06:41.480]  his father famous congressman is so much of the civil rights movement more who died very mysteriously
[03:06:41.480 --> 03:06:48.360]  he's about to take over i wanted to just let you know that i'm on vacation with family i got a very
[03:06:48.360 --> 03:06:52.520]  desperate call from one of the producers that one of our top pentagon space x sources
[03:06:55.560 --> 03:07:01.480]  had had been called us and that he he'd already told me that he'd take a special report in morocco
[03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:08.440]  with elon musk and that it was with anthony bourdain but at six o'clock in the morning
[03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:12.040]  then when this happened it's nine o'clock now when i first got this news and and then it all
[03:07:12.040 --> 03:07:17.240]  started to click so i called our source back and he went over the whole thing he was there
[03:07:17.240 --> 03:07:21.800]  it was obviously they know who it is on the inside it was at his home with his family and you know
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:26.520]  there in morocco with their big facility and of course when it comes out who he is provide those
[03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:34.440]  who basically runs morocco and so you've got you've got elon musk and you've got anthony bourdain
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:40.440]  at this big facility overlooking the vista on the ocean and they spent days out there and musk
[03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:47.160]  is already really good friends with or was good friends with mr bourdain and of course musk is
[03:07:47.160 --> 03:07:52.360]  telling you everything i tell you world government ai takeover we got to stop it they plan to get rid
[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:57.320]  of humans the decision's been made we got to struggle against it the media is lying to you
[03:07:57.320 --> 03:08:02.280]  they're your enemies they want to stop human progress and so let me just read to you the notes
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:07.560]  that i was given and again i was already told this months ago also ashton kutcher
[03:08:07.560 --> 03:08:14.840]  he was about to go public in all of this i was told a month before she went to the winehouse
[03:08:14.840 --> 03:08:17.400]  that about the same source that they they call it
[03:08:21.160 --> 03:08:26.360]  well they have several terms for it but full spectrum reality
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:33.960]  they have a lot of terms full spectrum drama where where trump and others in the patriot
[03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:38.360]  leadership recruited khanye five years ago when they decided to make this move
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:43.240]  the military was going to carry out a coup against obama because he was signing us over the chinese
[03:08:43.240 --> 03:08:47.960]  they did the office of personnel management hack 21 million names of all our spies all our people
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:52.360]  all their families the keys of the kingdom apples now move they're giving them all the keys to all
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:58.200]  apple users your cloud code that's reuters i mean we're already pretty much been taken over by the
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:04.360]  chinese they've got hollywood they're taken over the universities i mean it is it is mega level but
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:09.080]  last dish effort was made with trump he reached out to khanye he reached out to kim kardashian
[03:09:10.120 --> 03:09:14.440]  she was on the fence he khanye went with it that's what they locked him up in a mental institution
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:17.960]  about a year and a half ago and he was going to already launch this but he they had let him go
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.160]  they you know that whole act where they can say something's wrong with you and then grab you for
[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:29.320]  a few days and so reportedly a lot of stuff to khanye was in there but he he powered through it
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:33.320]  he's a great hero he is man he's got everything to lose he stood up because he has everything to gain
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:43.080]  and so all of that unfolded um and so you've got spacex you've got elon mus that represents
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:46.760]  kind of the good faction in nasa that wants to have a pro-human future doesn't want to suppress
[03:09:46.760 --> 03:09:50.920]  the live assistance technologies i told you at the inauguration before trump spoke that he would
[03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:56.120]  talk about unlocking the secrets of the universe and that he would call for the secret medical
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:00.200]  technologies they've been suppressing to be released he's not moving forward with that i'm on record
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:05.720]  because i have the sources but i want to be honest with you it's metaphysical i have sources but we
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:11.080]  all know already so we're already finishing each other's sentences that's why they hate us we we
[03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:17.640]  are plugged in to the internet of of of the human mind the human destiny the human will what humanity
[03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:23.640]  wants and so yes we scientifically look at stuff yes we talk to each other yes but we're already
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:29.080]  synced up just like bill martz said last friday alex jones and donald trump are soulmates and
[03:10:29.080 --> 03:10:32.840]  it's true we're all soulmates there's billions of people that are soulmates with black skin with
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:39.800]  white skin with red skin with yellow skin with pink skin with sunburned skin we are all together
[03:10:39.800 --> 03:10:44.280]  in this big quest in this love of humanity the love of our ancestors a love of the great quest
[03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:48.200]  and there's people that want to satanically block that and still the future and it's not happening
[03:10:48.200 --> 03:10:52.200]  so i'm going to go to dr nick baggage after the break or just a minute but let me just give you
[03:10:52.200 --> 03:10:59.240]  these notes culture will speak from the dead they've opened and shut said that he died it's
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:05.240]  preposterous um bordain was not having any of it he was ready to stand against him he was finally
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:12.040]  convinced by elon musk of what was really going on and shown the proof the proof of the child
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:17.480]  trafficking and things that he'd seen himself but didn't put two into together is what made him
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:21.720]  have nightmares and basically break down he came out of the depression and wouldn't talk about what
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:26.280]  he was going to do except saying he liked what kanya had done and was planning to go public and
[03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:31.400]  wanted to perhaps even meet with trump publicly to say we should have unity and world peace he
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:36.280]  liked the fact that he the trump wants to work with russia and the fact that he understood that
[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:43.160]  bordain or so that was all made up bordain didn't like the pressure he was put under by cnn uh to
[03:11:43.160 --> 03:11:49.560]  come out wrote these quick and to basically get involved the whole trump bashing operation
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:54.680]  and then even after he did what they wanted it only got worse that was a turning point for him
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:58.600]  the epstein situation in hillary and being attacked by the democrats and her staffers
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:10.200]  uh again uh he just had a gut level had already met trump before and didn't know
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:13.080]  why everybody was demonizing him so much and he wanted world peace
[03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:19.960]  again there's the broader message that this is a message to elon musk and others and and joe
[03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:25.080]  rogan that if you don't shut up we're going to kill you and kill your family uh that that everyone's
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:32.040]  children in danger and then i'm a target that's pray for me police folks um he had just gotten
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:36.680]  remarried was totally happy talking to elon almost every day they were planning to do big
[03:12:36.680 --> 03:12:41.160]  stuff together talking about a new tv program oh this is why they got pissed netflix is the
[03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:46.040]  future obama wants to come in but they'll force feed it he was talking about leaving cnn and
[03:12:46.040 --> 03:12:50.440]  then doing a tv show about human advancement and the human future with elon musk who that's the big
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:55.880]  one just the jealousy at cnn and just just everything but they didn't want him to leave them
[03:12:55.880 --> 03:13:01.000]  they wanted to you know he's gone now they can own the dead star they can milk all his old episodes
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:05.640]  and and and then edit out all the stuff he did the last two months with dozens and dozens of
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:09.480]  segments he taped about his awakening so that that scared him plus he was going to leave him
[03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:16.920]  at zero point zero he said he was the happiest he'd been in his life he he felt like he'd been so
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:21.560]  unhappy when he was the mainline liberal he was like in a prison but now he was awake
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:25.320]  and and and and they spent days with him this individual that was with musk
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:29.240]  and all this he works with musk and was like witnessing this and just how happy they were
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:35.720]  so quick
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:46.040]  he kept talking about the bigger plan that was a bigger plan for humanity now
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:50.200]  he saw the so-called leftist plan wasn't even leftist plan was to control the left
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:14:05.240]  yeah zpz 0.0 again owning his own show but now that he's dead he won't have the final cut
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:13.560]  wanted to trump for forum and meeting was actually planning to get on trump about some
[03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:17.320]  issues but also thank him for other issues and say that we should all come together for global
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:21.800]  peace and they thought it was reasonable for people to talk to trump and for jz to go meet with him
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:28.520]  and then he was just basically really synced up with elon musk and i was told a bunch of other stuff
[03:14:31.560 --> 03:14:35.080]  and so i'm going to talk to my source and put out as much more of this as i can
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:37.800]  so i had to cross through some of this because they asked me not to get into it
[03:14:37.800 --> 03:14:41.800]  but
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:47.960]  he died in a crappy hotel room in france and instantly they said oh it's suicide which is
[03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:52.920]  always a telltale sign there's a cover up we're going to go to break here in 60 seconds and i'm
[03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:56.760]  going to let him take over but just as a snapshot in 60 seconds dr nick baggage what do you make
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:01.160]  of this you experience your dad being killed what do you make of this well you know i think
[03:15:01.160 --> 03:15:08.840]  that it's about whistleblowing right i mean this is ultimately what it becomes and years ago i was
[03:15:08.840 --> 03:15:13.400]  working with members of european parliament to try and create an independent way of doing it we
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:19.640]  never got anywhere but whistleblowing i think is fundamental to how a democracy should run i mean
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:25.560]  we need to know certain truths for republic to stay intact and when you look around the world at
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:30.760]  the corruption out there whether it's a democrats or the republicans the very highest level it's
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:35.240]  always the same player working against our interests for someone else i think that's what
[03:15:35.240 --> 03:15:38.920]  we're seeing and it's coming down i know you've got a full show prepared but but there are systems
[03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:43.880]  unraveling there's a huge global earth pulse away that you predicted 20 years ago talk about that

[03:20:18.360 --> 03:20:24.520]  alex jones
[03:20:29.240 --> 03:20:34.280]  and welcome back to the alex jones show and this is dr nick baggage and i'm standing in for alex
[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:40.040]  for this last hour of uh friday's show um first i want to pick up where alex left off you know
[03:20:40.040 --> 03:20:46.280]  when uh when he was talking about my predictions 20 years ago about unawakening uh a time when we
[03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:51.720]  would really see the kind of changes uh that we're beginning to see now i i think we're in the middle
[03:20:51.720 --> 03:20:58.520]  of it and i'd really like to start this fight by thinking about what we just said about reaching
[03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:03.800]  out to each other and and i want to talk about the baseline on my my baseline values first of all
[03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:11.160]  i believe that we are in fact created in the image and likeness of god and i think we should start
[03:21:11.160 --> 03:21:17.560]  to act like and and maybe this gets us to a closer place of solution when you look at another human
[03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:22.440]  being and you see the divinity in them when you look in their eyes and you start to recognize
[03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:30.840]  that a certain level of respect uh is required um that begins to change the paradigm that begins
[03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:36.280]  to change the way we see the world when we begin to see each other differently in the world you know
[03:21:36.280 --> 03:21:42.680]  in between us uh and i've said it before are the electronic sort of interfaces that are the priest
[03:21:42.680 --> 03:21:50.440]  of the 21st century if you will that which stands between us in divinity in the earth which is each
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:57.080]  other created in the image and likeness of god so um that foundation is where i start and finish
[03:21:57.880 --> 03:22:04.040]  my work each day and and what i want to say uh in the context of today's program when we're talking
[03:22:04.040 --> 03:22:10.040]  about the things going on in the world is to inform is to educate and it's also to change
[03:22:10.040 --> 03:22:16.840]  the way we see it but on the basis of a foundation of values that i think i hope most of us share
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:21.640]  in common and alex was saying you know i come from a political background that's true my father was
[03:22:21.640 --> 03:22:26.760]  a state senator and then later united states congressman my brother mark was a u.s senator
[03:22:26.760 --> 03:22:31.000]  he's currently running actually for the governor of the state of alaska which was announced last
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:39.000]  friday uh when we were uh on the air uh thinking about what's what's coming um in fact my my other
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:44.760]  younger brothers in the state senate uh here in alaska but the fact is coming from a background
[03:22:44.760 --> 03:22:50.120]  uh a political background i think is important in the context of where we are today and i want to
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:54.360]  mention too you know my father was a first generation american my grandparents were immigrants from
[03:22:54.360 --> 03:23:00.680]  croatia uh he was born in the united states first generation american worked his butt off he couldn't
[03:23:00.680 --> 03:23:05.960]  afford college for four years so he finished a four-year degree in two uh and went on to become a
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:11.800]  teacher uh a state senator a superintendent of schools at one point uh and a congressman up
[03:23:11.800 --> 03:23:18.680]  until his death and at the age of 40 um under mysterious you know circumstances that we'll
[03:23:18.680 --> 03:23:24.680]  talk about maybe another time today i want to get back into some of the things we left off with
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:29.960]  last friday on resource related issues because these are important but you know when we think
[03:23:29.960 --> 03:23:33.880]  about the country and we think about the budget everybody thinks about the budget and then they
[03:23:33.880 --> 03:23:38.920]  think about taxes and in the business world we would call that the profit and loss statement
[03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:45.880]  or the income statement money in money out in our personal lives that's our budget money in money
[03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:52.360]  out and that's what everybody talks about what they don't talk about that the globalists do not
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:24:01.000]  want us talking about is the balance sheet of the country what are the assets what is what are the
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:09.880]  assets we hold in common in this republic what do we own as americans in common the natural resources
[03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:16.440]  public lands i mean our military the things our tax dollars buy all that belongs to us
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:22.440]  but who does it serve it serves globalist interest around the world is where the policeman for the
[03:24:22.440 --> 03:24:28.600]  planet that is not what our founding fathers intended that is not where we started we were to
[03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:35.480]  be a light to the world an example that heathers would emulate based on their intrinsic internal
[03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:43.640]  desire to have something different not to be packed down their throats by propaganda or our
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:50.840]  propaganda or our world view but to have the respect again for the right of self determination by
[03:24:50.840 --> 03:24:56.760]  people around the planet the balance sheet us 16 trillion in the hole let me tell you where
[03:24:56.760 --> 03:25:04.600]  that 16 trillion is in one national asset and this comes out of a press report from bloomberg
[03:25:04.600 --> 03:25:12.920]  actually and it's talking about natural resources right now we're exporting 10.7 million barrels of
[03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:23.960]  oil or producing 10.7 million barrels of oil a day 2.57 are being exported where's the money
[03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:32.920]  and why right now a major major issue and why an w are look it up itself it's it's the naval
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:40.200]  it's a reserve on the north slope of Alaska next to crude obey it's projected to have 16 billion
[03:25:40.200 --> 03:25:49.000]  uh barrels of oil not including the gas just one oil field and we'll we'll look at the oil basins
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:57.160]  if they'll bring that slide up but this one area has 16 billion but billion barrels which had a
[03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:05.000]  hundred dollars of barrel which wasn't very long ago that's 16 trillion dollars that we own that's
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:12.200]  enough to cover the whole deficit one resource in Alaska and we're missing it look at the very top
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:19.960]  of that image now this was used in the 1980 lands fights over Alaska because they locked up in 1980
[03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:27.560]  when this image was made they locked up 104 million acres of public lands for preserves and parks that
[03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:33.480]  nobody unless you're rich because it's the playground of the rich you can't even get there
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:41.080]  there now the fact is those oil basins those represent only two have been in in production
[03:26:41.080 --> 03:26:46.280]  in south central Alaska around anchorage and i can't point to it because i'm i'm remote but you'll
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:51.960]  see it in the south central part of the state that cook inlet that's been developed yes indeed
[03:26:51.960 --> 03:26:57.080]  that pointer is on it now you look at the very top of the state where that last couple of oil there
[03:26:57.080 --> 03:27:03.560]  it's our you'll see prude obey now that is the only other field but most of what you see in orange
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:12.760]  is on drill okay these represent billions and billions and billions of barrels of oil and
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:21.720]  trillions of trillions of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas enough to resolve the deficit
[03:27:21.720 --> 03:27:29.080]  to resolve the debt but we need to start talking about what do we own what does this country own
[03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:35.000]  and how are we managing our resources and who's taking those resources most people don't realize
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:40.360]  this either the north soap of Alaska at one time produced two million barrels of oil a day
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:47.000]  right now we're producing approximately 600 000 barrels of oil a day going through a pipeline
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:54.200]  that's running at one quarter of its capacity not for a lack of oil for a lack of will meanwhile
[03:27:54.200 --> 03:28:00.200]  the hubs in the lower 48 state are jammed up they can't even ship the oil that we're producing
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:07.480]  all of its bottleneck the refineries are full the export stations are full everyone is full
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:13.880]  they're having to literally truck oil and gas out of the out of the midwest uh in low in lower
[03:28:13.880 --> 03:28:18.520]  states and ports and even there it's jamming up we're going to be back after the break i want to
[03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:24.600]  continue a discussion about the national balance sheet and the looting the train wreck uh that
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:30.280]  we're in the middle of which is actually the biggest train robbery we ever had we'll be right

[03:31:58.360 --> 03:32:03.880]  be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need
[03:32:03.880 --> 03:32:10.920]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid
[03:32:10.920 --> 03:32:17.160]  rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:32:17.160 --> 03:32:23.560]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[03:32:23.560 --> 03:32:29.560]  heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity
[03:32:29.560 --> 03:32:36.040]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[03:32:36.040 --> 03:32:42.840]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water
[03:32:42.840 --> 03:32:48.440]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[03:32:48.440 --> 03:32:52.520]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:32:52.520 --> 03:32:59.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:34.520]  was first uh discovered back in 1969 by atlantic richfield company um they determined that there
[03:34:34.520 --> 03:34:40.920]  was about one billion barrels of oil that was the estimate now it actually so far we produced
[03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:47.720]  over 13 billion barrels which even at at half the uh half half of a hundred bucks i mean it's
[03:34:47.720 --> 03:34:55.320]  over 50 now it's running around 68 to 75 in that range um that's about eight trillion dollars more
[03:34:55.320 --> 03:35:01.400]  or less that's been shipped off the north slope so far by multinational now up until the early
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:07.640]  1980s half owner basically of all of those resources on the north slope was british patrolling
[03:35:08.680 --> 03:35:15.880]  now what people don't know is up until the mid 80s or the early 80s the british crown
[03:35:15.880 --> 03:35:24.840]  owned 25 percent of british petroleum stock in other words we were still a colony we were still
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:30.120]  paying the crown out of the treasury out of the resources that we hold in common now they
[03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:37.640]  divested in the 80s and later um later uh british petroleum wanted to sell their assets uh or actually
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:41.960]  merge them with arco atlantic richfield which would have given them a total monopoly a foreign
[03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:48.280]  company of the biggest oil field uh in history and the infrastructure that went with it unfortunately
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:54.520]  myself two other guys we filed anti trust suits uh later our state legislate legislature the state
[03:35:54.520 --> 03:35:59.240]  of california the state of oregon the state of washington filed suits we withdraw they won and
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:06.600]  they didn't get to do it but the fact is we it's the same game today but nobody talks about the
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:12.280]  balance sheet i want to draw people's attention to to last week's broadcast we sort of set the
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:20.360]  foundation here go back and look at it june 1st uh of of 2018 the fourth hour of alexa show we
[03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:25.240]  began to sort of shape up what does alaska have to offer the country a couple points i want to cover
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:33.960]  again one is we are 18 percent of the land mass of the united states 18 percent yet we have only
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:42.760]  750 000 people occupy this place when you when you think about um the size of this we have there's
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:50.360]  more roads in the city of seattle than my whole state and yet we hold most of the treasury most
[03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:56.680]  of the natural resources most of the public lands that are undeveloped and open for development in a
[03:36:56.680 --> 03:37:02.520]  way that is much different than the 1880s i can assure you but when we look at the possibilities
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:08.040]  and that's what i really want to draw people's attention to that the art of the deal is in
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:15.000]  recognizing what you have at the table and we don't we're we're we're we're totally diverted into
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:21.240]  talking about budgets and balance sheet and never thinking about anything else producing wealth
[03:37:21.240 --> 03:37:28.120]  than the work of our labor and you know that wasn't even legal until the constitution was changed
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:35.640]  in 1913 which made income tax legal it took a constitutional amendment to tax the labor the
[03:37:35.640 --> 03:37:42.280]  labor of working men and women it wasn't just an automatic oh we can go do this you had to change
[03:37:42.280 --> 03:37:51.160]  the foundation of the country to take up to a third of every hour you work and hand it off
[03:37:51.160 --> 03:37:58.920]  to an elite spending it for the development of your resources for someone else this is how it's
[03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:04.600]  gone 200 years the biggest train robber you need to be the robber baron you've talked about the
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:09.960]  robber barons of the 1800s building railroads and robbing the public of resources and land everything
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:17.640]  up nothing's changed ladies and gentlemen it is the same game and it takes aggressive different
[03:38:17.640 --> 03:38:24.280]  leadership that maybe we've got the guy in the white house to make the deal a little better deal
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:27.880]  you know and there's a lot of controversy right now because the chinese are looking at our resources
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:32.600]  well there's a good reason we're on the pacific rim everyone on the pacific rim is interested
[03:38:32.600 --> 03:38:38.840]  in alaska resources and if you look at the very top of the state and you think about where we sit
[03:38:38.840 --> 03:38:45.080]  in terms of global transportation as the polar regions melt which they are no matter what man
[03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:49.080]  does and i was going to get into that today but we're going to kick that over to next week because
[03:38:49.080 --> 03:38:53.080]  we just don't have time and we'll get into the climate change issues a very different way of
[03:38:53.080 --> 03:38:58.680]  looking at them but how it affects us economically is this happening period it can't stop it's going
[03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:04.600]  to happen no matter what you want to argue about the cause that makes the north polar regions ice
[03:39:04.600 --> 03:39:10.840]  free which allows alaska to be one of the shortest routes to europe with our natural resources if we
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:16.200]  can get a rail link to alaska which we do not have we could actually get our natural resources
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:21.400]  into the midwest through the trans canadian rail systems and the canadian rail system stretching
[03:39:21.400 --> 03:39:27.080]  all the way up into northern british columbia you know these guys have their act together they build
[03:39:27.080 --> 03:39:34.520]  railroads to reach resources they build pipelines to reach resources they manage them environmentally
[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:41.160]  with a lot of debate in hand just like we do to get to the right place to develop our resources
[03:39:41.160 --> 03:39:46.120]  in the right way and that's what we're doing in alaska the nation needs to pay attention we have a
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:55.800]  greater coastline than the east coast west coast and gulf coast of the united states combined i mean
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:40:04.440]  looking at at what's possible right now in alaska to begin to reshape the nation we need the kind of
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:10.840]  emphasis we put when we built the road to alaska it was in world war two could really quick us
[03:40:10.840 --> 03:40:17.160]  hopping off point we were headed to drop things to lend lease over to the russians who were our
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:24.280]  friends even the middle of their communist period to break the back of hitler you know they built a
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:30.840]  road in a summer to alaska and yeah it wasn't much of a road i can tell you when my dad took it
[03:40:30.840 --> 03:40:38.520]  about 10 years later in 1955 it was no picnic but the fact is we need transportation corridors
[03:40:38.520 --> 03:40:46.040]  that's a national to be a national priority that get us the kind of corridors that can take us all
[03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:52.920]  the way into interior alaska across the southern flank of the brooks range which covers the richest
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:41:01.400]  mineral belt in the united states huge huge resources one of the publications uh that that i i use
[03:41:01.400 --> 03:41:06.760]  and i read it's it's a it's a one of these weird ones you know for alaskans but it's this way
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:13.000]  mining news and this is the one that's written for insiders on what's going on here 35 strategic
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:19.640]  minerals the congress has just announced most of them are in mineable quantities in alaska
[03:41:19.640 --> 03:41:27.160]  not being mine the few that are zinc as an example one zinc mine produces six percent of all the
[03:41:27.160 --> 03:41:33.240]  zinc concentrate in the world the port is frozen solid half the year it's it's out of the gnome
[03:41:33.240 --> 03:41:38.920]  area you know and yet six percent of the whole world annual supply comes from this one line
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:43.480]  the tenth largest silver mine in the world is in southeast alaska we have the largest
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:49.400]  molybdenum deposit on coastal waters it's not even being looked at we have rare earths being developed
[03:41:49.400 --> 03:41:56.040]  by ukore uh in southeast in the ketchikan area of alaska this will be the first major rare earth
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:00.760]  mine in the united states right now 90 of all rare earths come from china and they're not allowing
[03:42:00.760 --> 03:42:07.160]  exports and we need them for all of the technologies that drive an economy in the 21st century
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:14.280]  they're a time one another major project in the same area when you when you look at um yep
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:20.520]  the red dog mine up on the screen incredible incredible deposit if you look at um what's
[03:42:20.520 --> 03:42:27.960]  happening in the uh well we're headed into break we're gonna have to come back so let's talk more
[03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:34.120]  about the resources the balance sheet how do we get out of this hole and stop the train wreck and
[03:42:34.120 --> 03:42:39.160]  take our resources back take our nation back this is dr nick faggett standing in for alas

[03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:33.560]  today and i just want to say i really appreciate the opportunity to do this each each week as it's
[03:47:33.560 --> 03:47:38.360]  shaping up and it gives me a chance to explore some of the areas that i think are important to
[03:47:38.360 --> 03:47:45.000]  amplify those foundational issues that are all about taking our country back i mean when i think
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:52.280]  about again the balance sheet and sort of what's happening in in alaska i want to go back to just
[03:47:52.280 --> 03:47:57.720]  before the break talking about strategic minerals you know when you think about rare earths the
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:48:02.840]  difficulty has been not just finding them which we we do we have we found them you know we've got
[03:48:02.840 --> 03:48:08.440]  them in alaska the other thing that is important is how do you separate they're very complex the
[03:48:08.440 --> 03:48:15.320]  order the chemistry on them is is extremely complex so the companies that are doing the work here
[03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:21.080]  have actually developed the technologies and they've trialed those technologies piloted them
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:26.360]  and they're now using them in a couple of other places for handling waste streams of heavy metals
[03:48:26.360 --> 03:48:32.360]  and toxic materials to keep them out of the dump and back into applied technology and a couple
[03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:38.360]  places are using them they piloted a program with the oil sands in canada when those oil sands are
[03:48:38.360 --> 03:48:43.800]  heated and extracted from the from the rock there's a lot of other metals and and materials
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:50.440]  in it and what happens is that material um can actually in a fluid form have the heavy metals
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:54.920]  extracted so they're running a pilot see if they can normally get them out of the waste streams
[03:48:54.920 --> 03:49:00.280]  they don't become a part of the waste but actually are used within industry they're also building
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:07.480]  a program in the lower 48 states to actually recycle the heavy metals out of industrial
[03:49:07.480 --> 03:49:12.520]  waste again by having developed the kind of technologies that make the extracted process
[03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:19.480]  clean efficient and to serve the interests that this century requires when when you think about
[03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:24.920]  the innovation not just in the technology but you really have to look at three things and when
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:31.000]  i was a young kid and when i was in my teens i talked about information transportation uh and
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:38.040]  communication systems as being the keys for the 21st century now this is 40 years ago over 40 years
[03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:44.840]  ago uh and and those remain the keys for the 21st century transportation is a deficit alaska has
[03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:50.040]  state-of-the-art communication we have state-of-the-art information systems we need transportation
[03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:56.520]  quarters so we can move from the ports that are on the coast inland into the into the resource base
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:02.440]  of the nation uh we need the same kind of initiative that push railroads through the west and we need
[03:50:02.440 --> 03:50:09.880]  pushing through the rest of the west alaska's west uh the other the hidden 18 percent almost a fifth
[03:50:11.160 --> 03:50:17.960]  of the country and most people think it's sitting off to the side of of maps in some lower position
[03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:27.080]  look on a globe and where alaska sits take pride in this resource that we own uh together uh alaska
[03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:34.760]  and let's think about how do we take the fiftieth state the last one in might be the big one to
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:41.240]  bail us all out let's think about it a little differently uh in this century the image up
[03:50:41.240 --> 03:50:48.120]  right now uh showing alaska you can see uh the coastline that islands that stretch ammos touching
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:54.360]  russia and japan you know when you think about we have a 200 mile limit that surrounds alaska
[03:50:54.360 --> 03:51:00.120]  you look at southeast just a small gap of canada before it touches seattle uh if you look at the
[03:51:00.120 --> 03:51:06.760]  north part of alaska 700 miles from south to north and you see all that light blue in the map
[03:51:06.760 --> 03:51:13.080]  those are all potential oil bases and only two of them are being developed right now
[03:51:13.640 --> 03:51:19.640]  and that's in the south central part the very very small part near anchorage and then in the very
[03:51:19.640 --> 03:51:25.480]  northern region of the state one of the few roads that even penetrates the state goes straight
[03:51:25.480 --> 03:51:31.560]  from fairbanks north to crudo bay and it was built during the pipeline you know the pipeline
[03:51:31.560 --> 03:51:37.240]  uh zeroing in another coming in close on that map which you can see now the brooks range which is
[03:51:37.240 --> 03:51:42.280]  the mountain range at the top of the map and just the other side of it is the biggest oil
[03:51:42.280 --> 03:51:48.600]  basin left in the united states where you're going to see billions and billions and billions of
[03:51:48.600 --> 03:51:54.920]  barrels of oil found if you look um in the cost of view area um which is also on the map in the
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:52:01.160]  same section on the very far end ammos to the ocean in this area is a deposit of graphite now
[03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:08.520]  graphite and graphene are critical for battery technologies for modern electric vehicles alaska
[03:52:08.520 --> 03:52:14.040]  that one deposit is a known deposit four and a half miles long in surface they've tested the
[03:52:14.040 --> 03:52:19.880]  graphene its top quality for batteries and that's going to come online in the few years that has
[03:52:19.880 --> 03:52:26.040]  enough capacity to fuel the entire graphene demand of the united states right now we import
[03:52:26.040 --> 03:52:33.400]  virtually all of it so if we're going to remain competitive we are a raw resource place you know
[03:52:33.400 --> 03:52:39.240]  when you think about the real factors of economic production there's four it's not cash it's not money
[03:52:39.240 --> 03:52:45.400]  that's the medium between each of these four um aspects of economic production and they are
[03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:52.840]  land and natural resources they are labor and they are entrepreneurship and capital equipment
[03:52:52.840 --> 03:52:58.200]  that's kind of stuff that makes other stuff like shovels and factories those are the four factors
[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:04.920]  the biggest biggest thing we have right now in this country is underutilized labor in my state
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:12.680]  40 unemployment in rural areas 40 40 the highest in the nation has been that way since i was born
[03:53:12.680 --> 03:53:19.800]  here and yet we have resources that could create not just marginal jobs mining jobs pay 80 to 100
[03:53:19.800 --> 03:53:25.800]  grand a year for people working underground in my state these are good jobs these are the kind of
[03:53:25.800 --> 03:53:31.480]  jobs that allow families to function again not with three jobs in the household but with one
[03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:39.960]  we have opportunities to build railroads to build roads and ports in a place that has the ability
[03:53:39.960 --> 03:53:46.280]  to support that with our natural resources we have an opportunity that is being missed by this
[03:53:46.280 --> 03:53:52.840]  nation as we debate the cash flow again who's going to pay the taxes who's going to pay the money
[03:53:52.840 --> 03:53:59.720]  we're all paying enough let's look at who's taking our resources for nothing and create a
[03:53:59.720 --> 03:54:07.480]  competitive contracting environment where they begin extracting our resources for us the way it's
[03:54:07.480 --> 03:54:13.080]  done in a lot of the world you know these resources are not allocated yet that we haven't made deals
[03:54:13.080 --> 03:54:21.240]  on yet we need a new deal a different deal a deal that puts the right weight on the nation's side
[03:54:21.240 --> 03:54:28.120]  of the table and not lobbyists not multinationals who have looted and robbed this country for 200
[03:54:28.120 --> 03:54:33.160]  years and continue to do so you know until this tax reform they weren't even taxed on their foreign
[03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:38.600]  income and i want to talk briefly about that in the minerals and oil and gas game they're only
[03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:46.920]  taxed on half of their income and this is why look it up look up depletion allowances depletion
[03:54:46.920 --> 03:54:52.280]  allowances what they allow and this happened back in the early 1900s when they created the income
[03:54:52.280 --> 03:54:58.360]  tax the oil gas and minerals industry were screaming bloody murder they want to pay so they put in this
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:03.720]  little thing in the code spend there ever since for over a hundred years depletion allowances
[03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:11.480]  so they get to take when they deplete the resource that we own they don't own it they lease it okay
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:17.320]  but they get to depreciate it or deplete it and so they take the amount of field goes down
[03:55:18.280 --> 03:55:22.520]  and it offsets the amount of the income they have and they can offset up to half
[03:55:22.520 --> 03:55:29.880]  of their net income in other words the 20 percent tax cap for corporations but they're in the
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:36.840]  mineral and oil and gas game it's half of that it's 10 percent domestically seven and a half percent
[03:55:37.720 --> 03:55:44.600]  internationally it's like a sales tax in some parts of the country that's what they're paying
[03:55:45.480 --> 03:55:49.720]  because of this law over a hundred years old it gives them an advantage i'm in the mineral
[03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:55.000]  business i know how it works and i appreciate the tax advantage but i don't think it's fair for
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:01.320]  americans i shouldn't have to set that type of an advantage i should be paying my fair share
[03:56:02.360 --> 03:56:09.480]  on resources that once upon a time belonged to the nation in common in this case these these
[03:56:09.480 --> 03:56:18.280]  properties were conveyed in 1904 even before income back all right but going back to the balance sheet
[03:56:18.280 --> 03:56:25.160]  the stuff that is not allocated we need a new way of looking at we need a competitive contracting
[03:56:25.160 --> 03:56:30.440]  environment because government's not good at running businesses we already know that but these
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:36.040]  are just basic natural resources that need to be contracted for extraction so the maximum value
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:43.480]  goes to the public not to private corporations that already have huge advantages tax wise and
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:53.720]  even bigger ones international a very different game we need to reset reset the nation and not
[03:56:53.720 --> 03:56:57.880]  just in the way it's being done politically right now which is creating all the consternation
[03:56:57.880 --> 03:57:03.400]  that we can imagine and what i would say in the last few seconds of this broadcast today
