[00:00.000 --> 00:19.520]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:19.520 --> 00:24.200]  The facts and common sense are in, yes there have been corrupt empires, yes they manipulate,
[00:24.200 --> 00:28.680]  yes there are secret societies, yes there have been oligarchies throughout history and
[00:28.680 --> 00:36.780]  yes today in 2002 there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing
[00:36.780 --> 00:46.400]  for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.760]  Where human beings are absolutely worthless, there's six and a quarter plus billion of
[00:51.760 --> 00:57.000]  us and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're causing a problem,
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.280]  we need to be cold at the tune of 80%, it's amazing to talk about that but it's the globalists,
[01:02.280 --> 01:08.320]  the UN, their own public statements and they've convinced a lot of liberals and elitist conservatives
[01:08.320 --> 01:16.440]  and others that by going along with this we're intelligent members of society, it's the ultimate
[01:16.440 --> 01:27.040]  Malthus world view, it is this radical virulent form of social Darwinism, it's the excuse
[01:27.040 --> 01:33.440]  of tyrants and by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.660]  bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care the
[01:39.660 --> 01:45.320]  state becomes God basically when it comes to your health and then by releasing diseases
[01:45.320 --> 01:50.800]  and viruses and plagues upon us we then basically get shoved into their system.
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.080]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, US resistance against
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.520]  a global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist China, allied with the big mega
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.800]  banks that set up communist China in 1949, the communist Chinese have taken control of
[02:04.800 --> 02:09.280]  US telecommunications infrastructure, the communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood, the
[02:09.280 --> 02:12.720]  communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities, this is all confirmed,
[02:12.720 --> 02:16.920]  this is not a drill, big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the communist
[02:16.920 --> 02:21.960]  Chinese government, they've officially become state run, Apple 100%, Google is now making
[02:21.960 --> 02:27.160]  the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship, they are now beta
[02:27.160 --> 02:31.960]  testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones to do that, this is
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.560]  happening, this is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to
[02:35.560 --> 02:40.560]  probes and censorship thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it,
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.520]  now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.280]  previous attacks, this is a tight traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using
[02:51.280 --> 02:57.360]  adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation, in layman's terms they are manipulating the
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.000]  fact that we adapt to being oppressed, we adapt to being pressed with the low dosages
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.520]  of oppression, now when the mega ton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.480]  the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose,
[03:13.480 --> 03:17.680]  total internet of things, integration, global social score, complete command and control
[03:17.680 --> 03:23.400]  system, it is the virtual reality AI weapon system, now attacking the United States with
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.000]  traders inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.480]  and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai com slash big tech making
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.520]  combat emergency situation, I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.560]  and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can, they want to double use me as they
[03:42.560 --> 03:48.720]  always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.600]  turned against us, so they take what I've said being sincere build me into an insincere person
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.920]  in the straw man, I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.640]  and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the
[04:02.640 --> 04:08.080]  distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones,
[04:08.080 --> 04:13.280]  so even if I didn't sell out to them they've now used me as an archetype to serve them
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.880]  by being the main distraction, I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare
[04:18.880 --> 04:23.760]  fulcrum and it's being used against you, only your full understanding of this key will break
[04:23.760 --> 04:28.720]  you free from this paradigm, I have given you the transmission now break free
[04:32.320 --> 04:39.680]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over

[04:48.480 --> 04:55.840]  they have their AI, we have our sixth sense and beyond, we'll be back on the other side with

[06:53.040 --> 06:57.920]  video clips hundreds of incredible articles and then only getting to a handful of them but some days

[07:12.720 --> 07:18.640]  then paul joseph watson is coming up as well okay let me say a few headlines to give you an idea what
[07:18.640 --> 07:26.800]  we're dealing with biden as you know came out and said that the children belong to the state
[07:28.560 --> 07:33.920]  and now we have democrat legislatures and the department of education publicly saying that
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.800]  they're going to teach pleasure-based sexual relations to end the family and in relationships
[07:38.800 --> 07:44.720]  that's always been the plan whether it's homosexual or heterosexual it is being pushed so that you
[07:44.720 --> 07:50.880]  don't form meaningful long-term relationships so you're isolated and that is why they're doing all
[07:50.880 --> 07:57.680]  of this this is the democratic party the federal government literally conquering america biologically
[07:57.680 --> 08:02.240]  with the destruction of the normal mammalian activity and the hyper sexualization of children
[08:02.240 --> 08:09.680]  at young ages so they can wreck their trajectory of their lives unbelievable that's just two of the
[08:09.680 --> 08:15.120]  articles here's another one and i'm not going through these in the order of what's most important
[08:15.120 --> 08:20.880]  they're all important all just shows the evil cup that's been spilled out on us dnc pollster finds
[08:20.880 --> 08:26.480]  democrat voters frustrated discouraged and frightened frightened of their own party yes
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.080]  frightened taught to hate the republicans taught to hate christians taught to hate conservatives and
[08:32.080 --> 08:38.080]  populace and there's certainly some people that aren't perfect the republicans but knowing you can
[08:38.080 --> 08:45.040]  see for yourself america is literally being destroyed as fast as the globalist can without
[08:45.040 --> 08:51.840]  getting an uprising and they have another plan to actually push it and get an uprising so we are
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.600]  stuck in a rock and a hard place we don't want uprisings and we don't want to collapse we have to
[08:57.600 --> 09:03.280]  just politically culturally spiritually take back control of our lives and not comply we've
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.280]  got that incredible information we have all these different hollywood people talking about how they
[09:07.280 --> 09:11.920]  drink blood on television not just megan fox i thought i'd get it what's behind that that's
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.880]  called lesser magic they need to tell you what they're doing that gives it more power
[09:16.880 --> 09:22.160]  they have americans called it counting coup not when they drank blood but when they would tell
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.280]  somebody they were coming to kill them you get extra feather in your hat and your cap if you
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.680]  told somebody you were coming and then if you counted coup where you would have a club that
[09:31.680 --> 09:35.520]  wasn't a lethal club but a wooden club where you'd hit him in the leg hit him in the chest hit him
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.680]  in the head and your coup would just go up that you were so good you could have killed him three
[09:39.680 --> 09:46.240]  four times before you pull out the real battle axe the real stone club and beat their brains out
[09:46.240 --> 09:53.760]  their brains out that's all part of counting coup it's like a video game you get jumbo spiritual
[09:53.760 --> 10:01.840]  numbers with diablo uh when you drink the blood on tv so we've got that coming up it's the externalization
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.560]  of the hierarchy and they need to do this so that god raises the hedge of protection from us
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.240]  removes it so they can come in against us this is all being done as a ritual to destroy our
[10:12.240 --> 10:18.240]  purity and our innocence you see how it all ties together remember jocelyn elder said and i still
[10:18.240 --> 10:22.960]  can't find the audio but rush lumbar used to play it but that was pre-internet and they've scrubbed
[10:22.960 --> 10:28.800]  it so well i couldn't find sorrel saying he loved working for the nazis from 60 minutes but finally
[10:28.800 --> 10:35.520]  found it again they'd scrub that but she said oh you reach down to the baby in the crib and you
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.240]  would do it for it you'll touch it you know and she's like i mean this woman was going to be the
[10:42.240 --> 10:48.320]  surgeon general well now it's official teach them the pleasure-based sexual relations at age five
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.080]  these are some really nasty folks and they've been pushing their agenda for a long
[10:56.080 --> 10:58.240]  long time let's shift here is the other big news
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.800]  and and what do these two clubs have to do with each other here but play obama first
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.960]  we have now essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions worldwide
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.840]  he just puts it out there like it's no big deal but it is a declaration of biological and chemical
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.880]  war in your face shed with a smile here it is despite the fact that we've now
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.680]  essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.520]  around one in five americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and
[11:33.520 --> 11:37.280]  end put their families at risk rather than get vaccinated
[11:40.320 --> 11:46.240]  people are dying because of misinformation and they've set up a new disinformation ministry
[11:46.240 --> 11:51.120]  of truth officially to stop that except everything we said was true everything they've said has been
[11:51.120 --> 11:57.200]  a lie so let's let's talk about that statement they said safe and affected it had been tested
[11:57.760 --> 12:03.040]  two years ago when it wasn't tested and their own internal cdc documents said it wouldn't work and
[12:03.040 --> 12:08.240]  would cause heart attacks myocarditis blood clots cancer infertility you name it we have it from the
[12:08.240 --> 12:14.480]  cdc but then he works to make sure you can't hear our show where we show you all those documents
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.440]  i showed those documents again yesterday on the screen at the cdc website to see the fine print
[12:19.440 --> 12:26.320]  tells you what's it's going to do but then in the national news where it's not a legally binding
[12:26.320 --> 12:33.200]  statement obama can lie to you but hide it at the kernel of truth it's now essentially been
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.360]  clinically tested on billions of people and then they suppress all those real numbers as much as
[12:37.360 --> 12:45.120]  they can canada the us the e you the uk new zealand they've all announced operations to
[12:45.120 --> 12:53.360]  suppress clinical data because it would add fodder or credence to the conspiracy theorist
[12:53.360 --> 13:02.240]  oh a 40 plus percent increase in death in 18 to 63 stuff like that that's in all the insurance
[13:02.240 --> 13:09.200]  numbers it's 40 or 40 plus percent on average it's 40 percent let that sink in ladies and
[13:09.200 --> 13:15.200]  women those are factual mainstream articles but then separately oh here's obama oh we tested on you
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.280]  as you were all guinea pigs and then we suppress what happened and just tell you oh it's totally
[13:21.280 --> 13:26.240]  safe and we've got to shut down anybody that disagrees with us breaking by administration
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.120]  creates disinformation governance board under dhs the fight misinformation we'll get into all that
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.320]  and then meanwhile putin says we have weapons that no other nation has and we will use them if
[13:38.320 --> 13:44.480]  needed and this is after labiroth three days ago threatened basically nuclear war saying russia is
[13:44.480 --> 13:49.840]  now at war with nato and they're announcing that uh they're already sitting in polish and us troops
[13:49.840 --> 13:55.200]  uh who are fighting and i just talked to some military people this morning who just returned
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.880]  they said it's full on like world war two just absolute just destruction dead bodies everywhere
[14:00.880 --> 14:07.200]  russians annihilating russians getting annihilated just tank battles just this is full on war folks
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.240]  it's why you're not seeing a lot of it or hearing about it it's just full on war we're at war with
[14:12.240 --> 14:23.520]  russia right now here's putin if anyone attempts to interfere in these events from the outside
[14:24.480 --> 14:32.560]  they must know and if they create threats strategic threats to russia that are unacceptable to us
[14:32.560 --> 14:44.880]  they must realize that our response to their attacks will be swift we will we have all the
[14:44.880 --> 14:58.880]  instruments all the weapons required to do so we have weapons that no other nation has and we will
[14:58.880 --> 15:06.960]  use them if needed so the department of education and the state legislatures that are controlled by
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.920]  democrats have announced we're going to sexualize your children and teach them to not be in nuclear
[15:11.920 --> 15:16.080]  families that's official the president says the children belong to the government when they're in
[15:16.080 --> 15:21.760]  the school that they're the parents the border is completely collapsed but they've got school kids
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.000]  all over the country drilling to go to medical centers and be tested without parental consent
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.440]  they're giving children injections without parental consent obama admits they just getting
[15:29.440 --> 15:36.560]  picked two billion people putin is threatening nuclear war and i'm just getting started and
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.320]  movie stars are all over tv talking about how much they drink blood does any of this sound good to you
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.800]  oh and then there's probably a hundred articles today and major publications calling for my arrest
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.920]  for january six yeah that's where we are folks that's where this country is that's how much trouble

[19:15.200 --> 19:20.160]  and of course triggered by the brakes in the uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.440]  fascist world government that's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing
[19:25.440 --> 19:33.600]  us of build back better this is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world
[19:33.600 --> 19:39.120]  economy because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which
[19:39.120 --> 19:44.640]  is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon
[19:44.640 --> 19:50.880]  on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.280]  maybe it's because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine released

[21:11.840 --> 21:15.040]  because the shortfalls was something they've been telling me for years but i wasn't listening
[21:15.040 --> 21:19.840]  because i kind of run everything around here uh and i've loved to see my pants a lot of times
[21:19.840 --> 21:24.640]  and so i kept designing every month a new t-shirt or a couple times a month and that's why some of
[21:24.640 --> 21:28.400]  the designs are really amazing some are kind of okay because it's pretty much me designing them
[21:28.400 --> 21:32.560]  and telling folks what i want so i'm not gonna say we have the best shirts but we got some really
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.480]  good ones and some okay ones the point is they're real they're americana by telling me we got the

[21:39.840 --> 21:43.200]  it is so that's why i have to be honest with t-shirts some are amazing some are just okay
[21:43.200 --> 21:48.480]  the point is they're historic i mean hell the original mass murderers agree gun control works
[21:48.480 --> 21:58.640]  shirt i designed 22 23 years ago back when the editing software took me like a day of just
[21:58.640 --> 22:03.040]  processing to be able to put a picture of hitler stalin and mal on a white shirt and say mass
[22:03.040 --> 22:08.160]  murderers agree gun control works on the back peasants or politicians love disarm peasants

[23:54.960 --> 24:04.080]  saw why it's gone viral on twitter on taylor del's twitter site 20 years ago folks alex jones said
[24:04.080 --> 24:10.400]  open borders castle society centralized state run health care depopulation release of plagues and
[24:10.400 --> 24:17.440]  viruses and there it is well how did i know all that because it's in their own plans and then
[24:18.880 --> 24:24.640]  a video from four years ago where i predicted everything that happened we played that and
[24:24.640 --> 24:29.920]  i specifically laid out what was coming next i mean we know what's coming next and it's unspeakable
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.840]  hell it's unspeakable collapse and you've got all these minions of the corporate and governmental
[24:35.840 --> 24:44.160]  system and ecclesiastical system and and and the education system as well going along with this
[24:44.160 --> 24:48.720]  breakdown of civilization they believe it's their clout and pivot communist takeover
[24:48.720 --> 24:53.840]  no it's a permanent long-term post-industrial world where almost everyone even serving the
[24:53.840 --> 25:00.080]  system will be dead or in a forced labor camp before it's all over please turn back now
[25:00.080 --> 25:05.440]  minions of the system please realize historically you are guaranteed going down a bad path i know
[25:05.440 --> 25:10.240]  evil is fascinating to you i know the thought of being a powerful thug with a machine gun ruling over
[25:10.240 --> 25:14.640]  us in death camps really excites you and they're salivating everywhere wanting to arrest all
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.520]  trump supporters right now over the news that's not going to result in what you think that's
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.600]  designed to bring the country down trying to execute that operation against the american people
[25:25.600 --> 25:31.680]  is a suicide mission of any major army much less the justice department and i'm not seeing a
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.240]  suicide mission because i'm gonna physically fight it no i'm trying to stop all this i'm trying to
[25:36.240 --> 25:42.560]  stop the civil war well i gotta do is turn on the news and see them pushing a civil war i don't
[25:42.560 --> 25:46.960]  want our country torn apart i don't want violence against any group organization whether it's the
[25:46.960 --> 25:51.840]  private citizens of the government or corporations because we have a problem of good and evil in
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.320]  this country in the world and you're not going to fix it just taking out the figureheads we've
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.000]  got to fundamentally change who we are in our hearts as jesus christ said and then be examples
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.200]  in the world to change the world and then not submit to evil and be civilly disobedient like
[26:09.200 --> 26:16.400]  jesus did like mahogany did and like martin luther king jr did the example of christ was the new
[26:16.400 --> 26:23.760]  type of warfare knowing how to turn the cheek knowing how to then stand up though and rebuke
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.120]  those and then they get down on the gutter and then they lose the fight what did gondy say
[26:30.560 --> 26:36.000]  any true leader who's trying to free the people will go through this process first they ignore you
[26:36.000 --> 26:45.440]  then they laugh at you then they attack you kill you imprison you and then you win
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.040]  you understand that it always works that way when you have right on your side first they ignore you
[26:51.760 --> 27:00.960]  then they laugh at you then they attack you then they lose so just remember that everything
[27:00.960 --> 27:05.680]  good we've got everybody knows this is because our forebears stood up for what was right and for
[27:05.680 --> 27:09.440]  human justice didn't mean when they started trying to fix things everything was perfect it took them
[27:09.440 --> 27:14.400]  a long time in the processes but the state of liberty and freedom and transparency we'd had
[27:14.960 --> 27:19.760]  took hundreds of years of the renaissance to develop and in just a few short decades it's
[27:19.760 --> 27:29.920]  being burned down to the ground and there is a certain exhilaration and manicness to tyrants
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.480]  and their minions while they're ransacking the castle while they're burning down the village
[27:34.480 --> 27:38.800]  while they're raping and pillaging but they find in the morning then there's nothing left to live
[27:38.800 --> 27:44.720]  off of and they try to move on to the next village the next town except then they run out of villages
[27:44.720 --> 27:51.040]  and towns or more than not the villages and towns band together when the barbarians come
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.280]  and they stand against the barbarians and they defeat them together and so you're gonna have
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.400]  to decide whether to do this the easy way folks are the hard way but i counted the cost
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.200]  and i believed in you and i knew that if we exposed the new world order we talked about
[28:07.200 --> 28:11.840]  what it was going to do and then when it came true the first phases of it we'd have a really
[28:11.840 --> 28:15.600]  good shot at beating it because we would have already laid out that this was coming and people
[28:15.600 --> 28:21.840]  were really impressed with that when you can tell them 10 20 25 30 years before what's going to happen
[28:21.840 --> 28:28.000]  to the t then even the laziest people go i better go research what he knows because as we speak it's
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.560]  all over the news like it's no big deal oh yeah the u.m. is going to run our healthcare in america
[28:32.560 --> 28:37.120]  so she says yeah you don't have congress doing that or you don't have the legislatures no no no
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.680]  it's it's it's not even the executive it's the u.n. well of course the u.n. runs it i ain't duh
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.880]  we're going into a totally tyrannical world government whose in game is killing you and your
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.960]  family and that's all over the news they say yeah we want to depopulate everybody at the
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.040]  debo script and i talk about it the new york times says he's psychotic he says the globalists want
[28:57.040 --> 29:04.240]  to depopulate yeah you see this it's an info wars republic defense card with original info

[33:07.440 --> 33:19.120]  live raw and unfiltered by globalist propaganda it's alex jones
[33:19.120 --> 33:36.640]  all right let's drill into the covid biomedical tyranny takeover stack here
[33:37.920 --> 33:43.920]  it is extremely extremely important obviously i already played this clip i'm gonna play it one
[33:43.920 --> 33:50.720]  more time this is former president barack hussain obama he says we have now essentially clinically
[33:50.720 --> 33:59.840]  tested the vaccine on billions worldwide again let's go over the lies here they lied and said
[33:59.840 --> 34:03.920]  had been clinically tested had they lied and said it was a vaccine it wasn't this is all fact
[34:04.720 --> 34:09.520]  and now he admits they can he pick billions of people but he says it's safe and anybody that
[34:09.520 --> 34:16.960]  doesn't say it's safe should be shut down should be silenced as disinformation and that ties into
[34:16.960 --> 34:24.240]  the next story breaking by administration creates disinformation governance board under dhs to fight
[34:25.200 --> 34:32.400]  misinformation and i believe we have that clip in here if we do not have that clip uh get that
[34:32.400 --> 34:38.640]  for me guys because clip 13 okay i do i do want to get to that clip here in a moment but first
[34:40.080 --> 34:43.520]  let's get into this covid stack that it ties into
[34:48.240 --> 34:55.520]  pre-print sars cov2 vaccination can elicit cd8 t-cell dominant hepatitis now they already knew
[34:55.520 --> 34:59.600]  that but little kids are getting hepatitis all over the world and it's from the vaccine it's
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.120]  hitting their liver a virus is hitting their liver what do you think the vaccine is it's
[35:03.120 --> 35:10.000]  a virus a prion crystal hepatitis outbreak even mainstream news reports it's the vaccine
[35:14.080 --> 35:20.960]  hepatitis outbreak in children may be a coincidence of covid lockdowns weakened immunity the media
[35:20.960 --> 35:27.280]  tries to spin it while road island takes steps prevent potential hepatitis a outbreak oh
[35:27.280 --> 35:32.960]  oh we'll take your shots that'll stop it wonder what's causing this outbreak as road island
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.120]  moves for forced inoculation and then just like israel was basically forced inoculation you'll
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.680]  wonder why you have the highest rates of blood clots heart attacks and this new crazy thing that
[35:43.680 --> 35:48.560]  eats your liver gee what could it be what what did we tell you two years ago that the gene therapy
[35:48.560 --> 35:55.200]  said to do in a small percentage of people they do it eat your liver oh there's another one sars
[35:55.200 --> 36:04.400]  cov2 vaccination can elicit a cd8 t-cell dominant hepatitis and here it is right here in the journal
[36:04.400 --> 36:11.040]  of hepatitis pathology very prestigious you might want to go read this for yourself if you care
[36:11.040 --> 36:15.760]  or just give them the experimental shot and see what happens there's more of the studies
[36:15.760 --> 36:23.920]  Meanwhile Fauci clarifies us out of acute component of pandemic phase but but but sake
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.520]  comes out and contradicts him and says no it's not so these lying criminals can't even get their
[36:29.520 --> 36:34.720]  lives straight just in congresswoman xc waters says she has tested positive for covid i'm
[36:34.720 --> 36:40.160]  grateful to be fully vaccinated and have received two booster shots and boy these people are dropping
[36:40.160 --> 36:47.200]  dead fast as much as i hate them i hate seeing people hurt themselves who says pandemic justifies
[36:47.200 --> 36:52.320]  leaders pitch at maderna meeting the un now officially roiders reports will be promoting
[36:52.320 --> 37:00.320]  maderna the strongest one that has tripled the side effects of even the visor hayley beaver
[37:00.320 --> 37:06.160]  had a heart surgery after scary blood clot caused many stroke after she took the shot yeah very young
[37:06.160 --> 37:14.160]  woman nyh study finds those with shots at fewer antibodies even after covid infection
[37:16.960 --> 37:22.000]  you hear that that's mainstream news that's the nyh reporting that the vaccine erases your immune
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.360]  system and you get covid more often other studies show that as well but it's okay
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.760]  covid mandates for white house correspondence dinners don't apply to all only certain people
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.960]  are forced to do it like the cooks and the workers they got to wear mask all the elitists won't i mean
[37:38.960 --> 37:45.600]  this is a true class system under islam the women have to cover their faces wonder the new order
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.600]  just all us commoners do let's go ahead since i mentioned it and play that obama clip just
[37:51.600 --> 37:57.520]  you can hear it for yourself one more time before i hit the rest of the story despite the fact that
[37:57.520 --> 38:04.800]  we know essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide
[38:08.960 --> 38:14.000]  around one in five americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and put their families at
[38:14.000 --> 38:21.840]  risk rather than get vaccinated people are dying because of misinformation
[38:21.840 --> 38:29.440]  uh i just incredible lies ladies and gentlemen uh and here is may orcas who's got the border
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.440]  completely wide open they're getting rid of title 42 to even check for any diseases from
[38:33.440 --> 38:37.440]  third world countries or weapons or that people aren't smuggling children which we know goes on
[38:37.440 --> 38:43.600]  on the mass scale senate reports all confirmed and that obama by the way oversaw all that well
[38:43.600 --> 38:48.640]  now it's much much bigger under biden here is secretary of homeland security may orcas says
[38:48.640 --> 38:53.200]  disinformation governance board is being created counter misinformation that means
[38:53.200 --> 38:59.440]  criticizing his trees and here it is another huge threat to our homeland is miss and disinformation
[38:59.440 --> 39:04.080]  you noted that it's a concern of yours at the border with human smuggling organizations peddling
[39:04.080 --> 39:09.680]  misinformation to exploit vulnerable migrants for profit one of my main concerns about disinformation
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.720]  is that foreign adversaries attempt to destabilize our elections by targeting people of color with
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.240]  disinformation campaigns after it became clear that there was foreign meddling in our 2016 election
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.520]  the senate select committee on intelligence authored a report on the disinformation tactics
[39:25.520 --> 39:30.880]  used by russia's internet research agency the ira to interfere in the election the report found
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.000]  that quote no single group of americans was targeted by the ira information operatives
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.840]  more than african americans a newer trend that we saw in the 2020 election and already in the 2022
[39:41.840 --> 39:46.960]  midterms is that disinformation is being heavily targeted at spanish speaking voters
[39:46.960 --> 39:52.800]  sparking and fueling conspiracy theories dhs and its components play a big role in addressing
[39:52.800 --> 39:57.840]  miss and disinformation i can't listen anymore of this i mean you've got 99% of the corporate
[39:57.840 --> 40:01.680]  media is anti-freedom you've got globalists destroying everything of hollywood drinking
[40:01.680 --> 40:08.000]  blood on tv you have men competing in women's sports we have the department of education
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.040]  announcing they're going to sexualize basically pedophilia eyes children in age five my god
[40:13.040 --> 40:16.880]  and you wonder why we don't like you lady you trust you and then you call us to see

[40:21.840 --> 40:26.960]  who the hell would believe people like you don't give a rat's ass what color you are lady you work
[40:26.960 --> 40:34.000]  for evil good lord and our big problems the republicans at the top are almost as bad here's
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.240]  the headlines by administration creates disinformation governance board under dhs to fight misinformation
[40:40.240 --> 40:47.200]  that's literally out of 1984 everybody overuses hitler everybody overuses stalin everybody over
[40:47.200 --> 40:53.040]  uses 1984 but this is directly a ministry of truth and they're all over the news saying oh come back
[40:53.040 --> 41:00.400]  with this that alex jones needs to be arrested for his misinformation that was always the logical
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.240]  extension of this they're coming for your children they're injecting your children with something
[41:06.240 --> 41:11.760]  that gives them viral hepatitis on record you think these are nice people i got articles out

[41:18.000 --> 41:24.480]  from the lockdowns of course they knew what they were doing this is psychological warfare
[41:24.480 --> 41:29.040]  but we're lucky here in the west we didn't get our food cut off for almost two years like abrica
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.520]  where an extra 10 million people started death worldwide an extra 25 million now
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.640]  oh but those are just raw numbers right they don't humanize that all day
[41:41.040 --> 41:45.600]  it just goes on and on biden starts disinformation board led by russia expert who called
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.680]  hunter's laptop trump product yeah that's another thing about that speech by that congresswoman i
[41:49.680 --> 41:56.480]  was just showing you talking to me orcas is they say oh the russians meddled in 2016 and 2020

[47:24.800 --> 47:40.560]  i feel it floating in the air
[47:55.200 --> 48:04.480]  my friends thank you so much for being here with us in this epic journey you're all together
[48:04.480 --> 48:11.760]  sharing all right let's get into why they feared the broadcast before i hit this ministry of truth
[48:11.760 --> 48:18.160]  publicly being established to persecute and destroy and annihilate the free peoples of earth
[48:18.160 --> 48:28.000]  here is a clip from 2002 where i lay out what was coming and what was gonna unfold and i ask you is
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.240]  this disinformation or is this the blood of truth here it is the facts and common sense are in yes
[48:34.240 --> 48:39.600]  there have been corrupt empires yes they manipulate yes there are secret societies yes there have
[48:39.600 --> 48:46.480]  been oligarchies throughout history and yes today in 2002 there is a tyrannical organization calling
[48:46.480 --> 48:56.560]  itself the new world order pushing for worldwide government a cashless society open borders total
[48:56.560 --> 49:03.840]  and complete tyranny where human beings are absolutely worthless there's six and a quarter
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.640]  plus billion of us and the globalists have said it many times there's too many of us we're causing
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.080]  a problem we need to be cold at the tune of 80 percent it's amazing to talk about that
[49:14.080 --> 49:20.080]  but it's the globalist the un their own public statements and they've convinced a lot of liberals
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.760]  and elitist conservatives and others that by going along with this that we're intelligent
[49:25.760 --> 49:35.760]  members of society it's the ultimate mouth this world view it is this radical virulent form
[49:35.760 --> 49:43.920]  of social Darwinism it's the excuse of tyrants and by creating open borders where there's no
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.840]  national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources by centralizing and
[49:49.840 --> 49:55.760]  socializing health care the state becomes god basically when it comes to your health and then
[49:55.760 --> 50:02.640]  by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us we then basically get shoved into their system
[50:02.640 --> 50:09.120]  we then basically get shoved into their system that's why they hate me because we are directly
[50:09.120 --> 50:15.440]  over the target we are in the matrix we are in the zeitgeist contending with their agent smiths
[50:15.440 --> 50:25.360]  at point blank range and they know their attempts to censor have failed and so they now come for me
[50:25.360 --> 50:31.440]  and you breaking and I mentioned this but I got sick of listening to congresswoman here's
[50:31.440 --> 50:37.760]  the actual clip out of the clip of the head of dhs mayorkas saying that yes we're establishing
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.200]  this disinformation committee that will then go out and order anyone censored they want or
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.600]  call for the fbi to go after whoever they want that's what they're saying or even have the
[50:47.600 --> 50:54.160]  cia go after people and and then of course put out announced facts that we're supposed to receive
[50:54.160 --> 51:00.560]  as gospel absolute truth here it is congresswoman we have a number of different offices that
[51:00.560 --> 51:06.160]  different offices engaged in this critical effort of course our cyber security and infrastructure
[51:06.160 --> 51:13.600]  security agency has an entire effort focused on election security right as part of its mission
[51:13.600 --> 51:21.440]  set our office of policy office of planning policy and strategy also is a leading effort
[51:22.640 --> 51:29.920]  our undersecretary for policy rob silvers is co-chair with our principal deputy general
[51:29.920 --> 51:39.520]  counsel jennifer daskel in leading a just recently constituted misinformation disinformation
[51:39.520 --> 51:45.040]  governance board so we're bringing the goal is to bring the resources of the department
[51:45.600 --> 51:51.600]  together to address this threat i just read a very interesting study that underscores the
[51:51.600 --> 51:58.000]  importance of the the point that you make of the the spread of myths and disinformation
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.800]  in minority communities specifically and we are focused on that in the context of our cp3
[52:04.800 --> 52:10.720]  and other efforts translated brown folks ain't drinking the kool-aid no more and neither are
[52:10.720 --> 52:16.240]  white folks that were coming together and that's got the system scared so continuing biden starts
[52:16.240 --> 52:21.840]  disinformation board led by russia expert who called hundreds biden's laptop a product of
[52:21.840 --> 52:26.880]  trump and said it was all fake the thousands of pedophile images videos the crack smoking all
[52:26.880 --> 52:34.320]  of it was fake of course it was all all real and folks point this out jason hawthorne points out on
[52:34.320 --> 52:39.600]  twitter i know 1984 references are a little stale but the government creating an actual ministry
[52:39.600 --> 52:48.320]  of truth is a little two on the nose for me and here is the actual fcc ftc document doj
[52:49.200 --> 52:55.600]  where the left and the just department's own subgroups asked that wait for it elon musk not
[52:55.600 --> 53:01.920]  be able to buy twitter this was a threat to free speech and democracy so if you don't censor
[53:02.800 --> 53:08.480]  and if you don't shut down free speech you're hurting free speech the head of the fcc rejects
[53:08.480 --> 53:14.640]  call for fcc to block musk purchase of twitter now let's move to this and i don't want to spend
[53:14.640 --> 53:19.680]  much time on myself but it's very important in the larger areas so i'll only cover stuff about
[53:19.680 --> 53:26.720]  myself when it's really key but we're in central this for a reason we know we're talking about they
[53:26.720 --> 53:30.800]  have articles in the texas newspapers the new york times just all i mean i got over a hundred alerts
[53:30.800 --> 53:36.400]  on this today saying alex jones has gone to the january sixth committee and he basically admits
[53:36.400 --> 53:40.400]  he's guilty and he's going to expose trump everything total lies none of it's true the
[53:40.400 --> 53:44.160]  just department kept calling here over and over again to our lawyers for the last three months
[53:44.160 --> 53:47.520]  we said no and we and we said have you dropped the charges on no one who did nothing wrong
[53:47.520 --> 53:53.520]  and you send us written questions and you give me immunity so you don't lie and say that i
[53:53.520 --> 53:56.960]  perjured myself was just they'll just have a witness say i lied what matter i'm telling the
[53:56.960 --> 54:02.320]  truth i'm not going to be martha stewart then i will talk to you if somebody comes to your door
[54:04.960 --> 54:08.160]  and says we want to talk to you and you open the door and talk to him are you reaching out
[54:08.160 --> 54:18.320]  no but but again oh he's in trouble oh he admits he did it i mean it's just it's it's so evil so
[54:18.320 --> 54:23.040]  here's another one of the articles facing judgment alex jones pleads for help from the deep state
[54:23.040 --> 54:30.880]  so now going to a federal court access to state or federal courts going to a federal court and
[54:30.880 --> 54:34.400]  saying they claim i have hundreds of millions of dollars i don't have ten million dollars i don't
[54:34.400 --> 54:41.360]  have five million dollars they already have found me guilty without a trial so here i'm in bankruptcy
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.760]  you know how much money i have fine just i don't want the show trials this summer and this fall
[54:47.760 --> 54:53.120]  three sandy hook show trials be on tv everywhere i'm not scared of that but it'll be a fiasco
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.200]  and it's a lie and it's a fraud and it's not a real trial where i'm not even allowed to defend
[54:57.200 --> 55:03.840]  myself i'm already guilty so i go to the federal court hoping it's a little better and that turns
[55:03.840 --> 55:08.800]  into i've gone to the deep state no the deep state is the controlled media the deep state is the

[1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:13.920]  on cnn plus after less than a month shuttering its arrogant evil lying sociopathic doors but first
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:18.560]  this uh video got tens of millions of views in the last few days on twitter instagram or
[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:25.680]  where else you name it so i thought we'd play it see the hilarious reason alex jones was banned
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:30.480]  from twitter and this is the head lawyer that broke down crying two days ago project veritas
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:37.280]  caught it on tape when she was uh talking to an all-hands meeting of executives about elon musk
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:43.120]  taking over and this is why they claim i was banned for talking bad to oliver darcy when i saw him
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:49.120]  outside of congressional hearing in dc a few years ago this is like four years ago now and it's
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:53.280]  famous video where i say this is the one that tries to censor people this is the guy that says
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.400]  i'm bad and racist this is the guy that attacks me and i said amongst other things that he looks
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:04.800]  like a evil possum try to have a little bit of fun and of course he went and tattled and that was
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:10.160]  the final straw you can't talk bad to public figures they're only allowed to bully and dox you
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:17.360]  and censor and ban you so uh here's a little mashup of that the guy that goes around policing
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:21.200]  and calling for censorship and then claims that trump's wrong there's no censorship of
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:30.720]  conservatives or patriots you are incredible channel how are you doing alex eyes of the rat
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:34.560]  eyes of the rat

[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:28.880]  all you people that have a fury already complex and think you can take the greatness of america
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:33.120]  and dominate it you might actually be somebody because you project your own loathing for yourself
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:38.880]  on everybody else i'm a winner i love myself i love who i come from victory and strength and honor
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:45.120]  you are the definition of dishonor and one day in the encyclopedia britannica encyclopedia galactica
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:49.200]  it will have your face next to dishonor and the word rat what do you hope to accomplish here
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.480]  i'm just showing people just the survival nature of the bottom of the barrel these dying news
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:59.040]  corporations have to dredge up from the front lines to attack the first amendment
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.280]  they're the equivalent of like that in my view you're the equivalent of like the hitler youth
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:07.600]  they put on the front lines stop the advance of the allies so you came here to attack the media
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:12.800]  you're not the media you are fake news you are the criminal news network you engage in racketeering
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:17.200]  trying to shut down real news real information you engage in lying and fraud in your audience
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:24.000]  on a free meditative continual basis you got some damn evil eyes son
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:35.520]  you got some damn evil eyes son the video's on bandod video but for any listeners that want to
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:39.360]  see it or folks want to share it the notice he said where are you going to publish this
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:47.840]  because already been taken off youtube and apple and instagram and a bunch of other places
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:55.120]  so he then went and ran admittedly and tattled to twitter because how dare i stand up with somebody
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:01.680]  that's been attacking me for years i'm lying about me how dare i it resist him peacefully
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:09.120]  that's where these people are and that's that's where they come from and that's what they do but
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:15.360]  now he was supposed to have his own show on cnn plus with ron stelter and now it's canceled after
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:20.560]  a month with 300 million dollars investment because no one wants to watch you or listen to you so just
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:26.160]  because you think you'd silence all your competition doesn't mean anybody would come it'd be like if
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:31.760]  they canceled all the real nascar drivers the top 100 drivers and then brought people out there that
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:37.680]  had just gotten their driving license at 16 it didn't know how to drive and then like oh we're
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:43.280]  going to go watch that at nascar let's go watch people don't even know how to drive a car i mean
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:47.520]  seriously what you think we're going to show up and pay for that think anybody wants to listen to you
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:52.400]  you think just because you come down on us with both feet with the whole system
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:57.760]  means you can still beat us because no just like the united states under global's control couldn't
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:05.440]  defeat the vietnamese in a 15 year war and i'm sorry a lot of our people got chewed up in that
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:12.160]  fraud but it was a fraud you will not beat us either you new world order scum if we know you're an
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.880]  outside force if we know you're here oppressing us if we know you're here trying to dominate us
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:23.360]  and we simply wake up to that fact you will never prevail no matter what you do and you are hated
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:28.480]  and you are loath mercenaries of the new world order period
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:32.800]  but that's what they fear
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:38.320]  all right let's hit the military news right now in the economy news
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:47.840]  this is i mean it's hard to even be on air trying to get excited about this because
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:52.960]  i'm already super upset about it and there's not words describe how upset i am and i know
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:58.480]  you know it's dangerous too it's just crazy that the west had a proxy war and overthrew
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:02.160]  the electric government eight years ago and attacked russian held areas on their border
[1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:09.920]  and did all of this and finally lured russia into this giant war that's going on it's full
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:16.720]  scale i've talked to sources that just returned it's unlike anything since world war two or korea
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:24.960]  it is just full on battles and full on house to house and just dead people everywhere on both sides
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:30.880]  so a lot of russians are dying a lot of ukrainians are dying and a lot of western personnel
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:38.480]  are dying as well but there's such media control you're not hearing about it so it's bad
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:42.800]  and i haven't been given all the details because that's classified
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:48.720]  i can tell you the people over there say that the only group making any headway here is the new
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:56.000]  world order with divide and conquer and a police state and massive weapons contracts but it's a
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:02.560]  loser for everybody else involved putin came out and said we have weapons that no nation has

[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:06.480]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:17.600]  the united states is officially in war with russia through nato
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:24.400]  russia has openly made those statements on monday we didn't need putin or labroth to tell us that
[1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:30.320]  we know that this has all been set up by the globalist this is terribly dangerous and is
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:36.000]  accelerating towards nuclear war labroth said that we are getting very close to nuclear war as the
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:41.360]  west escalates weapons and training into ukraine and now latimer putin said this today
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:51.680]  if anyone attempts to interfere in these events from the outside they must know
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:21:00.160]  and if they create threats strategic threats to russia that are unacceptable to us they must
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:12.400]  realize that our response to their attacks will be swift we will we have all the instruments all
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:30.560]  the weapons required to do so we have weapons that no other nation has and we will use them if needed
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:39.520]  russia is a distraction ukraine is a diversion from the world economic collapse engineered
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:44.320]  by two years of lockdowns in the third world often on lockdowns in europe and other areas of the world
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:50.000]  this is a global consolidation of power the new global digital programmable token
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:57.440]  cashless society social credit score carbon tax regime it's not coming it's being rolled out now
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:03.280]  but then either old system would go down while they pose as the saviors that's why the globalists
[1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:07.600]  that are corporate manipulating all the different sides against each other are saying that power
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:16.320]  outages and cyber attacks are imminent meanwhile biden seeks 33 billion for ukraine a massive jump
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:28.480]  in funding you hear that 33 billion on top of the tens of billions just this year but it gets worse
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:34.320]  biden wants new powers to seize russian assets and that means anybody they say is connected to a
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:40.160]  russian and i have been particularly targeted by those lies when they have said it's a us
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:45.440]  government policy to fight russians and then when big banks cancel our bank accounts they
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:51.840]  one of them sent us the secret document out of g2 basically saying we're listed as russians and
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:59.040]  and his and his agents of evil meanwhile hunter biden and his dad got three plus million dollars
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:05.840]  from the moscow mayor and it just goes on from there but that's okay because you know
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:10.000]  joe biden's a pedophile so it's okay right he's part of the club poland has secret plan
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:14.640]  for ukraine moscow claims it's not even russia's claim i don't just believe moscow they they like
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:20.640]  quite a bit polans always set a bunch of areas on the border of western ukraine belong to them
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:26.640]  and they're talking about taking it that's what happens in wars countries get divided up i predict
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:32.320]  russia will take about a third of eastern ukraine i predict poland take about 10 percent of western
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:38.880]  ukraine inability to quickly replace stingers and javelins for ukraine highlights industrial
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:44.560]  base problems air force mag reports that they are running out of weapons that's what i was told
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:55.760]  by my military sources that were over there as journalists and they see all the different
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:01.760]  foreign brigades that are coming in including with military background and there's no weapons for them
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:11.760]  iran outlines joint goals with china so this is driven iran and russia and china closer together
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:17.760]  polish households are out of gas now their main way of cooking food and heating and cooling their
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:25.120]  homes as russia turns off the gas as they promised they would do us companies are in no rush to
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:31.840]  substitute russian oil in europe despite washington's promises and again russia is the second largest
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:37.040]  supplier of fertilizer one of the biggest suppliers of grain in the world the third largest supplier
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:43.680]  of oil i mean this is going to hurt us not them the rubles up fuel is up gas prices are up both
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:51.600]  natural gas and gasoline crude oil all of it madelvian president says country in predicament
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  since they have no alternatives to russian gas and it goes on from there so a very very very
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:11.200]  dangerous situation that we are all in right now i want to hit some more news on the economy
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:15.440]  then we'll go to break them back with their phone calls and other news and clips the balance of
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:25.760]  today's broadcast now again you saw the head of the imf on monday we played a bunch of clips
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:37.520]  say in english in broken english that they didn't know printing thousands of trillions of dollars
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:42.640]  and other currencies and then giving it to themselves at big corporations and banks to buy
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:49.600]  up everything would cause inflation and they went on to say they need to slow the economy down by
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:54.240]  raising taxes on little people the same thing chuckie schumer said which of course is the exact
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:26:02.720]  opposite you do during an inflationary period if you want to bankrupt somebody cut their pay
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:09.360]  which is what taxes do while prices go up while the rich elites give themselves trillions of dollars
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:14.080]  a week to buy up whatever they want
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:25.680]  recession us gdp shockingly contracts in q1 driven by inventory exports plunge so our exports are
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:31.200]  even down we can't get stuff out of china there's no supply chain to speak of everything's falling
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:37.520]  apart i can tell you that and the average american still doesn't get the fact that we've gone over
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:44.400]  the edge of a cliff us goods trade deficit hits record high q1 gdp growth estimates slash
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:55.360]  Reuters us economy post surprise contraction oh yes it's so surprise but don't worry all over the
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:00.960]  world western leaders say the answer is cutting off more pipelines more oil more gas more natural gas
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.400]  and more solar even though solar it takes more carbon to make a windmill than it ever produces
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:11.600]  in electricity and the average idiot thinks oh an electric car is environmental it doesn't use
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:16.640]  any fossil fuel even though most of the power it gets is from coal and they're shutting those down
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:21.200]  and windmills and hydroelectric cannot supply enough for even a fraction of what we have 10
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:29.440]  can't get 10 but then hollywood says we can't have nuclear either which i have issues with
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:33.120]  because they don't run them right but that's i'll be what are we gonna do you see what's that mean
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:40.320]  mean boxed in no energy being shut down a mostly wind and solar powered us economy is a dangerous
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:45.200]  fantasy well it's not a fantasy for the globalist it's a post industrial world shutting down
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:49.920]  civilization society of depopulation but yes people that buy into it who don't know what's
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:55.680]  going on they are living in fantasy land south korea agrees to share gas with europe amid energy
[1:27:55.680 --> 1:28:00.560]  crisis oh so they're gonna sell more gas they're gonna produce more gas but here we can't even
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:05.520]  do it because vibe is putting all these regulations and rules on so you can't but don't worry venezuela
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:13.840]  and saudi arabia and russia and south korea they can all supply everybody now as america goes from
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:21.360]  being the biggest energy exporter to now the biggest energy importer again in four years
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:26.160]  trump reversed that for only the second time in u.s history and now they've done it again screwed
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:32.080]  us over because the public is economically illiterate about how things really work
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:38.640]  all right we're gonna come back with your phone calls and then i'm gonna get into the pedophile

[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:04.160]  the un estimates that over two billion people alive on earth today have cognitive disabilities
[1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:10.560]  lower IQs and so many other medical issues because of one thing iodine deficiency and most iodine
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:16.480]  that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds so it's not
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:21.600]  absorbable in the body and that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue we have the purest

[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:39.760]  stuff but there are a few things around here that come up missing sometimes and that's the
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:44.960]  little fair day cages when you leave them laying around and its survival shield x2 now this is my
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:49.840]  personal bottle that i keep right here at my desk and i was about to illustrate for you
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:58.000]  taking some but it was already was half full a few weeks ago someone has been eating my porridge
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:05.760]  someone has been taking my x2 ladies and gentlemen let me see if there's even any
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:10.560]  left in this bottle and the answer is no literally i didn't mean to do this picture
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.680]  someone has stolen directly out of my bottle and we had like 10 bottles a month ago here
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:22.720]  did we find one yet and they've all disappeared so someone is taking the x2 and i'm not mad
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:27.520]  i but i'm literally about to plug x2 and take it and my x2 bottle was over there on the other
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:32.480]  counter and it disappeared it's okay just get somebody to bring more from the from the warehouse
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:37.200]  okay and then we will lock it up i love the crew and i'm sure they didn't do it i think gremlin's
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:42.320]  come in here at night little elves come in here at night and they but but my point is you know
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:47.360]  what else comes up missing around here because i have this stuff all over the place super mill
[1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:51.680]  vitality and when i forget to take supermanual vitality in fact our head of security i was in
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:56.160]  his office the other week and i go i notice you've got super mill vitality there on your counter
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:01.920]  did you buy that well somebody gave it to me i mean have you been liking it oh yeah i've been
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:05.600]  liking it he's in really good shape and everything else that did you catch the libido and he's like
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:12.080]  yeah it's it's amazing they're great products they're available at infoworkstore.com and i was
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:16.720]  sitting here during the break i was thinking i need to take some x2 i haven't taken it about a week
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.960]  and i found my bottle over there in the other office and someone took it and i supposed to
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:27.600]  take that much in a couple weeks so i want to know what's going on my point is is that
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:33.280]  x2 is deep growth crystal iodine billions of people have cognitive disabilities looking up
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:37.440]  for iodine efficiency most iodine in the soil and the food is bound to other elements so you don't
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:42.960]  absorb it correctly or any of it it's amazing it's been sold out for months it's back in stock 25
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:48.480]  percent off you take it under the tongue i like to just put it in water and drink it that way and
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:54.080]  and when you take the x2 bring it to me oh you found something thank you so much sir when you
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:59.760]  take the x2 i'm just going to be completely point blank with you it was doctor group 10 years ago
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:04.000]  told me alex most people are iodide deficient and i said what do you think the story is no that's
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.760]  toxic he goes he he he developed some that was extracted out of seaweed that was x1 it was still
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:13.920]  really good but not deep growth crystal then we lost that source because of who i was so he got it
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:18.320]  from an oil and gas drilling company you have to have a da license to have it it's a controlled
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:24.880]  substance before it's put into the palm oil and he said waiting about two weeks you'll go through
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:29.120]  the detox it feel bad for about a week and then you'll just feel incredible after those sunspots
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:33.840]  you have will go away you're going to notice a lot more let's just be technical it's not it's not
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:38.400]  funny you will notice a larger morning erection probably like when you were a teenager and i'm
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:45.120]  like sure right he goes listen to me he goes take it promote it sell it so i private labeled his brand
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:50.960]  then and ladies and gentlemen two weeks later felt sick for a couple days after that i like it when
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:55.120]  i'm carrying my children up a hill and act on your shoulders and when you take them off you feel
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:59.760]  like you're flying because the 50 60 pounds whatever it is is off your shoulders it's the same thing
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:06.160]  when i forget to take x2 it's just such a game changer and and and yes when i remember to to
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:13.840]  take x2 at least a couple times a week i have libido like when i was 18 years old and that's not
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:20.640]  what it's even sold for that's an example of what it does so listen just like i don't steer you wrong
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:25.760]  on politics or geopolitical systems of the world or two years ago hey better buy storeable food
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:29.040]  food prices are going to explode there's going to be shortages now it's happening this is all
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:36.640]  very simple stuff it's science it's economy this x2 is so incredibly important and i finally
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:41.040]  started setting an alarm on my phone every two days that goes off to remind me to take it because
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:46.720]  when i do i lose weight i'm healthy and again my libido is absolutely incredible i mean i don't
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:52.800]  want to get technical here but let's just say this it's like i'm 18 but better and where was
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:59.120]  iodine of this quality my whole life the answer is they put bromine and bromide and chlorine
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:04.000]  and everything and fluoride the opposite of it to block those natural activities this stuff is

[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.000]  minutes starting when we come back in a few minutes i still got more time before we go to
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  break i want to go ahead and hit this story and then we will go to break we'll come back this group
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:14.320]  of stories we will come back with your phone calls on the other side directly look at this headline
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:19.680]  in fact get the clip ready please biden just made a comment about parental rights that's even worse
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:23.840]  than the previous comments we've seen we also have the msnbc clip
[1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:33.840]  we're one of their hosts years ago comes out and says that your children belong to us melissa
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:39.040]  harris perry we have to break through this idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:42.640]  to their families we're going to play her clip first then we're going to play biden's clip from
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:49.680]  yesterday evening and then we're going uh to hit this other article look at this article
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:54.480]  out of red state and this i follow the links it's true we already know this is going on
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:58.480]  the department of education is coordinating with 20 plus democrat control legislatures
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:06.400]  to begin sexualization of children at age five on a quote pleasure based sexual relation model
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:13.360]  designed to end the family so people don't ever make lasting bonds and instead never form families
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:20.400]  so whether it's homosexual or heterosexual i am telling you this is pedophilia and you see it
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:24.160]  everywhere and it's all out in the open again we trailblazed exposing that it sounded crazy
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.920]  that's why they were so pissed at us because they knew their plan was about to roll out we had their
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.720]  documents they didn't want people to be pre-warned to be ready for it when it came out democrat
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:38.720]  legislatures want children taught sex specifically pleasure based sexual relations we'll get to that
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:44.400]  when we come back in your calls but right now let's go to msnbc saying your children belong to them
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:50.240]  we have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:56.080]  of a private notion of children your kid is yours and totally your responsibility we haven't had a
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:00.560]  very collective notion of these are our children so part of it is we have to break through our
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:04.960]  kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:09.520]  recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's responsibility and not
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:14.640]  just the households then we start making better investments and you've heard me say it many times
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:21.680]  about our children but it's true they're all our children and the the reason you're the teachers
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:26.240]  of the years because you recognize that they're not somebody else's children they're like yours
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:31.440]  when they're in the classroom what a creepy bastard we'll go to break and come back with
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:36.480]  your phone calls and you know i made the joke about stealing strawberries and cherries actually i
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:39.920]  bought a bag of strawberries and cherries or boxes strawberries and cherries i guess i didn't
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:43.680]  technically they even at central margar where we went have a little table when you first come in
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:48.000]  for free stuff for the kids so we both got free apples but i guess it was only for kids so i did
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:52.400]  technically steal an apple okay my mind worked through like you didn't actually steal that you
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:56.560]  bought those well it didn't matter i did steal an apple so i'm correct now we're right back
[1:42:56.560 --> 1:43:03.760]  you know it's a fact and i'm not bragging when i say it it's just true that info wars is seen
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:12.400]  by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:19.680]  their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now hitting the most
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:25.920]  important aspects of what we've ever done so i'm asking listeners now to realize we've got

[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:03.040]  mike in california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:08.800]  of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s. government gain
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:14.800]  of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:20.240]  involving influenza mers and stars viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses and it's a
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:25.040]  research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:29.520]  intersection there's the stops on you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:34.480]  also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:40.000]  this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know rand and others you know
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:43.760]  maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.360]  you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:52.400]  literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:56.560]  it's still a gain of function you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:01.040]  people thank you mike we love you we have over a hundred designs of t-shirts that just sit there
[1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:06.080]  in our warehouse we just sell those shirts to fund the operation but we'd already made some orders
[1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:10.080]  on future shirts coming in but these are all limited editions so once these new shirts come in
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:14.560]  we're going to sell those and that's it we'll have limited editions one at a time in the future
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:19.920]  and when they're gone they're gone well here's the new limited edition shirt this one is 2495

[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:15.120]  and it's just a crescendo like like angels playing and you hear all these banjos and fiddles
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:20.800]  with guitars all at the same time and then it just raises to a crescendo like at the end of free birth

[1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:47.760]  well i love the product anyway i just want to you know maybe let some of the new listeners know
[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:52.720]  that there are a lot of ways that we can you know push back against this on a peaceful manner
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:58.240]  and the only way i can really describe this is like basically what i have done with the
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:03.680]  assistance of some friends and some groups is that we basically get into the ears of some of our
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:09.440]  local state legislatures and get them information whether it's pulled from your website
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:15.920]  or it's pulled from other great websites and just lay out the facts and it's been proven worthy uh
[1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:22.160]  we've uh basically if we can influence the right people but uh for example you saw the governor
[1:53:22.160 --> 1:53:27.360]  of alaska a few weeks ago he's thinking about drilling in on elastic state lands because of the
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:32.160]  federal ban and so just those little things just reaching out to people even waking up people you
[1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:36.960]  don't know who like who else other people knows they might pass that information to us absolutely
[1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:42.160]  i can tell you we've seen the studies the caribou sleep up against the pipelines uh the humans built
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:47.840]  settlements and grow trees it's nothing but frozen tundra out there uh and oil and gas is
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:53.600]  extremely clean process now other than some fracking in in some water tables that isn't good
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:58.000]  so the oil company doesn't do a good job they can't cause some problems but we should absolutely
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.040]  be exploring alaska and trump opened it up and biden killed it just like he killed the keystone
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:07.520]  pipeline and so much more and that's why we're going bankrupt uh and so we've got to get in there
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:12.480]  and as you know you live up there but i've looked at the topographical maps i mean what like 95
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:18.240]  percent of alaska's not even sparsely populated it's totally empty so the idea that doing some
[1:54:18.240 --> 1:54:24.640]  limited oil drilling and gas drilling is bad is just preposterous well alaska has some of the
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:31.360]  cleanest drilling of laws on the books and the uh we have there's several pipelines only being used
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:35.760]  at something like 30 to 50 so we definitely have the capability to get it to ships and get it to
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:41.120]  the lower 48 but exactly but the caribou and everybody as you know like cover and there's no
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.440]  cover out there and now we know that their population's gone up in certain areas just
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:49.120]  because the pipelines were built that are now being shut off because they sleep up against
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:55.200]  them it gives them cover i mean it's it's like sinking an old battleship uh in the caribbean
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:55:00.160]  you'd say oh that's gonna hurt things no it creates a giant reef human development is good
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:07.280]  when it's done right we need to develop this country i completely agree and i will uh
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:12.800]  support any effort to help develop and help everybody else out this is all about helping
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:18.320]  out our citizens helping out everybody and alex thank you for having me on god bless you pray
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:24.000]  for you every day and i'll wish you the best and i'm going to continue to pray for you as you are
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:31.120]  under tremendous attack and i i pray for you alex i need the prayer marshal that i am under massive
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:35.280]  attack but i know anytime i feel sorry for myself that that means we're all under attack and i asked
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:39.840]  for this and i stepped up to the plate and you've stepped to the plate and all i ask is you stay with
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:45.280]  me and you realize how serious these times are for all of us when you look at jones and you see i'm
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:50.720]  under attack you're under attack they're coming after all of us and you're not next they're already
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:57.280]  attacking you thank you sir let's talk to daniel in north carol cattle north carolina sorry my eyes
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:03.440]  are going out daily north carolina go ahead hey i like uh how you doing today man it's i'm good
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:09.760]  talking to you brother love you what's up oh well good i think i have a few ideas here um assuming
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:18.400]  we can stop the nwo takeover technocratic police state um we're still looking at a population drop
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:26.480]  off at this mrna is like all the other ones uh somewhere between 80 to 100 possibly fatalities
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:33.600]  so what i'm thinking is we got to get the wildlife to bounce back and get nature itself back on
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:38.800]  course a little bit maybe planting fruit bearing trees and shrubs wildly and of course people
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:45.040]  plant their own produce locally oh yeah we just use rooftops and like in germany grow food in the
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:52.240]  medians the highways we'll have so much look we the government pays farmers not to plant the the
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:57.120]  united states can supply the whole world of food brother the idea that we've reached our carrying
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:03.920]  capacity is a lie and i'm i'm also suggesting that we start eating gators and sharks and uh
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:10.800]  large aquatic predators uh to get those populations to bounce back as well desalination even people
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:15.520]  running their own personal stills but large town stills near the coast and lakes and whatnot
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:19.440]  it'd be something we could run on bonfires if there's no doubt there's been some overfishing
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:24.480]  and things like that uh but uh you know it's like biden said there's no more trees we have more
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:29.600]  trees than when white man arrived 400 years ago in the united states i mean there's more trees now
[1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:34.160]  we planted more trees there's more trees than ever been all right we'll be right back ladies and

[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:35.600]  owners they own you they own everything all the important land they own and control the corporations
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:39.040]  they've long since bought and paid for senate the congress the state houses and city halls they
[2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:43.760]  got the judges in their back pockets and they own a big media company so they control just about all
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:52.320]  the news and information you get to hear they got you by the balls they want obedient workers obedient
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:56.960]  workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:02.240]  enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:06.800]  overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:12.240]  coming for your social security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:20.720]  it's a big club and you ain't in it and you said recently quote when you give they do whatever the
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:26.720]  hell you want them to do you better believe it so what specifically did they do if i ask them if i
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:31.280]  need them you know most of the people on this stage i've given to just so you understand a lot of
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:38.240]  money you and i are not in the big club the owners of this country know the truth it's called the
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:44.720]  american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it but i'll tell you what they don't want
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:49.680]  they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they don't want well informed
[2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:54.160]  well educated people capable of critical thinking they're not interested in that that doesn't help
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:02:01.920]  them that's against their interest that's right from the front lines of the information war it's alex
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:23.440]  jones we are drugged out we are following other people's opinions we are controlled by the media
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:30.960]  today it all changes this reality has been forced upon us it is a choice just like when i said slavery
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:36.400]  is a choice istein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:41.280]  so we keep on saying i hate you i hate you you you you how are we gonna get a different result out
[2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:49.280]  of hate why don't we just try love why don't we just try love we have the resources for a peaceful
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:55.920]  world you know sometimes you need some crazy mother to change something steve jobs is crazy now we
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:02.400]  all see jobs phones they say trucks crazy they say i'm crazy but i'm here to show love it's a bigger

[2:03:11.520 --> 2:03:23.200]  alex jones i want them shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think they are horrible
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:29.360]  for our society spanning people they're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:38.480]  allowed to have merely i'm a conservative jew so i guess that makes me such a dangerous person
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.960]  spreading articles spreading videos spreading links you're gonna get demonized you're gonna get
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:52.240]  attacked three that's going to do something terrible like help trump get reelected that's
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:04:07.200]  really what all this is about is the right to be due and say whatever you want it's about freedom
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:14.000]  of expression on the journalists and the left not interested in telling the truth about me because
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:20.640]  i don't fit the stereotype they can say whatever they think and i respect their constitution right
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:31.600]  to do it and i hope they respect my country

[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:38.880]  children because only then will we roll over and then accept two plus two equals a hundred only
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:44.160]  then will we accept all the lies they're trying to push on us and the unnatural world these evil
[2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:49.600]  people are trying to build we'll go right back to your phone calls but i mentioned this yesterday
[2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:57.920]  but i wanted to cover it today this is a megan fox and this is her talking about her and her
[2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:04.720]  boyfriend and how they drink each other's blood and then she makes a big joke out of it but but
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:11.520]  that's what angelina joe lee does a bunch of them do it on record it's standard operating procedure
[2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:17.600]  you know i was hanging out with joe rogan last night for a couple hours and he asked me he said
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:22.000]  how did you know about jeffrey epstein 15 plus years ago and tell me about it he said how did
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:28.800]  you know that i said uh ted gonderson was tapped to be the fbi director but he was old school so
[2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:34.560]  he didn't get it but he was the head of the fbi at memfos and the head in la and here is and he
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:39.680]  did some things that were bad he ran the coantel pro program against uh black folks and he later
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:43.680]  apologized to that on the air before he died but he thought they were calm as he thought it was the
[2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:48.160]  right thing to do but later he saw that he was wrong marlos or king and the black panthers
[2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:55.040]  and others he targeted but he was the real deal and you know i knew he was real and i got a chance
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:00.960]  to interview him probably 60s times 70 times had a chance to have dinner with him probably 10 times
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:06.400]  he would come and give speeches in austin and he took time out to really try to educate me and would
[2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:11.280]  call me on the phone ask i was doing and tell me he appreciated me you know charleston heston did
[2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:18.800]  that when i was uh i mean we're talking like in 1999 98 i mean i would just hey it's charleston
[2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:22.640]  heston is chuck here please give me a call he's like how are you doing you're really doing but
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:27.440]  he wasn't just doing that to me he was doing hundreds of interviews a month on talk radio
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:31.680]  he was flying all around in his own jet with his own money pissing his liberal wife off
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:37.760]  um educate people about the second amendment in america he really loved it and i would have
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:43.200]  like 15 minute conversations only it probably happened five six times with charleston heston
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:48.720]  and the first time i interviewed him i interviewed him twice he said hey feel free to call me if
[2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:53.360]  you ever want to talk or you know talk about strategy so i didn't call didn't call next time
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:58.800]  i had him on he said hey you never called so i i called once didn't answer called again didn't
[2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:06.640]  answer you know week let called again hello this is uh chuck i'm like i'm mr heston uh
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:10.160]  because you know i wouldn't care about some modern holiday person but he was a christian a patriot
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:14.880]  i mean hell ten commandments you name it ben her i mean my god i grew up on that and i'm like uh
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:22.640]  he was just he was like these incredible speeches but very calm like america is in
[2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:26.080]  trouble and we've got important work to do and it's going to be young men like you they're
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:30.640]  going to help lead the future after people like me are gone alex and you've got a particular
[2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:35.440]  gift for what you do and i just you know i'm sitting there and it was general parton and
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:43.360]  to have even had more conversations with him than um than gunderson and only a few with heston
[2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:52.240]  five or six but but the point was is these guys were the real deal and john wane i never
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:56.640]  got to talk to john wane or anybody met his son but but the point was is that john wane did the same
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:03.440]  stuff john wane tirelessly ran around defending america tirelessly encouraging the troops and
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:08.720]  common people that's real leadership folks and not when the cameras are on everybody was around
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:14.400]  they really understood leadership so i'm sitting there with joe rogan last night and there's all
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:18.240]  he's got his friends there and he's saying i said joe please stop he went over like 20 minutes
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:24.480]  like alex said this and i was that how i'm like joe please i said i said i know about this from
[2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:32.960]  ted gondeson in general part i mean that's how i know all this stuff and then i said charleston
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:37.680]  heston and people are looking at me like charleston heston i mean it just gets weirder and weirder
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:41.680]  and weirder but truth is strange the fiction and that's what i'm saying to everybody is
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:46.240]  you're just as important as i am matt rudge always said that that a person with a blog or a
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:50.000]  website just as important as the new york times you're a person you're observing you're reporting
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:55.440]  what you're seeing doesn't mean you're perfect and so i'm giving credit to charleston heston
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:11:00.000]  and by the way i know that ted gonderson's son reached out like a year ago and we never got him
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:07.600]  on i want ted gonderson's son on they only talked about the phone like one time 20 something years
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:14.000]  ago i want ted gonderson's son on i want to fly him here because every day i think about ted
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.760]  gonderson every day i think about bitten part every day i think about charleston heston
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:24.400]  trailblazers every day i think about berry goldwater every day i think about congressman
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:31.280]  hanson every day i think about the john birch society and the people that were dead on that
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:35.600]  nobody was basically listening to and that they were demon i mean ronald reagan woke up by these
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:43.200]  folks i mean he was perfect but he was woken up by heston goldwater he wrote that he said that he
[2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:47.200]  gave speeches you know they're highly suppressed we should go find those speeches i've seen him
[2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:53.680]  and then play the reagan speeches when he was running for office in 79 80 because you listen
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:59.120]  to it it sounds like alex jones just a lot smoother but that's what america was facing they knew
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:07.280]  this stuff when i was six seven eight nine years old we're gonna go to your calls i want you to know
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:14.880]  know this is the first rodeo and we wouldn't even be where we are today without these men and women
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:24.240]  and like char charlotte israeli and anthony sutton and just so many other amazing people
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:33.200]  phyllis schlafly these were good hard working americans salt of the earth classy good people
[2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:37.200]  it was the fbi today was like ted gunner said i talked to him about january six in a minute
[2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:41.120]  they weren't perfect but they were really on average trying to do good they got misguided
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:47.680]  sometimes but they were good people today ladies and gentlemen it's run by people like robert
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:52.960]  moeller who cut his teeth with whitey bulger running murder operations and drug operations
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:13:00.720]  in the east coast and that's when things really started getting bad was in the 70s 80s and 90s
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:07.840]  when the fbi got infiltrated by the mafia and basically became the mafia and that's where we are
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:17.120]  today so and i'm sitting there talking to joe and all these great people and it's like i'm
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:28.000]  speaking in chinese or martian ted gunnerson general parton ron paul came out of those guys
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:34.320]  i'm gonna go to break ticket calls i promise i'm sorry i'm just ranting here but but just imagine
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:38.880]  gunnerson saying they run child kidnapping rings the black mother by and take kids to private
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:45.600]  islands and jeffrey epsi and all this stuff and we're talking like 20 years ago so that's how i knew
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:53.520]  all this because the very heart of america what we used to be hardcore dedicated men and women
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:58.000]  that would tell the truth no matter what that did their research and were tireless that's
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:04.880]  what info wars was built on and i'm just blown away that they're discernment that they spent
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:11.840]  so much time believing in me and i believe in you so that's why when you call in and thank me
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:17.120]  we're all in this together folks i love you i appreciate you what do you expect me not to
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:23.920]  fight these people it's a default don't thank me just help me fight here is uh meghan fox
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:30.000]  just sitting around how wonderful blood is now she drinks it with her boyfriend here it is
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:36.800]  i guess to drink each other's blood might mislead people are like people are imagining us with
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:41.680]  like goblets and we're like game of thrones drinking each other's blood it's just a few drops
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:49.440]  but yes we do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes only it is used
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:55.360]  for a reason and it is controlled where it's like let's shed a few drops of blood and each drink it
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:15:00.560]  he's much more haphazard and hectic and chaotic where he's willing to just like cut his chest open
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:08.000]  with broken glass and be like take my soul let me bleed on you it doesn't not happen let me tell
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:13.760]  you maybe not exactly like that but it a version of that has happened and many times
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.800]  so an empty but beautiful woman introducing everybody to vampirism young girls are watching
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:27.600]  this and this is like a worm on a hook dropped into the water here's a beautiful radiant woman
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:34.480]  all lit up perfectly sticking your breasts out like so that men and women and young girls think
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:40.480]  that's what beauty is is bleeding and cutting and harming yourself vampirism and then we got this
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:45.760]  hitting a new low Ukrainian man post video boasting of eating Russian soldiers flesh
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:51.520]  on camera as a vampire that's on info wars dot com that's what we're fighting folks we'll be back

[2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:26.240]  half the battle all right we're gonna go to your phone calls right now those of you that
[2:20:26.240 --> 2:20:34.720]  have been patiently holding let's talk to jeremy and then don and others jeremy in nevada you're
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:41.360]  on the air my friend thank you alex yeah i've been a long time listener first time caller
[2:20:41.360 --> 2:20:47.120]  and i'm a bartender down here in las vegas so i promote your show and your products constantly
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:53.200]  all the time thank you it's a pleasant surprise that i find there's a lot more people like ourselves
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:58.880]  that you know are waking up to what's going on but at the same time i'm telling people all time
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:04.560]  out there at the bar that you know when it boils down to this election you know i've been telling
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:11.040]  people be wary they've got to do something to you know make it to where they cheat again for
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:14.880]  election fraud so on and so forth and so i've been telling people that i think that there's
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:18.880]  going to be some sort of new virus because a lot of people aren't believing in corona now and all
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:24.480]  the rest of the stuff oh yeah yeah they already punched us with a straight right and now they're
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:31.040]  about to hit us with a left hook and so i just saw an article yesterday talking about how out of
[2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:38.000]  china there's a new avian flu that was just confirmed with a case but saying that oh it's
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:44.240]  relatively impossible for you know it to spread to humans but it sounds oddly familiar to what
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:50.000]  they did with corona and it's coming out right at the right time so it's totally pre-programmed and
[2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:53.280]  if they think they can get away with it they're going to drop the hammer on us brother what do
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:59.600]  you think we should do i honestly have been trying to tell people that uh you know if you're not
[2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:04.880]  taking some of your stuff and some other supplements to keep your immune systems high i mean you're
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:11.600]  running a risk make sure you stay away from the dang vaccines and you know eat healthy i mean the
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:16.320]  biggest thing is is if we keep our immune systems up they can target us all day long but as long as
[2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:21.040]  we ain't taking their poison shots and you know all that other stuff and stop wearing the dang mask
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:27.600]  i think that's what we need to be aware of and and not not do the voting like that i've literally
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:33.440]  if they start trying to get us to do the in for the mail voting stuff no we need to stand against
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:39.840]  that i agree sir thank you so much for calling let's go to caller in idaho let's talk to don
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:48.640]  in idaho hey alex thanks for the reminder uh for the dragon juice i just had some after you
[2:22:48.640 --> 2:22:54.240]  initially uh talk about the x2 but uh man i think we're living through a script this is just
[2:22:54.960 --> 2:23:01.920]  insane everything that's going on uh from the gen to 21 to uh what's going on over in ukraine
[2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:08.320]  there's a great article on the ran dot org called overextending and unbalancing russia
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:13.200]  uh i think it was right they published it years ago the whole rain corporation plan
[2:23:13.200 --> 2:23:15.680]  which they're carrying out there tell people more about that document
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:21.280]  yeah well it just goes through all the different ways that they can overextend russia
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:27.120]  you know and the probability of success in all these different categories it's a it's a great
[2:23:27.120 --> 2:23:32.560]  article they got all kinds of charts on here uh goes from life i've scanned the document years
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:36.480]  ago then looked at it again last month get people the name again so we can put it on screen for tv
[2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:44.480]  viewers yeah it's uh overextending and unbalancing russia overextending and unbalancing russia ran
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:50.960]  there it is on screen yeah yeah it's a really good read i highly suggest it because you know
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:54.800]  we're just living through that now you can see all the tactics that are laying and that's it
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:23:59.600]  they're scripting a doomsday into the world it's human's fault global warming lie when they're
[2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:04.480]  the ones collapsing civilization and intend to maintain control and build city states everything
[2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:09.600]  else will be collapsed and feudalism that is the plan and we know their plan it should be easy to
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:16.320]  stop folks that's right and i just wanted to say a couple quick things uh been a listener since about
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:22.160]  07 i heard you on uh alan watt got rid of the old cutting through the matrix hose yeah he was a
[2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:30.320]  great guy amazing yeah and then uh i remember years ago g edward griffin said uh talking to you uh
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:35.600]  uh he's i forget he was talking about his uh freedom force international thing that he had
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:40.880]  started years ago but he said we can't basically said we can't do anything uh without positions
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:46.480]  of power and influence and you know we're just we're just on our heels constantly right we're
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:51.120]  you know i don't see too many pictures and let me pause you in a rub because if i try to name
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:55.840]  all the great people i can't but jibber griffin has been around since the 60s he was extremely
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:25:02.000]  successful corporate executive learned about all this heard of john burt society record didn't
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  believe it went to disprove it found that it was true and just did so much of the work today
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.480]  jibber griffin is a living legend i want him on the show immediately because i want to honor
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:18.080]  these people and he is still alive and still healthy what an incredible individual in fact i
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:24.560]  salute jibber griffin i salute him as as as as good as it gets probably the greatest living
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:31.920]  american right now we salute you jibber griffin what a dynamo dozens of huge films that millions
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:37.360]  watched first huge documentaries in the 60s and 70s i mean he literally launched so much of the
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:43.840]  resistance now how did i not think of him my god another one of my mentors yeah he's amazing amazing
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:49.200]  man and uh just want to finish by saying you know we're we're ruled by irresponsible children that
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:54.480]  can't be accountable for their actions and every day it seems i learned they're more evil than the day
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.720]  before that's all i hate to travel and jibber griffin invited me to so many of his events
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:03.040]  i never went to him but uh god i should have absolutely what else is on your mind they're
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:09.120]  done uh that's about it just every day i learned they're more evil than the day before so we just
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:14.880]  gotta we just gotta keep fighting keep yourself healthy and educate yourself that's right they
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:19.920]  have no bottom and it's our acquiescence that allows them to do it thank you again i'm just
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:23.520]  thinking about all the persecution i've been through it it's a blessing because i get to know
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:29.760]  gee ebber griffin and general parton and ted gunterson and then now i get to influence tucker
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:37.440]  carlson and joe rogan and victor orbon and uh balson arrow and it's not bragging it's true it's
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:43.440]  it's like how literally and i appreciate your call i'd be at dinner with general parton or
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:49.360]  or ted gunterson and they just give him a speech and i'd be at table with about 10 people
[2:26:51.840 --> 2:26:55.040]  and they'd be like i want to talk to you for a minute or you walk over the car with me and he was
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:00.320]  like both of them did stuff like this that grab you listen this is really serious you gotta get
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:04.000]  really serious and be focused understand what we're on target here and we're not going to be around
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.360]  forever this thing's probably gonna hit in the next 20 30 years we need you to get in position
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:10.640]  and warn as many people as possible you understand you're sitting there these people these people are
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:17.440]  not and it's like they transmute something to you they like my uncle did it too who was an iran
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.200]  contra and a bunch of other stuff he did the same thing when i was a teenager he was grabbing by the
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:26.720]  arm i said listen this is really real you need to do something about it and i guess that's a normal
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:32.400]  thing for men to tell younger men about what the threat is to charge them up but that's
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:37.520]  what's been missing in the leadership because the average father is playing golf or you know
[2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:41.920]  are going to football with the kids or whatever but they don't give them a mission and i'll be honest
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:47.520]  i didn't spend enough time with my children i got four children most of them are growing up now
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:53.360]  and they're great children but they just i was a bad father in many ways and i repent of that
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:28:02.400]  but it's just that and my my own father instilled in me leadership and taking action
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:08.800]  and it's just incredible i mean we have to do that now folks that's what this is all about
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:16.640]  and there's just some spiritual thing about leaders getting ahold of young people and saying
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:21.760]  listen to me this is what's happening you need to choose this mission you use an analogy because
[2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:26.400]  that everybody knows this archetypally it's dead now it's like Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:32.880]  and he says a little talk with it he says you must go with me to Alderaan and he says i
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:37.760]  i gotta go grow the crops we done that i got i you know i can go to the academy next year
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:43.120]  and he goes listen the fight's now of course by the time Luke Skywalker gets home his family's
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:50.400]  all been killed now he knows Obi-Wan Kenobi was right this is reality this is the war
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:29:00.560]  this is the future this is our victory you see this it's an info wars republic defense card

[2:33:37.840 --> 2:33:39.680]  never got him on the show but he was a listener
[2:33:41.520 --> 2:33:44.960]  talk to him and a song about kim trails and died
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:48.720]  and that's the guy you're listening to
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:53.600]  you're a hanger right now it's about knowing how many good people are on the team
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:34:00.560]  let's hear a little bit from this patriot we got all the good people folks
[2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:09.520]  if you don't love it leave it let this song i'm singing be a warning to you you're running down
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:15.120]  my country and you're walking on yeah you're walking on the fighting side of me
[2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:20.960]  me yeah some squirrely guy don't believe in fighting
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:31.200]  i read about some squirrely guy who claims he just don't believe in fighting
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:40.080]  and i wonder just how long the rest of us can count on being free they love our milking honey
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:46.560]  but they preach about some other way but living
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:54.560]  and they're running down my country horse they're walking on the fighting side of me yeah
[2:34:55.840 --> 2:35:02.800]  they're walking on the fighting side of me running down a way alive running down a way
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:08.240]  alive by fighting in the fighting side of me all right let me go back to your phone calls but
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:15.440]  i wanted to say one thing here i was thinking about how i had the most incredible mentors as i've
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:21.280]  grown older it was just incredible both my grandfathers my grandmothers my mother my father all
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:26.320]  these incredible people i felt pushed to fight the new world order and suddenly was just in this
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:32.080]  world of these incredible people who everything they said has come true and imagine the opposite of
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:38.240]  that our little four and five and six year old children in private and public schools everywhere
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:44.480]  being taught how to have animal sex being taught how to give blowjobs i don't mean to be gross here
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:50.240]  it's what's going on it's in the news they are doing it imagine they didn't get the leadership i got
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:58.000]  they got the leadership of pedophilia imagine what those children are going to be like
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:07.280]  like everything i am is because the people around me instilled their energy into me they
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:12.720]  put their energy on me haul a ritual call what you want they injected their spirit into me
[2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:19.920]  of resistance and discernment and will they were giving me their power to resist to the
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:28.080]  future because they knew the fight was coming and they're with me now and i look at these
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:34.240]  pedophiles and these satanist and what they're doing and i just tell you now we will defeat them
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:42.400]  we will stop them because it's our destiny and if we don't do it god will damn us to an eternity
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:52.000]  be cut off
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:37:01.200]  the crimes they're committing against children oh my god
[2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:07.360]  and the left just loves it they think it's so fun and they're part of the power structure
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:13.840]  they throw the winning team i will assure you you are not on the winning team and you will pay
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:21.120]  for what you've done you will be broken but i take no pleasure in that i want you off our children
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:30.480]  i want you to back off but you won't back off you won't back off until we make you back off
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:42.720]  for every action is newtonian physics and as the unified field theory of max plank
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:51.360]  and alberdijkstein proves is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and we
[2:37:51.360 --> 2:38:01.920]  are that reaction we are the counter to the evil we are that light in the dark of the night
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:09.600]  god works for us to save the children you ask where are you god god asks where are you you've
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:18.880]  been given all the tools and all the will to easily easily defeat these people and you
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:26.560]  you didn't do it you didn't stand up you didn't fight back you didn't resist
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:37.120]  so while they abuse and rape and murder our children god's children understand that it's on us
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:45.600]  and if we don't start saving these children and if we don't start standing up god's gonna hurt us
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:39:00.400]  real bad you know what we deserve it so you've been warned you've been warned right now all
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:06.720]  you preachers all you politicians and all you bankers and all you big people that get ahead

[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:18.400]  a thousand times until the judgment comes and when it comes it comes hard
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:24.400]  i have i'm i'm gonna tell you we're not just gonna have food collapse around nuclear war
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:34.480]  very soon i have seen it so this is everybody's last warning right now if you don't pray to god
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:39.120]  and repent and if you don't speak out and if you don't take peaceful loving action
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:46.000]  and god is going to end that abortion one way or another and god's going to end that
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.120]  pedophilia one way or another just like Noah's flood but this time fire

[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:16.960]  that's what man dot video is about cnn's all over darcy for i got banned on twitter finally
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:21.040]  three and a half years ago he goes what platforms you aren't oh only twitter i'll get you banned
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:26.640]  today because he thinks well i'm a weakling i'm a scumbag i mean he is a piece of trash i don't
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:32.400]  say that with pleasure i mean he's the enemy and he's just like i will silence you that's how i went

[2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:48.800]  i don't take pleasure in that because the new world order is like a dying giant squid
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:54.800]  just wants to grab us with its tentacles and pull us into hell so don't take their weakness
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:50:00.560]  as weakness take it as a sign of their commitment they are weapons formed against us
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:08.640]  they are overtaken individuals that are slaves so don't laugh at how stupid they are don't laugh
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:14.480]  at how they jibber and giggle and act like gremlins realize that's an overtaken person
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:21.280]  and it's our failure that allowed that to happen i'm the guiltiest of celebrating how ridiculous
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:27.440]  they are that's actually their power to go against their own free will to go against their own
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:30.800]  interest to go against their own families to go against their own future
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:37.040]  that's not that's not something to joke about that's death
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:47.200]  anna in the great state of texas anna thank you so much for calling welcome hey welcome

[2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:23.040]  office over five years you think he would look better but he doesn't he looks worse and the
[2:51:23.040 --> 2:51:30.000]  other thing i wanted to say about prerog agrawal the twitter you know ceo he comes over here on

[3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:15.760]  the book on doxing and harassment false reports and media control they're trying to confirm her to
[3:00:15.760 --> 3:00:23.040]  head up the 11th circuit court of appeals right now and senator joss holly yesterday brought
[3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:28.000]  these points up to her there's a big article on info wars dot com it's got a bunch of clubs but
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:33.360]  here's one of those clubs right now let me let me ask you let me ask you about the southern
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:41.520]  poverty law center more generally what year did you splc february 2021 or i'm sorry 2019 2019
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:48.720]  2019 was the year that the splc paid 3.4 million dollars in response to defamation lawsuits 2019
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:55.440]  was the year that charity watch gave your organization an f rating the splc has been labeled
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:01:00.880]  by the left wing policy journal current affairs as an outright fraud that uses willful deception
[3:01:00.880 --> 3:01:06.880]  designed to scare liberals into writing checks the progressive journalist alexander cockburn
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:12.640]  said this about splc i regard it the southern poverty law center collectively as one of the
[3:01:12.640 --> 3:01:18.000]  greatest frauds in american life liberal death penalty abolitionist steven bright refused to
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:23.680]  accept an award named after the founder of the splc saying in his words the splc has long been run
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:32.160]  by a con man and a fraud that's from a harpers magazine article also in 2019 splc employees
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:37.120]  told the press we were part of a con and we knew it that's in a new yorker article not exactly a
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:44.640]  right wing journal are you concerned by any of this record of the organization that you work for
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:50.320]  senator what i'm glad that i didn't hear in that litany is a complaint about the voting rights
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:55.120]  work that we've done about the clients in the community are you concerned that charity watch
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:02:00.560]  gave you an f that you had to pay 3.4 million dollars in response to defamation lawsuits that
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:04.560]  you've been criticized like your organization has been criticized as a fraud and a con job
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:10.080]  and that you work for an organization who says it's their goal in life to completely destroy
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:16.320]  their opponents none of that gives you any pause senator again my work with the southern poverty
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:22.800]  law center has been to uphold the constitutional rights of individuals who without pro bono council
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:29.840]  would not be even able to have access to justice i have to tell you i find your answers absolutely
[3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:34.640]  extraordinary absolutely extraordinary i can't believe you've been nominated for this position
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:39.360]  i can't believe that the president of the united states would nominate someone from this organization
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:45.200]  with this record and i can't believe that you would sit here today and refuse to condemn this
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:50.320]  hateful frankly violent rhetoric from this organization with this record it's astounding
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:59.440]  to me well it is astounding they're putting the literal communist aggressive murderous

[3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:27.200]  to her joseph watson
[3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:33.600]  you're live it is the summit news hour and we're tracking the very latest development with Elon
[3:06:33.600 --> 3:06:40.160]  mosk's takeover of twitter big changes happening to twitter over the past few days despite the fact
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:46.240]  as we know the actual takeover itself is not yet completed they're still desperately trying to block
[3:06:46.240 --> 3:06:51.680]  it and failing but Elon mosk's takeover of twitter will take three to six months but we're already
[3:06:51.680 --> 3:06:59.520]  seeing massive changes on the twitter itself the blackpilled nihilists who suggested that nothing
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:05.360]  would change have been proven wrong already again despite the fact as i just explained that the
[3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:11.440]  takeover isn't going to actually go through and be rubber stamped for three to six months i've
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:18.800]  personally received about 22 000 new followers on twitter over the past few days that on a platform
[3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:23.840]  that's basically been for anyone on the right conservatives completely stagnant for a number
[3:07:23.840 --> 3:07:31.200]  of years now and is that because they've reduced or they've lifted the suppression algorithm algorithms
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:38.080]  are they digitally burning documents as people have speculated we had this article a couple of
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:43.440]  days ago twitter goes on internal lockdown to prevent woke employees taking revenge for
[3:07:43.440 --> 3:07:49.600]  Elon musk takeover twitter has gone on internal lockdown in order to prevent woke employees
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:55.760]  from taking revenge in response to musk's takeover of the company now of course this was
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:08:03.280]  an internal lockdown on product updates they still allow for quote business critical updates but
[3:08:03.280 --> 3:08:11.280]  they tweaked a few settings on the back end of twitter to prevent the irate woke uh hair pullers
[3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:17.360]  from again suppressing content from punishing people who are basically celebrating Elon musk
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:24.560]  takeover so they put a lockdown on that but then we had this article today with people now openly
[3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:31.280]  asking the question is twitter suppressing algorithms or is it just that there's been a
[3:08:31.280 --> 3:08:36.640]  flood of new users coming from conservatives in the right wing i wouldn't be so sure about that
[3:08:36.640 --> 3:08:42.000]  given that truth social isn't number one in the app store right now you've got a bunch of new
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:48.880]  signups on that our conservatives and right wingers really rushing back to twitter in such huge
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:56.240]  numbers over the past few days in fact ben collins reported on the day Elon musk down to his twitter
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:09:04.800]  takeover 200 000 katie perry followers deactivated 200 000 deactivated now of course a lot of the
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:10.080]  a lot of the katie perry followers are just normies they're not necessarily political
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:17.200]  is that bots are they cleaning up a back end bot system that was gained to the benefit that was
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:24.160]  rigged to the benefit of leftist and to the detriment of conservatives given that as people
[3:09:24.160 --> 3:09:28.960]  like donald trump jr are reporting tens of thousands of new followers over the past few days
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:35.280]  leftist rachel maddow those kind of types are reporting losing thousands of followers in the
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:41.120]  past few days we asked the question is twitter burning the evidence by unshackling conservative
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:47.680]  accounts a lot of people are noting that their debooster their ghost ranking which you can check
[3:09:47.680 --> 3:09:54.080]  on certain websites has been lifted in the past few days since this takeover was announced but
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:09:59.120]  announced but again not completed conservative twitter users have noticed a massive uptick in
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:05.040]  followers and engagement following Elon musk's twitter buy and of course part of that is explained
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:10.080]  because it's in the news you will get a lot of sign-up simply because twitter has been the big
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:16.080]  news story now for the past week but leftists on the platform are experiencing the inverse
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:21.600]  prompting some to wonder if the company is undoing evidence that it rigged the reach of people it
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:29.920]  deemed to be undesirable now of course right up until 2018 as I said use myself as the example
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:37.360]  constant growth in twitter followers to the point where I got to about 1.2 million followers a couple
[3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:43.440]  of years ago or maybe three years ago late 2018 was when they really intensified the censorship
[3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:49.200]  and then it was completely stagnant and in fact numerous massive conservative accounts not only
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:57.360]  stopped growing but they had regular routine purges of quote bot accounts that caused conservative
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:02.320]  right-wing accounts to lose thousands of followers in a single day and that happened on numerous
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:09.440]  occasions then of course you get people reporting I followed you and now mysteriously I'm unfollowed
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:17.120]  from you but I didn't do that so was that a deliberate game a deliberate rigging system
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:22.800]  where they put that into the algorithm they unfollowed manually a bunch of people from a bunch
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:27.440]  of top conservative accounts and now they're trying to hide evidence of that because it is
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:34.080]  essentially election rigging given that they did it again in the year of a mid-term election
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:42.320]  and then intensified it right before the 2020 election are they covering their tracks well twitter
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:47.280]  well twitter said in a statement quote we've been looking into recent fluctuations in follower accounts
[3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:51.680]  while we continue to take action on accounts that violate a spam policy which can affect
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:55.920]  follow accounts these fluctuations appear to largely have been a result of an increase in
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:04.880]  new account creation and deactivation is that really the case again I got 10 000 new twitter
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:11.440]  followers yesterday are there 10 000 conservatives who have come back to the platform simply because
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:19.360]  Elon musk has announced he's taken it over again not everybody is believing that explanation
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:25.120]  then of course you have the flip side of the equation which is people being punished conservatives
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:30.720]  being punished by woke twitter employees in revenge for Elon musk's takeover we have this
[3:12:30.720 --> 3:12:37.120]  headline out of information liberation our twitter employees taking vengeance on their enemies before
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:44.400]  Elon musk eventually cleans house they know for example that gab the big competitor to twitter
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:50.160]  was unverified a couple of days ago but again that has happened to other major accounts in this
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:55.600]  article they know that the comedian the late comedian norm mcdonald who passed away about
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:13:01.840]  seven months ago lost his blue checkmark a few weeks ago isn't that nice of them the guys
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:07.680]  literally just died and they take away his blue checkmark so now everyone can pretend to be
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:16.000]  norm mcdonald's you know rip memorial account according to bloomberg news musk had to lock down
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:21.520]  twitter source code after buying the site due to fears of internal sabotage and of course we had
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:27.760]  the project veritas leaked audio of them freaking out about it we had the twitter lawyer who was
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:32.800]  instrumental in banning trump who was likely behind the banning of zero hedge when they put
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:39.040]  out information regarding the covid lab leak origin literally crying balling her eyes out in
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:47.520]  a meeting at what might happen at god forbid free speech being allowed and then of course we have
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:52.720]  other things gets into it in this article we have the washington post coming out and
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:57.840]  and saying two days into musk buying twitter he's using his megaphone to help target twitter
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:05.600]  employees prompting a barrage of attacks again only the left wing mobs can dog pile and harass
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:11.680]  people on twitter when conservatives criticize journalists that's massive harassment and abuse
[3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:17.600]  but when the left actually does docks harass and abuse people well that's just them again making
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:23.440]  people on the right take responsibility for their words bake to laska another prominent
[3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:29.120]  former twitter user who was suspended he tried to come back he was banned within 24 hours so it
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:33.120]  seems to be the case that people who are trying to get back on the platform thinking that it's
[3:14:33.120 --> 3:14:38.480]  already changed are being banned having their accounts once again suspended for ban evasion
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:45.360]  but then you have this of course elon musk many people speculate one of the primary reasons for
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:52.960]  him buying twitter was his outrage at the babel on b having their account locked for a satirical
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:59.200]  article announcing the babel on b's man of the year is rachel levine now of course what happens
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:04.320]  on twitter if you don't delete the tweets that they said have broken their policies you don't
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:09.120]  get access back to your account it's technically not banned but you don't have access to it you
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.640]  can't tweet from it well lo and behold today the babel on b's man of the year rachel levine
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:21.680]  tweet is back on twitter so somebody has gone have to go on into the back end and lift that
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:29.520]  suspension on the babel on b elon musk's best mates that tweet is now back on twitter and the
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:35.760]  babel on b presumably now have access back to their account so again there are massive changes of
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:40.960]  foot in the back end in twitter are they suppressing the algorithm are they burning
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:47.840]  digitally burning documents at least and are there changes in terms of once censored content
[3:15:47.840 --> 3:15:52.160]  and potentially once censored individuals being allowed back on the site we'll be back to talk
[3:15:52.160 --> 3:15:59.520]  about it more summit dot news don't go away so i did it i signed up for the austin marathon i've
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:04.720]  been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness

[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:52.640]  info wars on the air the globalists are hoping you don't take action take action now info wars store
[3:19:52.640 --> 3:20:14.880]  dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:26.240]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson feel alive and as i said before
[3:20:26.240 --> 3:20:32.560]  great 22 000 new twitter followers in three days posted about that about 20 minutes ago and basically
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:39.120]  all the replies below the tweet are saying i'm a new sign up or i came back to twitter as a result
[3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:44.880]  of elon musk taking over so a lot of those are likely to be new sign ups but then you have
[3:20:44.880 --> 3:20:49.760]  for example in this article which i talked about earlier from information liberation
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:56.400]  our twitter employees taking vengeance on their enemies they list the increase in followers that
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:21:04.400]  some of these top personalities have seen took a carlson 62 000 joe rogan 63 000 again that's in
[3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:12.880]  the space of two days basically donald trump juniors added 87 000 in one day said cruise 51 000
[3:21:13.760 --> 3:21:20.640]  then you have on the flip side the likes of kamala harris losing 22 000 aoc losing 27 000
[3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:27.840]  hillary clinton losing 17 000 rachel maddow losing 18 000 i don't think leftist to any great degree
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:33.200]  whatsoever or fleeing twitter it's like when they say they're going to flee the country if trump wins
[3:21:33.200 --> 3:21:39.120]  again they don't do anything they just say it to get the dopamine to get the clicks i'm leaving
[3:21:39.120 --> 3:21:44.400]  twitter and yet they don't deactivate their account they're not leaving twitter in droves they couldn't
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:49.760]  bear to do that so i reckon there's two things going on you are getting a lot of new followers
[3:21:50.400 --> 3:21:56.080]  from conservatives returning to the platform but then you're getting a genuine authentic
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:03.200]  bot purge which is an impacting these left-wing accounts that were artificially boosted in the
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:09.440]  past to have bot followers attached to them so i think if you see that trend continuing over the
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:15.200]  next few days that looks like what is going on let's go to this video now because nijal
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:21.920]  forage commented on ilan musk's takeover of twitter and this is what the former ukip leader
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:28.000]  had to say here is nijal forage you may say to me twitter is not the real world why do we all
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:33.200]  bother about it and speak about it so much but it's got several hundred million users and here's
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:38.800]  the key point much of what you read much of what you see on telly much of what you hear on radio
[3:22:38.800 --> 3:22:45.680]  is influenced by what is said and debated on twitter it has a massive influence over
[3:22:45.680 --> 3:22:50.960]  mainstream media and what it reports and in the early days twitter was rather like the other
[3:22:50.960 --> 3:22:57.040]  platforms it was a means of many of us getting the argument out because after all the bbc were
[3:22:57.040 --> 3:23:01.840]  going to cover my stuff in the european parliament now were they but i was able through twitter
[3:23:01.840 --> 3:23:08.640]  and other platforms to put out speeches to reach really big audiences and hey the master the global
[3:23:08.640 --> 3:23:15.600]  master of twitter was of course donald trump who's 5 30 am tweets from the white house were
[3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:20.800]  eagerly anticipated by those that loved him and those that hated him but hey we knew what he thought
[3:23:20.800 --> 3:23:27.440]  every day about pretty much everything then something started to change brexit happened
[3:23:28.160 --> 3:23:34.480]  trump happened and those liberals on the west coast who set up companies like twitter suddenly
[3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:41.120]  were horrified that they created organs for free speech that allowed people to make their minds up
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:48.800]  and make big decisions that they didn't agree with and so then it all started to change and goodness
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:55.520]  me haven't i noticed it because i built up a twitter following of 1.7 million people and it
[3:23:55.520 --> 3:24:01.760]  wasn't very difficult every single month to put on 30 40 50 000 new followers but within the last
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:08.080]  few years that has completely stopped i've had no growth on twitter whatsoever the stuff i put out
[3:24:08.080 --> 3:24:14.240]  the stuff i say gets seen by far fewer people now it could be that my stuff's really dull and boring
[3:24:14.240 --> 3:24:21.040]  and i've got nothing interesting to say no original thoughts whatsoever but i don't actually think
[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:28.000]  that's the case but there's something called an algorithm it's a weird mathematical formula
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:32.880]  i don't fully understand how it works i don't think the truth is many people do but it's through
[3:24:32.880 --> 3:24:39.520]  their algorithms where they're able effectively not to ban you from twitter but to shadow ban you
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:46.320]  from twitter oh but of course if you speak out too much about lockdown or issues like that or
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:52.480]  question global warming too much you'll find that almost no one sees the stuff that you put out so
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:59.520]  this public square for free speech has actually become part of something akin to a conspiracy
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:05.520]  we saw the height of it with hunter biden in the last election all sorts of extraordinary
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:12.000]  dealings with ukraine with mosco with beijing and yet it hardly got any mention on social
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:18.160]  media or on mainstream media they'd made their minds up we weren't allowed to know and actually
[3:25:18.160 --> 3:25:23.360]  the last couple of years has been a constant battle a constant war for me with organizations like
[3:25:23.360 --> 3:25:31.360]  twister but suddenly a white knight has appeared and it is elon musk extraordinary figure i wasn't
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:36.720]  sure about it you know i really just couldn't work out who this guy was what is clear he's an
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:45.920]  absolute devotee of free speech now yes of course free speech has its limits incitement etc should
[3:25:45.920 --> 3:25:52.560]  not be allowed in the public space but musk is committed to free speech he's launched this audacious
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:25:58.400]  bid to take over twitter the board have accepted the offer that he's made he's going to turn it into
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:03.440]  a private company but he will have some problems he will face some difficulties friend of mine
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:11.360]  yesterday spoke to a senior twitter executive in the united kingdom my name came up and the
[3:26:11.360 --> 3:26:18.480]  twitter executive used the c word so much for a platform for free speech the whole culture of
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:26.160]  the organization has been towards censorship towards cancel culture so frankly elon has really
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:33.120]  really got to drain the twitter swamp but if anybody can do it it's this guy he's hugely audacious
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:38.720]  i noticed jeff bezos overnight the world's second richest man asking questions about whether this
[3:26:38.720 --> 3:26:44.720]  meant china would have influence over twitter it won't china ban twitter a long long time ago
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:51.840]  so let's all later on today raise a glass to elon musk raise a glass to free speech and let's hope
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:57.760]  we actually get a proper town square back for public debate for hundreds of millions of people
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:03.760]  which then leads to media sources putting stuff out that is seen by billions all over the world
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:10.080]  this is a big and an important moment and even if donald trump at the moment is saying well he's not
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:15.680]  really sure whether he's going to rejoin twitter i reckon he will it was twitter that won him the
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:20.960]  presidency and that was why they decided in the end to ban him and to censor the rest of us who
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:28.560]  could be seen to the right of the political spectrum this is a really big exciting moment the sun is
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:36.800]  shining hey everything crossed they have nigel forage and he mentioned the hunter biden laptop
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:42.640]  story and that ties into this story of course the biden white house the deep state the regime
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:49.600]  there was a backlash against elon musk's takeover of twitter in the form of them creating this
[3:27:49.600 --> 3:27:57.760]  department of homeland security disinformation unit and guess who heads that disinformation unit
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:04.240]  it's a woman who said the hunter biden laptop story completely confirmed completely authentic
[3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:13.120]  completely genuine was disinformation of course because in their eyes disinformation is any information
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:18.640]  that is harmful to the regime the department of homeland security's new different disinformation
[3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:25.120]  units are is headed by a woman who says free speech makes her shudder she literally has physical
[3:28:25.120 --> 3:28:31.760]  convulsions at the very idea of it they falsely labeled the hunter biden laptop story disinformation
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:38.880]  this is nina jankowitz and again as i point out in the article the disinformation units the fact
[3:28:38.880 --> 3:28:46.560]  checkers are literally there not to check the facts not to filter the truth but to bury the truth
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:52.800]  they serve the same purpose that the ministry of truth served in orwell's 1984 which is burying
[3:28:52.800 --> 3:29:05.280]  and eliminating the truth we'll be back
[3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:30.160]  we will use it to fight the new world order ethereum bitcoin xrp light coin there there's dozens of

[3:33:26.160 --> 3:33:32.640]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom
[3:33:32.640 --> 3:33:42.800]  it's paul joseph watson now another phenomenon that we've seen over the past few years is the
[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:51.280]  ideological purity tests being applied to historical content in terms of art and culture
[3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:57.200]  and entertainment and we had another example of that just recently of course now they're
[3:33:57.200 --> 3:34:03.360]  making authors sign books where if they put any offensive content in their books that later triggers
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  well idiots that then the publishing company can cancel their contract and they're applying
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:18.400]  this retroactively as well headline uk streaming platform sensors homophobic line in 2002 spider
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:26.640]  man movie yes all the old are all the old films are being dragged kicking and screaming into the
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:32.800]  current sensibilities of wild idiots who are offended by literally everything and being
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:39.200]  censored uk streaming platform itv player has censored a homophobic line from the 2002 spider
[3:34:39.200 --> 3:34:44.240]  man movie and yet another example of older content being run through modern politically correct
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:51.600]  purity tests basically this was a line in spider man where the toby maguire spider man character
[3:34:52.240 --> 3:34:57.680]  was facing off against his rival bonesaur and said quote that's a cute outfit did your husband give
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:04.800]  it to you in the newly censored version being played on itv player in the uk the line is reduced
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:11.760]  to quote that's a cute outfit which of course renders the entire scene confusing and meaningless
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:18.160]  we've had other examples of this mbc announced that they were scanning 17 000 hours of past
[3:35:18.160 --> 3:35:24.560]  wwe content to weed out racist material pbs removed gone with the wind from its platform
[3:35:24.560 --> 3:35:30.240]  entirely because it had a black character who was a maid a servant to a white family
[3:35:30.960 --> 3:35:36.240]  who by the way was the first black female actress to win an oscar so they are raised her
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:40.960]  from history in the name of political correctness and of course we had little britain in the uk
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:49.360]  doing a similar thing we've had iconic books like literally they rewrote a version of 1984
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:56.000]  to reflect modern attitudes and make it more feminist so again just as the fact checkers
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:01.760]  are acting as the ministry of truth these ideological purity tests are acting in the same
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:07.600]  way they're running everything through the test if it doesn't pass the test it gets deleted it gets
[3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:13.520]  censored and maybe in the future nobody will ever remember that it was even there in the first place
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:20.400]  another thing that's being eliminated in many contexts is white men and now the new york times
[3:36:20.400 --> 3:36:26.240]  has come out and published an article saying basically there aren't enough black women flying
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:31.760]  commercial airliners and that there are too many white men flying planes and we have a clip about
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:37.680]  that here it is too many white men flying planes let's roll it published an article complaining
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:43.600]  about the fact that 95 percent of airline pilots are men and that almost all of that number are
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:50.400]  also wait for it white oh no the absolute horror they're demanding the industry embrace greater
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:56.880]  quote pilot diversity yeah really about 95 percent of airline pilots in the u.s today are male and
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:01.600]  nearly as many are white now with pilots in short supply there's urgency for the industry to
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:07.040]  act on diversifying piloting is stubbornly monolithic about 95 percent of airline pilots
[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:12.400]  in the u.s today are male nearly as many are white as if there's anything wrong with being a white
[3:37:12.400 --> 3:37:18.640]  male there isn't it's okay to be white few women and people of color aspire to fly planes because
[3:37:18.640 --> 3:37:23.600]  they rarely see themselves in today's flight decks states the article seemingly ignorant of the fact
[3:37:23.600 --> 3:37:29.040]  that women don't choose high pressure jobs that are more suited to men and quote women of color
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:34.240]  only represent a fraction of the population of the united states the article quotes alan mayer a
[3:37:34.240 --> 3:37:40.160]  history professor at auburn university who blames the stereotype of the quote often subconscious
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:45.040]  association between whiteness and maleness and technical competence or it could just be that
[3:37:45.040 --> 3:37:49.040]  white men tend to be quite good at technical things because they're generally smart and
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:37:54.400]  competent apparently however the most important thing when it comes to airline pilots is not
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:37:59.840]  their competency in flying a plane but their ethnic background if ever there was a profession
[3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:06.000]  where diversity quotas should be ignored and the best person possible regardless of race
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:11.120]  be given the job it's airline pilot but that would be common sense and the left doesn't do
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:15.760]  common sense what's next are they going to whine about they're not being enough people of color
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:25.840]  in charge of the nuclear codes they have it let's move on to covid yes covid still exists
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:32.800]  and the people who push devastating lockdowns mask mandates vaccine passport mandates have
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:37.680]  scottled away with their tails between their legs and not taken responsibility for being
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:43.520]  on the wrong side of history and we have two major massive new examples of that that just
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:48.880]  occurred over the past few days there's a big outbreak of hepatitis among children
[3:38:48.880 --> 3:38:54.880]  in numerous different countries across the world and guess what caused it lockdowns outbreak of
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:39:01.040]  hepatitis and children caused by lockdowns that weakened immunity yes humans do still
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:07.280]  have immune systems that are supposed to be exposed to different viruses so they can maintain
[3:39:07.280 --> 3:39:13.760]  strength and immunity the clues in the name will now a shocking outbreak of hepatitis cases in
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:19.280]  children may have been caused by lockdowns and social distancing which serve to weaken immune
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:25.520]  systems according to health experts the global surge of this hepatitis outbreak amongst children
[3:39:25.520 --> 3:39:32.000]  has so far impacted 12 different countries with 169 cases of acute hepatitis or unknown origin
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:40.400]  detected since last october this is occurring in children under the age of 5 17 so far that we
[3:39:40.400 --> 3:39:47.520]  know have required liver transplants and one unfortunate child has died as a result of this
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:55.040]  hepatitis the reason it's happening is because of course kids are supposed to be exposed to viruses
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:40:01.680]  at a young age so they build up natural immunity they're not being exposed what happens
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:07.840]  is that this virus is supposed to manifest itself as the common cold the kids are supposed to have
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:12.400]  natural immunity defenses against that but because their natural immunity has been completely
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:17.680]  obliterated by the fact that they were kept out of school kept away from other children
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:23.360]  made to wear masks in many cases they don't have that natural immunity that can fight the common cold
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:29.520]  so then this virus turns into hepatitis a more serious illness of course and this is causing
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:36.560]  deaths and the need for organ transplants in children under five and they quote professor
[3:40:36.560 --> 3:40:42.720]  simon taylor robinson in the Daily Mail who said quote i think it's likely that children mixing
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:48.720]  in kindergartens and schools have lower immunity to seasonal adenoviruses than in previous years
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:54.240]  because of restrictions in other words because of lockdown this means they could be at more risk of
[3:40:54.240 --> 3:40:59.440]  developing hepatitis because their immune response is weaker to the virus so yet again
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:05.760]  another concrete example of lockdown causing devastating long-term impacts this time targeting
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:14.000]  children and again in this second instance targeting kids study lockdowns drove 60 000
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:20.240]  children in the uk alone to clinical depression this is a study published in the royal society
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:25.600]  open science journal which found that lockdowns in the uk caused around 60 000 children to suffer
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:33.200]  clinical depression they detected the researchers in this study a 27.1 per cent prevalence of
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:38.880]  depression amongst their sample of kids and number significantly higher than would have
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:44.960]  occurred without lockdowns and the telegraph reports that that equates to about 60 000 extra kids
[3:41:44.960 --> 3:41:49.280]  who suffered clinical depression who wouldn't otherwise have been in that horrible situation
[3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:58.800]  if not for COVID-19 lockdowns last year in the uk we had 400 000 kids referred to mental health
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:04.640]  specialists because they had things like eating disorders self-harm again a lot of that driven
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:11.440]  by the isolation by the depression caused by lockdown we've had speech therapists reporting
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:17.520]  a 364 percent increase in patient referrals of babies and toddlers they're having cognitive
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:23.840]  developmental disorders they're having difficulties learning to speak because of being in isolation
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:32.960]  because of adults wearing masks and i still see parents in the uk making their five-year-old kid
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:39.440]  wear a mask outside literally stunting the cognitive development of their own kid
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:46.880]  presumably to virtue signal you know in support for the current thing i still see that everywhere
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:52.480]  major study by johns hopkins concluded global lockdowns had a massive detrimental impact
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:59.440]  on society you were on the wrong side of history for you see this it's an info wars republic defense

[3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:24.480]  we have big news believe it or not out of belgium yes the sleepy european country
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:31.680]  where in the capital city of brussels the majority of kids are now being born with the name
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:36.320]  a muhammad or at least islamic names take up almost 50 percent of newborn babies
[3:47:37.280 --> 3:47:42.480]  belgians are a minority native belgians are a minority in their own capital city
[3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:48.400]  just like why english people are in london and now we have a big story because a leftist leader
[3:47:49.120 --> 3:47:54.160]  the head of the socialist party there has admitted that multiculturalism basically has
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:48:01.120]  failed he was driving through the very diverse part of brussels called mollambique the notorious
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:07.520]  migrant ghetto where the paris massacre suspect salar abdeslam hid out for four months and was
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:13.280]  able to evade police because he was basically embedded and protected by the community and
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:19.440]  there's been a massive uproar in belgium in response to this leftist leader's comments what did he
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:26.320]  say let's go to the clip here it is this leader in belgium caused alarm amongst his own political
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:31.280]  allies after admitting that multiculturalism had failed the president of belgium's social
[3:48:31.280 --> 3:48:37.120]  democrat vori progress party conor rousseau caused leftist to hyperventilate when he let slip the
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:43.040]  truth speaking about mollambique an area in brussels that has a 40 percent muslim population
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:49.200]  rousseau said quote when i drive through mollambique i don't feel like i'm in belgium the socialist
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:54.560]  leader said integration of failed to such an extent that most people were born there yet can't
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:48:59.440]  even speak french quote in brussels due to the shortage of teachers there are people who teach
[3:48:59.440 --> 3:49:04.400]  in arabic because they don't even speak french this is unacceptable rousseau said and what is the
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:09.840]  flemish government doing it increases the cost of language courses to reduce waiting lists rousseau
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:14.960]  noted that in some areas schools only teach in arabic and children are not even encouraged to
[3:49:14.960 --> 3:49:19.760]  learn dutch or french the leftist leader's comments provoke to hissy fit amongst his own
[3:49:19.760 --> 3:49:24.400]  colleagues the head of the socialist party's parliamentary group armed laouge denounced
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:29.920]  rousseau's comments as intolerable stigmatizing and xenophobic his main gripe was that rousseau
[3:49:29.920 --> 3:49:36.400]  had offended brussels as diverse and cosmopolitan population boohoo mayor kathryn mouro called
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:42.320]  rousseau contemptuous while even members of his own party went public to condemn his completely
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:47.760]  truthful comments mollambique is a migrant ghetto so notorious salar abdeslam one of the
[3:49:47.760 --> 3:49:53.440]  paris massacre jihadists is able to hide out in the community for four months while evading police
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:59.440]  when i visited mollambique right after the paris massacre i was refused service in shops for being
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:05.920]  white in brussels a european capital the most popular name for newborn babies in the de facto
[3:50:05.920 --> 3:50:12.560]  eu capital of brussels is you guessed it mohammed islamic names make up 43 percent of total
[3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:18.160]  registrations in the belgian capital city the top four is mohammed gene mohammed again with
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:23.520]  a different spelling and armed native belgians are now a minority in brussels while across the
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:28.640]  whole country 48 percent of babies were born to a foreign mother or a mother of foreign origin in
[3:50:28.640 --> 3:50:36.160]  the last year 53.2 percent of residents in antwerp belgium's most popular city are now of immigrant
[3:50:36.160 --> 3:50:41.440]  origin unsurprisingly belgian cities are routinely rocked by migrant riots including massive unrest
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:47.040]  in andelect in april 2020 an event to mark black history month which took place in brussels in march
[3:50:47.040 --> 3:50:51.840]  2020 told white people that they were not welcome unless they paid a fee and cleaned up after black
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:56.640]  people later that year after black lives matter protesters in the city of antwerp defaced a statue
[3:50:56.640 --> 3:51:01.840]  of king leopold II belgium's longest reigning monarch authorities removed it and put it in a
[3:51:01.840 --> 3:51:12.800]  museum but remember guys diversity is a strength meanwhile staying in europe again we have governments
[3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:19.200]  justifying this reduction in living standards by citing support for the current thing despite the
[3:51:19.200 --> 3:51:25.520]  fact that this lowering of living standards reduction in life quality has been part of the
[3:51:25.520 --> 3:51:32.320]  great reset agenda for many years this whole failed green economy narrative has been a part of it
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:38.000]  they're merely now transitioning it into support ukraine because that's more popular amongst the
[3:51:38.000 --> 3:51:44.800]  masses amongst the npcs we have a headline here italy to start rationing energy to support ukraine
[3:51:45.440 --> 3:51:51.520]  from next month onwards italy will begin rationing electricity to support ukraine with public buildings
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:51:58.080]  banned from running air conditioning at lower than 25 degrees or heating higher than 19 degrees
[3:51:58.080 --> 3:52:04.480]  and they're encouraging encouraging at this stage not forcing businesses and private individuals
[3:52:04.480 --> 3:52:11.120]  to do the same the plan is being dubbed operation thermostat and is being hailed as the example
[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:15.920]  for italyans to follow in their own private homes the prime minister there mario dragui
[3:52:15.920 --> 3:52:21.840]  promoted the campaign by the campaign by asking quote do we want to have peace or do we want to
[3:52:21.840 --> 3:52:29.200]  have the air conditioning on so either you know you can look trendy you can be a moral exhibitionist
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:34.000]  you can get all the dopamine from that you can feel good about yourself for essentially doing
[3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:40.240]  nothing or you can live in comfort have heating and air conditioning i know which one that i'd
[3:52:40.240 --> 3:52:46.400]  choose presumably the price of peace is now a permanent reduction in your quality of life
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:51.760]  hit lightly commented quote i'm not exactly sure how adjusting your thermostat is going to
[3:52:51.760 --> 3:52:57.440]  achieve peace but hey we're living in the age of sentimental manipulation over reason so just
[3:52:58.000 --> 3:53:04.880]  believe and on that subject we have a final video here because everywhere i go where i live
[3:53:04.880 --> 3:53:11.520]  visit the nice well to do villages here in the corpse wall region there are people who earn
[3:53:11.520 --> 3:53:18.560]  significant amounts of money and have significant amounts of wealth reserves very proudly displaying
[3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:24.800]  their support for the current thing while much of the rest of the country enters fuel poverty can't
[3:53:24.800 --> 3:53:30.800]  afford to fill up their tank to go traveling anywhere and of course has to pay increasingly higher
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:37.280]  and higher food prices many people now slipping below the poverty line but again it's all to
[3:53:37.280 --> 3:53:44.000]  support the current thing to support Ukraine here is the video enter quality to support Ukraine let's
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:50.240]  roll it go driving in well to do areas of england and you'll be met with a familiar sigh profusely
[3:53:50.240 --> 3:53:58.080]  performative moral exhibitionist appeals to support Ukraine how giant flags some not even displaying
[3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:03.520]  the proper colors signs in the window ribbons on the front gate quite how this in any way
[3:54:03.520 --> 3:54:09.040]  materially supports Ukraine is anyone's guess seems like the primary purpose is to make these
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:14.800]  privileged posh twats feel less self-conscious about their wealth guilt and yet for much of the rest
[3:54:14.800 --> 3:54:21.440]  of the country the climate to support Ukraine is pushing them closer to poverty petrol and diesel
[3:54:21.440 --> 3:54:27.280]  prices already climbing before the conflict started have gone virtually parabolic since the
[3:54:27.280 --> 3:54:33.040]  sanctions on Russia four in ten Brits face entering fuel poverty later this year customers
[3:54:33.040 --> 3:54:40.000]  debts are expected to rise 50% or 800 million pounds come October that's going to get horrific
[3:54:40.000 --> 3:54:45.600]  truly horrific said Scottish power CEO Keith Anderson it has got to a stage now where the size
[3:54:45.600 --> 3:54:49.920]  and scale of it is beyond what I can deal with beyond what I think this industry can deal with
[3:54:49.920 --> 3:54:54.960]  he says the company is being deluged by calls from panic customers worried about how they're
[3:54:54.960 --> 3:55:00.560]  going to pay the bill we're expecting a severe impact on customers ability to pay said eons UK
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:05.920]  chief executive edf energy chief executive Simone Rossi says they've received a 40%
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:11.920]  spiking calls from customers alarmed at soaring prices so yeah it's very easy to display your
[3:55:11.920 --> 3:55:17.440]  support for Ukraine if you own three Range Rovers an eight bedroom manor house and a hundred acres
[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:23.360]  of land an extra 20 quid here and there to fill up the tank an extra 700 quid a year in heating
[3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:29.440]  costs is barely even going to touch the sides but so many others it's the difference between being
[3:55:29.440 --> 3:55:35.600]  able to put food on the table the price of which is also skyrocketing so maybe before you feel the
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:40.800]  need to signal your virtue about supporting Ukraine with your stupid flags and your little
[3:55:40.800 --> 3:55:46.400]  ribbons to try and one up your neighbors in your rich Cotswold enclave because their flags bigger
[3:55:46.400 --> 3:55:52.640]  than yours think just for a single second about the impact this is having on those who can't afford
[3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:58.800]  to support Ukraine because of our support for Ukraine and because of the sanctions they can
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:07.200]  barely afford to support their own families now spare a pot of thought for the poor Germans
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:12.160]  because the situation is even worse in their country because Germany imported up until recently
[3:56:12.160 --> 3:56:18.960]  55% of its gas from Russia along with a third of its oil and 45% of its coal they have government
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:25.040]  ministers they're telling them to take fewer showers to support Ukraine they also have government
[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:30.320]  ministers telling them to cope with soaring energy costs by wearing warmer sweaters which
[3:56:31.200 --> 3:56:35.440]  by the way if old people don't properly heat their homes no matter how much clothing they're
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:41.200]  wearing they can literally die well now lo and behold we have this German inflation hits four
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:46.720]  decade high for a single month Germany's inflation rate rose at its fastest pace since before
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:52.640]  reunification data for April published on Thursday showed as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:59.360]  a rise in energy prices it's not the invasion that sparked it it's your sanctions that sparked it
[3:56:59.360 --> 3:57:05.200]  take responsibility meanwhile though Germany apparently has plenty of money despite
[3:57:05.920 --> 3:57:12.160]  inflicting this unprecedented inflation on its population to send anti aircraft systems to
[3:57:12.160 --> 3:57:19.040]  Ukraine in policy shift they're sending a fleet of around 50 anti aircraft systems to Ukraine
[3:57:19.040 --> 3:57:26.080]  paid for by the German taxpayer who was already laboring suffering under record rampant inflation
[3:57:26.080 --> 3:57:33.520]  we also have of course Joe Biden just sending a further 33 billion in military aid directly
[3:57:33.520 --> 3:57:39.040]  to support the current thing I don't think American taxpayers were asked about that were they
[3:57:39.040 --> 3:57:42.480]  that's going to wrap it up for now war room is next summit dot news they're going
