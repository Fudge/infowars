[00:00.000 --> 00:07.520]  Well, the big vote's coming up on the repeal, or is it really a repeal of Obamacare?
[00:07.520 --> 00:09.880]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:09.880 --> 00:13.880]  We have massive news on Soros trying to stir up race wars and civil unrest.
[00:13.880 --> 00:17.960]  It's a big, important transmission on this Friday worldwide broadcast.
[00:17.960 --> 00:25.800]  But first, we also have one of the top survivors from Benghazi joining us today, a lot of other
[00:25.800 --> 00:26.800]  big guests.
[00:26.800 --> 00:29.480]  We have a key report from John Bowne.
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.800]  Eitbart and Info Wars, under investigation for ties to Russia.
[00:33.800 --> 00:34.800]  Report.
[00:34.800 --> 00:35.800]  That's right.
[00:35.800 --> 00:39.280]  Stephen Bannon trying to cut middle-class taxes, rebuild our military, and defend our
[00:39.280 --> 00:46.320]  borders and get the VA working right, as well as kill Obamacare, decorated Navy officer.
[00:46.320 --> 00:47.320]  Can't trust him.
[00:47.320 --> 00:48.320]  Can't trust anybody.
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.880]  But we can trust Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and John Podesta and Michael Moore, can't
[00:54.880 --> 00:55.880]  we?
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.760]  We have to reduce the deficit because, and so therefore we must cut education.
[01:00.760 --> 01:14.280]  That is a stupid, a common, a moment of, what, a moment of comedy, of comedy, of goodwill.
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.200]  But this budget is really a slap in the face of the future.
[01:18.200 --> 01:22.200]  And Barack Obama Day will not be celebrated in the former President's home state.
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.980]  lawmakers in Illinois voting down the proposal to honor his birthday as a state holiday on
[01:27.980 --> 01:29.480]  August 4th.
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.880]  I would just add, this should be of concern to everyone that the Russians are trying to
[01:33.880 --> 01:34.880]  influence our election.
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.520]  But I'll answer your question directly, which is that she said all throughout this campaign
[01:39.520 --> 01:41.600]  she will crack down on Wall Street.
[01:41.600 --> 01:47.560]  She said it too, there's nothing that is, that she hasn't said in private that she doesn't
[01:47.560 --> 02:09.560]  say in public.
[02:09.560 --> 02:12.760]  And this, you see, has been built up for months.
[02:12.760 --> 02:15.760]  At first when they came out and said, oh, the Russians stole the election, it'd be too
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.760]  much.
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.480]  They were going to build it and build it until they say that Breitbart's Russian, Stephen
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.920]  Bannon's Russian, I'm Russian and Trump's Russian.
[02:26.920 --> 02:31.560]  And if Trump and his people don't counter strike when Hillary is openly on the Communist
[02:31.560 --> 02:38.800]  Chinese payroll, sold 30% of our uranium to Russia, got all of these tens of millions
[02:38.800 --> 02:42.840]  for it, and if they don't start the indictments of the open crimes they've committed, they're
[02:42.840 --> 02:44.280]  not going to stop.
[02:44.280 --> 02:50.600]  This company, Uranium One, had outposts in the U.S., in uranium mines.
[02:50.600 --> 02:57.400]  So they were essentially bargaining to sell their company to the Russians so the Russians
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.600]  could in part control U.S. uranium production.
[03:02.600 --> 03:08.960]  And in order for that deal to be signed off on, one of the federal agencies of the United
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.240]  States had to okay it because this is national security, is the State Department, then headed
[03:15.240 --> 03:18.000]  up by Hillary Clinton.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.800]  It's undisputed, even the precious New York Times admits that.
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.880]  So what's the big story here?
[03:22.880 --> 03:30.000]  The FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases and about the people we are
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  investigating.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.600]  I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.440]  information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition, details about U.S. persons
[03:42.440 --> 03:47.680]  associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.520]  intelligence value, the House Intelligence Committee will thoroughly investigate surveillance
[03:52.520 --> 03:58.960]  and its subsequent dissemination, who was aware of it, why it was not disclosed to Congress,
[03:58.960 --> 04:05.040]  who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, whether anyone directed the intelligence
[04:05.040 --> 04:11.000]  community to focus on Trump associates and whether any laws, regulations, or procedures
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.080]  were violated.
[04:13.080 --> 04:17.920]  And the globalists of the traders, they're the outside group that has come in and taken
[04:17.920 --> 04:18.920]  over the country.
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.560]  And here we are, not just in the United States, but worldwide saying, kick the oligarchs out,
[04:23.560 --> 04:31.520]  kick the globalists out, and to claim it's Russian is the most ridiculous thing on Earth,
[04:31.520 --> 04:33.160]  but they don't care.
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.000]  Violence is discovered to be elite, unelected, above the law, tax-exempt, diplomatically
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.520]  immune, totally corrupt.
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.080]  The new royalty, we reject Kim Jong-un.
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.400]  We reject, you know, Queen Elizabeth II.
[04:46.400 --> 04:49.280]  We reject George Soros and the new royalty at the UN.
[04:49.280 --> 04:50.280]  We're done.
[04:50.280 --> 04:53.720]  Well, it's breaking all of the news.
[04:53.720 --> 04:57.520]  They have the smoking gun proof that Obama did spy on the president.
[04:57.520 --> 05:00.240]  It's exactly how we told you he did it.
[05:00.240 --> 05:05.720]  Appearing on The Drudge Report this morning, potential smoking gun showed Obama administration
[05:05.720 --> 05:08.240]  spy on Trump team sources.
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.320]  Republican congressional investigators expect a potential smoking gun, establishing that
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.520]  the Obama administration, spy on the Trump transition team, and possibly the president
[05:16.520 --> 05:18.040]  elect himself.
[05:18.040 --> 05:21.640]  Intelligence committee chair, David Nunes from California, has said he expects that
[05:21.640 --> 05:24.320]  the NSA will provide him this smoking gun evidence.
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.280]  The intelligence has said to leave no doubt that the Obama administration in its closing
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.240]  days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect
[05:33.240 --> 05:34.800]  Trump, according to sources.
[05:34.800 --> 05:36.800]  And basically, it boils down to this.
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.200]  While it's legal for the deep state to collect intelligence on foreign targets, it's not
[05:41.200 --> 05:44.280]  legal for the names of U.S. citizens to be unmasked.
[05:44.280 --> 05:47.400]  This was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports.
[05:47.400 --> 05:52.600]  Now looking back at Trump's March 4th wiretapping tweets, it seems he was right all along.
[05:52.600 --> 05:57.240]  Soon, we will find out if Obama administration officials are too big to jail.
[05:57.240 --> 06:01.280]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[06:01.280 --> 06:06.360]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[06:06.360 --> 06:09.720]  before it became a loss to our modern diet, a processed junk.
[06:09.720 --> 06:14.960]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[06:14.960 --> 06:21.120]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[06:21.120 --> 06:22.560]  great tasting formula.
[06:22.560 --> 06:23.560]  Caveman.
[06:23.560 --> 06:27.440]  Those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[06:27.440 --> 06:31.440]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:31.440 --> 06:35.440]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[06:35.440 --> 06:40.800]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[06:40.800 --> 06:44.680]  of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:44.680 --> 06:47.240]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:47.240 --> 06:51.600]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:51.600 --> 06:55.200]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:55.200 --> 06:59.680]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself, InfowarsLive.com
[06:59.680 --> 07:00.680]  today.

[07:25.200 --> 07:28.120]  and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.

[07:36.800 --> 07:40.920]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our

[08:20.280 --> 08:24.920]  Then that would also mean that in the case of General Flynn, not only did it a masking
[08:24.920 --> 08:30.680]  take place, but also an intelligence leak, which as I understand it never happens in
[08:30.680 --> 08:36.000]  a case where signal intelligence such as this is in fact obtained.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.000]  Is that correct?
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.440]  Yeah, I've never heard of that happening before, and as I've said many times, the only
[08:41.440 --> 08:44.720]  crime that we know has been committed here is that one, and it's quite clear that it
[08:44.720 --> 08:45.720]  was a crime.
[08:45.720 --> 08:50.680]  Look, I think you said it right, Sean, these programs are vitally important to the security
[08:50.680 --> 08:56.200]  of our country, and that's why we take this seriously here in Congress to do, conduct
[08:56.200 --> 09:01.240]  our oversight, and clearly when I see a problem, I'm going to point it out.
[09:01.240 --> 09:07.920]  In the case of any type of leak, that would be a violation of the Espionage Act.
[09:07.920 --> 09:08.920]  That would be a felony.
[09:08.920 --> 09:11.920]  That would be five years potentially in prison.
[09:11.920 --> 09:15.160]  That's correct, and it appears like that happened, right?
[09:15.160 --> 09:20.520]  I mean, we won't know until we got all the details, but from my perspective, it appears
[09:20.520 --> 09:21.680]  like that was a crime.
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.480]  And that raises another question, was you talked about it being widely dispensed within
[09:25.480 --> 09:31.480]  the intelligence community, meaning many people saw the surveillance of the presidential
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.640]  act and his transition team, and they were identified, then it goes to the issue of
[09:36.640 --> 09:38.520]  how many people had access to it.
[09:38.520 --> 09:44.160]  Two weeks before President Obama left office, he modified Executive Order 12333, which allowed
[09:44.160 --> 09:49.280]  the sharing of this type of intelligence which had never happened before with 16 other agencies.
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.720]  Is there a possibility that was done so that leaks could be covered up, sir?
[09:52.720 --> 09:57.000]  Well, in the reports that I read, they were clearly disseminated far and wide, and I don't
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.400]  think it actually has anything to do with the change in that procedure.
[10:01.400 --> 10:07.200]  But what I saw was disseminated pretty far, and in many cases you have to wonder why,
[10:07.200 --> 10:08.560]  which is why I raised the question.
[10:08.560 --> 10:14.840]  But prior to that modification of Executive Order 12333, it was not usual practice to
[10:14.840 --> 10:16.040]  widely disseminate.
[10:16.040 --> 10:22.960]  So certainly, look, if this happened in November and December, that didn't happen until January,
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.760]  the alteration of 12333.
[10:24.760 --> 10:31.400]  Is there anybody that you saw that had dissemination of these documents that should have?
[10:31.400 --> 10:33.800]  I don't want to get in the weeds here, Sean.
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.120]  I don't believe that change impacted what I saw.
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.120]  Okay.
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.280]  But with that said, I will say that the dissemination was pretty far and wide, and like I've said
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.520]  before, I think it appears to me that it was all legal.
[10:46.520 --> 10:49.200]  The question is, should it have been done in the first place?
[10:49.200 --> 10:51.440]  Did it meet foreign intelligence value?
[10:51.440 --> 10:56.200]  And then secondly, were any other American names unmasked?
[10:56.200 --> 10:58.400]  And I have information that says that there are.
[10:58.400 --> 10:59.400]  All right.
[10:59.400 --> 11:03.560]  Now that's Representative Dunne as the head of the House Intelligence Committee telling
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.240]  you the exact truth of the law and how it works.
[11:08.240 --> 11:11.200]  That's why this is so ridiculous.
[11:11.200 --> 11:19.360]  Everything a president elect does on a telephone is recorded by law when they're talking to
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.160]  foreign leaders.
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.560]  What's illegal is unmasking the president, unmasking Flynn, saying you have proof that
[11:29.560 --> 11:31.760]  they're selling us out to the Russians.
[11:31.760 --> 11:33.520]  The bluff gets called.
[11:33.520 --> 11:36.800]  The House of Senate Intelligence Committees get their proof.
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.080]  There's not even phone calls till the middle of December that are supposed to be phone
[11:41.080 --> 11:43.640]  calls to the Russians and everybody else.
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.160]  Trump was calling hundreds and hundreds of world leaders a day when he called me three
[11:48.160 --> 11:49.160]  days after the election.
[11:49.160 --> 11:52.640]  He said, Alex, your number, whatever, I only got five minutes with you and I've already
[11:52.640 --> 11:55.920]  called a hundred and something people and I told folks about that.
[11:55.920 --> 11:57.040]  That's what Trump was doing.
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.760]  It's what Flynn was doing.
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.440]  But that's what's so crazy about this is that that's what CNN and MSNBC and ABC and even
[12:05.440 --> 12:09.600]  Fox News for the last two weeks was saying the president may get impeached.
[12:09.600 --> 12:10.600]  What a bold statement.
[12:10.600 --> 12:17.720]  It's actually been three weeks claiming the NSA was spying on him.
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.960]  That's what it is when under law they're spying on the foreign diplomats and leaders through
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.120]  those digital interfaces.
[12:28.120 --> 12:34.800]  And now Nunes comes out and says, no, I've seen the evidence, which they just play stupid
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.720]  with at the NSA and other agencies, the record of them spying on Trump.
[12:41.720 --> 12:44.040]  He's seen the records.
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.240]  And then we know some of the other sources that have gotten information to Nunes showing
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.600]  illegal spying was going on by Obama going back eight plus years ago when he first got
[12:54.600 --> 12:58.680]  into office against Donald John Trump.
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.440]  That everybody knew had the top TV shows, you name it, the top two scores, the top likeability.
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.120]  Back then he had like 90% likeability with the public in national polls.
[13:09.120 --> 13:10.120]  So he's got to run for president.
[13:10.120 --> 13:12.120]  Remember, he wasn't a right-winger or left-winger back then.
[13:12.120 --> 13:17.320]  He was just Donald Trump, the entertainer, the golfer, the billionaire, the guy with
[13:17.320 --> 13:21.240]  the beautiful wife.
[13:21.240 --> 13:28.400]  So this is a real water loom for the Democrats in the deep state because they were so foolish.
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.080]  They came out and said, we have the intercepts that Trump is selling us out of the Russians.
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.200]  Well, they had the intercepts, but he wasn't selling us out.
[13:35.200 --> 13:38.320]  Then Trump said, you've leaked that information.
[13:38.320 --> 13:40.160]  That's illegal, cut and dry.
[13:40.160 --> 13:48.640]  And they went, oh, baby, like porky pig.
[13:48.640 --> 13:49.640]  We didn't do that.
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.640]  We never surveilled anybody.
[13:50.640 --> 13:55.120]  His prepositions were like, here's thousands of headlines, hundreds out of the Washington
[13:55.120 --> 13:56.120]  Post and New York Times.
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.360]  Here's one writer that wrote three stories, one writer that wrote four stories, one writer
[13:59.360 --> 14:06.000]  that wrote eight stories in the New York Times alone saying wiretaps, intercepts, transcripts
[14:06.000 --> 14:14.240]  of Flynn and other Trump people selling us out to the Russians.
[14:14.240 --> 14:16.960]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[14:16.960 --> 14:19.040]  But what's the big takeaway here?
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.240]  They thought you were stupid, I was stupid and didn't know the facts.
[14:22.240 --> 14:23.800]  And now Sean Hannity's up there.
[14:23.800 --> 14:25.080]  God love him.
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.880]  Giving you the US code, giving you the law, how they were doing it.
[14:28.880 --> 14:30.280]  It's all law.
[14:30.280 --> 14:31.320]  It's all in the books.
[14:31.320 --> 14:37.120]  It's going on for 50 years or more.
[14:37.120 --> 14:40.920]  So now Fox News calls it potential smoking gun last night showing Obama administration
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.600]  spied on Trump team.
[14:42.600 --> 14:50.400]  This is like saying smoking gun that the Gulf of Mexico exists.
[14:50.400 --> 14:53.880]  Smoking gun, Mother Teresa existed.
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.680]  It's like smoking gun, I'm holding a laptop or an iPad in my hand.
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.680]  Anyone can see I am.
[15:02.680 --> 15:08.480]  Smoking gun, I've got a shot of North America behind me on the Jumbotron.
[15:08.480 --> 15:10.840]  Smoking gun, I'm wearing a baby blue shirt.
[15:10.840 --> 15:14.440]  Smoking gun, I'm wearing a black sports wristwatch.
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.480]  Smoking gun, my hair is falling out.
[15:16.480 --> 15:18.880]  Smoking gun, smoking gun.
[15:18.880 --> 15:25.000]  And I have to sit here being the person telling you this for 20 years the same way every time.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.240]  They have keyword software, they're grabbing everything.
[15:27.240 --> 15:32.400]  It runs through the major telecom hubs and now they've moved on to more advanced stuff.
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.080]  Because it was all declassified 20 years ago.
[15:37.080 --> 15:41.880]  And they would just say, oh, that's the crazy conspiracy theorist.
[15:41.880 --> 15:43.240]  And they would pick things that sounded weird.
[15:43.240 --> 15:48.920]  I'd be sent video shot from a nursing home in Kingsville, Texas of, you know, 18 helicopters
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.360]  coming in and blowing up the old police station and scaring the town in some Delta Force drill.
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.320]  I'm not against Delta Force, but I show the video terrorizing people.
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.480]  What is the PSYOP?
[15:58.480 --> 16:01.160]  The military high up folks say this is the condition of the public.
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.160]  Bill Clinton's ordered this.
[16:02.160 --> 16:03.400]  The military doesn't like it.
[16:03.400 --> 16:04.720]  This isn't just a training mission.
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.120]  And they had headlines across the country saying Alex Jones believes black helicopters exist.
[16:09.120 --> 16:11.440]  And they start this whole black helicopter thing.
[16:11.440 --> 16:13.680]  People were seeing him all over the country doing drills.
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.080]  And they were doing a test to tell you, you're crazy.
[16:17.080 --> 16:27.920]  There's no black helicopters despite the fact that I had former Delta Force people telling
[16:27.920 --> 16:32.440]  me what the program was and had emergency managers and police chiefs.
[16:32.440 --> 16:38.240]  And I have the video of the police chief in San Antonio in an interview in his office
[16:38.240 --> 16:44.120]  where they offered him $200,000 cash Delta Force did to let them run secret operations
[16:44.120 --> 16:47.840]  and basically assassination squads and things like that inside San Antonio.
[16:47.840 --> 16:51.960]  It was going on all over the country and the Delta Force didn't like it.
[16:51.960 --> 16:55.720]  They were being used by the president because the average person isn't going to say no to
[16:55.720 --> 16:57.040]  one of our best military units.
[16:57.040 --> 17:02.080]  They're going to believe there's some reason they used our James Bond types to go compromise.
[17:02.080 --> 17:04.440]  And now a Philippus had been in army intelligence.
[17:04.440 --> 17:06.320]  He said, listen, get the hell out of my office.
[17:06.320 --> 17:10.480]  Then he found out they bought off almost the whole city.
[17:10.480 --> 17:13.280]  Then AP had to admit, okay, Alex Jones is right.
[17:13.280 --> 17:18.080]  The black helicopters are here and they're absolutely running psyops.
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.960]  But see, this is how they work, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:21.960 --> 17:25.200]  Then they go, Alex doesn't like the army.
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.000]  No, the army doesn't like what they're being told to do.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.720]  See, the armies are army.
[17:29.720 --> 17:31.120]  The governments are government.
[17:31.120 --> 17:32.360]  I never hated the government.
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.280]  I didn't like the globalists that hijacked it.
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.280]  And I've told you thousands of times, thousands of times, but if you're a new listener, this
[17:38.280 --> 17:40.640]  is key.
[17:40.640 --> 17:41.640]  Globalism is illegal.
[17:41.640 --> 17:42.640]  It's corrupt.
[17:42.640 --> 17:43.640]  It's anti-human.
[17:43.640 --> 17:44.800]  It's absolutely greedy.
[17:44.800 --> 17:47.440]  It wants to make you poor to control you and it's so arrogant.
[17:47.440 --> 17:51.200]  It's written hundreds of books and white papers and university studies admitting their
[17:51.200 --> 17:52.200]  global plan.
[17:52.200 --> 17:59.080]  This movement is a scientific dictatorship in their words called the technocracy.
[17:59.080 --> 18:04.800]  If you ever expose it's there and ever make them admit, okay, Obamacare isn't free.
[18:04.800 --> 18:06.920]  Or okay, they really are coming after our guns.
[18:06.920 --> 18:12.080]  Or okay, there really are globalists and a global government that's out to take our freedoms.
[18:12.080 --> 18:18.640]  If you ever force that and the public finally admits it's real, it's like admitting that,
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.720]  again, that the sun came up this morning.
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.560]  But it's this peer pressure mind control where they go, there's no NSA spying, nobody
[18:25.560 --> 18:26.560]  spied on Trump.
[18:26.560 --> 18:27.560]  That's insane.
[18:27.560 --> 18:29.280]  You just said a week ago you were spying on him.
[18:29.280 --> 18:30.280]  No, he didn't.
[18:30.280 --> 18:31.280]  No, he didn't.
[18:31.280 --> 18:34.400]  CNN came on last week and said, Alex Jones is preposterous.
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.600]  He claims, I wrote articles about wiretapping and the president being spied on.
[18:39.600 --> 18:45.400]  And the very author's name, I kept saying three, was on four articles saying surveillance,
[18:45.400 --> 18:50.040]  wiretapping, intercepts, transcripts of the president and his transition team, selling
[18:50.040 --> 18:52.720]  us out to the Russians.
[18:52.720 --> 18:59.440]  And he went on CNN and said it didn't exist.
[18:59.440 --> 19:02.720]  The radio listener, the article's flashback, New York Times admits wiretaps used against
[19:02.720 --> 19:03.720]  Trump.
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.720]  Let's scroll down.
[19:04.720 --> 19:07.560]  We'll show you a screenshot of just one of the articles where it says wiretap data using
[19:07.560 --> 19:09.200]  inquiry on Trump aides.
[19:09.200 --> 19:14.440]  And I can play you the same guy saying it doesn't exist and you're crazy.
[19:14.440 --> 19:16.040]  Well, guess what?
[19:16.040 --> 19:17.920]  It doesn't work anymore.
[19:17.920 --> 19:22.080]  These little control freaks.
[19:22.080 --> 19:27.760]  So the big takeaway here is, Davos Man is dead, Bilderberg Man is dead.
[19:27.760 --> 19:31.640]  The guy that founded Bilderberg literally died, as you know, a few days ago, that Rockefeller.
[19:31.640 --> 19:35.600]  But in their own writings, they're saying globalism is dead and they're not saying it
[19:35.600 --> 19:36.840]  to play possum.
[19:36.840 --> 19:40.440]  Their corrupt system is going to fall.
[19:40.440 --> 19:44.160]  Now they're just trying to steal as much money as they can and run to armored redoubts
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.880]  in the Pacific Ocean.
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.360]  That's a fact.
[19:48.360 --> 19:52.840]  I read about it and heard about it from some sources and I went and investigated it in
[19:52.840 --> 19:53.840]  Kauai.
[19:53.840 --> 19:56.360]  I think I'm going to go to Tasmania and investigate it as well and there they were
[19:56.360 --> 20:01.400]  building their mountaintop armored fortresses, helicopter pads, everything, kicking the locals
[20:01.400 --> 20:02.400]  off their land.
[20:02.400 --> 20:03.400]  You name it.
[20:03.400 --> 20:05.480]  And it's even worse in Tasmania.
[20:05.480 --> 20:08.560]  That's really out in the middle of nowhere.
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.720]  And they are pulling out, either planning something big, I don't have an idea.
[20:13.720 --> 20:16.480]  I know what's in their cards.
[20:16.480 --> 20:23.320]  I know it's in their spectrum of plans and if people can't admit the stuff that's in
[20:23.320 --> 20:28.880]  their face, how are you going to admit to yourself and change the stuff that is absolutely
[20:28.880 --> 20:33.480]  going on but is 50 times more scary?
[20:33.480 --> 20:38.640]  I'm not going to sit here and stick my head in the sand.
[20:38.640 --> 20:43.800]  Globalism is criminal, it is anti-human, it is a horrible ideology, the worst the world's
[20:43.800 --> 20:51.040]  ever seen, it comes out of the eugenics, social Darwinism movement that spawned the fascist,
[20:51.040 --> 20:56.440]  like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, it's bad.
[20:56.440 --> 21:00.760]  And Hitler and Mussolini were unorganized morons compared to the globalist.
[21:00.760 --> 21:04.080]  But they don't care if you're white or black, they want to dumb everybody down and play
[21:04.080 --> 21:07.560]  us off but they use race politics posing as the left.
[21:07.560 --> 21:09.360]  That's the global plan.
[21:09.360 --> 21:15.080]  As the giant third world population implode them, flood the west, dictate the surrender
[21:15.080 --> 21:24.000]  of the west of the globalist, 3 million North African Muslims are waiting under the UN migration
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.360]  slash borders board run by the founder of the EU, Peter Sutherland, and they're ordering
[21:29.360 --> 21:36.440]  Europe right now, the EU under UN, talk about dictatorship, to let 3 million in in the next
[21:36.440 --> 21:45.400]  six months, 3 million on top of the 5 million documented, 80% of the military aged men flooding
[21:45.400 --> 21:46.400]  in.
[21:46.400 --> 21:47.400]  What is that plan?
[21:47.400 --> 21:53.040]  Sutherland told the Guardian three years ago and gave a speech to the EU saying it's
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.040]  to end Western civilization and white culture.
[21:58.040 --> 22:03.720]  When they say white though folks, they mean due process, juries, electricity, all the
[22:03.720 --> 22:10.200]  stuff, they don't want the world getting the idea that you, our system's not perfect.
[22:10.200 --> 22:14.440]  But boy, go to Guatemala, go to North Korea, go to Venezuela, go to Nigeria, which is one
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.880]  of the better African countries, go to South Africa and then tell me how good those places
[22:19.880 --> 22:20.880]  are.
[22:20.880 --> 22:27.120]  Go to Cuba, go to Eastern Europe, where everything's a screw job and a ruling class and there's
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.560]  nothing but a mafia.
[22:28.560 --> 22:33.040]  Your only hope is getting your daughter or your son married in to one of the local power
[22:33.040 --> 22:34.040]  structures.
[22:34.040 --> 22:35.720]  That's all there is.
[22:35.720 --> 22:40.680]  The whole culture's about butt kissing, not about innovation, not about building, not
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.960]  about a future.
[22:42.960 --> 22:43.960]  America isn't perfect.
[22:43.960 --> 22:44.960]  Europe isn't perfect.
[22:44.960 --> 22:47.440]  We're trying to get to that renaissance.
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.320]  Just the idea of it created all this technology you're looking at, the medicine, everything,
[22:51.320 --> 22:56.360]  but it's all got a bad side because the globalists have hijacked with Trojan horses, the culture,
[22:56.360 --> 23:00.920]  the electronics, the medicine, everything for their agendas because they don't want
[23:00.920 --> 23:05.560]  to give us Promethean fire that our ancestors built.
[23:05.560 --> 23:12.080]  The human culture all contributed to the science we have.
[23:12.080 --> 23:20.160]  It's just that the plague hit Europe a thousand years ago, 800 years ago, 600 years ago and
[23:20.160 --> 23:25.280]  wiped out the elites as they were in the cities and left the farmers and that's what caused
[23:25.280 --> 23:29.840]  the renaissance was actually people out working hard far away from cities who had their own
[23:29.840 --> 23:35.000]  little industries and were too far away for the nobles to come and slave them completely.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.720]  All those secret technologies that have been held back going back through different cultures
[23:39.720 --> 23:45.000]  were then able to spring forth because a large part of the population died and we were able
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.160]  to get the renaissance going because the elite were basically wiped out.
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.480]  It's the only reason we have, it's not that even Europe is better than other regions and
[23:55.480 --> 23:56.480]  groups in the world.
[23:56.480 --> 23:59.800]  They've all had technologies and things, this is advanced, but their elites kept them
[23:59.800 --> 24:02.560]  behind the city walls and never gave it to the public.
[24:02.560 --> 24:07.600]  Same thing the Europeans did, whether it's Japan or ancient Europe or ancient Mesoamerica,
[24:07.600 --> 24:14.880]  it's ancient Africa, the elites don't want new innovation going to the people because
[24:14.880 --> 24:19.600]  they're controlling everyone with it and that same fight we've been dealing with forever
[24:19.600 --> 24:22.000]  is what we're facing now.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.560]  I've got more of the new Nest clips I want to get to, I've got the confirmation hearings,
[24:27.560 --> 24:33.640]  I always say his name, we're on Gorsuch, we've got that, we've got the clips from the president,
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.520]  we've got a bunch of huge guests joining us today, but the Democrats are openly in the
[24:38.520 --> 24:45.440]  news saying sabotage the economy, plunge the economy, stop Trump, kill Trump, overthrow
[24:45.440 --> 24:50.240]  Trump, on and on and on, and I'm going to tell you what Trump's doing, he's letting
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.400]  the Republican establishment have their way with a little bit better bill to put it back
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.600]  into Congress and he knows it's going to go to the Senate and it's going to get killed
[24:58.600 --> 25:03.480]  but then he's tried to get rid of Obamacare that the full fines and fees hit you this
[25:03.480 --> 25:07.320]  year, then they'll still hit you, he would have tried to get rid of it, it's their fault,
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.760]  they don't do it right, then we'll get the full repeal, that's what I'm predicting and
[25:11.760 --> 25:19.440]  I predict the House will go ahead and vote on this Paul Ryan thing that will keep the
[25:19.440 --> 25:23.560]  death spiral from going all the way down, it's got big problems but it's a lot better
[25:23.560 --> 25:28.960]  than Obamacare and then I predict it'll get killed in the Senate because it's not globalist
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.920]  enough for them and then it'll go right back to the full House and there'll be a new bill
[25:32.920 --> 25:38.880]  brought forward by the more conservative libertarian caucuses that will be used to then discredit
[25:38.880 --> 25:43.840]  Paul Ryan and I think you're seeing Trump very Machiavelli but in a good way for the
[25:43.840 --> 25:51.840]  people set up Paul Ryan for a big fat juicy fall.
[25:51.840 --> 26:03.200]  So we'll see, we'll see, we'll see if my eye is right, we'll see but I know this America
[26:03.200 --> 26:07.000]  is back open for business and the whole world knows it and a lot of people are excited,
[26:07.000 --> 26:15.480]  a lot of people are upset but America being back in business means prosperity has a shot
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.400]  and that's why I'm so excited.
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.040]  Let's go ahead and play one more of these Gorsuch clips again because this is important,
[26:23.040 --> 26:30.520]  this is a boil down, what's happening with Supreme Court nominee, here it is, it's a
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.080]  boil down.
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.240]  The rating of well qualified is reserved for those found to merit the committee's strongest
[26:40.240 --> 26:42.920]  affirmative endorsement.
[26:42.920 --> 26:49.080]  Having examined Judge Gorsuch through this lens, the standing committee members unanimously
[26:49.080 --> 26:52.480]  voted that he deserved the well qualified rating.
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.400]  It's the law, whether we like it or not, it's the law and if I start saying I like one opinion
[26:58.400 --> 27:00.080]  or I like the other opinion, I'm signalling...
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.080]  All right, I'll let you ask the hook, let me go to another one.
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.600]  Thank you, thank you Senator.
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.360]  In a Republican congressman, recently said the best thing the president can do for his
[27:11.360 --> 27:18.800]  Muslim band is to make sure he has Gorsuch on the Supreme Court before the appeals get
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.280]  to that point.
[27:23.280 --> 27:27.040]  Senator, a lot of people say a lot of silly things.
[27:27.040 --> 27:32.840]  My grandfather, well that's more than silly, let's say his congressman wants you on the
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.280]  court so they can uphold a Muslim band.
[27:36.280 --> 27:43.280]  Senator, he has no idea how I'd rule in that case and Senator, I'm not going to say anything
[27:43.280 --> 27:48.480]  here that would give anybody any idea how I'd rule in any case like that that could
[27:48.480 --> 27:52.960]  come before the Supreme Court or my court of the 10th Circuit, it would be grossly improper
[27:52.960 --> 27:58.160]  of a judge to do that, it would be a violation of the separation of powers and judicial independence
[27:58.160 --> 28:03.280]  if someone's sitting at this table in order to get confirmed, how to make promises or
[28:03.280 --> 28:07.880]  commitments about how they rule in a case that's currently pending and likely to make
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.560]  its way to the Supreme Court.
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.560]  Do you agree with that statement that under the Second Amendment, weapons that are most
[28:17.560 --> 28:24.320]  useful in military service, M-16 rifles and the like may be banned?
[28:24.320 --> 28:30.080]  Senator, Heller makes clear the standard that we judges are supposed to apply.
[28:30.080 --> 28:37.720]  The question is whether it's a gun in common use for self-defense and that may be subject
[28:37.720 --> 28:39.560]  to reasonable regulation.
[28:39.560 --> 28:41.560]  That's the test as I understand it.
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.680]  There's lots of ongoing litigation about which weapons qualify under those standards and
[28:47.680 --> 28:50.000]  I can't prejudge that litigation sitting here.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.760]  No, I'm just asking you, do you agree with this statement?
[28:52.760 --> 28:53.760]  Yes or no?
[28:53.760 --> 28:56.840]  Are the statements out of the Heller decision from the United States?
[28:56.840 --> 28:57.840]  Add justus Scalia's statement.
[28:57.840 --> 29:02.280]  Well, whatever's in Heller is the law and I follow the law.
[29:02.280 --> 29:06.440]  It's not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing, Senator, respectfully, it's a matter of it
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.800]  being the law and my job is to apply and enforce the law.
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.720]  Do you believe that there are ever situations where the cost to an employer, of an attorney
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.240]  to leave, can justify an employer asking only female applicants and not male applicants
[29:21.240 --> 29:22.440]  about family plans?
[29:22.440 --> 29:25.240]  Senator, those are not my words and I would never have said them.
[29:25.240 --> 29:26.240]  I didn't say that.
[29:26.240 --> 29:30.000]  I asked you if you agreed with this statement and I'm telling you I don't.
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.420]  But my view is very simple and that is that there is a cloud now hanging over the head
[29:36.420 --> 29:41.720]  of the president and while that's happening to have a lifetime appointment made by this
[29:41.720 --> 29:44.120]  president seems very unseemly.
[29:44.120 --> 30:01.360]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.360 --> 30:05.760]  Appearing on the Drudge Report this morning, potential smoking gun showed Obama administration
[30:05.760 --> 30:10.560]  despite on Trump team sources, Republican Congressional investigators expect a potential
[30:10.560 --> 30:16.000]  smoking gun establishing that the Obama administration, despite on the Trump transition team and possibly
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.640]  the president elect himself, Intelligence Committee chair David Nunes from California
[30:20.640 --> 30:24.440]  has said he expects that the NSA will provide him this smoking gun evidence.
[30:24.440 --> 30:28.360]  The intelligence has said to leave no doubt that the Obama administration in its closing
[30:28.360 --> 30:33.320]  days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect
[30:33.320 --> 30:34.880]  Trump according to sources.
[30:34.880 --> 30:36.880]  And basically it boils down to this.
[30:36.880 --> 30:41.280]  While it's legal for the deep state to collect intelligence on foreign targets, it's not
[30:41.280 --> 30:44.360]  legal for the names of US citizens to be unmasked.
[30:44.360 --> 30:47.480]  This was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports.
[30:47.480 --> 30:53.080]  Now looking back at Trump's March 4th wiretapping tweets, it seems he was right all along.
[30:53.080 --> 30:57.320]  Soon we will find out if Obama administration officials are too big to jail.
[30:57.320 --> 31:23.720]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly news.
[31:23.720 --> 31:28.200]  Former office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to
[31:28.200 --> 31:30.600]  the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:30.600 --> 31:35.600]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:35.600 --> 31:38.600]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.600 --> 31:40.800]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.800 --> 31:44.760]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400.
[31:44.760 --> 31:48.360]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.360 --> 31:51.920]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:51.920 --> 31:55.160]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.160 --> 32:01.600]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[32:01.600 --> 32:06.560]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:06.560 --> 32:09.880]  before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[32:09.880 --> 32:13.040]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com.
[32:13.040 --> 32:18.360]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and
[32:18.360 --> 32:22.760]  seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[32:22.760 --> 32:23.760]  Caveman.
[32:23.760 --> 32:27.640]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:27.640 --> 32:31.640]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:31.640 --> 32:34.280]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:34.280 --> 32:39.480]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[32:39.480 --> 32:43.760]  From the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[32:43.760 --> 32:47.440]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[32:47.440 --> 32:51.760]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:51.760 --> 32:55.400]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[32:55.400 --> 32:59.840]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and infowarslife.com
[32:59.840 --> 33:03.680]  today.
[33:03.680 --> 33:10.920]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[33:10.920 --> 33:13.320]  the mind of man.
[33:13.320 --> 33:26.840]  I want to run down the gauntlet of just over the top important news in the shower because
[33:26.840 --> 33:32.360]  we have Larry Clayman who of course has won a case, a major case, the only case won against
[33:32.360 --> 33:38.480]  the NSA for illegal spying, exposing that he's also connected to the NSA documents.
[33:38.480 --> 33:47.240]  He didn't release those to the public, that was our journalist and infowars DC chief Corsi
[33:47.240 --> 33:48.720]  and the press is the fourth of state.
[33:48.720 --> 33:49.720]  We have that right.
[33:49.720 --> 33:53.000]  As long as we don't give out people's personal info and hurt them and we didn't do that,
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.160]  we gave small snippets of the index of this database of people that were being surveilled
[33:58.160 --> 34:04.640]  that the FBI has had for years and is fully aware of and is not denied.
[34:04.640 --> 34:13.720]  And you notice that there has been almost no coverage of us breaking this last Sunday,
[34:13.720 --> 34:20.520]  six days ago, that the entire Trump family is being surveilled going back before Obama
[34:20.520 --> 34:28.000]  but intensified under Obama going right through 2015.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.480]  And that by the way is illegal spying, there weren't warrants on this.
[34:32.480 --> 34:35.720]  They're just targeting for the collection so they go, oh, it's not exactly, we're not
[34:35.720 --> 34:38.720]  going to listen to it or look at it right now so we're just going to go ahead and record
[34:38.720 --> 34:39.720]  it all.
[34:39.720 --> 34:40.720]  They're doing it to everybody.
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.320]  The last six years when they put that big Utah facility online and the other big one
[34:45.320 --> 34:48.600]  in San Antonio, they admit they can record everything now.
[34:48.600 --> 34:56.840]  All the calls, all the texts, all the faxes, just landlines, everything.
[34:56.840 --> 34:57.840]  They admit it.
[34:57.840 --> 34:59.320]  It's been a congressional hearings.
[34:59.320 --> 35:01.880]  Again, that's what's so frustrating about this.
[35:01.880 --> 35:04.080]  This is all admitted.
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.760]  I told you three weeks ago, it was foreign intelligence collecting and they were using
[35:08.760 --> 35:11.160]  it to spy on Trump when he made foreign calls.
[35:11.160 --> 35:13.040]  I told you, that's the law.
[35:13.040 --> 35:17.480]  I told you that the fact is they leaked it, that's what's illegal and they lied about
[35:17.480 --> 35:18.480]  what was in it.
[35:18.480 --> 35:20.200]  I'm going to stop right there.
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.040]  It's just when you watch CNN sit there and lie to their viewers and go, there's no spying.
[35:24.040 --> 35:25.040]  It's insane.
[35:25.040 --> 35:29.120]  He made it up when they just been saying they were spying.
[35:29.120 --> 35:35.480]  And then, oh my gosh, Fox News has the big scoop yesterday, the smoking gun.
[35:35.480 --> 35:39.160]  They were attacking Larry C. Johnson, their former commentator just a few days ago on
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.400]  Fox and CNN saying he just pulled it out of his rear end.
[35:44.400 --> 35:47.640]  Johnson was saying what's known at the CIA and NSA.
[35:47.640 --> 35:48.640]  He talked to his colleagues.
[35:48.640 --> 35:50.800]  He said, yes, they were ordered to target Trump.
[35:50.800 --> 35:54.200]  It's well known.
[35:54.200 --> 35:57.200]  And now he's been vindicated, vindicated.
[35:57.200 --> 35:58.560]  We've been vindicated.
[35:58.560 --> 35:59.560]  That's been vindicated.
[35:59.560 --> 36:00.560]  You've been vindicated.
[36:00.560 --> 36:06.160]  But see, if we don't have a voice to tell people that the sun came up this morning, they'll
[36:06.160 --> 36:09.680]  start teaching school kids that in the sun, you know, that it's a lemon or something up
[36:09.680 --> 36:10.680]  in the sky.
[36:10.680 --> 36:11.680]  I don't know.
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.760]  But we get you the best guess like Larry C. Johnson, former section chief in an analysis
[36:17.760 --> 36:19.840]  over a whole section of the CIA.
[36:19.840 --> 36:24.280]  Of course, we have the articles where CNN says he's crazy just two days ago.
[36:24.280 --> 36:26.000]  Oh, the next day, proven completely right.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.080]  He was always right.
[36:29.080 --> 36:34.200]  Bill Benny, former head of the NSA technical, the guy that actually ran it, that little
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.720]  politician Hayden, you see in a general outfit or an space command admiral outfit, you know,
[36:39.720 --> 36:46.280]  like he's about to be in the new Buckaroo Banzai movie or the new Star Wars.
[36:46.280 --> 36:47.280]  Bill Benny is joining us.
[36:47.280 --> 36:48.280]  Let's have a guess.
[36:48.280 --> 36:50.800]  We get you.
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.960]  Overhead, the guy that actually ran the NSA, one of the most famous code breakers and super
[36:55.960 --> 37:04.440]  mathematicians in history, they say he's up there with the top five, six people.
[37:04.440 --> 37:12.080]  Total machine got SWAT team rated for telling Congress under law that they were illegally
[37:12.080 --> 37:21.120]  surveilling Congress and then it came out William Benny's right and after he got SWAT
[37:21.120 --> 37:22.120]  team.
[37:22.120 --> 37:23.120]  Of course, other things happen to him.
[37:23.120 --> 37:24.120]  He doesn't talk about.
[37:24.120 --> 37:25.120]  That's what real men do.
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.000]  They just keep moving forward when you get poisoned.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.880]  But Bill Benny will be joining us.
[37:33.880 --> 37:37.720]  And then David Knight is going to host the fourth hour and Dr. Dick Beckett is still
[37:37.720 --> 37:38.720]  here.
[37:38.720 --> 37:40.840]  So I know they're also going to be shooting some other interviews, but I hope he'll join
[37:40.840 --> 37:44.120]  David Knight because that's just an hour wasn't enough of Dick Beckett's yesterday and those
[37:44.120 --> 37:48.320]  two are Knights of Scientist too and an engineer.
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.360]  So these guys certainly get along well.
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.160]  So I hope he's hosting the fourth hour with him today.
[37:55.160 --> 38:01.880]  And then Chris Tonto Peranto, one of the most famous war heroes, not just in this age, but
[38:01.880 --> 38:10.760]  in hundreds of years in America, who single-handedly with just what six other people took on conservatively
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.440]  300 combatants and killed most of them in Benghazi.
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.040]  He's going to be joining us because we put the call out to every week, have a veteran
[38:20.040 --> 38:26.600]  on or active duty folks as well, just to support the commander in chief and talk about how
[38:26.600 --> 38:27.600]  they think the country's going.
[38:27.600 --> 38:33.400]  Because you know, you got the former deputy head of the Defense Department, a political
[38:33.400 --> 38:36.880]  running around saying that they need to overthrow Trump and trying to organize it in the Washington
[38:36.880 --> 38:39.720]  post that the Pentagon.
[38:39.720 --> 38:45.400]  So the least our veterans can do is stand up and say, listen, this is our president.
[38:45.400 --> 38:46.400]  He's elected.
[38:46.400 --> 38:47.720]  We're not going to sit here and put up with this.
[38:47.720 --> 38:49.720]  We're not going to physically do anything offensively.
[38:49.720 --> 38:53.360]  But if you try to have martial law, or you kill Trump, you people that have all been
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.480]  calling for it, every single one of you that have been calling for the president to be
[38:56.480 --> 39:02.360]  killed or overthrown, you, by law, we will be then the official resistance to a foreign
[39:02.360 --> 39:03.440]  globalist coup.
[39:03.440 --> 39:06.360]  And I'm just telling you, I'm not organizing anything.
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.000]  I'm asking people that are experts in resisting this type of crap to say, look, they're organizing
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  it.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  I told them months ago, I said, they're going to build towards civil unrest, martial law,
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.680]  an attempt to overthrow the government.
[39:17.680 --> 39:19.640]  They're going to call it a civil emergency.
[39:19.640 --> 39:26.760]  And now they're calling for it all over CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Michael Moore, Rosie O'Donnell
[39:26.760 --> 39:31.480]  saying martial law, you know, they're saying kill Trump, overthrow Trump.
[39:31.480 --> 39:32.720]  This is talking points.
[39:32.720 --> 39:38.080]  They mean to do this.
[39:38.080 --> 39:39.080]  They mean to do this.
[39:39.080 --> 39:42.200]  So you understand everything I've told you is coming true.
[39:42.200 --> 39:44.360]  It's happening because I've studied military doctrine.
[39:44.360 --> 39:47.280]  I've studied historical overthrows of governments.
[39:47.280 --> 39:50.680]  Most of these analysts and people just go read a few books and then, you know, have a CIA
[39:50.680 --> 39:51.960]  title and think they're geniuses.
[39:51.960 --> 39:54.320]  I know what I'm talking about.
[39:54.320 --> 39:55.680]  I know their playbook.
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.600]  I know, and it's not that I'm Mr. Big Shot telling you that I'm telling you that because
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.520]  you've got to listen to me and the military's got to listen to me.
[40:04.520 --> 40:07.640]  And people in the intelligence agencies that are loyal to the Republic, and I know it's
[40:07.640 --> 40:12.440]  the majority of you, it's quite frankly, I used to get so mad at the agencies and all
[40:12.440 --> 40:16.000]  the military and police going along with the tyranny.
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.320]  They'd always say, change it on top.
[40:17.320 --> 40:18.320]  We're giving these orders.
[40:18.320 --> 40:19.320]  We don't like it either.
[40:19.320 --> 40:22.920]  What they're doing is running the good people out because we won't do this.
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.240]  It's a litmus test on purpose.
[40:24.240 --> 40:25.920]  And then they make us all get the blame.
[40:25.920 --> 40:28.320]  I said, well, let's see what you can do then.
[40:28.320 --> 40:29.320]  Wow.
[40:29.320 --> 40:31.040]  Look at the intel, the resistance.
[40:31.040 --> 40:37.040]  It was 40% of the victory was the intelligence agencies from the local police right up to
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.240]  the CIA and the NSA and the Defense Intelligence and the Army and the Marines just everywhere.
[40:42.240 --> 40:45.680]  I mean, look at all the Army colonels and Marine Corps colonels and generals we have
[40:45.680 --> 40:48.400]  on that blow the whistle on huge operations.
[40:48.400 --> 40:51.480]  That's who exposed Fast and Furious first before it was ever in the news was a Marine
[40:51.480 --> 40:54.000]  Corps officer out in Arizona.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.840]  He's been physically attacked.
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.840]  You name it.
[40:57.840 --> 40:58.840]  Death-threaded.
[40:58.840 --> 41:00.000]  He knows who did it.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.840]  The shipments going out of there of weapons from that Marine Corps base to Mexico and
[41:04.840 --> 41:09.880]  then shipped to the Middle East to Al Qaeda, Al Nuzra, ISIS.
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.320]  We told you about it a year before it came out in the news confirming everything he said.
[41:14.320 --> 41:17.460]  You just, you think we have like Marine Corps colonels and people on and they're just making
[41:17.460 --> 41:18.960]  stuff up on air?
[41:18.960 --> 41:22.320]  You think they're just pulling it out of the air?
[41:22.320 --> 41:23.320]  No, they're not.
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.360]  You think William Bennett, the former head of the NSA, you think he just pulls this
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.640]  out of the air because he wants to have them come after him and try to kill him and swat
[41:30.640 --> 41:35.320]  team him when he's in the shower because he told Congress what was happening?
[41:35.320 --> 41:36.640]  The Senate's being spied on.
[41:36.640 --> 41:37.640]  Boom!
[41:37.640 --> 41:38.640]  Swat team.
[41:38.640 --> 41:40.200]  The Senate is the government.
[41:40.200 --> 41:45.720]  You're not supposed to have the NSA and see how he's spying on the Senate.
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.760]  But they're doing it and they want to sit there and talk to us like we're stupid.
[41:49.760 --> 41:52.440]  So he's coming up.
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.120]  You know, Twitter blocks most of our articles from being shared now and they'll get real
[41:57.120 --> 41:58.640]  bad and they'll back off a while.
[41:58.640 --> 42:01.320]  They're testing them because when there's news about it and it ends up in newspapers,
[42:01.320 --> 42:04.840]  they pull back for a while while they're banning hundreds and hundreds of other accounts a
[42:04.840 --> 42:06.240]  day of people that are smaller.
[42:06.240 --> 42:07.440]  But together, you're huge.
[42:07.440 --> 42:08.440]  You're bigger than drudge.
[42:08.440 --> 42:09.440]  You're bigger than I am.
[42:09.440 --> 42:10.440]  You are the power.
[42:10.440 --> 42:12.440]  People say, we'll just leave Facebook.
[42:12.440 --> 42:17.640]  No, we've got to stay on it and force them to not let it go like Communist China who's
[42:17.640 --> 42:21.840]  telling them, since America will let you in.
[42:21.840 --> 42:27.240]  The Senate is saying, we'll give you access to the biggest market in the world for people.
[42:27.240 --> 42:33.880]  They're the second biggest economy, but biggest market in the world for minds, 1.3.5, 1.357
[42:33.880 --> 42:40.480]  million people in China, or China, like our beloved president says it, bing, bing, mong,
[42:40.480 --> 42:41.480]  bing, mong.
[42:41.480 --> 42:43.760]  That's a lot of them for fun.
[42:43.760 --> 42:49.560]  And they're saying, you oppress your people and we'll let you in.
[42:49.560 --> 42:50.920]  That's so fantastical.
[42:50.920 --> 42:52.640]  That's so nakedly evil.
[42:52.640 --> 42:55.360]  Oh, by the way, Microsoft's allowed in.
[42:55.360 --> 43:00.400]  They work very closely with a special Windows 10 that allows the Communist Chinese to spy
[43:00.400 --> 43:01.640]  on everyone in the country.
[43:01.640 --> 43:04.000]  It's their own little NSA update.
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.800]  China says, China says, thank you.
[43:10.800 --> 43:19.960]  So, let me tell you what else we got in the clubs coming up after this break.
[43:19.960 --> 43:20.960]  We knew it.
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.600]  Democrats openly put voter registration cards in the Islamist refugees they're bringing
[43:25.600 --> 43:29.960]  in, in the Democrat run towns, and admit they're having them vote, just like all those states
[43:29.960 --> 43:32.560]  trying to pass laws to let illegals vote.
[43:32.560 --> 43:38.920]  Then they sit there and they play stupid and say, nobody's ever had an illegal vote.
[43:38.920 --> 43:42.720]  And again, the poor illegals are under the globalist control because they get government
[43:42.720 --> 43:43.720]  money.
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.320]  They make them go vote five, 10 times to get their welfare check or let them stay in
[43:47.320 --> 43:48.320]  the country.
[43:48.320 --> 43:53.240]  They just go as little zombie bots to go and vote and vote, vote off a list of dead people
[43:53.240 --> 43:54.240]  in the newspaper.
[43:54.240 --> 43:55.240]  That's all they do.
[43:55.240 --> 43:59.440]  They take the dead people out of the newspaper, program, run a program of who is on the voter
[43:59.440 --> 44:00.440]  rolls.
[44:00.440 --> 44:01.440]  Okay, these people are all dead.
[44:01.440 --> 44:03.440]  Go vote here.
[44:03.440 --> 44:05.440]  That's all they did.
[44:05.440 --> 44:08.200]  Very simple.
[44:08.200 --> 44:10.080]  And they don't want laws so that can happen.
[44:10.080 --> 44:13.600]  That's how it works, just like I tell you how the NSA works, and then they all come out
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.640]  and say exactly what I told you years ago and months ago and weeks ago, because we're
[44:17.640 --> 44:22.600]  not just winging it and I'm not just up here imagining what it is and then it magically
[44:22.600 --> 44:23.600]  comes true.
[44:23.600 --> 44:28.600]  I'm telling you what is admitted fact.
[44:28.600 --> 44:31.200]  That's coming up.
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.760]  We also have what's up on DrudgeReport.com, an article by Paul Joseph Watson, and again
[44:36.760 --> 44:43.440]  I mentioned censorship.
[44:43.440 --> 44:47.480]  All over the internet, they have thousands of Facebook and Twitter accounts saying kill
[44:47.480 --> 44:48.480]  Donald Trump.
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.040]  Go after me, you name it.
[44:52.040 --> 44:54.480]  And some of these things have hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, and they
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.160]  let them sit there and say, we're going to kill Trump or we're going to overthrow America.
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.720]  Hell, they say it on national TV, Time Magazine calls for rioting and looting.
[45:02.720 --> 45:03.720]  So does Newsweek.
[45:03.720 --> 45:11.120]  Hunt and kill all white women, Facebook posts, deem not hate speech, infowars.com, shocking
[45:11.120 --> 45:17.200]  double standard of social network giant exposed, yet again, yeah, they let the Islamists call
[45:17.200 --> 45:18.320]  for whatever they want as well.
[45:18.320 --> 45:25.360]  It's just the craziest fomenting because here's the deal, they don't like abolitionists and
[45:25.360 --> 45:28.280]  Republican voters and people that weren't racist that can bring us all together.
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.600]  So they're trying to do all this racist stuff, the white people, the engineers are not the
[45:32.600 --> 45:39.080]  idiots, you know, people that are posting this crap, kill all the white women.
[45:39.080 --> 45:44.640]  They're allowing all that to try to get white people to go into their own circuitous areas
[45:44.640 --> 45:49.200]  and just retreat from society so they can basically balkanize everybody just like a
[45:49.200 --> 45:53.640]  prison, like I always say, with the Asians here, the Hispanics here, the whites here,
[45:53.640 --> 45:54.640]  the blacks here.
[45:54.640 --> 45:57.760]  And even if you're not a racist, you have to go be, if you're white or you're black,
[45:57.760 --> 46:00.880]  you have to go be with a supremacist group and get the supremacist tattoo or they kill
[46:00.880 --> 46:01.880]  you.
[46:01.880 --> 46:04.280]  Yeah, but it's a high security prison.
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.800]  Other ones, you just get your ass kicked unless you can beat the, you know, gang leader
[46:08.800 --> 46:11.480]  up and then the warden is going to put you in solitary confinement because he wants the
[46:11.480 --> 46:14.240]  big gang leader in control, that's how it runs the prison.
[46:14.240 --> 46:18.680]  They'll have three or four gang leaders, most areas don't have a big Asian population,
[46:18.680 --> 46:22.400]  so they'll, and they'll have the local gang leader is seen as the criminal government
[46:22.400 --> 46:23.400]  leader.
[46:23.400 --> 46:28.280]  Brzezinski wrote a book in 1977, I read it years ago, the Technotronic Era, where he
[46:28.280 --> 46:35.240]  admits that they control the criminal leaders.
[46:35.240 --> 46:36.240]  That's how it works too.
[46:36.240 --> 46:41.160]  When he saw me, I guess as a criminal leader, many times I was approached, but once in front
[46:41.160 --> 46:44.640]  of John Harmon, we had Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group on, that's running
[46:44.640 --> 46:45.800]  so much what we face today.
[46:45.800 --> 46:49.480]  And he said, listen, you already in the superclass, you've got a big group under you, you lead
[46:49.480 --> 46:53.200]  the opposition movement, just work with us and I'm telling you, it's going to be awesome.
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.000]  I'll come to New York next week, meet us, you know, come, come on, let's do it.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.480]  CFR, we're ready, we're ready, I'll just go to dinner and let's do it.
[46:59.480 --> 47:00.480]  And I said, nope.
[47:00.480 --> 47:01.480]  He goes, I just can't believe it.
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.800]  He said, I can't, no one says no to this because 99.99 percent of people never get
[47:05.800 --> 47:06.800]  that call folks.
[47:06.800 --> 47:07.800]  I wasn't honored.
[47:07.800 --> 47:09.240]  Of course, I'm effective.
[47:09.240 --> 47:13.680]  Of course they tried to recruit me into an anti-American globalist organization.
[47:13.680 --> 47:18.160]  I'm an American, I'm completely loyal to liberty and freedom of my family and you.
[47:18.160 --> 47:22.840]  It wasn't hard to say no to, oh, I can go be, you know, at the Kissinger Group.
[47:22.840 --> 47:26.120]  Oh my gosh, that's the top of the CFR, by the way.
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.560]  See, everybody else is clamoring to get into the CFR.
[47:28.560 --> 47:33.960]  I would just bypass the whole CFR and go right to the top.
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.000]  And they told me why, they said your clarity, your focus, the way you cut through to people,
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.240]  you could, you could, you could go to the stars or go on this crusade that's going nowhere.
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.920]  I got told basically that exact same thing more than 15 times by a different globalist.
[47:48.920 --> 47:54.200]  Alex, you can take over the world with us or you'll be destroyed.
[47:54.200 --> 47:57.640]  Well, let's see what happens to the New World Order.
[47:57.640 --> 47:59.400]  What's being destroyed right now?
[47:59.400 --> 48:00.400]  You're not laughing now, are you?
[48:00.400 --> 48:03.480]  But see, they already knew the potential, they already knew how precarious their position
[48:03.480 --> 48:04.480]  was.
[48:04.480 --> 48:05.480]  That's why they were trying to buy me off.
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.840]  And so many other people that sold out willingly, but see, we've already changed the world.
[48:09.840 --> 48:12.360]  So now we've made it safe for people to tell the truth.
[48:12.360 --> 48:16.840]  And so all these other organizations and groups and people are now able to fall on our footsteps
[48:16.840 --> 48:18.120]  that weren't bad people.
[48:18.120 --> 48:20.000]  They just didn't have the trailblazing spirit.
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.200]  And so now everybody from Sean Hannity, the Russian body, you name it, can sound just
[48:24.200 --> 48:25.200]  like Alex Jones.
[48:25.200 --> 48:28.680]  And I don't get mad at that because we're winning now.
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.520]  That's how I win is when everything we talk about becomes the common culture.
[48:33.520 --> 48:34.840]  And that's what they say in the newspapers.
[48:34.840 --> 48:35.840]  Look at Trump.
[48:35.840 --> 48:36.840]  Look at the Republicans.
[48:36.840 --> 48:37.840]  Look at them.
[48:37.840 --> 48:38.840]  They've got to stop this.
[48:38.840 --> 48:41.000]  They've got to stop picking up what Alex Jones says and what Drudge says, because if that
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.800]  ever happens, it's over for us.
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.560]  But there's one Achilles' Hill to that, and that's our funding.
[48:47.560 --> 48:50.920]  I want to salute and thank all of you that buy the great products at m4store.com.
[48:50.920 --> 48:57.440]  But we know from who does visit and who does buy, it's a fraction of a percentage of people
[48:57.440 --> 48:59.880]  that actually purchase products from us.
[48:59.880 --> 49:03.240]  If just one or two percent of you out there listening would buy water filtration, you
[49:03.240 --> 49:04.240]  already need.
[49:04.240 --> 49:08.240]  We have the best systems, vetted systems, non-GMI early on seeds, high-quality supplements,

[49:18.320 --> 49:24.560]  just like our information's cutting edge and very risky and dangerous, we will admit
[49:24.560 --> 49:25.560]  it.
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.520]  Our products are amazing and high-quality and aren't risky.
[49:28.520 --> 49:34.640]  You can go read from third-party sites, the thousands of reviews, 4.8 is the average.
[49:34.640 --> 49:37.760]  Thousands of reviews total, the different products.
[49:37.760 --> 49:40.000]  Sign up for the auto-ship and additional 10 percent off.
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.880]  We have got specials on high-quality, storeable food, 30 to 40 percent off that ends this

[49:50.720 --> 49:55.480]  the umbrella site.

[50:03.720 --> 50:06.040]  over a month, but this was a limited run.
[50:06.040 --> 50:09.720]  We have problems getting the tubes and getting lined up with the big manufacturer.
[50:09.720 --> 50:13.080]  That's the biggest organic manufacturer in the country for toothpaste.
[50:13.080 --> 50:14.600]  Everybody knows who I'm talking about.
[50:14.600 --> 50:15.600]  That's this.
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.160]  It's made on their line, their people, super high-quality, we just add what we want into
[50:18.160 --> 50:19.160]  it.
[50:19.160 --> 50:20.160]  That's what we do.
[50:20.160 --> 50:23.160]  We come with our own products or we piggyback and private label other super high-quality
[50:23.160 --> 50:25.280]  stuff and then discount it.

[50:30.800 --> 50:32.000]  Victory Series 2 is in.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.680]  We sold out of the Donald Trump victory.
[50:34.680 --> 50:35.760]  There's even less of these.
[50:35.760 --> 50:41.840]  This is a smaller edition of the Minuteman, the classic Minuteman edition, true art laser
[50:41.840 --> 50:52.480]  inscribed on the lower systems for m4s or 223, you know, m16 semi-automatic type variant
[50:52.480 --> 50:53.480]  systems.

[51:00.800 --> 51:04.680]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books
[51:04.680 --> 51:08.480]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this
[51:08.480 --> 51:10.040]  law in our lives?

[51:19.360 --> 51:20.360]  in our lives.
[51:20.360 --> 51:24.680]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative
[51:24.680 --> 51:26.160]  power of the universe.

[51:29.560 --> 51:34.920]  Nearly one-third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[51:34.920 --> 51:35.920]  One-third.
[51:35.920 --> 51:37.960]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[51:37.960 --> 51:38.960]  Is America next?
[51:38.960 --> 51:41.120]  Hi, I'm the owner of Enfield All Body Armor.

[51:46.600 --> 51:47.600]  They have prepared.

[52:00.280 --> 52:01.600]  It's called the Deep State.

[52:06.440 --> 52:10.400]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.

[53:59.400 --> 54:21.680]  Chris Peranto, known as Tonto, former Army Ranger, CIA, Benghazi, he's going to be joining
[54:21.680 --> 54:23.920]  us for, you know, the film 13 Hours.
[54:23.920 --> 54:27.640]  If you haven't seen it, I don't normally watch war movie films, because I know it's
[54:27.640 --> 54:33.240]  just, you know, usually a joke compared to the real thing, but this, that movie is very
[54:33.240 --> 54:38.480]  accurate because they followed it according to the victims of it or the survivors of it.
[54:38.480 --> 54:41.440]  And so we're not talking about that film so much.
[54:41.440 --> 54:47.120]  He's just coming on to get into the president and the attacks on the president so much more.
[54:47.120 --> 54:50.640]  You know, more and more, I'm personally on my Twitter feed at real Alex Jones.
[54:50.640 --> 54:53.200]  I was late coming to Twitter.
[54:53.200 --> 54:55.400]  I never really used it the first five years it was around.
[54:55.400 --> 54:56.920]  We've been using it a few years now.
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.760]  We've got about a million followers on our different accounts or, well, I guess we count
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.960]  Watson almost two million, but we have better engagement than the BBC, especially on Watson's
[55:05.960 --> 55:06.960]  account.
[55:06.960 --> 55:07.960]  So I'm trying to learn how it works.
[55:07.960 --> 55:11.240]  And I know libertarians and conservatives aren't really so much on Twitter, but James
[55:11.240 --> 55:17.160]  Woods is and he's put up some amazing images of a conservative women versus liberal women.
[55:17.160 --> 55:21.520]  I don't want to be mean to liberal women, but this is pretty much what they look like
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.800]  if you go to real Alex Jones and we put that up on screen and it makes me wonder just what
[55:26.800 --> 55:27.800]  is the difference?
[55:27.800 --> 55:29.840]  What's happening with this?
[55:29.840 --> 55:30.840]  Why is this the phenomenon?
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.120]  Because I've seen it at the inauguration versus the people trying to attack everybody
[55:35.120 --> 55:36.800]  and what was going on.
[55:36.800 --> 55:41.480]  Also we just tweeted another image he had, it's a conservative women versus liberal women
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.360]  where you can't really do the caption, but it's a so-called liberal Democrat voter looking
[55:45.360 --> 55:49.080]  at a Donald Trump female voter.
[55:49.080 --> 55:53.440]  And I want to do a caption contest actually with this image.
[55:53.440 --> 55:58.480]  You're going to have to do your own caption on this one.
[55:58.480 --> 56:05.440]  Is she envious or is she, I think she just loves God's work.
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.760]  Anyways, continuing ladies and gentlemen, we should have a caption contest with that
[56:09.760 --> 56:15.400]  one, because these images are just powerful and I'm not doing this to be mean, it's just
[56:15.400 --> 56:16.400]  it's true.
[56:16.400 --> 56:19.560]  You see it in the real world, so if I see some stereotype that's real, I'll tend to
[56:19.560 --> 56:20.560]  go with it.
[56:20.560 --> 56:27.600]  Here's another interesting issue, copying their 1960s issue is God Dead is also on our
[56:27.600 --> 56:34.960]  Twitter account of the real Alex Jones and it's a red background for Time Magazine.
[56:34.960 --> 56:37.920]  You guys can scroll down it's there and it says, is truth dead?
[56:37.920 --> 56:42.120]  Well in the 60s they said it's God Dead, it's truth dead and I tweeted, the truth is alive
[56:42.120 --> 56:47.320]  and it's living quite nicely at infowars.com forward slash show.
[56:47.320 --> 56:53.960]  Ladies and elitism are fighting for their lives at time, so I love how the president
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.240]  did an interview with Time like they're big, they're not big, infowars.com online is way
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.880]  bigger than Time Magazine online, their circulation isn't that big, nobody hardly reads them now
[57:02.880 --> 57:09.120]  and on top of it, they then call him a liar during the whole article, oh he's crazy, he
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.360]  said he was getting spied on, it's all proven right, oh he's crazy, he says this and that
[57:14.360 --> 57:19.120]  and everything they say he's lying about is admitted fact, that's so crazy, but they
[57:19.120 --> 57:24.080]  think they're readers, they bet everything, I've got so much content I could talk for
[57:24.080 --> 57:26.800]  a hundred years here, but I just keep repeating the same thing, they think you're dumb, they
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.880]  think you're dumb because everything is betting like Gruber said on you not having an attention
[57:31.880 --> 57:37.080]  span and being dumb as he said it, Zuckerberg said thank God you're such dumb Fs that you
[57:37.080 --> 57:42.360]  trust him, I couldn't imagine thinking of my listeners and supporters and like thinking
[57:42.360 --> 57:49.640]  badly of you, when you're great people you support us, you're how I put food on my children's
[57:49.640 --> 57:56.640]  table, but I guess when you abuse people and steal their data and screw them over and do
[57:56.640 --> 58:02.360]  all this, that's the attitude, that's the disconnect, that's a sociopath or a psychopath
[58:02.360 --> 58:07.920]  for you, coming up, hunt and kill all white women, Facebook says that's fine but you can't
[58:07.920 --> 58:13.080]  support the president and we also have other reports that have gotten to Democrat run cities,
[58:13.080 --> 58:18.680]  push plans to let non-citizens vote and then Chris Tonto-Paranto, the next segment, joins
[58:18.680 --> 58:26.040]  us and a lot more, then William Benny, former head of the NSA technical, Larry Klayman on
[58:26.040 --> 58:31.560]  the NSA leaks and so much more, but hey again, we're proving right, Trump's proving right,
[58:31.560 --> 58:36.400]  he was being spied on exactly like we said, but they all went, it's reposterous, it's
[58:36.400 --> 58:40.680]  ridiculous, rub in what liars they are, just like Trump was going to lose the election,
[58:40.680 --> 58:46.280]  just like you know, it's all their disgrace group, doubled down on fraud, infowarstore.com,
[58:46.280 --> 58:51.120]  we need your support, big sales in this weekend.
[58:51.120 --> 58:57.120]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[58:57.120 --> 59:05.160]  probiotic, we wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics
[59:05.160 --> 59:13.080]  that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[59:18.040 --> 59:24.720]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[59:24.720 --> 59:29.280]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[59:29.280 --> 59:31.800]  probiotic on the market.
[59:31.800 --> 59:36.880]  For your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today
[59:36.880 --> 59:40.480]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[59:40.480 --> 59:44.720]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public,
[59:44.720 --> 1:00:04.440]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:33.560]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:53.680]  So when President Trump put in his racist travel ban, we put out a call to action to
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:59.360]  Democrats across the state saying help us create welcome baskets for refugee and immigrant
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:03.040]  families who are making Nebraska their home.
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:09.640]  And the response has been incredibly overwhelming and just really heartwarming that so many
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:16.360]  Nebraskans across our state sent in these baskets with just the basic stuff that you
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:23.000]  need when you are starting a new home, whether it's diapers and toilet paper and towels,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:29.440]  but there's also dishes and blankets and rice cookers, utensils, and so we've been
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:36.640]  doing this for the last about a month and a half and this isn't even all of the baskets.
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:43.640]  We have a tremendous amount of baskets inside the office as well, but this is just what
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:45.200]  Democrats do, right?
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:49.840]  We not only keep elected officials accountable and we run for office ourselves, but we also
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:55.000]  make sure that we're connecting to our community on the issues that deeply affect all of us
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:02.480]  and we make sure that we had individuals write a little note to the families and then inside
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:07.320]  each basket there's also a letter from the Nebraska Democratic Party welcoming the family
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:08.320]  to Nebraska.
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:13.040]  It's signed by me as chair of the party and then we include a sticker in there for them
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:18.480]  to put on their car and also includes a voter registration form and just has our contact
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:21.560]  information in case they want to reach out and have any questions.
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:26.560]  So that's the gateway pundit man they do a great job just constantly staying on things
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.300]  going and finding clips of the Democrats bragging themselves that they're trying to get the
[1:02:31.300 --> 1:02:35.120]  refugees they're bringing in to go vote illegally.
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:41.720]  And see it's so ubiquitous, it's so admitted inside the Democratic Party that they're trying
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:47.400]  to pass laws in Nebraska, in Illinois, in California, in Texas, hell, everywhere.
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:51.600]  17 states just last year tried to pass laws, some of them passed them and they went to
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:55.080]  governors and governors couldn't sign them because it was so illegal, even Democratic
[1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:58.000]  governors like Jerry Brown.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.840]  So they just say we're having illegals vote, we're having foreigners vote that they just
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:03.840]  got here.
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:10.120]  You know day one you show up here as a refugee here go vote and they brag about it and then
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:16.320]  they say on the news Trump is insane saying the Democrats are organizing foreigners, illegals
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:17.640]  and refugees to vote.
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:21.600]  How crazy is he next you'll say the NSA was spying on him.
[1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:27.400]  It's like I just read it in the newspaper you said you were you say you have sources
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:29.440]  I say it's the illegal leak.
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:30.440]  We never said that.
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:34.320]  Oh, here's hundreds of articles.
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:40.240]  It's like they just have no rules that just like mentally ill or they're like delusional
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:47.840]  because they just because I guess their constituents on average really are just totally dumbed down.
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:51.800]  Totally dumbed down.
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:58.440]  And so they think all the rest of us it'd be like if you were picking on and beating
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:03.160]  up blind people when people are correct visually impaired it's okay to brain damage my with
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:08.720]  vaccines just don't call them blind but blind folks it's okay to you know go out and beat
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:11.960]  up blind people I guess to see they can't see it's the same deal but you come up and
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:15.720]  punch me in the nose I'm not blind and it's not okay to beat up people that are blind.
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:21.320]  The point is they act like all the rest of us are mentally handicapped like their constituents
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:24.000]  or mentally ill chip on the shoulder weirdos.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.480]  It doesn't work like that.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.480]  So the article is at drugreport.com we've linked to it and then police dot com Nebraska
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:37.200]  Democrat Party includes voter registration forms in refugee welcome baskets but Trump's
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:41.400]  completely insane none of this is going on.
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:47.200]  We'll be back on the other side with Chris Oronto also known as Tonto on the other side
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:51.480]  one of the main heroes they're all heroes have been gauzing and he's even bigger hero
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:05:00.960]  for being a whistleblower in the face of Hillary's lies we'll talk to him straight ahead.
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:05.640]  Appearing on the drug report this morning potential smoking gun showed Obama administration
[1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:11.440]  spite on Trump team sources Republican congressional investigators expect a potential smoking gun
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:15.840]  establishing that the Obama administration spite on the Trump transition team and possibly
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:20.440]  the president elect himself intelligence committee chair David Nunes from California
[1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.800]  has said he expects that the NSA will provide him this smoking gun evidence the intelligence
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:29.720]  is said to leave no doubt that the Obama administration in its closing days was using the cover of
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:33.800]  legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect Trump according
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:38.240]  to sources and basically it boils down to this while it's legal for the deep state to
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:43.000]  collect intelligence on foreign targets it's not legal for the names of us citizens to
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.800]  be unmasked this was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports now looking back
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:53.160]  at Trump's March 4th wiretapping tweets it seems he was right all along soon we will

[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:35.520]  the front lines of the info war well the head of the house intelligence committee Devin
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.040]  Nunes has come out and said I've seen all the proof from all the different agencies
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:43.560]  of course the president was under surveillance just as he said they were unlawfully using
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:48.640]  foreign intelligence gathered on phone calls he was using a staff was using in the transition
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:53.120]  team as they're supposed to do to politically spy on him and then claim they had evidence
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:57.480]  that he was this russian agent but there was no evidence there so trump demanded it come
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:01.000]  out and pointed out it was illegal to leak it they said we never spied on you thinking
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.800]  we have no memory they're betting everything on that just like gruber said with obama
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:11.960]  care and now we've got two days ago on the one year anniversary of the brussels belgium
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:16.560]  attack we got a bunch of people getting run over and killed stabbed to death and members
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:25.920]  of parliament saying don't say it's islamic it's just crazy and now we've got three million
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:31.040]  more islamicist quote refugees the un's trying to force europe to bring in they want hundreds
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:36.320]  of thousands more to be brought in here we just played the democratic party with the
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:40.320]  syrian refugees coming in giving them voter registration cards there's so much to talk
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:43.440]  about the point is there's a lot of special hundreds think this country belongs to them
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:48.160]  they've overrun it they've taken control of it but the good news is the sleeping giant
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:52.440]  that is america of every race color and creed we're all americans we bleed red blood we're
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:58.960]  one race on this planet are waking up to it and it's a beautiful thing michael more came
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:03.880]  out again yesterday and so we need a civil emergency and to overthrow president trump
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:07.720]  you see it all over the news killing have marshal law roseo donnell you have the former
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:12.920]  deputy head of the defense department in the news going to the pentagon trying to shop
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:17.800]  the idea of the military overthrowing the president that's so illegal folks that it
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:21.760]  makes my head spin and it's a bunch of foreign interest in the communist chinese coming in
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:26.320]  to help censor facebook you cannot make this up so i i just talked to some military guys
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:31.160]  i know we happen to know chris tonto peranto of course one of the big heroes and survivors
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:36.200]  of what happened in ben gazi and of course lion eyes properly so in the new film thirteen
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:40.600]  hours it's a big hit and so amazing to ask what do you think we should do well say we
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:45.520]  support the president and talk about if they're calling for military operations against the
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:50.240]  president we're not calling for anything offensive but we should start a discussion about the
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:54.800]  left thinking and soros doubling the amount of money to these groups to kill cops and
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:58.400]  burn down cities they're planning something so so chris we're gonna skip this break so
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:01.880]  you have more time thank you for joining us and coming on obviously everything you've
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:07.920]  done chris tonto peranto dot com i've kind of set the table the last four minutes where
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:14.200]  are we going with this i honestly i think right now it's just a lot of uh lib live talk
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:18.720]  i i it'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to just try to start there's some
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:23.560]  civil war going on i mean you've got guys like myself you've got plenty of contractors
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.000]  out there that are back home now plenty of person people like myself that are patriots
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.800]  that that aren't gonna stand aside and let some coup if you want to call it that take
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:38.280]  over um and also just to strengthen numbers and i'll give it to you live you want to come
[1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:41.160]  out you better be a hundred of you against one of me because that's what's going to take
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:46.320]  it there are a lot of me's out there so i i don't think it's realistic i think again
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:49.840]  it's a lot of threats and the libs do that they they are a lot of talk when an action
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:55.560]  comes and it comes actually picking up a gun and doing something uh i think if they were
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:59.400]  more inclined to protect this country you'd probably see more of them joining the military
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:03.680]  joining a law enforcement and uh and again so i i just i see there's a lot of a lot
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:07.840]  of bs a lot of just a tough talk at this point in time but if it comes to this not going
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:13.320]  to be tough talk believe me people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:19.040]  at you so i just warn them don't don't just just stop that that that bs and and and put
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:22.600]  a cork in it right now before it really ends up to getting to something that they really
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:27.360]  don't want to get into well chris that's exactly why as this rhetoric heated up i wanted to
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.600]  get you on because you're somebody with just a few other guys or some of them died unfortunately
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:35.760]  took on hundreds and hundreds of people and two different you know major you know battle
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:40.740]  scenes under 13 hours of admitted stand down you just have the physical courage and one
[1:12:40.740 --> 1:12:45.840]  of the most amazing alamos where some people actually made it out or a 300 where a few people
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:50.520]  actually made it so i mean it's beyond that you actually survived at a 300 type uh you
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:56.800]  know scenario but where it was just six against 300 or 500 uh but looking at this that's why
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.720]  i wanted to get you to talk about this as an expert on it uh because they seem confident
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:06.120]  and i agree it's a lot of talk but they're really trying to organize it and i understand
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:10.840]  i understand trump's resistance to stand up to this because it'll make him look like a
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:15.000]  fascist but when they're openly calling for his death everywhere and and my death and
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.240]  everybody else and it's just horrible at a certain point it becomes dereliction of duty
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:22.920]  if somebody doesn't get indicted if somebody doesn't get in trouble you know when when
[1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:29.000]  bow wow you know says i want to kidnap and rape and enslave the first lady or when uh
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.360]  uh you know his his uncle comes out snoop dog and says i want to kill trump puts a music
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:38.560]  video up we know he's a coward won't do it but he's trying to activate other mentally
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:42.880]  ill people so so that's why i'm so concerned that's true i i i you have a good point there
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:47.440]  and in the past if you did that then the secret service be knocking at your door and possibly
[1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:51.560]  you'd be going to prison i i think that needs to happen i think it needs to return there
[1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:56.360]  needs to there does need to be an example set whether it be snoop dog or somebody else
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:59.600]  out there where you're going to say you're going to kill the president that's a threat
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:05.160]  that is a terroristic threat at this point and the secret service fb i local law enforcement
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:08.640]  somebody needs to be knocking on the doors and pulling these guys in handcuffs and honestly
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:13.040]  if if it is a a star and i hate to use the word hollywood star but if that's what you
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.200]  want to call yourselves a star's you know tnz needs to be there too to make an example
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:21.600]  out of you an example needs to be made and and i don't have a problem of trump decided
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:25.360]  to do that and he shouldn't be called the fastest that that's the one you don't threaten
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:28.560]  to kill the president united states you don't do that in the past you've never done it
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:33.280]  if you do do it there are repercussions to it and i i think he he does at this point
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.400]  in time or somebody within the just session somebody within the doj needs to take this
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.320]  upon themselves and go ahead and do the right thing and arrest somebody make an example
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:48.160]  out of somebody and make it a public example and you know if we'll see what happens you
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.440]  but you can't keep letting it go you're correct you've got to lance that blister eventually
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:55.840]  if not it's going to get infected you got to do it and if you don't it's just going
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:59.840]  to get worse and worse and worse so i i do agree i do agree at this point with the threats
[1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:03.200]  to the president but again do i think that they're going to come out and actually start
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:08.960]  an all-out war a civil war in the united states of america they'd be well-earned to not do
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:13.600]  that i mean i just showed i mean i totally agree with what you're saying about the battle
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:18.320]  space we have the right we're americans 99 percent of the patriots are you know obviously
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:23.200]  with the president he's executing like no president seen on his promises it's almost
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:26.800]  unbelievable it's so good and so it'd be one thing if he was like selling us out to farm
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:30.880]  powers or something and that brings us to the next point what do you make of now newness
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.960]  coming on saying no they were surveilling him basically illegally the surveillance was legal
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:38.880]  because it was overseas but they were using it domestically the democratic party during
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:43.520]  this transition and then this claim that he's a russian agent securing our borders building
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:48.720]  up our military turning our coal back on that actually decimates the russian gas exports i
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:53.280]  mean really if you look at what trump's doing he's dominating he is he's doing it i love how you said
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:57.520]  he's doing exactly what he said there's no president i think that's coming the last i
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:02.560]  i know in the last eight years for sure but the last uh you know 12 16 years ago was great but
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:07.280]  he didn't deliver like he took him three years to deliver a recovery trumps on a 50 days yes he's
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:10.960]  been outstanding and i have respect for that whether i agree with the policies or not he's
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:17.680]  doing what he said he was gonna do and that's fantastic um as for as newness i i i know congressman
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.160]  newness a congressman newness is actually a friend a congressman newness has always said
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:25.840]  what he meant he's always been honest with everything that he's had to do with myself and
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:29.760]  he just comes off as very a lot of courage very honorable he's the only guy to admit the truth
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:34.880]  when they all know the truth and and so if he's saying it i i'll give it 99.9 percent that that
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:39.360]  thing is going on and as far as then doing it legally and then doing an elite what it is they're
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:44.240]  doing something illegally but pulling illegal things off of it that's typical ci at the moment
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:47.760]  Pompeo needs to clean house there they need to come in and see what was actually going on there
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:52.080]  needs to be heads to roll at the agency because what they were doing they they were getting
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:58.240]  information about trump and it was it was in my opinion that's illegal you don't do that whether
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:03.280]  it's with a you're doing an illegal act a legal action going to foreign powers but you're masking
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:09.520]  an illegal action by doing that well that's that's illegal isn't it doesn't whether it's still legal
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:15.680]  so my opinion is again Pompeo needs to get in there and take care of the agency and find out
[1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:22.960]  where what was going on and see if and see if there is actual basis to to get somebody arrested
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:27.840]  get some charges against somebody within the intelligence community and congressmen unions
[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:32.400]  i think will pursue that i i really do he's a pit bull and he will continue to pursue
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:36.960]  until he has he's run out of options he did that with us as best he could when he was under
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:40.720]  mike rogers on that house until subcommittee and i thought he did a fantastic job now he's the head
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:46.160]  of the committee exactly if that says anything about how uh how honest and this man is and his
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:50.240]  integrity so i just i leave it in the congressmen union's hands he's a subject matter expert when
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:54.960]  it comes to this and i think he can continue to pursue it and he will come to a good resolution
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:18:01.360]  if people within this the uh trump administration sessions and others will back him he has a good
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:06.080]  attorney general that can help him out where in our case we didn't have a good a good attorney
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:11.760]  general twice we had air colder and then literally of course we're gonna back us at all so um uh but
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:17.680]  i think i think he has the opportunity here to to come in and uh again set examples so it doesn't
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:23.520]  happen again chris peranto knows tonto i'm gonna go over as bob most people know who he is um there's
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.600]  a lot of secret wars that have gone on where some similar things happen but one of the most famous
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:32.720]  whether it was secret or or or public uh you know firefights where you guys are completely over
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:36.560]  overrun i know a lot of guys some of the guys didn't make it back so you don't want to say you were the
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:40.720]  you know you're one of the top guys in this but you know they all signaled the fact that you were
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:44.720]  yeah you know one of the guys that was the most effective in that hellish uh you know situation
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:48.480]  that took place and you didn't want us to plug this but i'm gonna do it you've got the ranger way
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:52.960]  new uh book uh being released in may promise you'll come back for that also you have the new
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:58.480]  firearm training dvd uh that's what i want to watch is that available at chris tonto peranto
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:03.680]  yeah it is all this and this stuff i hate doing i'll be honest alex i i can't stand it doesn't
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:07.600]  matter though if we don't support ourselves we're not going to have a voice people should get all
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:12.240]  this we have to build our own economy and i appreciate that and but yes you can get it all
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:17.200]  there and and i'm back in the training area back with farms and stuff i enjoy doing but we all
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:21.360]  need this you obviously know what you're doing surviving one of the most out you know a totally
[1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:26.240]  overrun operations ever yes yes sir i just i i'm sometimes it's better to be lucky than good and
[1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:30.640]  i was surrounded by a great freaking team i had two navy seals and three marines with me too and
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:34.400]  you know the the bottom line is you never gave up but the survivors all contributed and they say
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:38.880]  you're they're all heroes they say though that you really uh for the whole nine yards really did
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:42.880]  the i mean you're the hero of the movie why is that i i think is because i probably have the
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:47.600]  biggest personality i'm the biggest smartass how about that people people tend to gravitate
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:53.040]  towards the guy that's outspoken and that's me um and also yeah i i i i had no problem
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:57.600]  um if i was gonna die that night i was gonna die i think of anybody that gets out there and
[1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:01.200]  was worried about dying in the line of fire then they probably need to get out line of fire
[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:05.120]  you're you need to get out there to sacrifice yourself selfless service give of yourself
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:08.560]  kind of like we're doing you're put yourself on the forefront i'm sure you get threats daily
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:13.200]  because of what you do but that is important you need to be able to say hey don't get stronger
[1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:17.200]  though i've had more than threats they've run all sorts of operations against us like a movie
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:21.760]  but i actually get stronger when it's really weird i like the worst it gets the better i get
[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:26.080]  that's good that means that means that you have that that never quit that never quit mentality
[1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:30.720]  that you're going to win any battle and that's what you needed and that's that's i was lucky to
[1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:34.880]  have a father that raised me that way and lucky to be at a range of a time with the 75th second
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:39.280]  battalion that that teaches you that and then to be in there that night with that with the great
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:43.040]  team that that i knew was not going to quit on me so i was going to quit on them it's just
[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:48.400]  called although comes back to teamwork and and it comes back to never giving up synergy that's
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:52.320]  exactly what it is and use that big words i can see i don't know those big words oh yeah right
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:58.560]  but no it's like the interconnectedness because you all amplify each other exactly no that's
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:04.080]  the spirit isn't it if it comes back to the it comes back to having that faith and it's spirit
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:08.560]  is the perfect word for for you atheists out there guess what there are no atheists and foxholes
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:12.080]  you guys out there is something that are better and bigger than you that you need to
[1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:16.720]  reply spirit is the spiritual wi-fi and then it's what are you turning into that it's real
[1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:21.040]  and people don't know it they don't i mean how sick do you get with guys in an eight hour
[1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:27.360]  firefight like that you know i you get so the blessing that night more than anything was that
[1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:31.440]  we could answer each other's questions before it even happened it just blessed to have those 30
[1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:36.480]  that those 30 days that we were just there together so um myself and boon though very
[1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:41.040]  blessed to have him in there him and i'd been working together for 10 years so how lucky is
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:46.080]  that to have that one of my best friends up there in the rooftop with me basically slaying folks
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:50.240]  all night that we're trying to get up on our compound again sometimes it's better to be
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.560]  lucky and good and but sometimes faith is there and god takes care of you but providence had a
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:59.600]  hand on that night it definitely did and some of you would make it out to tell the truth definitely
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:04.560]  and and some of us were sacrificed themselves give the ron and bub give the ultimate sacrifice
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:09.760]  and they are they are the heroes i'm no hero the guys that survived are no heroes those two are
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:13.360]  the heroes because they gave everything so we could come home well as they were here today
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:16.960]  though they'd say everybody was together and you're still alive through you through everybody
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:21.760]  right now yes sir yes sir and that's why we're here i'm able to continue to talk and continue to
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:27.120]  take on to take on the and i love how you say islamists and liberalists i love how you put
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:32.800]  that is at the end because i have served with islamist muslim in kandahar in in cobble that
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:36.960]  have actually been more patriotic than some of these liberalists here in the united states
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:42.080]  exactly we're not attacking muslims in general but the radical form that the left is allied with
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:47.360]  and pushing why the hell would the leftist want to want to join with the worst bohavia
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:52.000]  south there that are bullying muslims all over the world and you saw right there with your
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:56.960]  you threw out before i came on uh it's all about elections it's all about power who's got the
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:23:02.880]  democrats for those who just joined us handing out a publicly in their own video to the muslims
[1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:07.840]  coming in from syria giving them voter registration cards telling them to illegally vote i mean what
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:15.600]  uh what what the arrogance it's it's shameful hey if doing what they're doing it would be great if
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:19.840]  they do it throw in those uh voter cards here's a voter registration card yeah give them their
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:26.000]  baskets don't make it illegal you know it it's it's sad that that there's still people out there
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.560]  that don't see it that way well tonto in the six seven minutes we've got left i can't wait
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:34.160]  to your book comes out folks should get the farm train duty because i'm having to get back in the
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:38.160]  farms myself i should be decent that i'm having to get back into it because half the time i can't
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:42.320]  sit inside of a barn anymore you know it's a thousand yards away but i mean all this stuff's
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:47.520]  going on here and there's so much to cover just what is front and center in your heart in your
[1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:51.840]  mind i mean i'm not the vets when i ask vets to speak up for trump it's not that they haven't
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:57.440]  done more than anybody we admire them we support them this is the battle for the real homeland
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:02.240]  politically and i know we can say oh the leftists are all talks and kill trump do all this but
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:08.000]  they're so crazy you know even a you know even a lobotomized pig sometimes can you know
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.880]  you know get something done yeah and and and they're just trying to activate all these crazies and
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  you know all this stuff's happening so just in the last five minutes what else is on your heart
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:21.680]  on your mind as you talk to folks well i i'm speaking around i just speak around the country
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:26.160]  law enforcement needs to be supported more i think i and i would love to see trump add more
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:31.040]  into the law enforcement community add more into just local and state police because really that is
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:35.680]  his protection if it's going to come down to where people are going to actually be out for his life
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:40.560]  on us soil it's the leos that are going to be standing up in front of him not and really not
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:45.760]  anybody else i like to guys like myself will pull a gun when the word when it when it finally is the
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:51.200]  worst case scenario which i hope it never comes to so i hope he continues to do that and i actually
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:55.360]  would like to see more money going through the law enforcement uh those guys are the heroes right
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  now because they're the ones that have to bite their tongue and have the patience to deal with
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.280]  these crazies they're seen on the streets he's leftists are seen on the streets and then you're
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:06.800]  right now what do you make of the illegal you know you're sitting there like raping the two-year
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:10.880]  old and the left media covers it up yeah i mean it's just i don't care whether it's a citizen
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:16.720]  or non-citizen report what's happening looking at the left though seros doubling his destabilization
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.560]  money he's a nazi collaborator since he was 14 he's overthrown all these countries he admittedly
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:27.440]  is a destabilizer i get we're a free open society but if i did one tenth of what he did and i don't
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:32.560]  want to by the way i would be arrested so fast i just don't get why is he allowed to do all this
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.280]  that's a good question and that's a good question where i wish donald trump would come on tv and
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:43.120]  you would ask president trump that because this this man isn't insider he isn't a is somebody
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:46.880]  that would be considered as i would consider a terrorist in another country if i was very would
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:53.040]  be fun as the whole arab spring yeah yeah so um i i don't know i it's a good question and maybe
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:58.720]  when i'm sitting around and and i have i'm very lucky to have good uh to friends up on the hill
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:02.800]  i am very lucky to have some good friends maybe ask them i that is a dang good question alex i
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:07.360]  don't know i but he does he's done things that probably need to well there's no problem that
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:13.440]  we need george soros and he needs to be under an under investigation for bottom line is
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:18.400]  terrorist again terroristic activities the united states of america um hey and if they have a problem
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:22.160]  with anybody going to get him send me hey i'm right here i'll go i'll go put handcuffs on
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:26.240]  and bring him to you you just let me know give me the word if if people are worried about saving
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:30.800]  face or threats against their lives that's what we're here for we're here to protect the united
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:35.840]  states i mean and i just said i'll take a couple buddies and we'll go grab and bring him india
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:39.040]  president trump just give us the word but it needs to happen it does need to happen and i
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:43.360]  am in total agreement with you you you got to cut the head off of a snake and watch it die and i
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:48.240]  think right now that's the head right there is your source well chris tonto peranto chris
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:54.720]  tonto peranto dot com anybody can just google his name everybody knows who he is um i'm just glad
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:59.200]  that we're so restrained and the veterans are so restrained they're much and so we're not calling
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.280]  for some type of we're just saying they're calling for killing everybody they're calling for overthrow
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:09.200]  we should have a discussion about what happened because i've seen uh dan bajino great guy out of
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:16.000]  secret service uh wouldn't go on with obama resigned um he's said look a 40 man team the security is
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:20.080]  going to the white house a 40 man team can get in there he says i'm not giving up security issues
[1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:25.440]  the leftists the islamists know that uh you know quite frankly i know the military told trump he
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:30.960]  really should either not be at the white house or or or shut down a few roads around to do something
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:34.800]  as a security expert who's been to this type of attack in a diplomatic compound that's not
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:40.000]  adequately defended uh what's your two-minute analysis on that sir well i you have to listen
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  to your experts there and if the secret service are the experts they know how to handle security
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.520]  around the white house if you're if you as a leader you're not willing to listen to your
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:51.520]  security experts you're going to fail and that took place that night in vangossia libya our
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:55.760]  leadership was not willing to listen to the experts on the ground which were us which cost
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:28:02.400]  lives which basically put us in a dogfight for the 13 hours so and you have people there that
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:08.960]  know how to do security at the white house utilize them don't put your political correctness uh in
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:14.880]  front of those security issues don't put any media issues in front of that as well listen to
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:18.960]  those guys they know how to protect you they want to save your life they want to make sure that you
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:24.800]  get home safely and if they're telling you to do it then you know what you probably should do it
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:29.040]  or you're it's going to come back and bite you down the road and i hope it doesn't but i'm just
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:35.280]  telling you from experience alex so uh president trump and staff listen to your security experts
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:38.320]  you have on there in the hill they're telling you the truth because they want you to live and they
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:42.800]  want you to live another day and do your job another day so uh so don't take their words at
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:47.680]  at at you know don't just take it at face value you know they do know what they're talking about
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:52.720]  exactly i mean i get saying the left's a joke because they are but they've got enough money in
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:57.360]  organization that even a blind hog find it you know acres occasionally broken clocks are right
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:00.320]  twice a day we should just be having a debate about this because they're saying they want to
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:05.360]  kill everybody and take over so i'm glad we've had this discussion uh because i just see so much
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:09.760]  so much intense craziness out there and then the economy's up good things are happening
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.280]  the left's in the news saying they want to implode the economy to stop trump they're economic

[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:04.960]  network appearing on the drug report this morning potential smoking gun showed obama
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:09.840]  administration despite on trump team source says republican congressional investigators expect
[1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:14.800]  a potential smoking gun establishing that the obama administration despite on the trump transition
[1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:19.600]  team and possibly the president elect himself intelligence committee chair david newness
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:24.320]  from california has said he expects that the nsa will provide him this smoking gun evidence the
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:28.800]  intelligence is said to leave no doubt that the obama administration in its closing days was
[1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:33.520]  using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect trump
[1:30:33.520 --> 1:30:38.320]  according to sources and basically it boils down to this while it's legal for the deep state to
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:44.000]  collect intelligence on foreign targets it's not legal for the names of us citizens to be unmasked
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:48.480]  this was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports now looking back at trump's

[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:58.880]  how off the chart powerful was that tonto peranto interview we just had
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:04.960]  chris tonto peranto dot com former army ranger second battalion 75th ranger regiment
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:09.280]  private security contractor had deployed throughout south america central america the

[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.760]  coordinating low-profile security and high-thread environments throughout the world he was part
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:22.560]  of the cia's alex security team was responsible for the terror i responded to the terrorist attack

[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:40.640]  from the cia annex for 13 hours mr peranto story it's told in the book 13 hours written by michael
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:49.360]  zukov and the five surviving annex security team men are a member and there he is saying we're
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:54.160]  ready to arrest jord sorrow's if everybody else is scared for their families because obviously
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:59.360]  you go after him that's reason nobody wants to be so dangerous he's a mafia chief a true james
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:06.800]  bonvillain and saying that if they're trying to organize a coup against trump the military and
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:12.080]  veterans need to be prepared to deal with it if trump starts doing unconstitutional stuff
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:16.000]  and taking our freedoms and selling our country out like the globalists have done i'll come out
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:22.080]  against him in seconds i have no allegiance to trump except for the fact i know he's for real

[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:14.400]  few weeks at japan for no reason threatening nuclear war and the news is like trump shouldn't
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:20.320]  respond with threats of military action what the hell's he's supposed to do
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:27.440]  somebody pulls up in front of your house with a big giant 50 cal mounted fully auto machine gun
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:35.120]  and says i'm gonna blow your house up the first time i heard that i'd go get a rifle quietly
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:37.200]  stick it out the door and shoot the person up between the eyes
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:45.120]  kim jong is running around with nuclear weapons i'm gonna blow up see you next week i'm gonna
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:50.160]  blow up tokyo you're talking a couple hundred miles away for tokyo 30 miles away for seo

[1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:02.320]  paper bag and it's just like perfect art type of government worship they're ruled and enslaved
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:08.720]  by a total wimp on a narcissist power trip what like takes money like that's like a lot of folks
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.120]  in the military like guys who've killed 400 people i mean everybody thinks chris calico
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:18.960]  the most people the army doesn't put down people they kill and they tell me chris ferranto is the
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:25.120]  baddest of the bad okay like jedi level doesn't even think about it just starts shooting people
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:28.480]  hardly ever misses and just doesn't even think about the bullets all just missing
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:35.440]  and imagine a guy like that who's ready to serve him his life for you any minute because he's so
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:40.960]  alive he's so dolled in total individual but collectively dolled in everybody's ready to die
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:47.200]  right now to somehow like kim jong on this little fat i'm not bashing fat people i'm
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:52.160]  in fat too at the point is he's just this little soft pudgy want to be tough guy walking around
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:57.840]  let's put some photos of kim jong on with his eyes bugging out acting powerful and he's so delusional
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:03.920]  10 years after denis rodman was uncool 10 years after denis rodman was the joke of the united
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:12.400]  states this delusionoid zom trimbioid this body snatched creature
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:19.840]  is running around laughing that he's got submarines and threatening to blow up japan
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:27.520]  as if he'd be alive five minutes after he launches that missile but he doesn't care
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:30.720]  because he's delusional like polosi
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:39.840]  and like maxine walters and like michael more and all the rest of them
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:47.440]  and jake tapper these guys all they have is getting us to respond to them that's why they
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:51.920]  say outrageous stuff all the time the average cnn show has a hundred thousand viewers or less
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:57.360]  local radio shows in big cities have that but they sit there in a suit i'm jake tapper
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:03.440]  and i've got 300 000 viewers and i'm gonna officially sign this as well it's ridiculous
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:07.360]  trump says there's a thing called the nsa and he was spying on him because we reported it was spying
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:14.480]  on him that's crazy isn't it i'm jake topper um let's go to the next ceo guy here you're another

[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:34.880]  deemed hates not hate speech that's mine for wars.com spicer there's more evidence cnn colluded with
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:39.440]  hillary than russia with trump well she also collided more the russia than trump ever did he
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:44.320]  didn't include any putin meets with lapin at kremlin vows not to interfere in election as they're
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:50.960]  now claiming he does globalist gangster junker threatens trump with war of european union collapses
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:57.520]  yeah junker you're pretty arrogant you threaten us with war and you have the capacity to do it
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:02.480]  it's time you're clear and present danger buddy urgun keep calling me dickhead i'll keep calling
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:06.960]  you a nazi okay you're flooding europe with islamists and trying to politically activate them
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:11.840]  potential smoking gun showing obama administration spied on trump team sources say
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:18.720]  this is a big one i don't cover enough there's more dead russians
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.720]  string of dead russians continues as
[1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:34.880]  witnesses and putin critics executed typical show execution russians mayor all of mos are
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:40.720]  controlled by radical islamists yeah the muslims intimidate their own groups first that's where the
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:48.480]  you know like any gang they control their sector even greater we you can't talk about an obama
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:52.880]  plot to sabotage trump question mark again the sun come up this morning three million migrants
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:57.200]  waiting to cross into grace says e u commissioner who's ordering them to let them in basically
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:02.080]  saying under the u n you have to let them in trump was right oh i forgot this one
[1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:09.040]  jewish team arrested for bomb threat to jewish centers 99 percent of the time a white woman
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:14.320]  says four black guys raped her and carved name center it turns out she made it up and a black
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:18.880]  woman does the same thing i don't know why it's like most of the time is something weird arson
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:22.240]  or a pipe bomb and fire departments they know is one of their own people i don't know how this works
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:26.560]  but it's just it's just firefighters are great people by the way but they understand it statistically
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.600]  that's where it comes from inside job trump was right jewish team arrested for bomb threat to
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:36.000]  jewish centers president trump was viciously attacked in February which was suggesting that
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:39.920]  threats may have been a false flag to make people look bad yeah they kept saying trump's not doing
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:45.680]  anything about the jewish centers and the jewish cemetery is being attacked by the leftist jewish
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:51.040]  lobby as if trump's anti-jewish he's totally pro-israel man but you're leftist you're not even you
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:55.520]  don't even care about jews or anybody else that matter you want to overrun every culture you
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:00.400]  want to destroy trump because you're on the payroll of islamists the left jewish lobby might as well
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:07.440]  be saudi arabia run that's not a rhetoric that's the truth member of congress warns of 1000 point
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:12.480]  stock market crash of obama care light does not pass that's why trump's going for because
[1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:16.880]  it was meant to implode the economy this year police repeatedly assorted ms-13 gang member
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:22.240]  sexual assaults two-year-old girl the media only fox and us will cover this is like drudge and others
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:26.640]  the the whole left media will not cover even raping a two-year-old stabbing you know another
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:34.240]  girlfriend attacking his other girlfriend running around it's okay though former muslim islamists
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:40.000]  emboldened by pc culture well that's their army that's that's who they're bringing in to do all this
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:50.400]  but first i want to get to some more of these clips where spicer says more evidence of collusion
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:56.480]  between cnn and clinton and russia and that ties into uh the video already played i want to get to
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:04.480]  it again the smoking gun bigger than watergate political espionage greatest civil rights violation
[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:11.920]  from hanity because the truth is coming out oh there's another story abc gush is over an amazing
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:17.280]  inspiring story of mother and son swapping genders i don't care if you swap tenders or whatever this
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:23.680]  is but you don't get a college degree that gets you a job you don't have a real culture it's being
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:28.960]  shut down now so the new thing is oh you change your gender see instead of getting a bigger house
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:35.840]  or better medicine or better education for your children it's you can swap your gender see that's
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.920]  that's what they give us in the new new world used to the globalist and they give us bobbles
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:45.440]  like iPhones and things to control us but now it's just you like opt into a cooler group
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:48.480]  and you get some attention from the media that's how to destroy and you feel empowered
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:55.680]  now let me just say once this hour that we're winning the info war reaching hearts and minds
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:58.960]  despite all the censorship the attacks of the immunizations you name it and you're not going
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:05.120]  to see or hear information like you just heard from one of the survivors of the 13 hours in
[1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:11.120]  mungazi tonto you're not going to get game changing info that does the research so the
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:15.440]  president has the proof he was being surveilled it gives you the very leaks that now force the house
[1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:20.880]  and intelligence committee because i don't want to you know i know the sources he's talking to i
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:24.800]  well i'm just going to leave it there it's not about credit it's about victory but i need to give
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:32.800]  you a little newsflash if you want to know the most effective operation that mean we're perfect
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:36.880]  boy i wish i was doing a better job against the new world order it's info wars other than drudge
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:40.400]  drudge is even better because he can like take something they're ignoring and force it out
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:45.920]  like our story about the nsa spying and dr durum coursey and and and share of our
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:50.000]  pio and all the info that's now bringing all this out and larry cayman's involved as well

[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:02.400]  drawings so it's an imperative but what's crazy is we ask for donations we don't really get them

[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:08.080]  libertarian anything patriotic pro america's being banned and that'll cause the nexus from google
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:12.480]  itself they know that but see now they want their competition shut down so they can't
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:18.000]  be be reduced see in the past that they censor people would leave them but now facebook google
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.600]  twitter they're all moving to have everybody censored so you only have them as an option
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:26.640]  that's why it's important to fight their censorship by info wars becoming even more successful
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:32.080]  i'm committed to this fight and i want to thank and salute all of you that supported us prayed for

[1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:04.400]  the support in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook

[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:27.600]  wow a smoking gun broke on fox news last night actually i'm glad they have the courage to put
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:32.960]  this out but we told you it's foreign intelligence being given legally back to obama and the democrats
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:38.240]  to spy on trump and they claim evidence of espionage when there is none then when they get
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:44.320]  called on it they deny it exists here's from hanity last night intelligence is said to leave no doubt
[1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:49.920]  the obama administration and its closing days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:56.000]  on foreign targets to spy on president elect trump according to sources you're now with reaction
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.720]  from surcha news sarah carter from the american center for law and justice jase secular i think
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:05.760]  this goes straight to the highest levels of the obama administration and that's where these answers
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:12.400]  need to come from we need to find out who unmasked these names and it wasn't just director comey
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:17.760]  there were other people that had access to this and the nsa can unmask these names so who requested
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:23.200]  that that's one of the most important important questions here shon and why and why and i think
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:28.880]  once those questions start to get answered just like chairman newness said then we'll know what was
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:35.920]  their political espionage and if there was shon this is the greatest civil civil liberties violations
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:41.040]  that we have seen in our country in a long time this would make a watergate look like kindergarten
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:48.000]  oh yeah they were surveilling the president and yes sarah you believe it was before as what before
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:52.720]  the election and now we're getting a confirmed by james rosen after the election and remember
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:58.560]  every time you go into a skiff every time you go into these secured compartmentalized facilities
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:04.240]  to view this information you have to swipe in you have to swipe in you have to sign a log it
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:10.160]  doesn't matter if you're the guy an analyst working on a case or if you're john brennan the former
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:16.400]  director of the cia you have to swipe in so there are logs out there shon and there is evidence
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:21.520]  out there some of that's classified but but they're able to get a hold of it if chairman newness can
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:26.080]  get a hold of that information he can start finding out who did well i think the attorney general
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:30.240]  needs to in panel a grand jury that's the first thing that needs to happen and start this investigation
[1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:35.120]  because sarah says correct you can find out who did this so that that's number one number two for
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:39.840]  the chairman of the intelligence committee he needs to get the background data because what he
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:46.080]  saw in those reports shocked him obviously not just because it named president trump potentially and
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:51.760]  his associates but also the nature of the dissemination itself that's right that's what's
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:57:00.480]  going on here and remember how they kept telling you none of this existed none of this was happening
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.960]  when they've been the ones that admitted they were doing it previously that shows the total mental
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:11.280]  illness that shows the beyond anything i've ever seen arrogance out of these people i mean it really
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:15.920]  is stunning that they thought they could say hey we're surveilling and we have evidence he's a russian
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:21.200]  then i go hey that's illegal to do the spying oh we don't have any evidence or you're still a russian
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:28.080]  but from our spying we weren't spying meanwhile let me show you this next article former cia analyst
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:33.840]  gave green light for nsa cia to sabotage trump that was march 6
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:42.160]  18 days ago or whatever it is and they blocked that on facebook not because it was fake news
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:46.960]  but because info wars is so on target and and because we were reporting on cutting edge info
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:56.240]  we had him on last week larry c johnson formerly the cia high level but he's covering stuff that's
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:01.360]  admitted already so they've called him discredited they've attacked him they've demonized him all the
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:06.720]  news where are they now but the head of the intelligence committee comes out and says it's
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:12.400]  true they say let's investigate newness maybe he's a russian too this is getting real old it's not
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:18.560]  going to work anymore where rand paul works for putin alex jones works for putin uh lapin works
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:23.600]  for putin um but it's all meant even if they fail to have a chilling effect we're not supposed to
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:28.080]  talk to the russians because the globalists have sold out the comic chinese that's the big power
[1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:33.280]  axis what's left to the us europe and the comic chinese rushes the wild card as usual just like
[1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:37.840]  in world war two world war one to break that stalemate because russia's still a sovereign country
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:43.920]  we'll be right back with hour number three jam packed with important guests larry claiming
[1:58:43.920 --> 1:58:53.680]  william benny and morris you want answers you're gonna get them this is alex jones i want to tell

[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:40.640]  be joining us but first here's a report on one of the big threats we're not talking about north korea
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:49.600]  north korea's kim jong-un has finally exhausted the patients that allowed the psychopathic regime
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:58.000]  to play its twisted inhumane games since kim jong-un was declared supreme leader in 2011 north
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.440]  korea's seven and a half billion dollar military budget compared to the united states annual budget
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:10.400]  of 580 billion is laughable still that isn't stopping kim jong-un from threatening to fire an
[2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:16.560]  intercontinental nuclear missile on the united states japan times writes north korea heralded
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:22.160]  the successful development of a new high thrust engine during a visit to the country's rocket
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:28.560]  test site by leader kim jong-un the reclusive nation's state media said sunday earlier this month
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:35.040]  pyeong yang issued an unusually over threat to washington and tokyo firing off a simultaneous
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:40.880]  barrage of four missiles as part of exercises that it said were training for strikes on us
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.880]  military bases in japan there has been growing speculation that the north will conduct an icbm
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:52.720]  test after kim used a new year's day address to claim that pyeong yang was in the final stages
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:58.880]  of developing a long-range missile capable of hitting new york and washington secretary of state
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:03.760]  rex tillerson spoke with south korean leaders over the weekend first of all i'd like to welcome

[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.320]  assessment of the situation we face today the united states stands by its commitments and we stand

[2:02:55.680 --> 2:03:02.000]  and it is a length pin of peace and stability in the asia pacific region the trump administration
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.600]  has prioritized the north korean threats and a consensus amongst the international community
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:14.240]  is quickly being sought north korea must fully comply with the relevant u.s security council
[2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:23.360]  resolutions he assured me that the united states will always with japan 100 percent and to demonstrate
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:30.000]  his determination as well as commitment he is now here with me at this joint press conference
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:39.920]  president trump and i myself completely shared a view that we are going to promote further
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:45.520]  collaboration between the two nations and also we are going to further reinforce our alliance
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:53.040]  north korea's neighbors have expressed concern after its announced plans to launch what it called an
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:59.200]  f observation satellite during the next three weeks vaging believed to have the most influence
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:04.720]  over pyongyang says it is worried about the plan and the united nations sees it as a missile
[2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:09.600]  program in disguise last month he's had more missile tests firing missiles just right off the
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:15.680]  coast of japan and then saying i will annihilate you i will nuke you with someone that looks
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:22.640]  like a cartoon character of a little potbellied crazy man with everyone worshiping him threatening
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:27.360]  to destroy south korea one of the most advanced high-tech countries in the world
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:33.520]  millions starving every few years in north korea total enslavement and the answer is threatened
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:39.120]  to nuke us threatened to attack us and now china has moved into the south china sea taking over
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:46.560]  90 percent of it they are declaring that they have the waters all the way down to the philippines
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:52.640]  and china is belligerently kicking philippinos off their own islands that people been on for
[2:04:52.640 --> 2:04:59.440]  thousands of years they're not just building new ones john bound for enforce dot com we'll be back
[2:04:59.440 --> 2:05:04.800]  stay with us appearing on the drudge report this morning potential smoking gun showed obama
[2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:09.600]  administration despite on trump team source says republican congressional investigators expect
[2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:14.560]  a potential smoking gun establishing that the obama administration despite on the trump transition
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:19.520]  team and possibly the president elect himself intelligence committee chair david newness from
[2:05:19.520 --> 2:05:24.080]  california has said he expects that the nsa will provide him this smoking gun evidence the
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:28.560]  intelligence is said to leave no doubt that the obama administration in its closing days was
[2:05:28.560 --> 2:05:33.280]  using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect trump
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:38.160]  according to sources and basically it boils down to this while it's legal for the deep state to
[2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:43.840]  collect intelligence on foreign targets it's not legal for the names of us citizens to be unmasked
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:48.320]  this was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports now looking back at trump's
[2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:54.400]  march fourth wiretapping tweets it seems he was right all along soon we will find out if obama

[2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:18.240]  texas command center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show you know
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:21.600]  the american people and president trump are actually able to restore the republic will have
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:26.000]  to stop running those liners i've had for 20 years about deep behind enemy lines you know the global
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:31.200]  is occupying america we're saying mid-down globalism occupies the eu it's ordering three million more
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:36.320]  muslims brought in from north africa uh the other states on islamic attack we just saw
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:41.200]  uh that took place coming up at the bottom of the hour uh we're going to be talking to larry
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:47.600]  claiming who of course has been involved with the whistleblower for many years um and the
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:51.680]  information that we know we put out last week he wasn't involved in that he brought the fbi
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:56.160]  i had it from separate sources but we're going to talk about what all this means he had a successful
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:02.560]  case uh well the only successful cases against the nsa that's at the bottom of the hour we'll
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:06.960]  get his take on all of that with larry claiming but william benney who i really appreciate taking
[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:11.360]  time out as a jonas was the former technical director of the national security agency he was
[2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:19.840]  also the main technical advisor uh on the film snowden which is so accurate almost happening
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:27.280]  so we have since the last time i talked to him we have the vault seven uh cia documents where
[2:09:27.280 --> 2:09:32.080]  they've got their own nsa going on illegally we've got trump they're in the news saying he's being
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:36.000]  surveilled months ago they have all these you know data and transcripts he says well that's
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:41.760]  illegal to say you were doing that that's a leak then they go well actually there's nothing in it
[2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:46.160]  you didn't do anything don't worry about it then they say oh we weren't spying on you as if the public
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:50.400]  has no memory well now congressman nunez the head of the house intelligence committee comes out and
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:54.480]  says no i've seen the documents i've talked to the agencies they were surveilling him overseas
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:09:58.960]  again you have the foreigners surveil americans we surveil the foreigners get around domestic
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:03.920]  spying laws everything we've done for decades but william benny only covers what he can cover
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:08.480]  that isn't classified but thanks to snowden we can cover so much so you couldn't get
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:14.720]  out there they're not snowed and no one and i'm not bragging for his ego he doesn't care
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:20.880]  it's a fact william benny is the leading expert on the nsa he helped write so many other programs
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:25.280]  their codes he's a very famous code breaker mathematician show he's with us to the bottom
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:31.920]  of the hour the next uh 18 minutes or so to break down from the expert's mouth exactly what's going
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:38.080]  on here but for me uh mr benny it's just crazy that they would deny what exists deny they were
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:43.360]  spying on trump when they just admitted they were it seems like they're really having a
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:48.080]  collapse of confidence right now they put everything they could into saying none of this happened when
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:52.880]  we have thousands of headlines where they were bragging they use nsa to illegally spy on trump
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:58.560]  and his administration yes well i think it's uh and by the way it's good to be back with you alex uh
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:06.720]  yeah i mean the whole point is and uh comey uh director comey is known about this the domestic
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:11.440]  spying program from nsa which is that called the stellar wind program originally they may
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:17.520]  change that name since uh since 2001 but it was the original name for the program that he knew
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:23.280]  about and that was the issue when he went to the hospital for the ashcroft visit in 2004
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:28.960]  they the white house was going to the ashcroft to get him to overrule comey because comey had
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:34.720]  rejected renewing that program at the time the way it stood and so they were they went to the
[2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:40.160]  hospital that's that stellar wind program was what that was all about and that program is simply
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:48.720]  the repository of collected data on u.s citizens inside the nsa storage facility so in other words
[2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:56.160]  it's like a excuse me a separate subject about all u.s citizens and uh and it's collected through
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:07.040]  other uh other countries around the world when they get to data that's the u.s citizens are
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:12.800]  there are uh data is routed through their countries or around the world like when they pick it up they
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:19.440]  share it with nsa too so it's all coming in into the centrally into the nsa databases so everything
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:25.120]  is there for against everybody in the country it doesn't matter whether you're elliot stitzer a
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:30.640]  member of the tea party member of the occupy group or any of that all that data is still there and
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:36.880]  of course president trump all the all the all the uh judges on the supreme court all the members of the
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:41.760]  joint chiefs of staff all the members of congress all that it's all there and it's only now a matter
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:46.640]  of targeting it is going into that database to pull only that data out which is what i maintain
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:53.360]  has been going on they've been targeting president trump also candidate trump and perhaps even mr
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:58.960]  trump before that so i think he's been a target for quite some time at least that's what appears to
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:03.840]  me to be the case well since you raised that we have larry claiming coming up a little bit later
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.200]  who has a cia whistleblower i've checked the phone numbers it's my old phone numbers it's where i lived
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:13.120]  it's we're at an office it is donald trump's private phone numbers i've checked other people in the
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:17.360]  database and we we have part of the database where we obviously haven't published it for people's
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:22.640]  privacy uh but we got this uh a few weeks ago we showed her the lighthouse they said yeah that's
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:29.120]  our numbers but this is a big deal uh under this program drag net and also sidewinder i know they
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:34.000]  have sub programs where the dea and other law enforcement are giving limited access uh but
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.800]  do you have any uh information on the program i just mentioned that i've personally listed in
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:42.800]  and i checked with a bunch of other people spot check this is an accurate database so this is
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:49.360]  some type of grid supposedly of who's being targeted so you know who's targeted then go request
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:55.360]  end of the program on who you want to pull data on yes and uh i think these are cia programs
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:02.320]  cia and fbi have direct access into the nsa databases so and there's no oversight of that at
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:08.240]  all that i can see uh that is never any indication the only oversight that's done and talked about
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:14.800]  are oversight and nsa analysts well i mean it gets back to the minimizing issue in the nsa
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:21.360]  databases nothing is minimized so when you go in there without and don't have programs that minimize
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:28.000]  see in nsa when they pull data out for the analyst they minimize it so they hide the identity but uh
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  if you're cia and fbi going in there it doesn't appear that they have any of that minimization
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:35.760]  process at all and that was your concern always even there for those that don't remember you've
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:40.080]  said this many times to the snowden film there's no monitoring of who goes into the system unless
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:47.520]  you're there in the system yeah yeah yeah and and when uh jadmer rogers was talking about in the
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:53.600]  testimony a few days ago that he gave uh he was talking about it they were only like 20 20 people
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:15:01.040]  who could unmask it and uh and report it that's those who are authorized that doesn't say how many
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:08.400]  have access to the raw data or the database of nsa they can look at the at the uh unminimized data
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:13.600]  and see who it is anyway that's right it doesn't say who they've got uh yeah i'm sorry interrupts
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:18.960]  you go ahead and say that again i'm saying that's that's on the order of a couple thousand i mean
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:24.160]  all all the all the system administrators and the system can do that all the all the programmers
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:29.040]  who are involved in all the contractors managing that data can look at it i mean the contractors
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:34.560]  i had even knew that uh when when they were working that they knew it uh that that stuff was there so
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:39.120]  i've talked to telecom contractors that say they can go right into the database too they
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:44.160]  say the thing's a sieve that's that's why i say it's right it's on the order of a couple thousand
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:50.080]  i would think expanding on that then what was it like for you to watch the senate hearings
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:54.000]  to see the fbi director nobody denied that the president elect was being surveilled
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  when just months before they were bragging they were surveilling them it's just it's it's amazing
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.440]  yeah well if you if you listen to what comey was saying specifically he was saying there was no
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:08.800]  directed wiretap in other words there was this general wiretap we sucked him up but we didn't
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:13.440]  direct the wiretap that tapped him that's what he was saying and i you know i thought it was a joke
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:17.840]  they're playing word games with us that's all yeah they're like we're surveilling everybody but we
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:22.560]  weren't targeting trump we were just listening to him giving it to the democrats and they're running
[2:16:22.560 --> 2:16:26.560]  knowing what you know without getting the classified information when they play these games and they
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:30.400]  say obama went around to the british and all the rest of it knowing what you know from what you've
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:34.160]  seen what nunez is saying how do you think this was actually directed
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:43.920]  my guess was uh it was it came um i i would guess it came out of the white house staff
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:49.120]  whether or not the president himself was involved i don't know but certainly they wanted to know what
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:55.280]  what was going on to help uh the democratic party yeah just like nixon did you know it's a it's a
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:59.120]  same it's a same philosophy know your political enemies and what they're up to and what they're
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:02.800]  making sure what they're planning but he had to physically break into psychiatrists offices and
[2:17:02.800 --> 2:17:07.040]  things and they had to have a name from the irs people to persecute i'm not defending nixon
[2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:12.800]  but isn't this just exponentially four or five levels bigger than what nixon did yeah because
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:16.720]  they don't have to go anywhere all that data's stored already they can go in and get it
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:22.960]  and procedurally i guess just somebody in the president's office says we want it
[2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:26.720]  and suddenly to the new york times the washington post that flin did talk to the russians
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:34.400]  yeah i think uh i think that uh you know that was part of uh but was part of the uh the diversion
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:40.400]  effort okay sort of speak i would call but but you know uh this is the kind of thing that uh that
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:45.440]  nixon did and he had to have people like we like we talked about he had people physically break in
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:50.560]  and certain certain in certain cases otherwise they'd use the fbi to follow people and monitor them
[2:17:50.560 --> 2:17:56.080]  and tap them and and in nsa at that time they had the program called minaret doing a very similar
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:02.560]  thing with the telecommunications companies back then and in in fbi they had the program chaos and
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:09.120]  at the i mean fbi was co-intel pro and ci it was chaos so those programs are doing basically the
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:12.480]  same thing they're doing now and they each have their different names but they're all basically
[2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:18.560]  doing the very similar things except it's now uh you know exponentially larger what they're doing
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:24.800]  and before nixon could only have them monitor maybe a few thousand people now it's it's 280 to
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:30.720]  300 million and whereas previously i've been critical of trump only in a few issues and one
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:34.720]  of them is being pro surveillance because he's thinking hey i'm a good guy it's against isis or
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:40.080]  whatever or you know the chinese communist but no yeah he's now learning it was using against him
[2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:44.960]  he's really upset i think this is a good you know in a way a good thing that he's getting educated
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:50.400]  informed about what's really going on yeah you know we also have to know that all this bulk
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:56.160]  acquisition of data you know just varies his analysts and and nsa ci and all over they just
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:01.360]  can't get through all this data so they can't really detect things like threats of terrorist attacks
[2:19:01.360 --> 2:19:05.680]  until they happen and then once they happen they find out who did and they have all the data they
[2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:08.960]  want well that's an encouraging thing they say homeland security is going into all these federal
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:14.240]  offices is saying stop being politically correct stop ignoring it when somebody's in islamists
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:20.160]  and says they want to kill people tell us i mean the best thing is humet and the best thing is uh
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:24.800]  you know actually going in you know for groups that are known mathematically that's who you
[2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:29.920]  then keep an eye on you don't just spy on everybody you don't even spy on them it's like once people
[2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:34.880]  say online i plan to kill trump or i plan to blow something up then you start watching them you get
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:39.200]  a warrant because you have to process i mean you have the evidence that that that you have probably
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:51.600]  had a professional-focused discipline job and right now it's just uh random scary and break this down
[2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:54.880]  because you i mean you're credible you want to brag about yourself as one of the biggest guys at
[2:19:54.880 --> 2:20:01.040]  nsa ever the major program to defeat the soviets writing the programs doing it the targeted algorithms
[2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:06.240]  all of it and your first you know being upset was just complaining in the 2000s that they weren't
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:10.480]  actually being effective then you learned more that other agencies were jacking into what you were
[2:20:10.480 --> 2:20:14.800]  doing keeping you blind to it here you are running the nsa you're being surveilled when you're in it
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:20.000]  which you should be they're not being watched so let's i mean how important that is that that that
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:26.320]  that's going on uh you see that that's uh that's one of the main things one of the main suggestions
[2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:32.160]  we made to president obama back in uh january of 2014 when he was going to try to change some things
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:37.200]  in nsa which he basically didn't uh we said here's some things you have to do and one of the things
[2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:42.160]  is be able to be able to monitor what the entire intelligence community is doing and verify what
[2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:47.040]  what they're doing right right now they had no verification process and we who watches the watchers
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:53.440]  yeah exactly and and the whole idea was to get to get to get professionally technically competent
[2:20:53.440 --> 2:20:58.320]  people who could go into any agency anywhere at any time with all the clearances and everything
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:04.000]  they could do that that's not impossible to do uh and and have them look and see what programs they
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:09.600]  have what what the databases they have what's in the database and all that and verify that that
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:15.520]  what they're telling everybody in congress uh is really true right now i mean they lie all the time
[2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:22.160]  please continue because i've been asking a lot of points here mr benny what are other key points
[2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:28.720]  folks should know well you see the problem i've always had is once you accumulate this data you
[2:21:28.720 --> 2:21:34.160]  know people are people okay you can't really change the nature of humanity i mean if you give them
[2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:38.800]  power over other people eventually they use it and that's what's been going on here they've been
[2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:45.040]  using it internally in the united states for for criminal prosecutions of people for acquisition
[2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:51.120]  of evidence against people to go arrest them and you know of course it's not you know we talked about
[2:21:51.120 --> 2:21:55.600]  this before it's not admissible in the court of law so they have to do a parallel construction
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:22:01.840]  which means construct data that would verify or that validate their probable cause to arrest them
[2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:06.800]  in the first place and substitute that data for the NSA data in the court of law which is a perjury
[2:22:06.800 --> 2:22:14.560]  you know and so you know it's just destroying the entire fabric of our our our our constitutional
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:20.160]  report and this is you warned congress 15 years ago it's being used for political purposes not
[2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:25.680]  even to protect the country you've been swat team they've gone after drake but but how sad it's got
[2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:31.040]  to be satisfying though now to see everything you probably warned congress about not just in the
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:36.880]  public but the senate being spied on by the CIA the president being spied on all the illegality
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:43.680]  coming out totally vindicating everything you said but you did it legally not bashing stoton
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:48.560]  you're a hero i think stones a hero as well but i get it he broke laws to expose greater crimes
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:52.880]  so you say hey prosecute the big crimes then go after him stoton says he's ready to stand for
[2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:57.920]  what he did but i mean what is it like to see this now all out in the open you're totally vindicated
[2:22:59.680 --> 2:23:05.360]  well you know it's uh you know it's a shame that uh i i i really feel i've always felt bad that you
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:10.640]  know the people in congress i couldn't get them to do something about it even though they knew it
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:14.320]  was wrong i mean they all knew it was that's why they're keeping it all secret that's why they
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:19.600]  try to keep it secret all along and so uh and no one has really stood up to do anything down there
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:25.120]  and i really that that that's really kind of uh depressing to me that that our government who
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:29.840]  takes oath of office their oath of office to protect protect and defend the constitution and
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:34.640]  the president's to preserve and protect and defend the constitution so you know it's just
[2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:39.840]  really depressing that we we call ourselves a democracy a democratic republic or you know
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:46.480]  constitution republic but you know when it comes down to it we're not really following the the
[2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:50.240]  founding principles of our nation and that basically when people are doing what they're
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:54.560]  doing but these things i i find they'll look at that as treason against the founding principles
[2:23:54.560 --> 2:24:01.120]  of this country absolutely and now we have a spy race by corporations and governments and and and
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:05.920]  you know quantum computing and all this craziness they're coming out with we've opened pandora's box
[2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:10.160]  and it's biting the politicians in the bud and the corporate leaders even worse than the general
[2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:14.160]  public and they're the ones that thought they knew better than the founding fathers
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:17.760]  that founded the country there's real arrogance here and that's what concerns me
[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:23.360]  yeah that's really that's right the elitists are in charge and they're not they think they
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:30.560]  know better when in fact the fundamental principles of human rights and and and have been embodied in
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:35.440]  our constitution from the very beginning they're they're so fundamental that you know and there's
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:39.200]  a way to change them if you want to change them put an amendment in take it through the process
[2:24:39.200 --> 2:24:44.880]  it's but they really are universal i mean how do you assault universal truth and then expect to not
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:52.000]  have hell right but but again that's the elitist view once you get to that point you're you know
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:59.040]  you know better than anything or anybody else and so you know that that yeah but you ran the nsa
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:04.480]  you developed most of systems you got more diligent as it went not on a power trip you could
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:08.320]  spy on anybody you wanted but we've now learned the other agencies they didn't do the same thing so
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:14.240]  is it a cultural thing is it a vetting process i mean why why doesn't seem we're just degenerating
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:18.720]  but to be positive the truth's starting to come out so are you an optimist or where are you right
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:28.000]  now william benning expose facts dot org well i am i am actually uh i think possibly since uh this
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:32.800]  is happening to the president i mean now he gets a focus on him so he begins to realize what's been
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.200]  going on i don't think they've really been telling him the truth anyway they have never really told
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:42.800]  they either the either the president or the congress said the real truth anyhow so you know i i think
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:49.200]  positively that this is a this is an opportunity to actually do something and and do the right
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:55.360]  things and get back on on board with our constitutional form of government and i'm still
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:00.160]  really pretty hopeful that's the case i totally agree with you that's government though what do
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:04.800]  we do about the corporations i mean as you said google all of their their worst thing in i say
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:09.120]  well you see that that's they don't have the right they shouldn't have the right to have that
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:14.160]  data either so what we need to do is first fix our government and pass the laws that that force them
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:19.840]  to change for their procedures uh the companies anyway i've also been lobbying in europe that
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:23.760]  they should start suing these companies because they've been violating the constitutional rights
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:27.600]  of people in europe and you've testified in europe and europe is is actually on that front the
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:32.240]  losses are starting by government yeah that's what i've been doing i've been doing that for
[2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:38.320]  a couple of years now so uh and uh we've talked to members of the EU including the vice president of
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:44.240]  the EU and they're starting to try to formulate laws that will force directed targeted approach
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:48.080]  in other words they're forcing them into a disciplined professional uh sure when somebody
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:52.320]  shows the algorithm the background the statements they're going to kill people you know then you're
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:56.080]  targeted when you're saying i'm going to you know kill people obviously you've violated
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:26:59.840]  people's rights by declaring you're going to declare a war so now you get spied on
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:03.920]  that's that's the constitution that's common sense uh we've got three minutes left i just
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:07.680]  don't want to gush here mr benny but you really are amazing it's one of the high points of my life
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:10.800]  you coming out to austin and going out to dinner with us and telling us stuff because
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:15.920]  you got such moral courage not just mathematical courage and all things you've done for america
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:21.520]  they're now saying with no evidence that i'm being criminally investigated as a russian spy because i
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:26.240]  supported trump uh they're now saying that breitbart is they've accused on the senate floor
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:34.560]  senator mccain has accused rand paul of quote being a russian agent uh what do you make of that i mean
[2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:42.080]  it's just crazy well i think it's uh it's the see the fear is that the people who have uh like uh i
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:46.720]  think a lot of the established politicians on all sides are afraid of what president trump's going
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:50.560]  to do because he starts doing the right thing he's going to break up their happiness management
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:56.160]  program in in washington which is where they they control everything they have the money and the power
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:02.080]  and they execute that and so he's he's looking at breaking that up spreading it back to states and
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:07.600]  transferring you know power and decision making out to people who are who should really be making
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:12.400]  the decision and he's really doing it and he's really doing it and that's what they're afraid
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:17.120]  of you see if he does that and he starts exceeding a greater scale he's going to make all these
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:24.960]  these permanent politicians these uh what i call the permanently petrified politicians in place in
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:29.920]  washington he's going to scare them and make them look really bad and they're going to look like crap
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:34.000]  so that we should start looking around for fresh people coming in and replacing them and that's
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.120]  what they're afraid of really wow william benny expose facts dot org i know you're the main
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:43.680]  expert behind snowed along with his data leak you never broke any laws you just are now going off

[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:24.080]  the kind and all the companies you're killed because they wanted to feed on all kinds of money
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:28.960]  so we found uh two companies in europe that are interested in doing that so we're going to be
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:34.000]  working with them to do that in europe please come back on the minute you want to sir to

[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:54.320]  newness with the proof that trump is right we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[2:29:54.320 --> 2:30:04.080]  the gcn radio network appearing on the drug report this morning potential smoking gun
[2:30:04.080 --> 2:30:08.720]  showed obama administration despite on trump team source says republican congressional
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:13.440]  investigators expect a potential smoking gun establishing that the obama administration
[2:30:13.440 --> 2:30:18.320]  despite on the trump transition team and possibly the president elect himself intelligence committee
[2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:23.280]  chair david newness from california has said he expects that the nsa will provide him this smoking
[2:30:23.280 --> 2:30:28.240]  gun evidence the intelligence has said to leave no doubt that the obama administration in its closing
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:33.120]  days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:38.160]  trump according to sources and basically it boils down to this while it's legal for the deep state
[2:30:38.160 --> 2:30:43.280]  to collect intelligence on foreign targets it's not legal for the names of us citizens to be
[2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:48.480]  unmasked this was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports now looking back at trump's
[2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:54.560]  march 4th wiretapping tweets it seems he was right all along soon we will find out if obama

[2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:24.000]  first off i want to ask the question what are the democrats and republican establishment do that
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:27.920]  all ganged up on trump had said you were never surveilled when it was in the new york times the
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:33.920]  washington post cnn i mean hundreds of times that i saw probably thousands i can't keep track of
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:38.160]  everything two months ago oh we got intercepts of trump and his people the russians and they
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:43.200]  were doing bad stuff trump goes well that's a leak that's illegal they went well actually the
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:47.440]  really you didn't do anything on those so don't worry went no tell me more well he's the president
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:52.400]  he can get access he learns what happened but it's classified he's not dumb he's not going to come out
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:58.320]  and say it so he lets the democrats get more ropes saying impeach him all this you know in march
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:03.120]  they're saying none of this ever happened but in january 20th they're saying it did happen
[2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:08.560]  roger stones a russian agent maniford hell now this week they said alex jones and ran paul are
[2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:13.680]  because we want to cut taxes secure our borders have the best military
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:20.880]  do all these things i mean well that's the russkies then you know whatever it's a joke
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:26.320]  so larry claimant joins us one over his whole bio it would take too long but everybody knows
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:32.160]  who larry claimant is uh the amazing work he's done uh founder of judicial watch and so much more
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:39.040]  now has his own organization and just time and time again as a game changing group we on sunday
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:43.600]  via some other folks that work with us publish some things that have been out there in federal
[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:47.200]  court showing that trump was being surveilled claimant is separate from that he's not involved
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:52.160]  in that he was involved though getting that cia whistleblower basically to come forward and so
[2:37:52.160 --> 2:37:56.480]  he's been trying in the system for a long time to do this and he's also the guy again that that
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:00.560]  has won against the supreme court court so he's separate from that but from a different angle
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:05.200]  newsmax.com he also has had his articles and things published there and of course you've got
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:09.200]  several websites larry claimant what's the best place for people to go read unfiltered because
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:19.280]  it's freedomwatchusa.org yes thanks alex freedomwatchusa.org freedomwatchusa.org you can find us on youtube
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:24.160]  neproku all kinds of different sites we're not as sophisticated as you are yes you are we're
[2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:28.400]  trying to be sophisticated like you at newsmax so so freedomwatchusa.org i've kind of prefaced
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:33.360]  things correct where i'm wrong whatever just let's get into the meat and potatoes of a classified
[2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:37.920]  case you're involved in that's you know dangerous to get into but really is a rosetta stone or a
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:45.600]  skeleton key to so much yes this is important because denis montgomery is really kind of the
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:50.960]  successor to mr binny who just had on and i take my hat off to mr binny as well actually
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:57.680]  represented him for a while going back as a whistleblower but denis montgomery was an nsa cia
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:06.720]  contractor and he left the nsa and cia with 47 hard drives over 600 million pages of information
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:13.040]  much of it classified and i felt that we needed to take him to sources in government who could do
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:17.840]  something they could listen to what he had to say because much of its classified i can't see it
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:22.880]  and we needed to put it in the right hands so i went to a federal judge by let's be clear you had
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:27.840]  it but you wouldn't look at it i didn't look at he had it he had the 47 hard drives i never took
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:35.920]  possession of 60 million pages 600 million 600 million pages and what he told me was on there
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:40.960]  was that there was surveillance on the chief justice of the united states other justices
[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:49.360]  156 judges president trump when he was a businessman other prominent businessmen and yours truly much
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:54.240]  like and by the way i have those trump numbers those are real numbers my numbers are real never
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:59.040]  before giving out i mean i've looked at the database it's it's real yeah and so what we did
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:02.880]  was i went to the one person i thought i could trust in washington at the time you know obama
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:07.280]  you know obama was in control of the administration when i would visit washington i almost felt like
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:13.040]  i was in you know in pluto i mean it was just not any anything that i could relate to uh with
[2:40:13.040 --> 2:40:17.120]  regard to who was in control of the government so i went to judge lambert who made so many good
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:22.560]  decisions when i was at judicial watch which i founded in the 1990s and he then brought in i
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:26.880]  brought him in and his montgomery he talked to montgomery and montgomery told him how he tried
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:32.720]  to go forward to senate intelligence committees house intelligence committees the inspector
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:36.880]  general the department of defense and others as a whistleblower legitimately not like snowden
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:41.040]  he left for russia but to do it the right way and he was basically given the back of the hand
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:47.840]  he actually showed judge lambert some of these communications with these government uh investigatory
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:55.280]  bodies lambert then put me in contact with the senate judiciary committee charles grassley had
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:41:00.400]  just taken control of the senate judiciary committee republicans had reclaimed the senate
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:05.440]  i met with them but they weren't terribly responsive either so i went back to lambert
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:09.760]  and i said what can we do now and he said well you know what fbi director comey has a good
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:15.760]  reputation for being independent in that during the bush administration he actually objected to
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:21.360]  warrantless wiretaps and others against american citizens so he says i can put you in touch with
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:27.680]  the general counsel of the fbi james baker so judge lambert and i went over to see james
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:33.280]  baker general counsel who works right underneath fbi director comey and he assured me i wanted to
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:38.080]  meet with comey but he said comey's not available but comey's going to be supervising this we then
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:43.440]  contacted the u.s attorney in the district of columbia and through an assistant u.s attorney
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:49.680]  deba kurtis we got immunity for montgomery to come forward to produce his 47 hard drives and later
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:56.640]  to be interviewed under oath by fbi special agents welter giardina and william barnett in a secure
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:42:02.720]  room in fbi field office headquarters in washington dc this was taped now that's very important
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:07.680]  because denis montgomery has a brain aneurysm he can die at any time but this material has been
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:15.440]  recorded two years later the fbi has done nothing i've inquired of the fbi no response i've gone to
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:23.280]  various uh agencies on the hill and i've asked them to inquire nothing last monday comey appears
[2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:27.920]  in front of the house intel committee of chairman newness he doesn't mention this investigation
[2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:33.520]  i have been urging that this come out and he plays domin says there's no surveillance that's
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:38.800]  worse than what clapper did that's right i don't comey was not honest he should have revealed this
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:44.320]  and the reality here is that the fbi's probably done some of this illegal surveillance itself
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:48.480]  and they bury sure look at stingray and all the rest of it right then you know they put drones
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:52.480]  over neighborhoods just as one example and they grab everybody's phone calls looking
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:58.560]  allegedly for one person so yes they're likely implicated and this thing's been covered up so
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:05.600]  i wrote a letter uh and you can find it on our website at freedomwatchusa.org alex to chairman
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:09.840]  newness and every member of the committee democrat and republican saying you must bring
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:15.520]  montgomery in chairman newness last monday said come forward with information and that's what we've
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:20.080]  done and we've told them and i'm glad you said because i have other sources you're one of six
[2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:25.200]  sources newness has including nsa cia you're an outside source that cooperated when he was
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:29.200]  already being told he should obviously know all this but they stonewall in the agencies but now
[2:43:29.200 --> 2:43:33.200]  we have whistleblowers because it's the president they're lying about him so they should do this
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:39.360]  coming forward and so and so now newness is is is thanks to you and others able to say this right
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:44.800]  and i said in the letter please let us know by the 24th of march which is today i get give me a
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:51.600]  response on that day i had previously met with one of his lawyers uh alan susan s o z a and laid it
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:57.200]  out for him what montgomery could provide so i'm hopeful now we know this morning that newness has
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:02.160]  said well we're canceling the open hearing for next monday but we're hauling he didn't use that word
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:07.120]  but that's what's happening is that fbi director comey's being hauled back in closed session and
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:11.360]  these questions should be asked what did you do with the montgomery investigation why has it been
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:17.600]  buried why did we not know about this last week when you testified because montgomery is the main
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:22.800]  man in many ways you know benny took it up to a certain point uh but montgomery was there to
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:29.360]  2010 two years into the obama all i know is we've spot check more than 20 numbers and these this is
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:34.960]  a real database it's totally illegal and we know it was being used and we know you've been on top
[2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:37.760]  of this trying to get people to look at it i don't want to get into this because i don't
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:41.120]  know you like core scene you like zulu and everything but it's a separate deal you're not involved with them
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:45.120]  i know you you're like hey i'm doing it this way they did that way you know you like them they like
[2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:49.360]  you but you did it separately we did it to show the president's right we did it that's the way it is
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:54.960]  but but i mean this is a big deal the president knows so i overall think it's good at least screenshots
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:59.520]  of limited stuff of the president myself michael savage you know we cut off the ends of the phone
[2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:04.160]  numbers at least that's out there and shows how credible your report is over the years and what
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:07.600]  you've been doing behind the scenes so i think it's kind of time to go public you know well
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:12.960]  yeah and we want to do it in the right way by bringing montgomery in front of people but this is
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:16.960]  bigger than snow this is 600 million i know why you've been young right right because there's so
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:23.440]  much there and and here's the reality is that montgomery could die as a brain aneurysm he needs
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:27.520]  to be interviewed immediately for those that don't know it's when the artery is puffing out it could
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:34.160]  blow any time put him under oath okay he's willing to come for his wrist is light here he's a hero
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:37.840]  and you know i mean obviously they demonize anybody that blows the whistle but they and
[2:45:37.840 --> 2:45:42.560]  there's they have no proof i looked him up but but just just a minute or two on montgomery and
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:48.080]  why this is so important where we think this database came from that's right jennison people
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:51.920]  i mean uh excuse me alex people have tried to destroy his credibility that's what they've
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:56.480]  done with president trump from these agencies and that's what they've done with montgomery they had
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:02.000]  this reporter this hack reporter jame ryzen of the new york times you know smear him but that
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:06.800]  actually confirms that he is the guy that you need to talk to because he knows where the bodies are
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:11.760]  buried no pun intended and sure when somebody's getting demonized nowadays especially you know
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:16.640]  they're the good guy yeah they're good guys and in terms of what happened out there in arizona
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:23.040]  with sheriff arpaio i represented in a in the successful amnesty case that knocked out obama's
[2:46:23.040 --> 2:46:28.240]  immigration order uh arpaio wasn't served well by his lawyers with regard to denis montgomery
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:33.680]  somehow got dragged into that which is why we're proceeding on a separate track uh and i sympathize
[2:46:33.680 --> 2:46:39.440]  with sheriff arpaio and he's a great man i've talked to him he's staying out of this so right so
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:44.640]  this is what's important here is that people just listen to it confirm what the fbi has in its files
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:50.160]  get that from the fbi chair but i don't want to make judgments but tell me if you think i'm wrong
[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:55.040]  i mean i i knew they were getting the info that i was being spied on i didn't realize that it's
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:47:00.400]  published all this stuff i mean obviously you like coursey what are the problems though with i mean
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:05.200]  i mean how do you blame us we have proof the president's being surveilled and we've got to
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:11.040]  show people at some point i mean the fourth of state does have certain rights well the fourth
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:16.320]  of state has rights yes it does and uh we don't question that but i'm a lawyer okay so i have to
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:21.760]  go a different i gotta you exactly that's it we're journalists we have different rules you have rules
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:26.640]  as an officer of the court that's right and and i read and i have judge labor looking at this thing
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:29.920]  from the top you know and i get it if you don't enter it right it doesn't get in but you've been
[2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:35.120]  successful because you get stuff entered right then you win that's right and it's all in fbi files
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:38.800]  so all they have to do the white house and i've said that a white house bring
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:42.960]  montgomery in interview him with people with appropriate security clearance is the f the
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:46.880]  white house should bring him in into the white house by the way as a lawyer what should we do
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:50.640]  because we only have like an index thing but it's it's there i've told people to lead it get it off
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:54.240]  we know it's real we checked it i've actually ordered to lead it that's what you should do right
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:59.760]  yes and you know let them do their job and what i would do the listeners of this show alex and you
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:03.600]  do a tremendous job and tremendous service i'm pleased if they should contact the white house
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:08.480]  and tell them bring montgomery in in a secure room with people that have security clearances
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:12.240]  go through this well that's what i when i was weeks ago talking to corsie he talked to the
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:17.440]  white house and so did i they all know it's real and we're like get montgomery in or make a press
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:20.960]  conference and then they're just we'll check and i don't know what's going on but i don't
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:25.600]  know why that hasn't happened well don't trust the intelligence agencies to give you the truth
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:30.960]  because as mr benny just said they lie okay they're covering up you have two very corrupt people
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:34.880]  under the obama administration that run the director of national intelligence clapper who's a
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:39.120]  certified liar who lied under us i was about to say why are these people still in companies to get
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:45.920]  rid of all clapper's gone john brennan former ci director gone he's ethically compromised and
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:50.720]  corrupt as well he tried to destroy trump in the lead up to the yeah what was that watch your mouth
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:57.040]  right he's a low class individual and and montgomery can tell you all about these people he worked
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:01.680]  with them okay they're dishonest they're corrupt and these did the obama's bidding and i'll tell you
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:07.760]  this if you follow the evidence here i'm certain that president obama's sitting on top of this he
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:11.600]  must have known i'm sure he directed it sure they always direct everything they're totally
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:16.080]  command and control but i thought it was above obama he doesn't who do you think who gave the
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:22.080]  order originally above obama soros it had to go to obama ultimately okay i mean you can
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:26.800]  blame it on the minions but the buck stops on his desk and and i want to make one other point
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:33.280]  out in other countries of the world israel brazil other countries they hold the top executive
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:38.240]  accountable they did as an or the prime minister we've never done that in our 240 year history it's
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:43.440]  time that we that we hold the former president of the united states and other high officials
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:48.000]  accountable that's the one holdover from england as we make the chief executive like a king and
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:53.600]  then we don't go after him and we we really should he can do no wrong and it's about time
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:59.600]  that this investigation focused on obama and his minions like brennan and clapper and frankly i
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:04.560]  believe the evidence will show that they should all be indicted convicted and frankly thrown in
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:08.960]  prison for what's been going on absolutely using the nsa to spy on the incoming president
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:15.280]  and then lying about it it's just crazy wow freedom watch usa.org amazing well larry as
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:19.440]  this develops the next few weeks please come back and then the last minute or two we have
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:23.760]  what else would you like to impart to viewers and listeners well i think it's an interesting
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:28.960]  contrast here is that freedom watch is pushing as hard as we can okay we're doing what we feel
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:33.040]  needs to be done we're not afraid we're not afraid of blackmail coercion or anything else
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:37.200]  the aclu who brought a case at the time i brought the original cases that i won against
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:42.160]  the nsa and the government defendants they were strong so you know this is terrible look
[2:50:42.160 --> 2:50:46.320]  at this mass surveillance because it was happening to some of their muslim clients
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:50.720]  but when it happens to president trump they're silent so they're actually backing
[2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:56.720]  what the obama people have done to try to destroy trump it's a disgrace larry claiming thank you
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:51:00.400]  so much for your courage and all your work it's just surreal to be involved in the middle of this
[2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:05.120]  and i know you've had the one case against this against the nsa that won and you were involved
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:10.000]  in so many other great movements and now to see you know this this whole database of surveillance
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:15.600]  over myself and so many others it's crazy thank you so much god bless you are alex thank you absolutely
[2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:20.400]  there goes larry claiming we had uh william benny formerly technical head of the nsa and we had
[2:51:20.400 --> 2:51:27.760]  tonto peranto the hero ben gazi on these guests 99 out of 100 are accurate none of us are perfect
[2:51:27.760 --> 2:51:32.720]  but we try to tell the truth we try to get it right but sometimes you know the innocent or those
[2:51:32.720 --> 2:51:36.560]  that are questionable get harmed we have to also admit we've been wrong that's what all this is
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:41.600]  about but our hearts are the right place we're trying to change the world we got nick baggage
[2:51:41.600 --> 2:51:46.640]  coming up with the great david knight in studio i'm going to be joining him as well for part of it
[2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:53.440]  coming up but first an important piece here uh when it comes to being accurate dealing with pizza
[2:51:53.440 --> 2:52:08.720]  gate here it is alex jones here with an important note to our viewing listening and reading audiences
[2:52:09.280 --> 2:52:13.680]  i'm going to read to you from a statement that's also posted to info wars dot com
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:19.200]  that i wrote yesterday last fall before the presidential election a large number of media
[2:52:19.200 --> 2:52:23.680]  outlets began reporting on allegations arising from emails released by wiki leaks that appeared
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:28.880]  to come from john podesta who served president clinton and obama and was the chairman of hillary
[2:52:28.880 --> 2:52:34.560]  clinton's presidential campaign dozens of those stories and articles raised or discussed theories
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:40.240]  that some of podesta's emails contained code words for human trafficking and or pedophilia
[2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:46.480]  stories also included allegations connecting members of the democratic party with a number of
[2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:52.720]  restaurants allegedly involved with a child sex ring these stories were cited and discussed in
[2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:58.560]  social media and went viral on the internet one of the persons mentioned in many of the stories in
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:04.640]  the media was a washington dc restaurant owner named james aliphantus and his pizza restaurant
[2:53:04.640 --> 2:53:11.200]  comet ping pong it is fair to say that mr aliphantz is a prominent individual who has been
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:16.960]  mentioned as a power player in washington mr aliphantz and his restaurant were mentioned in
[2:53:16.960 --> 2:53:23.280]  many stories published by a lot of different outlets mr aliphantz was quoted in many subsequent
[2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:29.840]  stories and he denied any involvement in such reported child sex rings these denials were
[2:53:29.840 --> 2:53:35.440]  reported in the national media and many other outlets and news websites the volume of stories
[2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:40.560]  was substantial generating national headlines and came to be known across the country as
[2:53:40.560 --> 2:53:46.880]  pizza gate we at info wars became part of that national discussion we broadcast commentary about
[2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:53.120]  the allegations and the theory that the emails contained code words we raised questions about
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:58.640]  information and mr podesta's emails and in the comic ping pong restaurant we believe at the time
[2:53:58.640 --> 2:54:05.360]  that further investigation was necessary in december of 2016 we disassociated ourselves
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:10.880]  from the pizza gate claims and theories a position we reiterated last month after being
[2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:17.600]  contacted by mr aliphantz in late february of 2017 we received a letter from mr aliphantz
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:23.200]  asking that we retract certain statements that he says were made in seven of our broadcast
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:30.000]  between the last week of november and the first week of december in 2016 we have attempted through
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:36.160]  our lawyers to contact mr aliphantz to discuss with him what sort of statement he would like to
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:44.000]  seem made in our commentary about what had become known as pizza gate i made comments about mr aliphantz
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:50.960]  that in hindsight i regret and for which i apologize to him we were participating in a
[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:56.160]  discussion that was being written about by scores of media outlets in one of the most
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:02.160]  hotly contested and disputed political environments our country has ever seen we relied on third party
[2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:07.120]  accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant we also relied on accounts of
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:13.360]  reporters who are no longer with us this was an ever-evolving story which had a huge amount of
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:20.000]  commentary about it across many many media outlets as i have said before what became a heightened
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:26.480]  focus on mr aliphantz and comic ping pong by many media outlets was not appropriate to my knowledge
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:31.600]  today neither mr aliphantz nor his restaurant comic ping pong were involved in any human trafficking
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:37.120]  as was part of the theories about pizza gate that were being written about in the media outlets and
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:43.040]  which we commented upon i want our viewers and listeners to know that we regret any negative
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:48.720]  impact our commentaries may have had on mr aliphantz comic ping pong or its employees
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:54.240]  we apologize to the extent our commentaries could be considered as negative statements
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:59.520]  about mr aliphantz or comic ping pong and we hope that anyone else involved in commenting
[2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:04.640]  on pizza gate will do the same thing here's what we've done to clarify to the public
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:10.400]  months ago we took down the majority of broadcasts and videos including ones that only
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:16.320]  passingly mentioned pizza gate this happened months before we were even contacted by mr aliphantz
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:22.320]  mr aliphantz has objected to portions of seven particular radio slash tv broadcast we have taken
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:27.040]  down those seven broadcasts and we have attempted to take down any broadcasts that mentioned mr
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:33.280]  aliphantz or comic ping pong we have attempted to do so not just on our website but also on social
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:39.600]  media sites such as our youtube channel if mr aliphantz has any other objections we invite
[2:56:39.600 --> 2:56:44.480]  him to let us know two reporters who used to be associated with us are no longer with us
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:50.400]  in a recent broadcast i invited mr aliphantz on our program to state what he wanted to and i again
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:57.040]  do so here he has given interviews to many media outlets and he is welcome to come on our show
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:57:01.840]  in issuing the statement we are not admitting that mr aliphantz or his restaurants have any
[2:57:01.840 --> 2:57:08.000]  legal claim we do not believe they do but we are issuing this statement because we believe it's
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:12.960]  the right thing to do it will be no surprise to you that we will fight for children our
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:18.480]  you that we will fight for children across america but the pizza gate narrative as least as
[2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:24.160]  concerning mr aliphantz and comic ping pong we have subsequently determined was based upon what
[2:57:24.160 --> 2:57:30.160]  we now believe was an incorrect narrative despite the fact that we were far from the genesis of
[2:57:30.160 --> 2:57:35.920]  this story it is never easy to admit when your commentaries are based on an accurate information
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:41.360]  but we feel like we owe it to you the listeners viewers and supporters to make that statement
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:47.200]  and to give an apology to you and mr aliphantz when we do we encourage you to hold us accountable
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:56.160]  because we improve when you do and again ladies and gentlemen that was we got distracted off by
[2:57:56.160 --> 2:58:01.920]  msm on the stuff in dc when it was all going on in new york and that's why day one i saw it and i
[2:58:01.920 --> 2:58:07.200]  saw the media and i said get off that and i did that because we're not psychopaths we actually
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:12.480]  look at what's reality and then focus on that we don't go like msm with all their dis info and just
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:17.280]  cold-bloodily spew lies this person's a racist this person's this this person's that you know just
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:21.520]  because it gets us ahead what we're doing we're all about integrity and that's why we make mistakes
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:28.320]  by covering msm focusing on it in the huge debate we will absolutely own up to it and make right
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:33.040]  for it as we just did all right ladies and gentlemen we're about to start hour number four

[3:00:37.040 --> 3:00:40.720]  tnews we didn't get to do today but we i think it's pretty powerful broadcast we got to a lot of it
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:46.720]  a lot of big guests but coming up uh i've known this guy 20 years over the phone and on skype but
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:51.200]  i've been personally so amazing when i go to dinner tonight and of course his daughter nick baggage
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:55.840]  he's going to be co-hosting with david night coming up in the studio in like six seven minutes
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:02.720]  he's tuned in you saw me with that little pizza gate correction retraction thing
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:08.240]  and i and i did that because i went and looked at what we were covering other people were putting
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:13.920]  out and a lot of it i was like you know that's not a real menu that's bs and i'm like take it all down
[3:01:13.920 --> 3:01:19.680]  and and some people see it as weakness that i i jerked a bunch of it no i don't accuse people
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:26.000]  of stuff there's not proof i i don't care if i'm covered when other people said i get the fact
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:30.960]  we're covered from that but i don't like it when you know alex balvin gets up and says the president's
[3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:36.160]  racist and he got it from alex jones but i'm the opposite of a racist so i don't like what they do
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:41.520]  to me show when i see something where okay i get it we're covering already a big controversy
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:44.320]  so we're not the ones doing it still i need the high ground
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:50.720]  and some people say well that's that's you know you just didn't you know whatever act you know
[3:01:50.720 --> 3:01:55.680]  that's what i do and i feel good doing that so you know we kind of get bullied and attacked and
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:02.000]  stuff over covering up connecticut and newtown and we're covering up pizza gate and all this stuff
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:06.960]  no we're not we were exposing what was in wiki leaks that had some really suspicious stuff in new
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:11.920]  york and other areas the media focused on what was happening at that pizza place because there
[3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:15.840]  was nothing going on there i've had crews in there three times eating dinner undercover and
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:20.080]  stuff you know they say it's great pizza and none of it's going on and that was just total
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:25.920]  from my opinion the globalists knowing we've got them in new york and just creating a straw man
[3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:31.120]  the media focused in on had their bots put it out and that'll happen so i'm done talking about
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:37.360]  pizza gate forever um you know even if you're trying to be completely accurate you can never
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:42.000]  be totally accurate but in this world covering a big event maybe like if the internet wanted to
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:46.400]  cover a Loch Ness monster in town lake in austin and i know the Loch Ness monsters not real but
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:49.440]  it's the biggest story ever about the Loch Ness monster we're going to cover the Loch Ness monster
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:54.240]  and say is it real does it turn out we believe the Loch Ness monster no is the catholic church
[3:02:54.240 --> 3:03:01.840]  been caught running pettifall rings absolutely has a boys town and you know penn state and the
[3:03:01.840 --> 3:03:07.120]  Vatican and all these other groups and is that a control system in congress is that going on
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:12.640]  absolutely it's going on but just because a bunch of bad stuff is going on we can't then look at
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:18.400]  every cloud in the sky like don keody and see windmills we've got a slag as their giants that's
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:22.720]  what i'm saying because they call us fake news all day when they're the ones that lie about
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:27.840]  wmds and iraq they're the ones that lie and say trump wouldn't be inspired on they're the ones
[3:03:27.840 --> 3:03:32.400]  that say trumps gonna lose the numbers show different they're the ones that spew this
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:41.760]  propaganda that obama cares free and it's not but the integrity we have is that we actually tell the
[3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:46.160]  truth when we stumble into something and start reporting on it and find out it's a load of crap
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:51.600]  and of course the media wants to make us the creators and progenitors of pizza gate when
[3:03:51.600 --> 3:03:56.880]  they're the ones as a distraction but it doesn't matter because people that are potentially innocent
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:03.280]  some weirdness going on there undoubtedly can't just be demonized and blamed for something and
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:09.040]  we can't do that or we become what we're claiming we're fighting my strength is that i'm honorable
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:16.320]  some people see that as a weakness it's not i i did it because i i really only say what i believe
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:21.120]  and you start seeing stuff going on the reporters or whatever you're like whoa whoa and they mean
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:26.000]  well too it's just that stuff is out of control you gotta dial it back and i think that's why
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:29.840]  the media and the rest of them targeted us saying we're the creators of all this when everybody
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:34.880]  knows we're not why foxes put out fake edited tapes i'm talking about hillary funding child
[3:04:34.880 --> 3:04:38.720]  murder and you know the middle east and they say i said it was happening in some pizza place
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:42.240]  and when i finally clicked that about a week into it i said this is a setup
[3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:48.160]  not by the people that are being set up by it we're being set up too but by the larger situation
[3:04:48.160 --> 3:04:53.600]  show coming up in studio dr nick baggage and another engineer david night please support us
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:57.200]  we got a lot of specials that end this weekend then four store dot com and we need that fun
[3:04:57.200 --> 3:05:03.040]  thing to go to the next level thank you all appearing on the drug report this morning potential
[3:05:03.040 --> 3:05:08.560]  smoking gun showed obama administration despite on trump team source says republican congressional
[3:05:08.560 --> 3:05:13.280]  investigators expect a potential smoking gun establishing that the obama administration
[3:05:13.280 --> 3:05:18.160]  despite on the trump transition team and possibly the president elect himself intelligence committee
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:22.720]  chair david newness from california has said he expects that the nsa will provide him this
[3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:27.360]  smoking gun evidence the intelligence is said to leave no doubt that the obama administration
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:32.240]  in its closing days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on
[3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:37.040]  president elect trump according to sources and basically it boils down to this while it's legal
[3:05:37.040 --> 3:05:41.920]  for the deep state to collect intelligence on foreign targets it's not legal for the names of
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:47.120]  us citizens to be unmasked this was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports now
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:52.720]  looking back at trump's march forth wiretapping tweets it seems he was right all along soon
[3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:57.920]  we will find out if obama administration officials are too big to jail rob do reporting for info

[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:27.760]  war welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and joining me now is dr
[3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:32.240]  nick begich and of course he's been interviewed by alex jones and many of the crew the last
[3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:37.200]  couple of days were fortunate enough to have him here in austin in studio and so we want to take
[3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:42.560]  the opportunity to talk to dr begich about some other issues and one of the things i was looking
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:47.520]  at dr begich while i was looking at your books here that you wrote back in 2000 2003 earth rising
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:53.120]  revolution toward a thousand years of peace you were talking at the time about the revolution
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:58.320]  and military effects its impact on freedom and of course how the technology impacts upon all
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:03.120]  that right and what i want to talk to you about today since you have a scientific background
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:09.280]  is it's just to lay this out for individuals who are not caught up in the actual technology
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:14.080]  aspect of it because when i talk to engineers and scientists many of them are so caught up in the
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:17.760]  details and the capability of what they can do it's like a puzzle to them it's an intellectual
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:22.240]  exercise right right right they love that and and it is so seductive as a matter of fact i
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:27.200]  talked to hugo de garis who wrote a book called artillek wars and he was talking about how he
[3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:34.240]  believes that he's creating some new artificial intelligence that is going to attack mankind
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:39.200]  and and he's very concerned about that but he is drawn to it like a moth to a flame right because
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:47.280]  he wants to be the one to create that so he has this this confliction within his within him to
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:51.920]  look at this and yet most people don't even think about that most scientists and engineers that i
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:55.600]  talked to don't even think about the consequences of what they're doing and when you're talking in
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:03.200]  your books here about the implication of non-lethal warfare right and and how dangerous that is because
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:09.120]  that gives so much power to a few individuals who see today uh director comey fbi director comey is
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:13.680]  now meeting with donald trump in the white house this article from bloomberg that came out two days
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:17.600]  ago comey is now the most powerful person in washington how did he get there well it's all of
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:22.000]  this surveillance stuff that's there besides the politics right when you add that technology mix to
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:27.200]  the macavelian politics that is always around a very powerful political situation there it's a
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:31.840]  dangerous mix isn't it it is in fact um one of the documents that we point to frequently is a
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:36.240]  document the revolution of military affairs complex short of war which was put together
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:41.200]  by the us army war college it seems like it was like the late 80s and they were talking about sort
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:45.520]  of what was happening in the trend in technology as it affects military science and one of the
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:50.800]  things they were saying back then was that it would be the kind of revolution in technology
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:55.360]  that would be similar to when gunpowder was introduced in europe in in the middle ages
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:02.240]  uh or nuclear weapons in an atomic weapons in the last century um this new system is deals with
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:08.720]  both the surveillance side uh and and really the attacking the operator but not in the same traditional
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:14.640]  sense of bullets bombs and ordnance things that tear tear things up but utilizing energy itself as a
[3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:19.120]  basic um component of the weapons systems so whether it's high powered lasers which we're
[3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:23.920]  reading a lot about today in fact that is where the action is when they built the missile defense
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:28.320]  system and ask where bullets we're going to try and hit bullets right ridiculous i mean the real
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:33.920]  story is speed of light weapons this is energy based weapon technologies when you extend this out
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:39.520]  and start looking at what we were saying in in 2000 even before was this trend was in fact the
[3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:44.320]  trend that we were headed into and what the u.s military college said in their in their written
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:50.240]  report was that these very technologies because of some of them the implications of them they would
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:55.360]  violate the american constitution yeah and what they and they say in their own papers and they say
[3:11:55.360 --> 3:12:00.000]  even though it's going to violate them um instead of stopping there where you think the universities
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:05.680]  are teaching our military professionals would stop um they went and said here's how we do it
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:09.520]  and what it was precisely what isan howell was warning us about it he's exactly about the
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:14.080]  military industrial complex he talked about the military academic industrial that's right is that
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:16.560]  they're going to take over all your science research they're going to take it over at the
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:20.080]  university level and that's where they're going to push this information and we go back and we
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:24.800]  look at there was a very interesting book and alex interviewed the author i listened to it on audio
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:29.360]  book it's called the pentagon's brain talking about darpa going back to its origins especially
[3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:36.160]  as it started rising through vietnam the particular group called the the jason's and and so you know
[3:12:36.160 --> 3:12:41.520]  going through all of that and looking at what they developed the fact that we had a psychologist who
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:47.120]  created the internet is the dr linklider okay who created the intergalactic computer network
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:52.640]  which they then just shortened to the internet he was looking at it as a tool of control and for
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.080]  the longest time i was an engineer i was very optimistic that we were going to take these
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:01.680]  tools that they had created we're going to turn them into instruments of freedom and that is a
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:06.560]  struggle that we still face going forward will we be able to seize those tools and turn them into
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:12.160]  instruments of freedom or will they accomplish their intended purpose and so that's the the real
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:17.360]  struggle that is before us i'm somewhat now as i look at this and the direction we're going now
[3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:22.480]  i'm not as optimistic as i once was well i you know i still i still think it has an opportunity
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:26.160]  only in the sense that at least we're all talking to each other you know and at least we're getting
[3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:29.680]  information even though they're monitoring everything we're still exchanging it and i think
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:35.040]  that's a fundamental um maybe the most important thing right now is that we actually are getting
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:39.520]  some information um internet provides sort of an equal playing field around the world at least
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:44.400]  in gathering data um i think it kind of is a double edged sword again you know it depends on
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:49.600]  who's who's uh wielding it you know and and it really depends on on how effective they are at
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:53.680]  controlling the population and this is really critical because when you start to look at the
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:59.200]  overlay of technologies the ability to manipulate populations not just with the standard propaganda
[3:13:59.200 --> 3:14:06.880]  but actually enforcing that um by being able to even override certain systems uh within our within
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:13.200]  our physiology and even our psychology the in fact um controlled effects is a concept that
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:18.880]  military has been looking at from a number of a number of aspects there was an article
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:24.000]  that was published by the electromagnetic directorate of the air force which most people
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:29.280]  you know exist but but what they were talking about was controlled effects for essentially
[3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:32.560]  doing the several things one is attacking hardware which we can all understand you know
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:37.280]  overriding um hardware the second was overriding the software that drives hardware you know the
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:41.520]  things that run the computers to be able to disrupt them and then the third aspect was
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:47.680]  overriding the human being yes and this is the real hindering the human domain exactly and and
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:53.120]  and what we're talking about here is um literally interfering with human brain function because the
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:56.480]  idea was that if hey if you could interfere with the brain function then none of the equipment
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:01.280]  matters anyway none of the computers matter anyway and so that became sort of the the higher target
[3:15:01.280 --> 3:15:05.280]  and one of the articles in uh technology horizons again produced by the air force
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:08.800]  they talked about controlled effects and and the direction in which they're headed
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:15.200]  and this is published in um june of uh 2004 and what they said back then was they would be able to
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:21.360]  create memory sets duplicate all of the senses of a human being sight sound smell touch taste
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:27.360]  to the point where they could create um mental hallucinations if you will that were so real
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:33.120]  you couldn't determine whether they were real memories or something else now the implications
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:38.880]  that are huge when you think about um trials and courts uh 30 years from now say if this kind of
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:43.520]  technology is is developed and and widely used and they portray that as saying well we want to
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:48.320]  help soldiers who are suffering from PTSD so we want to help them we want to be able to go in
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:53.120]  and selectively remove memories well then they'll be able to also selectively implant memories as
[3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:59.440]  well if they do that and people don't understand just how much uh resources have been allocated
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:04.400]  to understanding and manipulating the human brain and we have the brain project that was
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:08.560]  funded by barack obama i forget exactly the amount of money i believe it was hundreds of millions
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:12.400]  of dollars over a few years that they're pouring into this it's a tremendous amount of money that
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:17.440]  is being poured into that coming after the individual mind but then the other part of this
[3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:23.920]  is the hive mind right okay and that's where they want to get your metadata okay people think well
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:29.040]  you know i'm not a uh i'm i'm not really very political i'm not sharing a lot of articles
[3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:34.240]  that are controversial uh that i would be the focus of the government so i don't really have
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:39.280]  anything to worry about but they're interested in you especially if you're not particularly
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:43.760]  political because they want to know if their narrative is winning right so they have to have
[3:16:43.760 --> 3:16:50.080]  a way to collect all of that metadata and to look at it to look at your activity based uh
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:53.920]  they call it activity based intelligence they call it human domain analytics and it's all part of
[3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:58.480]  geospatial intelligence they want to map all these individuals onto a political map onto a
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:03.280]  geographical map uh and they want to know if their narrative is succeeding so they're looking at the
[3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:08.320]  hive mind and then they're very interested in manipulating interesting individuals minds
[3:17:08.320 --> 3:17:13.920]  and right right right very sinister very pervasive all you know encompassing well and this covers
[3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:18.480]  everything not just government it's as private industry uh private sector i mean the the development
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:24.880]  of data and the value of data is is huge um and the idea of being able to profile people on an
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:30.480]  individual basis this is where it is today and where and where it was intended to go 20 years ago
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:35.440]  when we first started reporting on it and the rationale is exactly what you're saying is is
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:40.080]  you can kind of look at sort of the whole trend in which way you're sort of shoving the culture
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:44.800]  and at the same time you can isolate the leadership and when you isolate the leadership any anybody
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:49.200]  who knows classical organizing that's what you do you isolate the leadership and then you manipulate
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:55.200]  the leadership and then you take the movement and and this is why um why i strongly believe in a
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:02.000]  headless revolution yes and this is the one that wins because when a revolution begins within each
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:07.440]  individual person there is no head there's just the accountability of knowing and following your
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:12.240]  truth that's the revolution in fact if you read military literature that's the revolution they
[3:18:12.240 --> 3:18:17.200]  cannot stop that's right it it has to be it has to be at the lower level at the grass level and
[3:18:17.200 --> 3:18:21.680]  that's what really concerns me the most about the internet and that's what's changed me from being an
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:26.880]  optimist to a pessimist about our future because when i look at what's happening here i understand
[3:18:26.880 --> 3:18:30.960]  that we have good people we have white hat hackers we have people like wiki leaks who have put these
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:36.800]  documents out and said look at what they've done look at the fact that we have uh this this thing
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:41.920]  that they call umbridge where they collect these techniques to make them look like their foreign
[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:45.600]  government when they really aren't where they've created all these hacks where they refuse to fix
[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:49.760]  these hacks julien assange was just talking about how they made it known to a lot of these
[3:18:49.760 --> 3:18:55.360]  different technical companies google in particular said here are the vulnerabilities that the cia
[3:18:55.360 --> 3:19:01.680]  funded collected and then lost or released and they're not interested in fixing this and so he
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:06.160]  said we're going to put out another bit of information tell you which companies are not
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:13.920]  fixing their stuff and also have a lot of ties to classified contracts but when i look at the
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:18.640]  information that's coming out there it's like when i saw the snowden release when i saw vault seven
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:24.800]  it's like yes now the people will understand but they don't they don't get it because they are so
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:28.800]  tied into this narrative where they want to believe anything that comes out of authority that's why
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:32.640]  we have this russian hack narrative that has gone on for how many months if there was anything there
[3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:37.600]  they would have released it by now but they continue to bring this out right because of people's
[3:19:38.240 --> 3:19:43.120]  confirmation bias because they're political bias they choose to believe that there's some
[3:19:43.120 --> 3:19:47.440]  russian quote-unquote hacking going on and they won't pull this back we'll talk about this more
[3:19:47.440 --> 3:19:53.040]  on the other side of this we're going to talk about uh would you go down this road if google tells
[3:19:53.040 --> 3:19:56.640]  you on your map would you drive down a road that will actually kill you and we've had several
[3:19:56.640 --> 3:20:00.000]  incidents of this happening that's the road we're all going down stay with us we'll be right back

[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:55.760]  edition and the fact that we have put 20 off all the other 80% lowers that you'll find at info wars
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:03.120]  store.com Dr. Begich as we're talking during the break you were talking about the bargain the
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:07.600]  fastium bargain that was talked about back in the 1980s that particular program that you mentioned
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:14.240]  the last segment so they're going to get everybody to trade their security and their privacy for the
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:18.160]  or their their liberty and their and their privacy for the promise of security but it's not working
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:23.200]  out too well for us is it when we look at what we see with vault seven we understand that not only
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:27.920]  have they funded and created these exploits as Aaron Schwartz warned us when he was fighting
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:33.600]  syspa before they killed him i believe that they killed him uh but he he warned us that they were
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:39.200]  doing that and now we see with these vault seven documents that they not only let this stuff out
[3:26:39.200 --> 3:26:44.880]  into the wild uh but they refuse to fix it so when they tell you that they're going to spy on
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:49.360]  everybody they're going to create these cyber burglary tools and they're going to make you safer
[3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:53.280]  because of that just understand that what they have done is they've kicked your door and and they
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:58.640]  refuse to let you fix the lock that that is correct and you know when our founding fathers
[3:26:58.640 --> 3:27:01.920]  decided privacy was an important thing they actually thought about a physical doorway but
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:06.320]  that is not the doorway to your privacy in the 21st century it's your digital doorway that's right
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:10.160]  and that's the one they are kicking in and and the fact of the matter is your data should be
[3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:17.280]  owned by you uh the only time it should be available is if you purposefully directly release it not
[3:27:17.280 --> 3:27:22.480]  that you excuse somebody for exploiting you that should be absolutely forbidden if we really wanted
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:27.280]  to see return to privacy that would be the first step is returning our our information and not
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:32.160]  allowing commercial enterprises to retain it beyond the point of a legal dispute and usually the
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:36.720]  statute of limitations on financial disputes run one to three years in most states that should be
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:41.040]  the limit of holding data your ability to dispute a credit card bill is six months that that ought
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:46.640]  to disappear once it's usefulness in terms of litigation is over it should be over two and
[3:27:46.640 --> 3:27:51.280]  you should retain it uh that is not the way it works uh the cameras are pointed the wrong direction
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:55.440]  they're pointed at the population and they're not allowed to know anything from this dark government
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:28:00.560]  all like you said the cameras are all pointed at us they our life is an open book but we're not allowed
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:05.120]  to know anything we don't even are not allowed to know the details of particular bills and we're
[3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:09.600]  seeing this again now with this health care bill that they created in private that they're putting
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:13.760]  this out and oh by the way this is coming up for a vote this vote is going to be starting uh real
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:18.320]  shortly and we're going to show you some clips as uh this vote begins but they're going to finish the
[3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:24.640]  voting at 3 p.m and we're going to go live rob do is going to cover that at 3 p.m going to talk
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:29.360]  about the result of the health care vote you can see they're now beginning the process it's going
[3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:34.000]  to take them at least a half hour to do this voting process that's going to end at 3 o'clock and then
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:38.960]  he's going to come in and talk about um the results of this and the implications of this
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:43.200]  where does it go forward it'll take your calls what do you think about this health care bill
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:48.400]  and uh so that's another example though I think of what we continue to see right the fact that
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:53.040]  everything is closely sought with the tpp you're not allowed to see this right elected representatives
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:58.160]  are not allowed to see this and they have to sign if they look at it they can't tell anybody that
[3:28:58.160 --> 3:29:03.840]  right that's what they saw in that that's the dark state that we see that this is so reversed
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:07.440]  from what it ought to be totally upside down in fact the cameras ought to be pointing in every
[3:29:07.440 --> 3:29:11.440]  government office we ought to be able to access online every government office that we're paying
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:16.160]  for because we are the employers it's not the other way around we're the employers we should
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:19.600]  have access to our employees and see what they're doing to serve our interest in our national
[3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:24.400]  interests that are not ours multinational interests that are not ours the the fact is
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:28.720]  when you really look at the technology and how it's evolved it's evolved as a tool against
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:33.440]  the sovereignty of the individual human being yes that's what needs to change yes that is what is so
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:38.400]  dangerous that is what we have to wake up in the american public the idea that you cannot trade
[3:29:38.400 --> 3:29:43.360]  your liberty for freedom or for security or for safety you cannot trade your privacy
[3:29:43.360 --> 3:29:51.040]  for security or safety stay with us and be right back with dr beggar we're on the march
[3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:56.400]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.600]  appearing on the drudge report this morning potential smoking gun showed obama administration
[3:30:05.600 --> 3:30:10.400]  spied on trump team source says republican congressional investigators expect a potential
[3:30:10.400 --> 3:30:15.760]  smoking gun establishing that the obama administration despite on the trump transition team and possibly
[3:30:15.760 --> 3:30:20.960]  the president elect himself intelligence committee chair david newness from california has said he
[3:30:20.960 --> 3:30:25.920]  expects that the nsa will provide him this smoking gun evidence the intelligence is said to leave no
[3:30:25.920 --> 3:30:30.240]  doubt that the obama administration in its closing days was using the cover of legitimate
[3:30:30.240 --> 3:30:35.360]  surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect trump according to sources and basically it
[3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:40.560]  boils down to this while it's legal for the deep state to collect intelligence on foreign targets
[3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:45.680]  it's not legal for the names of us citizens to be unmasked this was done and was disseminated
[3:30:45.680 --> 3:30:50.720]  through intelligence reports now looking back at trump's march fourth wiretapping tweets it seems
[3:30:50.720 --> 3:30:56.560]  he was right all along soon we will find out if obama administration officials are too big to
[3:30:56.560 --> 3:31:01.920]  jail rob dew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news it's not just our water we
[3:31:01.920 --> 3:31:06.560]  need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be clean it's the air we're breathing especially
[3:31:06.560 --> 3:31:12.960]  for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune

[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:13.680]  thing here the american system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world
[3:32:13.680 --> 3:32:18.800]  individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective well you know the next one's gonna be

[3:32:30.080 --> 3:32:36.000]  see what drums up against it's time to ride boys we need a thousand paul with ears when i was a boy
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:44.240]  it was okay to be proud of the flag heritage mom and apple pie and beef was for supper revelation
[3:32:44.240 --> 3:32:50.560]  dawn of global government the actical screenings on demand dvds now available star in alex jones
[3:32:50.560 --> 3:32:56.560]  charlie daniels special ops general jerry boykin want to shed some tears over the red white and
[3:32:56.560 --> 3:33:11.360]  blue revelation the movie dot info let's fix it you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex
[3:33:11.360 --> 3:33:26.560]  jones show and now your host david night welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here
[3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:33.200]  with dr nick begge and we've been talking about the juncture of technology and liberty of course you
[3:33:33.200 --> 3:33:37.520]  cannot give up your liberty to get your safety as we've been saying or privacy you should understand
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:45.600]  that from vault seven but as i said before the real key to all of this is the hive mind if you
[3:33:45.600 --> 3:33:50.720]  will that they're trying to manipulate that they're trying to measure with geospatial intelligence
[3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:56.480]  human domain analytics we saw this with jade helm i believe that jade helm was largely a psychological
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:03.680]  operation we've had the green braze and special forces really we think of them as kinetic operations
[3:34:03.680 --> 3:34:07.120]  where they're jumping out of planes and they're doing other things like that but the key thing
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:11.440]  that they have always focused on is identifying the people who are going to support them in a
[3:34:11.440 --> 3:34:15.440]  particular country whether it's here in america or abroad right and then understanding who those
[3:34:15.440 --> 3:34:19.280]  leaders are and then knowing who's going to be on their side and who's going to be against them
[3:34:19.280 --> 3:34:23.920]  knowing whether or not they can manipulate public opinion and that's a key thing with all of this
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:29.440]  when we look at geospatial intelligence and the fact that they can collect your metadata where
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:33.840]  they can look and see whether their narrative whether it's telling you that the russians
[3:34:33.840 --> 3:34:37.680]  hacked our election is that succeeding or not well they're going to be looking at your metadata to
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:42.480]  see if people are sharing that information their comments that they're making about that and i
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:48.080]  think one of the things that really concerns me as i move forward is the idea that this this
[3:34:48.080 --> 3:34:52.400]  surveillance net is really tightening around us we see the internet of things and of course we have
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:34:57.760]  a lot of mocking done by steven co-bear when teleconway said you know your television is
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:02.000]  watching you your phone is watching it yes we we know all of that we know that from the
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:06.160]  stoden documents samsung and others have admitted it we know that from the other documents and she
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:11.120]  says and your microwave might be videotaping it well they started a microwave as a camera and they
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:14.960]  they came out and made a lot of fun of that but of course it was david patrice five years a day
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:19.200]  before that they said we're going to be using all your appliances to monitor you the internet of
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:25.840]  things but now joining that is the car and i just want to remind people this happened back on march
[3:35:25.840 --> 3:35:32.960]  17th this woman went to the grand canyon she was using google to find her way around in her car
[3:35:33.680 --> 3:35:39.280]  and it got her lost she ran out of gas in a remote area was stuck for five days nearly
[3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:45.600]  died she's 24 years old and you look at this and you say oh how at what point do we stop
[3:35:45.600 --> 3:35:51.040]  believing and trusting these sources and this goes back you've been around while we're about the
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:56.240]  same age so you know how much people would trust a computer readout right and now they trust everything
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:36:00.960]  that they get on their iphone whether it's the news or whether it's google maps they don't question
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:06.560]  it and of course we had two years ago a fellow and his wife up in chicago they were following gps
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:11.760]  and the man literally drove it off the bridge you know if the if the car tells you if google maps
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:17.120]  tells you go jump off a bridge would you do it your yes people would literally go jump off a bridge
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:20.560]  you know the thing where your dad used to tell you would they would you jump off a bridge if they tell
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:25.600]  you well they will it killed his wife it seriously injured him then we had five years before that
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:31.360]  back in 2010 we had a woman who sued google at the time because she got hit by a car she followed
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:36.480]  google maps direction got hit by a car but people have gotten lost in remote areas the question is
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:44.400]  will people exercise their ability to think independently or will they become controlled
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:49.920]  sheep i i think there is really two segments population unfortunately the majority is in
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:36:56.080]  the controlled sheep category these days and when you think about this and most people actually
[3:36:56.080 --> 3:37:00.240]  don't that's that is the problem i think that's why the alternative media is the only answer right
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:05.840]  now for starting to wake people up and has been i think it has been steadily for quite a while
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:12.160]  the thing i would say about all that is when you think about a total surveillance state
[3:37:12.160 --> 3:37:17.600]  and people remember when that came out during the cheney period everybody's screen bloody murder well
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:21.600]  total information awareness right and everyone remembers it well we're there now they just
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:27.360]  gave it new names and subcategories and split it up among a bunch of agencies and 17 right and so
[3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:33.280]  here we are at the same place that the republicans were going to take us the democrats took us here
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:36.800]  yes okay it was under obama that all this happened yes remember all the promises about
[3:37:36.800 --> 3:37:40.720]  restoring liberty and freedom and shutting down guantanamo and ending the torture and
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:45.600]  ending all this stuff it never ended just get new names new classifications and it intensified
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:49.600]  and it actually intensified obama was the first president to be at war for his entire eight years
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:54.080]  right he increased the number of nations that we were war three or four to seven right he came
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:37:58.720]  after the nsa whistleblowers thomas drake was not prosecuted by the bush administration he was
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:02.880]  prosecuted by the obama administration right he went after more journalists and whistleblowers
[3:38:02.880 --> 3:38:08.720]  and all the other presidents combined in the last 100 years on the 1917 espionage act that is
[3:38:08.720 --> 3:38:12.880]  something that the left gave him a complete pass on why because they liked him yeah and i think it's
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:16.800]  one of the things that freaks them out so much about donald trump they don't like donald trump
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:25.040]  and they understand that they that they tacitly gave all this power to obama right and said we're
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:29.920]  fine with it because we like him and we want him to have dictatorial powers we want him to use
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:34.720]  executive orders we want him to use a surveillance state and now they find somebody that they don't
[3:38:34.720 --> 3:38:38.320]  like and we said at the time we said you know you're gonna get a republican you don't like someday
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:43.360]  that they may be very soon and that day is now exactly right all these people that are out there
[3:38:43.360 --> 3:38:47.680]  saying not my president that'd be saying what they really mean is not my dictator right because
[3:38:47.680 --> 3:38:52.560]  they want a dictator they just don't want this dictator and you know this question of again
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:57.040]  gets back to american fundamental values and this is where they've been lost is the fact of the matter
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:01.840]  is we had three branches of government each of them with with their own strength um too much power
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:06.560]  got concentrated in the executive i would totally agree with that it was misused um but it wasn't
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:11.200]  real back either and this is and this is everybody's fault in terms of the congress and and our
[3:39:11.200 --> 3:39:16.560]  general population when you when you talk about um internet manipulation we were talking about that
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:21.120]  is terms of electronic component of you know pbs did a special called the worldwide mind
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:27.280]  where they believe that the next generation won't require hardware that every mind will be linked
[3:39:27.280 --> 3:39:33.280]  yes oh yeah now oh this is a huge jump forward because to do this artificially is one thing
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:37.680]  because i think we already do this naturally i think this is one of the things that that we we
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:42.560]  are as human beings we're just kind of unaware of it on some level our communication happens at that
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:49.440]  level um but the idea of artificially linking all the minds in the world now you want to talk
[3:39:49.440 --> 3:39:54.160]  about control on a whole new level not just being reported by pbs okay a mainstream as you get and
[3:39:54.160 --> 3:39:59.120]  of course we look at ray Kurzweil now chief scientist at google for these types of things
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:04.000]  not just the singularity and mind transference that he believes is going to happen into machines
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:07.360]  but this is precisely what they're doing precisely where they're going and of course
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:12.240]  they bought all the promising robots that are out there that's the thing that is very concerning to
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:18.080]  me is the fact that we can have the autonomous killing machines right that are under the control
[3:40:18.080 --> 3:40:23.840]  of one or two individuals right it's a mad dictator some mad uh multi-billionaire like a
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:29.440]  james bond villain but the fact that you're not going to have an individual policeman's
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:35.200]  conscience check this no okay these these things will robotically follow it they'll slavishly
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:39.600]  follow whatever they are told to do they will be brutal ruthless and when you look at these devices
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:44.320]  they're being manufactured by boston dynamic right and how they are said these things are
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:48.480]  very very disturbing to watch these even the people who sit on the sidelines and cheer this
[3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:52.960]  typically like wired magazine look at this and go oh this looks kind of dystopian and it's like
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:57.360]  it's because it is it's what it's designed to do is taking the human factor out and the human
[3:40:57.360 --> 3:41:03.680]  factor needs to be in more so now than ever because of technology the humanity needs to be put back
[3:41:03.680 --> 3:41:07.760]  into what we're doing not removed from it which is exactly what's happening stripping down the
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:14.480]  humanity where people look at each other as commodities this is the loss this is the greatest
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:19.600]  loss of all if we lose our humanity and all of this there's nothing left to say you know when
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:23.360]  we we look at the potential for this you're talking about how much more dangerous this is a nuclear
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:28.640]  weapons consider the fact that we have a massive robotic police force or robotic army or whatever
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:35.920]  but if this thing if they wanted this to buy a false flag or even buy a bug or buy somebody
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:41.120]  taking this over and and how do you know what happens was this something that was deliberately
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:45.520]  done by the people in control of it or was it taken control over by the russians and the russians
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:50.320]  uh unleash our robotic police force on us you're not going to be able to tell but the destruction
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:54.800]  that is going to happen with that the autonomous killing machines that the pentagon is working on
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:58.800]  when you look at this and they they're talking about in their documents not only the directed
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:06.400]  energy weapons but the swarms of of robotic killers on the battlefield as my son said
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:11.520]  nothing good ever comes in a swarm no and here's the thing about it too is when you take again you
[3:42:11.520 --> 3:42:15.760]  take people further and further away from the battlefield if you think back on world war two
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:19.600]  returning veterans the last thing they ever wanted to see was their children their grandchildren in a
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:25.360]  war because they still had the smell of it and taste of it the essence of it they knew what killing
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:30.480]  was about and what and as human beings that were really not geared for this this is not who we are
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:37.360]  when you remove yourself from the battlefield this changes the entire dimension it becomes easier
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:41.440]  to pull the switch like the drone assassin like the drone assassinations and even if it becomes just
[3:42:41.440 --> 3:42:46.800]  the beginning of it oh yeah and if it becomes sort of too agitated little cartoon it you know
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:52.560]  which is what they do so that you give some of that decision-making capability to the robot itself
[3:42:52.560 --> 3:42:56.480]  so you can say you're not quite involved with it right just looking at it from an aerial view
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:00.880]  and you're saying well okay this area is being overrun now by these things you're not even seeing
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:06.240]  the detailed camera work right you might have seen with as we've seen dramatized so many times now
[3:43:06.240 --> 3:43:09.840]  somebody's saying the camera work of the children that were on the ground that just got blown up
[3:43:09.840 --> 3:43:13.120]  they don't even have to see that they don't have to look at that no and they're and the way the
[3:43:13.120 --> 3:43:17.760]  software is being developed is being developed to keep that emotional peace out under the under the
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:21.520]  story of well we don't want the post-traumatic stress syndrome issues and what you were talking
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:27.280]  about before before the breaks were the idea of creating technologies that will remove memory sets
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:33.440]  or put new memory sets in this is huge because the kinds of things that we need whistleblowers for
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:39.760]  are not even going to have the memory of it this is so fundamental because when you think about
[3:43:39.760 --> 3:43:44.080]  this is the interference with free will this is the interference with our ability to think freely
[3:43:44.080 --> 3:43:49.280]  as human beings something that most religions of the world say god will not even interfere with
[3:43:49.280 --> 3:43:53.760]  our free will yet this is a very essence of what these technologies about they are
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:43:59.040]  entering the human mind to take control of a human mind and to deliberately manipulate your
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:03.440]  thinking process this is where the technology is today you know in the in the writing i've done over
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:08.800]  the last 20 years we cite hundreds of documents most of a military unclassified documents at the
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:14.240]  time that we we release the information and the trend website the publisher website it's it's
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:23.920]  earthpulse.com but there's lots of information 700 pages of free data there um DARPA reports on the
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:28.080]  mind effects and things that they've done on the stuff that's open in the public one of my good
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:32.720]  friends um who whose deceased now uh was the inventor of the harp system we became friends
[3:44:32.720 --> 3:44:38.000]  over the controversy actually um he attended a conference uh here in texas with me uh a year or
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:43.760]  so before he passed away under again suspicious circumstances but he had just met recently
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:47.760]  at that time with tony tether who was ahead of DARPA at the time and he was talking to him
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:54.080]  personally about the mind control issues and nobody's laughing at DARPA anymore is what
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:58.560]  ben eastland told me he said on a scale of one to ten this would have been a one meaning no
[3:44:58.560 --> 3:45:02.960]  meaning for him until that conversation where it became a ten for him and he attended a closed
[3:45:02.960 --> 3:45:09.120]  conference a number of other experts on this um very topic here here in texas um the conclusions
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:13.840]  were this was the most dangerous direction that we were headed um the people that i had in that
[3:45:13.840 --> 3:45:18.400]  conference alexander caverain and the former head of the biophysics lab for the ussr academy of
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:24.000]  sciences for the 10 years prior to usr's collapse um also he is a visiting professor at number
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:29.440]  universities in the united states i spent weeks with him in alaska um we had rosalie bertel when
[3:45:29.440 --> 3:45:37.600]  the leading um people on radiological um victims also a former professor at uh at stanford we had
[3:45:38.240 --> 3:45:42.640]  a number of world-class specialists in this field and the thing that shocked me the most
[3:45:42.640 --> 3:45:50.400]  uh that came out of this was where it's headed and this was what rosalie said and rosalie
[3:45:50.400 --> 3:45:55.920]  bertel beyond being a physicist and mathematician she is also a nun okay which is a really unusual
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:46:02.080]  combination but she said the next evolution of human beings was this jump to these anomalous
[3:46:02.080 --> 3:46:06.000]  human potentials the idea of being able uh to do the things that are referred to in the in the
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:11.200]  bible as gifts of the spirit extra sensory perception in some arenas this is where human
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:16.000]  beings are from the leading scientists in the world alexander caverain and gave the mathematics
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:20.720]  for how these things actually work the physics of how telepathy works how telekinesis works how
[3:46:20.720 --> 3:46:25.840]  these various things work these are attributes that human beings possess that we've forgotten
[3:46:25.840 --> 3:46:31.680]  how to reinvigorate but there is a lot of work being done in this area and this is what i believe
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:35.520]  is going to happen i think this is the next evolutionary leap that's necessary everyone in
[3:46:35.520 --> 3:46:41.680]  that room that was their consensus totally surprised me unexpected outcome was that is
[3:46:41.680 --> 3:46:45.760]  that is the direction and that is the counter measure to what we're seeing today the thing
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:49.600]  that interferes with that that interferes with our ability to reach those states of awareness
[3:46:49.600 --> 3:46:56.160]  is fear and anxiety if you look at an eeg brain activity under fear anxiety hate anger any of
[3:46:56.160 --> 3:47:00.160]  these emotions you get incoherent brain patterns not associated they're associated with flight and
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:06.800]  fight responses if you look at brains that are experiencing empathy compassion love the higher
[3:47:06.800 --> 3:47:12.000]  emotions about what we call positive emotions you see very coherent brain patterns those associated
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:16.160]  with higher over thinking altered states of awareness those states of awareness that give
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:23.360]  you those inspirational insights those sparks of intuition those creative things that actually
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:28.400]  link you back to who you are as someone created in the image of a creator with with capabilities
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:34.800]  latent within you that are waiting to arise that's the revolution that's coming is the rising of who
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:39.680]  we are as human beings the remembering of what we are as human beings and then asserting ourselves
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:46.480]  into the world not to do harm but to bring back the issue of stewardship the issue of compassion
[3:47:46.480 --> 3:47:52.240]  the issue of love if you will but those things that stabilize the world and stabilize populations
[3:47:52.240 --> 3:47:57.200]  instead of those things that tear us apart rip us to shreds and continue to devour the very
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:01.040]  essence of what we are as human beings well it's going to be interesting to see where we go with
[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:07.440]  this you know just looking at the nuts and bolts of this the the thing that is so hard to pull back
[3:48:07.440 --> 3:48:13.760]  some of this potentially damaging research that's being done by DARP and others as they always say
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:16.560]  well we're going to wind up with a gap with the other the other guys are doing it so we have to
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:20.560]  do it as well but keep going down that path the other guys are doing it so we've got to respond
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:23.760]  to it real quickly i want to interrupt this discussion because we just got a bulletin that
[3:48:23.760 --> 3:48:30.160]  the GOP health care bill has been abruptly pulled they are not going to have a vote on this we just
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:34.480]  pulled it said president trump told the washington post and a telephone interview now this is
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:38.480]  interesting because just yesterday president trump delivered an ultimatum lawmakers said
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:43.920]  that you're going to have to do this or we're going to be stuck with this so they have now
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:49.520]  canceled that vote it'll be interesting to see what happens clearly nobody was really buying this
[3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:54.880]  because i believe this is one of these things like we talked about just like tpp this had was very
[3:48:54.880 --> 3:48:59.680]  analogous when you look at tp the tpp the right thing to do was what donald trump did when he
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:04.480]  first came in said it's gone he didn't say we're going to we're going to try to fix it around the
[3:49:04.480 --> 3:49:08.800]  edges and what they tried to do with obama care was try to fix it around the edges except at the
[3:49:08.800 --> 3:49:16.160]  very center of this were some very things that were antithetical to letting us control our lives
[3:49:16.160 --> 3:49:21.200]  they were illegal they were illogical they were uneconomical they were taking us down a path that
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:26.320]  was of destruction and it's not something that you can just fix willy nilly around the edges
[3:49:26.320 --> 3:49:30.880]  i think they have to begin with repeal and we'll see what's going to happen with this now it's
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:35.760]  very interesting to see that uh let's come back and talk a little bit about the time that we've
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:38.800]  got left we've got a few more minutes here before we go to break and then we got another segment
[3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:47.200]  i want to talk about the other aspect of this and that is not just controlling us and controlling
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:53.280]  what we know and controlling the hive mind or controlling the individual mind but also putting
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:58.480]  in this infrastructure like we're talking about with the cars because they're now moving rapidly
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:02.080]  towards self-driving cars and they talk about talking cars well those cars are going to be
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:06.640]  talking about you they're going to be talking about you to the road which then reports it back
[3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:11.520]  to the government that owns this but it's also a story of individual ownership you had a lot of
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:16.640]  things to tell me when we were talking before we came on air about what had happened in Alaska
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:23.120]  when we look at the situation that was done to Indians with the Indian reservations in the 19th
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:29.120]  century and then we see they took away their ownership their their their ability to live
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:33.920]  free and independent put them in a very constrained controlled environment that's what we're really
[3:50:33.920 --> 3:50:39.520]  seeing now with the with agenda 21 with the internet of things as the cars are joining that
[3:50:39.520 --> 3:50:45.280]  controlling our movement monitoring our movement and taking away our ownership and that's what you

[3:54:19.040 --> 3:54:22.800]  this trend that we saw so many places about the indian reservation because that is where
[3:54:22.800 --> 3:54:27.200]  we are headed with agenda 21 that's what they're trying to do to everyone now they're going to
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:30.880]  control your movement they're going to monitor everything that you do and they're going to take
[3:54:30.880 --> 3:54:35.840]  away your ability to own anything that's a very important part of the self-driving cars we get
[3:54:35.840 --> 3:54:40.080]  caught up in the technology just like the scientists do we talk about all the different wonderful oh
[3:54:40.080 --> 3:54:45.840]  look you'll be able to uh surf on the internet while it's driving you around or whatever that's
[3:54:45.840 --> 3:54:50.880]  a distraction a big distraction because what you have to understand is that you're going to lose
[3:54:50.880 --> 3:54:57.120]  ownership and you're going to lose control and independent you know a kind of anonymous
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:00.880]  ability to move around just like a cashless society they want to take away your cash they
[3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:05.600]  want to take away your private car and we should view it with the same alarm that we would view
[3:55:05.600 --> 3:55:11.120]  them taking away our cash and you have to understand you're not going to be able to opt out of this
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:14.240]  and this whole thing you know like your car you're going to keep your car like obama care that's not
[3:55:14.240 --> 3:55:18.640]  going to happen they're going to have to have everybody in these cars in order for them to work
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:22.400]  i believe don't you i think in the long run that's exactly where we're headed i mean it's a more
[3:55:22.400 --> 3:55:27.200]  controlled and directed society simple as that hundred percent monitoring um you know and they say
[3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:30.880]  oh we won't use the data you know you're not a criminal but when they store the data then all
[3:55:30.880 --> 3:55:35.920]  you have to do when they decide you're a criminal yeah just go backwards and pull up the reel you
[3:55:35.920 --> 3:55:39.680]  know it's like what they're doing great britain right now to unravel this terrorist attack yesterday
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:45.200]  yes yes great britain's the most surveyed society in the world cameras microphones on every corner
[3:55:45.200 --> 3:55:49.680]  so they can actually talking about having a drone air force to right to follow everybody in addition
[3:55:49.680 --> 3:55:54.160]  to all the cameras that they've got and so in great britain they're able to take from where he was
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:59.760]  and backtrack every place he'd been you know in in london for sure and and throughout england and
[3:55:59.760 --> 3:56:03.040]  this is exactly what they're doing and now they're scooping up all the other guys that were involved
[3:56:03.040 --> 3:56:06.640]  so trade your liberty trade your privacy for that but ignore the fact that they were the ones who
[3:56:06.640 --> 3:56:12.240]  allowed uh the preference to come in they allow people that they know are criminals to coexist
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:16.480]  among us and then it's about don't worry after the fact we'll tell you all about what they did
