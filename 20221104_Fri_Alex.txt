[00:00.000 --> 00:01.200]  We'll protect voting rights.
[00:01.200 --> 00:06.760]  We'll pass the election reform and make no, make sure no one, no one ever has an opportunity
[00:06.760 --> 00:10.600]  to steal election again.
[00:10.600 --> 00:14.640]  That's a doozy.
[00:14.640 --> 00:21.600]  So simultaneously on one side of their mouth, Republicans are trying to steal the election.
[00:21.600 --> 00:22.920]  We got to take over the elections.
[00:22.920 --> 00:23.920]  No one ever stole one.
[00:23.920 --> 00:24.920]  It's insane.
[00:24.920 --> 00:27.280]  Don't say that.
[00:27.280 --> 00:28.880]  What do you make of the new talking point?
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.920]  I mean, it's not new, but it's now the new big talking point.
[00:32.920 --> 00:38.880]  It's now the talking point that the democracy's in failing and America's going into a dictatorship.
[00:38.880 --> 00:42.600]  They want to put us in jail and they want to kill our children and they're going to ban
[00:42.600 --> 00:47.280]  and free speech when it's everything they're doing.
[00:47.280 --> 01:07.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, November 4th, 2022.
[01:07.120 --> 01:08.840]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.280]  I'm very honored and blessed to be in this position.
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.840]  Thanks to Providence of God and your incredible support.
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.080]  And I was sitting here just minutes ago trying to come on air with the theme of what's really
[01:23.080 --> 01:30.240]  happening on our planet, the core, the heart.
[01:30.240 --> 01:36.920]  And it's really this, the official talking point that I saw them start putting out when
[01:36.920 --> 01:47.200]  they first stole the election 20 months ago, 22, 23, 24 months ago, but took a few months
[01:47.200 --> 01:48.400]  for them to install themselves.
[01:48.400 --> 01:57.840]  So a little less than two years is something really amazing.
[01:57.840 --> 02:05.440]  And now they've gone from making it an embryonic talking point to a crescendo of talking heads
[02:05.440 --> 02:06.600]  out there.
[02:06.600 --> 02:13.000]  And when they tell you the talking point, you know exactly what they're going to do.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.800]  And it is horrifying.
[02:15.800 --> 02:21.440]  And it's guaranteed unless God intervenes or unless we catch them and stop them.
[02:21.440 --> 02:23.240]  And I'm not going to tell you what that is right now.
[02:23.240 --> 02:28.720]  I'm going to just sit here and let folks ruminate on what could that be?
[02:28.720 --> 02:30.080]  What's the big talking point you're seeing?
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.640]  Then we'll show you the talking point and then we'll lay out the reality of the talking
[02:35.640 --> 02:39.160]  point is true.
[02:39.160 --> 02:52.360]  That's the real trick of evil overhead shot, please is that the truth is what they're doing.
[02:52.360 --> 02:54.560]  But they're Satanist.
[02:54.560 --> 02:59.880]  So your subconscious mind knows what that symbol is, the pentacle, the symbol of a human,
[02:59.880 --> 03:10.440]  the power, a star, the head, the arms, the legs.
[03:10.440 --> 03:23.000]  What happens when you do this, you invert it.
[03:23.000 --> 03:30.400]  You've got the pentagram baffle med.
[03:30.400 --> 03:33.720]  So I know exactly what they're going to do, how they're going to do it.
[03:33.720 --> 03:36.280]  The question is the timing.
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.840]  And it is exactly what I would do if I was evil and I was them when I told you what
[03:40.840 --> 03:41.840]  they're going to do.
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.240]  And now you don't have to listen to me anymore.
[03:45.240 --> 03:49.560]  You're going to get to experience it right along with the rest of us.
[03:49.560 --> 04:00.440]  So when we come back from break, we're going to lay it all out, but it's not just here
[04:00.440 --> 04:01.440]  in America.
[04:01.440 --> 04:04.480]  It's all over the world.
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.920]  Same thing's being rolled out at the same time.
[04:05.920 --> 04:07.480]  It's been done in other places, other times.
[04:07.480 --> 04:11.920]  It says a high tech overlay to it now and high tech icing.
[04:11.920 --> 04:18.200]  And we know where the censorship and surveillance and control and lockdowns and arrest and disappearances
[04:18.200 --> 04:21.280]  and death camps lead.
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.720]  And now it's all in the news.
[04:24.720 --> 04:29.720]  Now it's all in the news, ladies and gentlemen, as they tell you how great it is now, they're
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.920]  going to protect democracy and they're going to protect you from tyranny by getting rid
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.560]  of all your freedom.
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.000]  And there's no such thing as stolen elections.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.480]  But Joe Biden is going to keep the Republicans from stealing this election.
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.320]  He said that new quote.
[04:51.320 --> 04:54.280]  So we're going to break a lot of stages, join us next segment, and I'm going to kick
[04:54.280 --> 04:58.080]  this sucker off.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.080]  It's a horror show.
[04:59.080 --> 05:01.160]  The slaves of evil are really a joke.
[05:01.160 --> 05:04.160]  The bigger joke is the fact that we go along with their false authority.
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.160]  It's a big broadcast today, ladies and gentlemen, they're all important, but this is going to
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.720]  be really important.
[05:09.720 --> 05:13.480]  I suggest you take the live links from info wars.com for its last show and share them
[05:13.480 --> 05:16.800]  like your lives depend on it because it does.
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.920]  So we are now four days from what is going to be a highly contested midterm election.
[05:21.920 --> 05:27.240]  The deep tapes attempt to stop a red populist wave from trying to retake the country legally
[05:27.240 --> 05:32.720]  and lawfully from the globalist criminal coup that we're living under.
[05:32.720 --> 05:37.520]  And the talking point that they've been putting out for two years is now the main talking
[05:37.520 --> 05:39.040]  point.
[05:39.040 --> 05:44.560]  And that is that the Republicans are going to put you in camps and kill your children
[05:44.560 --> 05:47.040]  and lock you down and hurt you.
[05:47.040 --> 05:50.600]  Of course, it's the Democrats in the deep state that are preparing all this and setting
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.120]  it up and saying they're going to do it.
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.760]  But then saying the Republicans are the ones that are going to do it.
[05:56.760 --> 05:58.040]  They are inverting reality.
[05:58.040 --> 06:03.040]  They're saying if you vote Republicans, it's the end of our republic, the end of the democracy,
[06:03.040 --> 06:05.040]  and that we're a dictatorship.
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.760]  And then Biden says, I'm not going to let the Republicans steal this election.
[06:08.760 --> 06:12.920]  So everything they say about populists and nationalists and conservatives and those of
[06:12.920 --> 06:18.880]  us trying to take over a political party legally and lawfully to stop the globalist.
[06:18.880 --> 06:20.920]  Everything they say about us is what they're doing.
[06:20.920 --> 06:26.240]  And so you don't need me to play these clips, though I'll play some.
[06:26.240 --> 06:29.880]  All you got to do is turn on any television or open up any so-called newspaper or go on
[06:29.880 --> 06:34.120]  the front page of Twitter or Yahoo or anywhere else.
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.680]  They are saying that the Republicans are going to kill you.
[06:38.680 --> 06:39.680]  Here's the headline.
[06:39.680 --> 06:46.360]  The MSNBC historian says if you vote Republican, your kids will be murdered and democracy will
[06:46.360 --> 06:47.360]  die.
[06:47.360 --> 06:48.360]  Now that's an actual quote.
[06:48.360 --> 06:53.120]  They're going to murder your, you know, the Democrats want to murder children in the womb.
[06:53.120 --> 06:56.360]  They want to do vasectomies and a couple of girls breast off and little boys genitals
[06:56.360 --> 07:02.600]  off and they love tyranny and love death and love fentanyl.
[07:02.600 --> 07:07.320]  Late night talk show hosts say, Hey, what's wrong with fentanyl?
[07:07.320 --> 07:08.720]  It just goes on and on.
[07:08.720 --> 07:11.320]  We know they're the party of death.
[07:11.320 --> 07:17.040]  We know they're the party of satanic activities and they're the parties of surveilling us
[07:17.040 --> 07:20.080]  with think tanks and the Democratic Party and the ADL, the Southern part of the Law
[07:20.080 --> 07:25.120]  Center illegally spying and then censoring and taking millions of Americans bank accounts
[07:25.120 --> 07:26.120]  away.
[07:26.120 --> 07:30.560]  Your bank just says, sorry, we're not going to use you anymore because you're a bad person.
[07:30.560 --> 07:32.120]  Not let you use us anymore.
[07:32.120 --> 07:33.120]  David Ike, it's official.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.920]  I've got a copy of the EU document.
[07:34.920 --> 07:39.440]  It's in the EU regulations, never passed by law, but by the dictatorship, David Ike's
[07:39.440 --> 07:43.720]  been listed a class three terrorist and is told he'll be arrested if he goes anywhere
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.720]  on the continent of Europe for two years.
[07:47.720 --> 07:48.920]  I have the transcript.
[07:48.920 --> 07:50.800]  Oh, but they're the good people.
[07:50.800 --> 07:57.280]  They're the ones defending democracies because no matter where you are, it's the globalist
[07:57.280 --> 08:00.640]  unified program of control, whether you're in Australia, whether you're in the Netherlands,
[08:00.640 --> 08:05.640]  whether you're in the UK, whether you're in Canada and more and more in the United States.
[08:05.640 --> 08:12.520]  He's called a class three terrorist and they go on to say because you claim governments
[08:12.520 --> 08:17.680]  are tyrannical and planning on taking our rights when they list the conspiracy theories
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.160]  that he's banned from Europe or it's that there's a takeover and an authoritarian plan
[08:22.160 --> 08:26.400]  and a plan to forcibly inject us with shots that don't work and they've done all of that
[08:26.400 --> 08:27.400]  and it's on record.
[08:27.400 --> 08:31.320]  They don't work other than killing you, which is their main function, so they do work.
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.480]  They don't work in the way they tell you they work and I mean, I read the document this
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.640]  morning almost got laid on air reading it because I just read it over and over again
[08:39.640 --> 08:43.120]  and it's a pretty lengthy document and we can spend the whole show just on this document
[08:43.120 --> 08:44.120]  from the EU.
[08:44.120 --> 08:49.600]  I've got an English translation right here and you read this and it's the most Orwellian
[08:49.600 --> 08:52.200]  thing ever.
[08:52.200 --> 08:56.000]  Because you say we're tyrannical, you aren't allowed to come here and give a speech because
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.040]  that's terrorist and because you say that the governments are run by people that want
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.600]  to take your rights, what?
[09:04.600 --> 09:07.600]  So it's the exact same and David's on next Tuesday.
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.400]  So it's the exact same inversion that we see in everything.
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.360]  There's more of these headlines.
[09:18.360 --> 09:23.520]  What we're really saying is if you don't elect us this time, you won't keep them out
[09:23.520 --> 09:26.320]  of power, you may never be able to elect us again.
[09:26.320 --> 09:30.200]  In short, vote to preserve your right to throw the bums out.
[09:30.200 --> 09:32.160]  Now they're the ones that stole the last election.
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.400]  They're the ones with all the fingerprints of fraud.
[09:35.400 --> 09:44.080]  But that's the talking point is the Republicans are going to create a dictatorship if you
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.080]  vote for them.
[09:45.080 --> 09:48.800]  But the Democrats are the ones that know there's been a political realignment that are trying
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.160]  to show up control like Venezuela did, so you never have another free election again.
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.480]  How many times have I said that a thousand times the last two years?
[09:58.480 --> 10:02.880]  And now they've inverted the truth, I said, and simply turn it on its head.
[10:02.880 --> 10:07.600]  But the average person at a subconscious level knows we're in a tyranny, knows they've just
[10:07.600 --> 10:08.600]  been through authoritarianism.
[10:08.600 --> 10:15.720]  But the average leftist goes into learned helplessness and normalcy bias and mass.com syndrome and
[10:15.720 --> 10:23.160]  claps and praises, yes, lock me up, make me take shots, take my job away, sterilize my
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.600]  kids, ship fentanyl in, demoralize me, devalue my dollar, fly around on private jets and
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.120]  live in mansions while they say that we can't have cars or air conditioning.
[10:33.120 --> 10:40.480]  And then I'm just going to praise and clap like a trained seal when you say it.
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.080]  When, or Schloss or how he says name, hysterically warns the Republicans when our children will
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.080]  be arrested and conceivably killed.
[10:49.080 --> 10:55.160]  Meanwhile, Rand Paul vows to introduce Bill to stop government and big tech colluding
[10:55.160 --> 10:57.080]  to censor speech to make it illegal.
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.080]  It's already illegal.
[10:58.080 --> 11:05.680]  Go talk to a constitutional lawyer, I've had judges on Napolitano and others and Judge
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.680]  Joe Brown.
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.280]  It's illegal on dozens of fronts and they admit in the federal document we got to keep
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.280]  the secret.
[11:11.280 --> 11:12.280]  It's illegal.
[11:12.280 --> 11:16.320]  Was he legal for Loris Lerner to target hundreds of thousands of conservatives with audits
[11:16.320 --> 11:18.360]  just because they were conservatives?
[11:18.360 --> 11:19.360]  Yeah.
[11:19.360 --> 11:23.480]  Richard Nixon had a list of a hundred and something names in his safe that he never
[11:23.480 --> 11:28.800]  used, but he was thinking about using the IRS on and boy, he had to leave office.
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.080]  That was one of the main reasons.
[11:33.080 --> 11:36.440]  But you have this reign of terror with the government illegally doing stuff.
[11:36.440 --> 11:37.440]  It's already legal.
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.080]  And I have other private corporations and groups involved with government power secretly
[11:42.080 --> 11:48.520]  is racketeering organized crime, intelligence operations against the American people.
[11:48.520 --> 11:56.400]  This is the swarmy bureaucrat bureaucracy, deep state that has gotten away with murder
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.840]  literally and figuratively and thinks they can just bring in a high tech tyranny and
[12:00.840 --> 12:01.840]  defeat us.
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.200]  But the awakening is huge.
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.760]  Cabin Newsome warns Democrats, red waves coming Tuesday.
[12:07.760 --> 12:10.600]  He positions himself to run in 2024.
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.120]  So we're going to play these clips.
[12:14.120 --> 12:17.240]  Hell, we'll start playing some of them right now.
[12:17.240 --> 12:23.240]  Here's the MSNBC historian on they are going to put you in a camp and kill your children.
[12:23.240 --> 12:24.800]  Now what did I say in the last two days?
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.520]  They're going to put you in a camp, but actually have reports and documents.
[12:28.520 --> 12:31.080]  They're building them and who they want to put in them all over the world saying COVID
[12:31.080 --> 12:32.080]  deniers.
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.960]  But don't go along with the next lockdown from Australia to the UK to the US.
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.320]  They're admittedly setting that up.
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.320]  That's on record.
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.360]  And there's all these pathologists and coroners coming out saying 40 plus percent death rate
[12:43.360 --> 12:45.240]  increase insurance tax worries.
[12:45.240 --> 12:47.400]  That's real proof they're killing us.
[12:47.400 --> 12:51.320]  They're building real camps saying they're for us listing David Icke as a terrorist saying
[12:51.320 --> 12:53.400]  I've got to be put in jail or taken off the air.
[12:53.400 --> 12:56.800]  They're doing all this illegal surveillance and bullying and then they turn around and
[12:56.800 --> 13:02.040]  point their finger at us, who are the underdogs, who are the rebels, who are the Americans,
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.440]  who are the patriots and say, we are the bad guys.
[13:07.440 --> 13:08.440]  We're the Nazis.
[13:08.440 --> 13:12.880]  They say, meanwhile, their main funder, one of their kingpins, one of their field marshals,
[13:12.880 --> 13:15.840]  George Soros, literally told 60 minutes.
[13:15.840 --> 13:19.960]  The best time of his life was helping round up Jews for the Nazis because he could infiltrate
[13:19.960 --> 13:21.320]  and find where the Jews were hiding.
[13:21.320 --> 13:23.840]  He went around finding Anne Franks on record.
[13:23.840 --> 13:31.920]  It's like, oh, ADL loves him because that's who they are.
[13:31.920 --> 13:34.720]  You cannot get more evil than people like George Soros, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.680]  They're committed to evil and they want to hurt and kill everybody.
[13:39.680 --> 13:40.680]  Look at Israel.
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.560]  It has some of the most draconian controls in the world after China with lockdowns and
[13:44.560 --> 13:47.360]  forced injections and mass death.
[13:47.360 --> 13:52.480]  Oh, Israel loves Jews so much, but the people running it follow the New World Order orders
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.560]  to AT and now Jews are dying in mass.
[13:57.560 --> 14:01.320]  I've studied history and when these globalists do this, they do a double cross and then right
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.920]  at the end, they turn and wipe out everybody and particularly the Jews.
[14:06.920 --> 14:10.840]  And so, yeah, there's about anti-Semitism coming, death of Jews is coming, absolutely.
[14:10.840 --> 14:13.760]  At the hands of the New World Order and the hands of the globalists, just like George
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.680]  Soros did, I predict this isn't turned around that the globalists will not just wipe out
[14:18.680 --> 14:23.840]  80% of the population, they will particularly hunt down the Jews.
[14:23.840 --> 14:24.840]  Look, Israel.
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.840]  Oh, but the Jews all think they're safe there.
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.800]  It's revelation, again, this is all deception upon deception upon deception.
[14:34.800 --> 14:40.720]  Come on, come on and wake up, baby, hold your eye back.
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.800]  The Republicans, if you elect them, are going to put you in jail and murder your children.
[14:46.800 --> 14:50.160]  Say the mouthpieces of the New World Order.
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.080]  Remember everything they say is the opposite.
[14:54.080 --> 14:56.920]  Their religion is backwards.
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.200]  Everything is an inversion of God's plan.
[15:00.200 --> 15:05.120]  Hear it from the mouth of one of these monsters.
[15:05.120 --> 15:10.640]  And a historian, 50 years from now, if historians are allowed to write in this country, and
[15:10.640 --> 15:15.800]  if there are still free publishing houses and a free press, which I'm not certain of,
[15:15.800 --> 15:22.240]  but if that is true, a historian will say, what was at stake tonight and this week was
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.080]  the fact, whether we will be a democracy in the future, whether our children will be arrested
[15:27.080 --> 15:33.040]  and conceivably killed, we're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system, and it could
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.800]  be a week away.
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.200]  If you vote, voting is now tyranny.
[15:40.200 --> 15:41.200]  Did you hear what he said?
[15:41.200 --> 15:43.880]  It's the same exact talking point everywhere put out by Hillary, put out by Obama, put
[15:43.880 --> 15:46.400]  out by Biden, put out everywhere.
[15:46.400 --> 15:53.680]  They're everywhere calling it book banning demonstrations in Michigan in places where
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.240]  you can't even read at city council what's in the books.
[15:57.240 --> 16:04.440]  Christie Lee last year and others tried to go read at the AISD and others, the actual
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.400]  book that's in the middle school where her child was going, and it's a famous book and
[16:09.400 --> 16:10.400]  she showed it to me.
[16:10.400 --> 16:15.000]  I'd read about the book, I'd read the excerpts, but I'd never seen in my life images of adults
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.640]  having sex with children.
[16:16.640 --> 16:19.960]  I've been blessed enough to never because they pollute the internet with it to ever
[16:19.960 --> 16:22.120]  run into any child porn.
[16:22.120 --> 16:29.120]  And I was looking at a graphic novel cartoon book that was anatomically correct, you know,
[16:29.120 --> 16:36.920]  like a cartoon book, it was a cartoon with children eight, nine years old being picked
[16:36.920 --> 16:42.720]  up in their backyards and their adult neighbor taking them in a shed and raping them.
[16:42.720 --> 16:49.880]  Oh, and they love it, of course, literal kidnapper porn.
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.720]  And I've got all these clips from city councils and county commissions, you've seen them,
[16:54.720 --> 16:59.600]  where people start trying to read what's given in some cases to elementary students.
[16:59.600 --> 17:03.680]  Parents aren't told these books are put in mass on the shelves and they spin it and call
[17:03.680 --> 17:04.680]  it.
[17:04.680 --> 17:09.680]  Oh, the Republicans and the Christians and the people that just don't like pedophilia,
[17:09.680 --> 17:15.200]  they're trying to ban books, no, I guess you can put out a book that has a graphic novel
[17:15.200 --> 17:16.200]  of pedophilia.
[17:16.200 --> 17:21.640]  I don't think that probably should be illegal, certainly when it's promoting it, but that
[17:21.640 --> 17:24.040]  starts to get into the First Amendment.
[17:24.040 --> 17:25.880]  But that isn't banned.
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.400]  Alex Jones is banned.
[17:27.400 --> 17:35.040]  And I guarantee you folks ought to try to go place at your local high schools.
[17:35.040 --> 17:36.040]  The great reset.
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.480]  The pastor should go go to the library, try to donate it to the school library and see
[17:40.480 --> 17:41.480]  if they try to block it.
[17:41.480 --> 17:44.200]  And I guarantee in leftist jurisdictions, they'll say, oh, no, you can't have Alex
[17:44.200 --> 17:52.040]  Jones's book here, but you can have a book that I told Christy Lee, I said, you can't
[17:52.040 --> 17:54.240]  show that on air.
[17:54.240 --> 17:55.760]  And she rightfully came and asked permission.
[17:55.760 --> 17:58.160]  She said, you think I should show this?
[17:58.160 --> 18:02.840]  And she handed me the book and I went in my office and opened it up and I'll be completely
[18:02.840 --> 18:03.840]  honest with you.
[18:03.840 --> 18:06.600]  I only went through like 20 pages of it.
[18:06.600 --> 18:10.800]  It was like a hundred and something pages long.
[18:10.800 --> 18:12.280]  But I forget the name of that book.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.440]  It's a bit of a big controversy.
[18:13.440 --> 18:14.440]  You call her.
[18:14.440 --> 18:15.440]  Yes, the name of it.
[18:15.440 --> 18:20.880]  And there it was with the AISD library sticker on the back of the damn thing.
[18:20.880 --> 18:22.840]  So what am I getting at here?
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.680]  Everything they say is a lie.
[18:27.680 --> 18:33.720]  And it was so surreal to open a book up that is adult men and also children having sexual
[18:33.720 --> 18:43.000]  relationships with each other and images of men performing oral sex on little kids and
[18:43.000 --> 18:50.920]  bending them over and sodomizing them for the first and only time of my life.
[18:50.920 --> 18:52.960]  I have seen child porn.
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.160]  I am brutalized by this.
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.160]  Gender queers what it's called.
[18:58.160 --> 19:00.600]  Yeah, show the cover of the book.
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.160]  You know what, go ahead and pull it up online.
[19:04.160 --> 19:05.160]  I know it's online.
[19:05.160 --> 19:06.160]  Reportedly.
[19:06.160 --> 19:07.160]  I don't know.
[19:07.160 --> 19:08.160]  Don't do it.
[19:08.160 --> 19:09.160]  Folks, I'm just telling you.
[19:09.160 --> 19:10.160]  You type that in.
[19:10.160 --> 19:11.160]  You click Google images.
[19:11.160 --> 19:12.160]  Okay.
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.320]  So they found blurred out copies of it.
[19:16.320 --> 19:17.640]  So you just get it off the screen.
[19:17.640 --> 19:19.160]  Get it off the screen.
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.160]  Sorry.
[19:20.160 --> 19:21.480]  I don't want to put it up with them.
[19:21.480 --> 19:22.480]  I'm just kidding.
[19:22.480 --> 19:23.760]  I'm not going to put it up there.
[19:23.760 --> 19:31.320]  So and in these books and others, it's about men kidnapping children.
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.600]  Now, you may be able to lure a 10 year old boy in the back of your van promising him
[19:36.600 --> 19:39.160]  you've got Legos or whatever or a puppy.
[19:39.160 --> 19:43.320]  But even if you can consensually trick them into having so-called sex with you, it's still
[19:43.320 --> 19:44.320]  kidnapping.
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.480]  It's still rape because they're not of age to do that.
[19:46.480 --> 19:53.560]  You pedophile monsters, pedophile publications are in school boards all over the country
[19:53.560 --> 19:58.560]  including where I live.
[19:58.560 --> 20:00.520]  And that's just five seconds of his line.
[20:00.520 --> 20:02.920]  Oh, they want to ban books.
[20:02.920 --> 20:05.000]  You know, they're going to kill our kids.
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.920]  They're going to kill us.
[20:06.920 --> 20:10.680]  When the Democrats today were overpopulated, where the Democrats today there's too many
[20:10.680 --> 20:14.560]  of us, where the Democrats want to abort everybody.
[20:14.560 --> 20:16.120]  So it goes on and on and on.
[20:16.120 --> 20:22.240]  Yeah, this particular video is from a week ago where the father is reading what his middle
[20:22.240 --> 20:36.720]  school daughter came in contact with and it describes two teenage boys raping a girl.
[20:36.720 --> 20:45.040]  They also in these books tell kids how to go sign up at sex sites, sex dating sites like
[20:45.040 --> 20:50.120]  and then they list the main names of them.
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.360]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is a direct pedophile attack on our children and they
[20:54.360 --> 20:58.720]  even have people go to the city councils in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, New
[20:58.720 --> 20:59.720]  York.
[20:59.720 --> 21:03.480]  You've seen the videos where they show up at the city council a lot of times dressed
[21:03.480 --> 21:08.920]  like hit the clown and say, we are going to get access to your children.
[21:08.920 --> 21:13.840]  We're going to groom them and you can't stop us.
[21:13.840 --> 21:19.560]  Remember the choir, the big city funded choir in San Francisco.
[21:19.560 --> 21:20.560]  We're going to get your children.
[21:20.560 --> 21:27.160]  We're going to take them.
[21:27.160 --> 21:39.280]  Remember Jocelyn elders 30 years ago was nominated to be the surgeon general by Bill Clinton
[21:39.280 --> 21:46.320]  and then they released the transcripts and testimony she'd given or she said the important
[21:46.320 --> 21:52.360]  thing when she talked for school is to take the two year olds and teach them to masturbate
[21:52.360 --> 21:57.480]  and we need the teachers to reach down and touch it and do it.
[21:57.480 --> 22:01.440]  And you're listening to this, I mean, and by the way, there's a bounty forever can find
[22:01.440 --> 22:02.440]  it.
[22:02.440 --> 22:10.880]  I heard Rush Limbaugh in 1993 when she was nominated play those clips and I and you cannot
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.200]  find them for a while.
[22:12.200 --> 22:15.960]  You couldn't find the Soros clips, but finally people found them and got them out.
[22:15.960 --> 22:17.440]  He's got to find Jocelyn elders.
[22:17.440 --> 22:28.240]  And my point is, is that this is a scientific, Schenarian psychological takeover plan to
[22:28.240 --> 22:32.960]  ruin children because all the research shows if you can sexualize a child when they're
[22:32.960 --> 22:40.160]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years old, you could screw them up for life.
[22:40.160 --> 22:42.120]  But I'm only analyzed five seconds of the club.
[22:42.120 --> 22:43.120]  I'm sorry.
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.440]  I can play the full 30 seconds to get an analyze all the other lives in it, but the total inversion
[22:47.440 --> 22:49.600]  and they're saying this on all the channels.
[22:49.600 --> 22:54.200]  Now, there it is Newsweek, Jocelyn elders suggested last week that schools might teach
[22:54.200 --> 22:57.920]  masturbation and safe sex.
[22:57.920 --> 22:59.920]  She did a lot more than that.
[22:59.920 --> 23:07.640]  She said the teachers would give hand jobs to the children and get all the little girls.
[23:07.640 --> 23:11.280]  Sorry, we're going to talk about this, folks, but your children can't protect themselves
[23:11.280 --> 23:18.120]  Yeah, she said, we're going to put condoms in the launch trays.
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.120]  Yes.
[23:19.120 --> 23:23.800]  And what the Boy Scouts did a few years ago, now that bankrupted them and now condoms.
[23:23.800 --> 23:26.840]  All right, Alex Jones here back live.
[23:26.840 --> 23:31.720]  This burst loss guy is echoing the talking point that's everywhere.
[23:31.720 --> 23:34.240]  And it's only a 30 second clip.
[23:34.240 --> 23:40.760]  You notice I just spent like 10 minutes on five seconds of it because every part of their
[23:40.760 --> 23:43.120]  talking points is a complete inversion.
[23:43.120 --> 23:46.320]  You flip it back around and it's exactly who they are.
[23:46.320 --> 23:47.480]  They're going to put you in death camps.
[23:47.480 --> 23:49.160]  They're going to kill your kids.
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.520]  Told you that on Monday and Tuesday people like Jones is going too far.
[23:52.520 --> 23:55.000]  Now what do they say invert?
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  They are inverting.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.800]  We flip it back.
[23:57.800 --> 23:58.800]  Very simple.
[23:58.800 --> 24:00.320]  I don't know the enemy battle plan.
[24:00.320 --> 24:01.320]  They can't help it.
[24:01.320 --> 24:02.320]  They are Satanist.
[24:02.320 --> 24:05.720]  Even they're not officially practicing them practicing it.
[24:05.720 --> 24:08.840]  They follow it at a spiritual level.
[24:08.840 --> 24:10.640]  So notice they're censoring us.
[24:10.640 --> 24:11.640]  They're watching us.
[24:11.640 --> 24:12.640]  They're controlling us.
[24:12.640 --> 24:13.640]  They're bullying us.
[24:13.640 --> 24:14.640]  They're demanking us.
[24:14.640 --> 24:15.640]  They're locking us down.
[24:15.640 --> 24:18.840]  They're trying to force inject us with poisonous shots.
[24:18.840 --> 24:20.760]  All of this incredible stuff.
[24:20.760 --> 24:24.560]  And then they say we're going to kill them and they say we're going to censor and burn
[24:24.560 --> 24:26.280]  the books.
[24:26.280 --> 24:34.960]  It's not banning books to not let eight year olds read about Billy getting picked up by
[24:34.960 --> 24:40.680]  a van and how fun it was to have an adult man screw him and they rear end.
[24:40.680 --> 24:41.680]  Yeah.
[24:41.680 --> 24:45.840]  And I'm sorry to have to talk like this folks.
[24:45.840 --> 24:49.960]  This is going on in the schools.
[24:49.960 --> 24:52.360]  And I've seen the video around the country and it happened here in Austin where when
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.440]  you try to show that book the police take you out.
[24:56.440 --> 24:58.320]  You don't show it to the adults.
[24:58.320 --> 25:01.480]  We got to secretly do it to the kids.
[25:01.480 --> 25:05.200]  In liberal jurisdictions the cops have their little special leftist that you work at the
[25:05.200 --> 25:08.400]  city councils as you know the cops outside might be good but the ones inside have been
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.240]  chosen usually because they're on board with the cult.
[25:13.240 --> 25:22.120]  So that's only five seconds of the 30 seconds let's play the 30 seconds again unedited and
[25:22.120 --> 25:24.080]  then I'm going to go back through it piece by piece.
[25:24.080 --> 25:29.760]  Go ahead and a historian 50 years from now if historians are allowed to write in this
[25:29.760 --> 25:35.080]  country and if there are still free publishing houses and a free press which I'm not certain
[25:35.080 --> 25:42.320]  of but if that is true a historian will say what was at stake tonight and this week was
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.160]  the fact whether we will be a democracy in the future whether our children will be arrested
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.560]  and conceivably killed.
[25:49.560 --> 25:56.320]  We're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system and it could be a week away.
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.600]  We are in a brutal authoritarian system that is trying to fully flex its muscles and institute
[26:01.600 --> 26:03.680]  and execute its control.
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.560]  Everybody knows that who's got two brain cells they can rub together.
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.680]  So let's start again and I'm going to start and stop and analyze each piece roll it again.
[26:13.680 --> 26:19.280]  And a historian 50 years from now if historians are allowed to write in this country and if
[26:19.280 --> 26:23.680]  there is still a historian 50 years from now if they're still allowed to exist and write
[26:23.680 --> 26:31.400]  in this country we'll be looking back on this mass murder takeover.
[26:31.400 --> 26:35.520]  Think about that how outrageous that is when they're the ones surveillings they're the
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.720]  ones watching they're the ones saying mostly peaceful protest they're the ones firing historians
[26:40.720 --> 26:44.560]  that don't agree with their official stories they're the ones finding Kyrie Irving five
[26:44.560 --> 26:50.680]  hundred thousand dollars to the ADL because he put out a link about some Jews involved
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.600]  with the slave trade which of course was going on five hundred years ago everybody was involved
[26:55.600 --> 27:01.920]  Africans Muslims Christians Jews which gets a fact it's in the history books attacking
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.400]  Jews to do that.
[27:04.400 --> 27:09.400]  But again only white Christians can be bad in the leftist cosmology and so that's your
[27:09.400 --> 27:16.080]  manipulation of history right there they're the ones at the universities that are banning
[27:16.080 --> 27:19.760]  all sorts of free speech and saying this weekend no white people allowed on the campus and
[27:19.760 --> 27:24.800]  all of this incredible racism and garbage we're hearing so back up to start again and
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.160]  roll it again.
[27:27.160 --> 27:32.760]  And a historian 50 years from now if historians are allowed to write in this country and if
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.600]  there are still free publishing houses and a free press what which I'm not certain of
[27:37.600 --> 27:44.400]  but if that is true a historian will say what was at stake tonight and this week was the
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.120]  fact whether we will be a democracy in the future whether our children will be arrested
[27:49.120 --> 27:55.080]  and conceivably killed we're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system and it could
[27:55.080 --> 27:57.360]  be a week away.
[27:57.360 --> 28:03.680]  So what he said is true if you're talking about them they've already done lockdowns
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.240]  they've already pushed a deadly shot I've got all these scientists mainline doctors government
[28:07.240 --> 28:12.360]  reports admitting massive increases in death doesn't protect you makes you get sick makes
[28:12.360 --> 28:19.160]  you spread it more but they're not losing their minds this is a talking point here's
[28:19.160 --> 28:29.640]  Chris Hayes basically saying the same thing you talk about mental gymnastics listen to
[28:29.640 --> 28:38.960]  the double think and the total oxymoronic garbage happening here here it is.
[28:38.960 --> 28:47.640]  A state in which republicans never lose is a one party state by definition that's a problem
[28:47.640 --> 28:53.040]  and we see this everywhere right we see this in Kerry Lake in Arizona and start over again
[28:53.040 --> 28:56.200]  I mean just this is a two minute clip so I can't stop and start as much will take hours
[28:56.200 --> 29:05.240]  but they just stole an election all the numbers show republican red wave red tsunami and so
[29:05.240 --> 29:10.360]  he's saying it's a party one state if one party that stole power now loses it fair and
[29:10.360 --> 29:15.160]  square because the landslide is so big so just on its face it's not even logical what
[29:15.160 --> 29:17.520]  he's saying continue.
[29:17.520 --> 29:24.240]  A state in which republicans never lose is a one party state by definition that's a
[29:24.240 --> 29:30.840]  problem it pause and we what are blue cities what are blue states where we know there's
[29:30.840 --> 29:35.280]  permanent election fraud and no matter what you do or what the polls show democrats always
[29:35.280 --> 29:41.920]  win because they're dug in and their machines going back to Chicago and daily in his machine
[29:41.920 --> 29:47.040]  they're the ones that you never see a swing back or forth the red areas you do see it
[29:47.040 --> 29:55.040]  back and forth because republicans don't steal elections like you do hardly ever I mean these
[29:55.040 --> 30:05.480]  people are elitist predators that know exactly what they're doing soulless parasites continue.
[30:05.480 --> 30:09.640]  We see this in Kerry Lake in Arizona you see Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania up and down
[30:09.640 --> 30:13.600]  the ballot secretary of state candidates people running for congress and so the pitch from
[30:13.600 --> 30:18.200]  democrats is basically if you care about democracy if you care about having this feedback mechanism
[30:18.200 --> 30:23.640]  in which the people you elect are accountable to them to you you've got no choice but to
[30:23.640 --> 30:35.480]  vote for us and that on its face sounds almost anti-democratic itself he just said you can't
[30:35.480 --> 30:42.520]  have two parties or one party will take over so our party's got to be the uniparty to protect
[30:42.520 --> 30:46.680]  you from them setting up a uniparty and so here's the big takeaway today 40 minutes into
[30:46.680 --> 30:52.120]  this broadcast as I've said many times but now it's official the democrat sold out to
[30:52.120 --> 30:57.160]  communist china new world order transhumanist party is 100% committed to the enslavement
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.520]  and destruction of all our basic freedoms in our life they're constructing a classic
[31:00.520 --> 31:09.720]  surveillance censorship cashless society social credit score market the beast system
[31:09.720 --> 31:15.560]  and they're trying to outlaw the other political party while claiming the other political party
[31:15.560 --> 31:23.000]  is trying to outlaw them total inversion total inversion while you see the one party state
[31:23.000 --> 31:28.920]  with kerry lake oh my gosh or the I mean they're running for governor running for senate I mean
[31:28.920 --> 31:34.920]  these people we see all over the country these republicans are running and if you let them
[31:34.920 --> 31:42.800]  win and then they'll kill your children and all the democrats want to do is kill our children's
[31:42.800 --> 31:46.960]  future and they can't physically kill them in the womb I mean and again you're like well
[31:46.960 --> 31:54.400]  he's just a babbling idiot no this is the talking point everywhere continue had no choice
[31:54.400 --> 32:01.840]  but to vote for us and that on its face sounds almost anti-democratic itself to say you don't
[32:01.840 --> 32:06.000]  have a choice hit pause again back it up 10 seconds again you know what I'm not gonna interrupt
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.320]  it anymore let's just play it into end because it's just it's there's so many lies you see
[32:10.320 --> 32:14.640]  it all for yourself folks you don't need me to stop it started we come back we'll back it up the
[32:14.640 --> 32:20.560]  start and just play it without me pausing it I mean I know it sounds undemocratic to outlaw
[32:20.560 --> 32:27.680]  the other party but we've got to or they'll outlaw us this is open tyranny being sold to the public
[32:28.240 --> 32:35.040]  the republicans are gonna censor us if we don't censor them you're the bad guys you're a pedophile
[32:35.040 --> 32:40.560]  party we'll have live coverage saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday what's going to be a
[32:40.560 --> 32:49.840]  contested election here at info wars here I am up on the stage
[32:49.840 --> 33:02.080]  playing the star again turn the page
[33:03.920 --> 33:08.400]  all right we have open phones in the second and third hour dead hours in the fourth hour
[33:08.400 --> 33:12.960]  head of the great Owen shroyer 3 p.m. central the coordinates of liberty are in full wars.com
[33:12.960 --> 33:20.720]  and vanda video all right uh let's let's just play the chris haste clip and I have dozens of
[33:20.720 --> 33:23.840]  these literally you don't need me to play this you see on every channel but I'm just analyzing
[33:23.840 --> 33:28.320]  these it's the same talking point the republicans are going to steal the election and by the way
[33:28.320 --> 33:31.520]  no one ever stole an election and they say we stole it doesn't exist and they're terrorist and
[33:31.520 --> 33:34.400]  they're criminal they need to be arrested and they need to be censored they need to be watched
[33:34.400 --> 33:39.200]  they need to be controlled they need to be all put in jail but they're authoritarians that want to
[33:39.200 --> 33:44.080]  put you in jail it's the same all over the world the same globalist corporate strategy is being
[33:44.080 --> 33:48.960]  rolled out europe's a few years ahead of us but man we're going over the slippery slope
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.880]  into tyrannical oblivion at warp speed
[33:56.800 --> 34:04.720]  so there it's a total inversion except for one perspective it's true that there are times for
[34:04.720 --> 34:08.960]  revolutions some can be cultural revolutions they can be peaceful some can be violent some
[34:08.960 --> 34:13.840]  can be a mix i like the pin my there in the sword mode that's where the first limit is first
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.000]  the founders believe it was even more important than the physical arms you had to have the mouth
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.240]  try to stop it from getting to that point or the mouth or the pin to direct the war
[34:23.200 --> 34:30.960]  so first amendments numero uno it's paramount penultimate number two is the arms but if you
[34:30.960 --> 34:39.120]  don't have the brain the weapons don't matter and so they're saying we're losing there's a political
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.960]  realignment everyone's turning against us and the republicans are going to put you in death camps
[34:42.960 --> 34:49.360]  to kill your kids if you elect them but it's the left that wants a permanent high tech forced
[34:49.360 --> 34:56.480]  injection medical tyranny carbon tyranny globalist socialist communist pedophilic satanic system on
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.440]  record i mean they're out in the open now the mask is off don't need me to tell you about this
[34:59.440 --> 35:04.640]  anymore go watch one of my shows 25 years ago or 10 years ago and people go watch them and they go
[35:04.640 --> 35:13.680]  what in the hell is this go to president planet dot tv there's like 20 years of videos for free
[35:13.680 --> 35:19.280]  almost every show archive there and folks go in there they call them info wars minors on twitter
[35:19.920 --> 35:24.560]  and they go in and just find these spectacular clips they're not spectacular i had the enemy
[35:24.560 --> 35:28.480]  battle plan i told you it was coming we're now living it you want to see the rest of the battle
[35:28.480 --> 35:33.520]  plan happen because i'm as serious as a heart attack if i'm exaggerating if i've if i'm making
[35:33.520 --> 35:39.200]  any of this sit up and i don't challenge god i'm not challenging god i'm just saying on on my
[35:39.200 --> 35:47.600]  immortal soul i mean everything i say up here every single word unless i'm doing satire and you
[35:47.600 --> 35:53.360]  notice i don't do satire very often it's fun but they take it out of context when i'm being sarcastic
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.640]  so i've really almost extincted that behavior because they were using it against us even though
[35:58.640 --> 36:02.240]  you know i was being sarcastic but no one i'm being serious which is 99 percent of the time
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.600]  it's exactly what i really believe i'm not exaggerating in fact most of the time i'm holding
[36:07.600 --> 36:14.000]  back because what i really think is too extreme so in a way i'm actually not as hardcore as i
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.560]  should be but i'm really telling you what i really believe and put a little bit of a governor on it
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.280]  just to make sure i don't go too far and you can't go too far now with these people so so they
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.560]  do want their permanent revolution their end of history is what they call it and so they're saying
[36:28.560 --> 36:34.080]  the republicans are about to have an end of history no populist anti-globalist pro-human
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.120]  folks pro-god people are have beach heads through populist parties worldwide most of them being
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.480]  conservative and if you want the big dark age of the new world order if you want to live in the
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.120]  great reset where they admit it's a tyranny or they admit the goal is to populate you on record
[36:49.120 --> 36:52.720]  well then go with them they're the ones saying they want to get rid of you they're the ones saying
[36:52.720 --> 36:58.880]  there's too many people they're the ones saying it and they got the nerve to say we're the ones
[36:58.880 --> 37:04.400]  that want to put you in a death camp and kill your kids i played that earlier they're saying it everywhere
[37:06.560 --> 37:07.360]  what have i been saying
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.640]  i've been saying it about them but showing proof making films writing books documenting it all
[37:14.640 --> 37:19.360]  neurotically where is their evidence we want to put them in jail or kill their kids there is none
[37:19.360 --> 37:23.360]  so let's play the chris hayes piece in the end without me interrupting but
[37:23.360 --> 37:26.720]  he's like it almost sounds like what i'm proposing is authoritarianism but
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.280]  it's what we need to do there's that moment where they got to go and you know this probably
[37:33.280 --> 37:40.400]  sounds like tyranny but we got to do it for your own good here it is a state in which republicans
[37:40.400 --> 37:47.840]  never lose is a one-party state by definition that's a problem and we see this everywhere right
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.480]  we see this in carry lake in arizona you see doug massariano in pennsylvania up and down the ballot
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.040]  secretary of state candidates people running for congress and so the pitch from democrats is basically
[37:57.040 --> 38:01.040]  if you care about democracy if you care about having this feedback mechanism in which the
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.640]  people you elect are accountable to them to you you've got no choice but to vote for us
[38:08.160 --> 38:14.800]  and that on its face sounds almost anti-democratic itself to say you don't have a choice but it
[38:14.800 --> 38:22.320]  also happens to be true in wisconsin voters might go to the polls and over 50 of them might vote
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.800]  for the democrats and republicans could win a super majority in both houses in that state
[38:28.800 --> 38:33.040]  they might even elect tony evers as their governor and that super majority could override whatever
[38:33.040 --> 38:39.280]  tony evers says that's what michael's is getting at much of the republican party the dominant faction
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.400]  within it run by donald trump the guy who tried the coup the first ever in american history
[38:44.400 --> 38:49.200]  that faction in that party is fundamentally opposed to democracy it's plain as day you
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.320]  could read it on the faces of the cops on the steps of the capital as they were getting their
[38:54.320 --> 39:00.800]  heads bashed in that faction wants to wield the power of the state through a number of means to
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.880]  insulate themselves from free and fair elections and in state one party rule whether it's through
[39:04.880 --> 39:09.200]  gerrymandering voter suppression or simply installing party loyals in key positions who do
[39:09.200 --> 39:17.280]  things like don't certify elections that don't go their way and so when democrats say you don't
[39:17.280 --> 39:20.800]  have a choice this election that there's only one party that cares about for democracy it's us
[39:20.800 --> 39:27.920]  democracy is on the ballot what they're really saying is if you don't elect us this time if you
[39:27.920 --> 39:34.960]  don't keep them out of power you may never be able to elect us again or in short vote to preserve
[39:34.960 --> 39:43.680]  your right to throw the bums out now let's hear from msnbc as well with their quote historian
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.840]  saying they want to put you in jail and murder your children here it is and a historian 50 years
[39:49.840 --> 39:55.280]  from now if historians are allowed to write in this country and if there are still free publishing
[39:55.280 --> 40:02.080]  houses and a free press which i'm not certain of but if that is true a historian will say
[40:02.080 --> 40:08.480]  what was at stake tonight and this week was the fact whether we will be a democracy in the future
[40:08.480 --> 40:14.160]  whether our children will be arrested and conceivably killed we're on the edge of a brutal
[40:14.160 --> 40:20.400]  authoritarian system and it could be a week away okay so where is anybody in our government
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.400]  that's done stuff like arrest people and put them in death camps okay george soros basically
[40:26.400 --> 40:32.000]  runs things he did that on record killery went in and destroyed countries were trying to work with us
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.920]  like libyan turned it over to radical muslims and killed hundreds of thousands okay our government
[40:35.920 --> 40:39.920]  started the whole syrian war the kill hundreds of thousands okay we're trying to abort everybody
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.000]  they say there's too many of us they're censoring us they're surveilling us they're illegally doing
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.280]  all this and then they sit there with some foppish fake aristocrat up there but oh it'll be the last
[40:51.280 --> 40:59.360]  election ever and they'll kill our children these people are disgusting and here's the good news
[40:59.360 --> 41:05.520]  almost no one listens to them almost no one believes them and every area they run has been
[41:05.520 --> 41:09.680]  running to the ground we're gonna go to break i'm gonna give the number out when we come back next

[48:24.560 --> 48:30.880]  i spent most of the first hour on the talking point that you don't even need me to tell you
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.400]  the talking point you see it everywhere the republicans are going to set up a dictatorship
[48:36.400 --> 48:40.000]  they're going to put you in femacamps remember i'm the crazy guy for saying that and they're
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.560]  going to kill your children those are quotes not just on the clips i played i mean they're
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.680]  everywhere they're going to kill us they're nazis they're surveilling us they're spying on us they're
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.400]  censoring us they're book banning they're they're they're doing what we're actually doing
[48:54.400 --> 49:03.120]  they're inverting reality in a massive way and then we've got biden in statements
[49:04.640 --> 49:07.200]  saying we will pass election reform
[49:09.600 --> 49:14.480]  if they keep control of the house and senate so the republicans can't still election so
[49:14.480 --> 49:18.560]  saying elections are stolen is insane it doesn't exist when you have evidence in your republican
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.040]  or a populist or a nationalist or you see evidence of it but when you're the democrats the republicans
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.040]  were planning to steal the election this election and the main general election in two years
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.960]  and and they're planning to put us in camps and they're planning to kill us those are real quotes
[49:33.520 --> 49:40.000]  i played last hour like three times and and and but but we're going to take over and pass election
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.720]  reform where there's no id and where illegal aliens can vote and where the dead people can vote
[49:44.720 --> 49:49.840]  and there's always these male imbalance from now to kingdom co because they know we're watching
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.560]  the machines so then they just put fake ballots fraudulent ballots in the machines so it's a
[49:54.560 --> 50:01.520]  real tally just using fraudulent voter data so here's biden we will pass election reform make
[50:01.520 --> 50:05.920]  sure no one has the opportunity to steal the election again well wait if the last election
[50:05.920 --> 50:14.560]  wasn't stolen then why do you need to pass reform that keeps it from being stolen see it's all
[50:14.560 --> 50:22.720]  circular logic it's all lies here it is my friends we offer a starkly different version
[50:22.720 --> 50:28.080]  and vision of this country a vision of a better america that's within our reach that's within
[50:28.080 --> 50:37.360]  our hands if we just vote if we elect two more senators we keep the house and democrats we're
[50:37.360 --> 50:43.920]  gonna get a lot of unfinished business we're gonna get done folks look we'll codify roe v wade
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.280]  kill those babies we'll ban it we'll ban us all weapons take the guns we'll protect social
[50:51.280 --> 50:58.400]  security medicare we'll pass universal pre-k we'll restore the child care tax credit we'll protect
[50:58.400 --> 51:04.560]  voting rights we'll pass election reform and make no make sure no one no one ever has an opportunity
[51:04.560 --> 51:09.040]  to steal the election again that's a doozy
[51:12.320 --> 51:14.800]  so simultaneously on one side of their mouth
[51:17.840 --> 51:20.640]  republicans are trying to steal the election we got to take over the elections
[51:20.640 --> 51:22.480]  no one ever stole one it's insane don't say that
[51:24.880 --> 51:28.480]  what do you make of the new talking point i mean it's not new but it's now
[51:28.480 --> 51:35.600]  the new big talking point it's now the talking point that the democracy's in failing and america's
[51:35.600 --> 51:39.680]  going into a dictatorship they want to put us in jail and they want to kill our children and
[51:39.680 --> 51:43.280]  they're gonna ban and free speech when it's everything they're doing
[51:44.800 --> 51:49.600]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine if you missed that number
[51:52.240 --> 51:56.720]  and the phone's obviously low up in seconds but you can always when you hear a caller hang up
[51:56.720 --> 51:59.760]  hit that read all we love to hear from you but the way we get to lots of calls
[52:00.960 --> 52:05.440]  is by getting to him and by moving on to the next person so as darth vader says
[52:06.480 --> 52:12.720]  you may dispense with the pleasantries let's go right to your important content with kyle in
[52:12.720 --> 52:18.160]  new jersey you're on the air hey alex how you doing i just want to make a quick comment about the
[52:18.160 --> 52:23.520]  chris say thing the fact that he says vote to preserve your rights to throw the bums out
[52:23.520 --> 52:28.720]  well that's exactly what we're doing i mean it's total inversion of reality everything they do is
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.520]  stagism it's inversion of reality and they really think that we're that stupid and i mean they're
[52:33.520 --> 52:39.520]  basically that stupid that they convince them to believe this nonsense look who they are is mercenaries
[52:39.520 --> 52:44.320]  that know it's all a lie i know some of these people behind the scenes more than a lot of them
[52:44.320 --> 52:48.640]  and so does mike cernovich and i point that out because mike made the point to me at dinner like
[52:48.640 --> 52:52.800]  six years ago he goes alex i had been with all these people and he's saying they're all really
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.800]  fans they wish they were us they actually hate their job and what they do so a lot of them aren't
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.120]  even really evil they just follow talking points now obviously the politicos and those above them
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.680]  are really evil but a lot of these people are just literal teleprompter readers that's all they do
[53:07.040 --> 53:12.320]  yeah they're just absolute puppets i mean literally they're probably all mk ultra more or less but
[53:12.320 --> 53:16.880]  the topic i wanted to bring up i think you guys should research is there's been a lot of ads on
[53:16.880 --> 53:23.040]  indeed a different job board it's called role player civilians on the battlefield and i'll just
[53:23.040 --> 53:28.080]  read you the quick description they're looking for qualified and motivated prior service military
[53:28.080 --> 53:34.240]  personnel or general personnel with previous exercise support experience to fill various
[53:34.240 --> 53:39.840]  positions supporting exercises in the u.s and potentially overseas so what they're doing is
[53:39.840 --> 53:44.320]  they're literally go through the job description it's in these different forts and i have two friends
[53:44.320 --> 53:48.560]  they're in the military and they told me they've been doing they're prepping all these exercises
[53:48.560 --> 53:52.880]  against the village i mean they're literally gearing up that's going to be the best no no
[53:52.880 --> 53:57.680]  the pedigree admits they're doing the biggest civil unrest drills and training specifically
[53:57.680 --> 54:02.080]  targeting quote constitutional terrorist they've ever done it it's actually not even secret
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.920]  yeah it's crazy i mean it's open the populists are going to put everyone in camps and kill
[54:07.920 --> 54:13.760]  everybody's children what do you make of that new talking point it's again it's just projecting what
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.920]  they're about to do we just got to learn that's what they do that the whole donald trump thing
[54:17.920 --> 54:23.680]  projecting ukraine projecting russia is everything that they were doing we know this exactly amazing
[54:23.680 --> 54:32.800]  points call god bless you jason in texas welcome uh yeah lex uh feds talked to you what october 11
[54:33.360 --> 54:38.960]  you know i gave my final prediction of all this and what's about to happen and it's true i mean
[54:38.960 --> 54:44.160]  we can see it coming it's happening i predicted that they were gonna you know there's gonna be
[54:44.160 --> 54:50.880]  some type of war they're gonna false flag thing like bomb our own thing country and blame it on
[54:50.880 --> 54:58.080]  china or russia we're getting close to the end is damn near i mean i agree if you look at every
[54:58.080 --> 55:03.440]  danger indicator they're all redlined they're all pegged they're all just screaming danger danger
[55:03.440 --> 55:06.880]  the russians put out a new statement warning them nuclear war saying they don't want it
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.560]  saying the west is moving nuclear weapons up to their border which is happening there's now a
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.000]  nato multinational force that's publicly in there fighting the russians the us now admits that
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  not the us people that run our country do and it's just totally insane exactly uh everybody
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.520]  listening to right now go get yourself wood burning stove load up on wood do whatever you
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.760]  can to prepare right now we have days left well i know this there's a good chance that there'll be
[55:33.760 --> 55:38.160]  some people in the grassroots and the power structure that are saying we put the brakes on
[55:38.160 --> 55:44.560]  this but i would give it a 50-50 chance the war explodes uh the depression intensifies and we
[55:44.560 --> 55:50.640]  have power outages fake cyber attacks uh and that uh we go into a new dark age i mean it's here
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.720]  this is the new older takeover yes sir we all better be praying and right with jesus thank you
[55:54.720 --> 56:01.600]  uh let's go to jordan in new jersey you're on the air hi alex uh thank you for taking my call
[56:01.600 --> 56:08.800]  uh jordan here from corona eyes dot com um i just want to comment briefly uh quickly about uh the
[56:08.800 --> 56:14.320]  new talking point on biden this is really a total desperation and these are bureaucrats mostly who
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.400]  just read off teleprompters and i completely agree with you so the people behind them are making
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.240]  their move and we better be on our on our best uh to try to i mean they're saying we are a dictator
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.080]  we're authoritarians we're going to set up a dictatorship we're going to spy on you we're
[56:28.080 --> 56:33.760]  going to censor you that's everything they're doing precisely right um and in the background
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.800]  all these other plans are going forward um and this gain of function research uh which is still
[56:38.800 --> 56:44.960]  going on is a criminal act that is in front of our very eyes uh you're you're hold on hold on i
[56:44.960 --> 56:47.440]  i don't want to give you just a minute everybody gets about two minutes stay there come back to
[56:47.440 --> 56:52.400]  you jordan the gain of functions beyond criminal they are producing bio weapons that kill 80% of
[56:52.400 --> 56:56.560]  humans and telling us where they're stored if you're going to make those things sure it's
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.880]  hell don't tell people where they're at and you shouldn't be making them coming up i don't want
[57:02.880 --> 57:07.520]  to air this but we have responsibility to so if you want to tune out in the last 10 minutes of
[57:07.520 --> 57:13.280]  this hour and tune back in you'll you'll you'll miss it which you might want to miss but why would
[57:13.280 --> 57:17.120]  they put something out like this when they're pro-abortion because they want to cauterize and
[57:17.120 --> 57:24.480]  make your heart black they want to celebrate evil npr has released shocking documentary audio of a
[57:24.480 --> 57:31.920]  woman having a baby vacuum cleaner out of her womb the crying the moaning the doctor telling her it's
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.680]  done that is coming up in the last segment of this hour we need to hear of this dehumanization
[57:38.320 --> 57:43.760]  jordan in new jersey uh you were talking about gain of function for me other than world war three
[57:43.760 --> 57:49.680]  and economic collapse it all goes together the fact that they admit okay we did do gain of function
[57:49.680 --> 57:56.240]  with super cuba that kills 80 percent of humans in london and in boston massachusetts and but we
[57:56.240 --> 58:02.800]  testified to congress we didn't do that and they're not arrested and then literally i know so many
[58:02.800 --> 58:08.880]  people just here in austin i don't know personally my medical doctor i didn't even know and i only
[58:08.880 --> 58:13.360]  see him like once a year for a checkup you know for blood tests and stuff surprisingly i'm super
[58:13.360 --> 58:20.640]  healthy as far as the stress got swat team just because they were at the capital not in the capital
[58:20.640 --> 58:24.560]  they got swat team they were never charged they were just there so they got swat team her and her
[58:24.560 --> 58:32.080]  husband my daughter's a lady so so that's how this is i mean this is real authoritarianism and
[58:32.080 --> 58:39.840]  i haven't gotten to this yet i'll hit it some next segment but but david icke has been listed as a
[58:39.840 --> 58:44.880]  quote class three terrorist now he put the press release out yesterday he's on the show to his
[58:44.880 --> 58:49.280]  dean and david doesn't make up stuff that's happened to him uh you can question some of his
[58:49.280 --> 58:55.600]  views but he's a very truthful moral person so i believed him but then i went and had it transcribed
[58:55.600 --> 59:02.480]  by google you know language interpreter translator and it's exactly what he said
[59:02.480 --> 59:11.680]  and i've got a transcript of it from the european union and it says you think governments are
[59:11.680 --> 59:16.400]  tyrannical and taking our rights so you're not allowed to come to europe you're banned by the
[59:16.400 --> 59:23.520]  e u outside of any law for two years and you're a terrorist mr ike what do you want to bet i try
[59:23.520 --> 59:27.920]  to go to europe and i go there to give a speech i'll be banned as well and then you'll be banned
[59:27.920 --> 59:33.040]  to your city and then bound to your neighborhood and bound to your house unless you come and apologize
[59:33.040 --> 59:40.320]  and pay a fine to the adl like kairi erving just did i mean that's where we are oh but oh the democrats
[59:40.320 --> 59:45.840]  talking point is the republicans are gonna put us in jail and kill our children and take over and
[59:45.840 --> 59:51.280]  they're gonna censor us and they're gonna spy on us everything they're doing total inversion so
[59:51.280 --> 59:56.640]  finish up your point jordan thank you alec um i just want to say the scan of function things is
[59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.200]  a huge issue i think some things distract too much from it the un just said they're not going to go

[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:25.040]  francis boil's definition of synthetic biology as a bio terrorist weapon this is what they're engaged in
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:31.040]  okay and they're they are a violation of u.s. code provisions that were amended as a violation of
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.800]  federal and state law making a bio weapon like this is life in prison contemplating releasing
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.320]  it's a death penalty in the u.s. code i've put videos out i can't get them on my site because

[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:44.640]  going to happen here in the future uh when black rocket twillow several months ago we're buying up
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:50.240]  all the real estate uh giving out loans to everybody now a lot of people are going into
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:56.960]  foreclosure rates keep going up higher and higher every two weeks um the difference is between this
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.680]  in 2008 is the government's not going to bail it's not going to bail everything out uh they'd
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.720]  rather send their money and let it come back to the uh easy that's right no no we're seeing
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.120]  organized collapse by design that they're going to blame on the covid lockdown but they orchestrated
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.760]  the whole thing and here's the other thing now it's the other thing that's going it's just like
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:25.360]  it was back then except it's even on steroids there's between 16 and 17 thousand car repos per
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.440]  day now in this country and what 37 percent of americans are overdrawn on their bank or credit
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.800]  cards and don't have money to pay their bills you know it's insane it's insane so it's gonna

[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.920]  depression unless you're a globalist hey the economy's great right those that's what they say
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.120]  but uh hey the other thing i want to mention to you uh as we talked before my science my
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.560]  scientist from my laser company was alex hill uh alan hill uh the number two and number three

[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:11.440]  correspondence from you know i have a lot of paperwork in the past now i'm not seeing anything
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:19.040]  but i one thing i will uh i want to state to you this uh you know putin's showing showing he's the
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.720]  biggest swinger over there now with his artillery and his his nukes putting them on borders etc etc
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.400]  but we don't know putin keeps everything under cover we don't know everything he has i think i
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.760]  think this guy is well there's no doubt that he uses low level forces first and i appreciate your
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.920]  call all right let's jam in more calls let's talk to marvin in alabama marvin go ahead
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.840]  hey i just wanted to discuss the uh inverted reality aspect of things uh
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:55.360]  brought up a good point this morning talking about yay uh are you and how uh his trainer
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.600]  threatens him and so it's the same thing that you're talking about now and you can show it's just
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:08.880]  uh kind of nationwide they're saying do as we tell you or else and of course you know they characterize
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.720]  that same thing with the shot as your choice that you're in informed consent we're informing you you
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:21.120]  better do what we tell you or else and the bad thing the bad truth is that all of this stuff that
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:27.520]  we uh that we're allowing to happen in essence we are consenting to and until people really
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:33.920]  uh grasp that then we're gonna keep uh running into trouble really all we have to do is like
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.840]  at the end of the the matrix when neo realized he didn't need all the kung fu and everything
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:46.000]  that he learned all he really needed at the end of the day was say no and once he had that power
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.920]  once he said no that was the end of it you know he picked us from then on well i'll say this uh
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.000]  i'm sorry go ahead yeah i want to say if you uh happen to be listening to your show we're with
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.680]  you brother and christ and stand strong don't give in i'm so sad this entire year and some of these
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.280]  people giving in don't do it brother we're with you we'll pray with you we'll pray for you and we
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.000]  got your back i don't care if you lose every time you can come stay at my house i love you brother
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:20.480]  and you're talking to yay right now right that's right and you too alex i just didn't hear you
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.760]  said i figured it was okay thank you so much uh we'll be right back with robert and thailand
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.560]  and others stay with us in full wars dot com band dot video those the court of celebrity
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:39.360]  please share them because it's it's up to you there are of course those who do not want us to
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.720]  speak we think just let me think even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:51.520]  guns will soon be on their way it's chances at them why because while the junction may be used
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:58.560]  lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words offer the means to meaning and for
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:06.160]  those who will listen the enunciation of truth there is something terribly wrong with this
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.240]  country isn't that you designed it sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television in
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.600]  local cruelty and injustice intolerance and oppression and where once you had the freedom
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:21.360]  to object to the thing can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.160]  coercing your conformity and setting your submachine cameras how did this happen
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.640]  who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:40.400]  accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror i
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:48.800]  know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a myriad
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:55.120]  problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got the best
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:01.760]  of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor adam subtler he promised you order he
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.720]  promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:20.880]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:36.800]  come we are the resistance we are the info war
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:52.560]  all right we're taking your phone calls right through the rest of the next hour a ton of news
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.760]  are going to be hitting as well was john paul jones the founder of the u.s. navy that famously said
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.280]  that when he's being commissioned into the navy the first navy of the u.s. he said i wish to have
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:10.400]  no connection with any ship that is not sail fast or i intend to go in harm's way
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:17.920]  he went on to say as fast as i can he indefinitely did that i want to ship one third the size of a
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:24.320]  large british attack ship was on fire and sinking he tied it to the side the troops climbed over
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.040]  the marines climbed over they took the ship and before that happened as their ship sinking the
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.400]  british officer held over a bullhorn they had batteries back then it was a big bullhorn he held
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:41.520]  him and said give up now and we'll give you full amnesty surrender and john paul jones said surrender
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.680]  i have only begun to fight
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.080]  and that's what i tell my enemies and they get so angry about it i've never been happier
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.640]  here i've never been more engaged knowing i'm doing important work for humanity i'm not happy
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:07.200]  about all the bad things happening in the world but i am extremely at a cellular gut spiritual level
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.360]  i feel aligned with my ancestors i feel aligned with my family i feel aligned with my crew i feel
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.480]  aligned with god i just know i'm doing what i'm supposed to do and i'm as high as a kite
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:29.920]  my very cells are telling me good job we like you that's because my spirit's in there resonating
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:36.800]  through them so no matter how they demonize or attack no matter what fantastical stuff they
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:45.520]  announce oh you owe 2.75 trillion dollars you owe two trillion 750 million dollars it's just
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.880]  ridiculous how about quadrillion how about infinity money it's just all okay add infinity money
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.520]  in fact i joked with their billion dollar judgment i said why not a trillion why not 50
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:00.640]  trillion because it's it's a joke they're a joke and they filed in court by the way a few days ago
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.080]  he's being brazen and saying he won't pay the money to the court so we want you to
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:14.800]  just before his appeal seize all his assets i don't have anything you dumb asses
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:26.320]  i'm so ridiculous and it's a 395 page document they filed almost all of it has no relation to reality
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.040]  but but understand this and then get serious about it for about your calls
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:37.040]  they hate me because they hate populace and they hate strength and they hate you so remember that
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.240]  absolute hatred is you're they don't know who you are they just hate you in general but they
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:48.160]  know who i am and so all the hate you see for alex jones is the hate of this dying corrupt
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:55.280]  inbred disgusting establishment that's going down and you know the god works in mysterious
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.720]  ways and i haven't enjoyed the persecution in lies about me at a certain level but it's like
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:11.920]  that great song my way written for frank sinatra and you know he talks about regrets i've got a few
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.560]  but then again not enough to mention because when you start thinking about the bad things that
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.480]  happened they made you better that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger that nichin
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:29.600]  thing and at the very end of the song to paraphrase it it's i took the blows i did it my way i didn't
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.880]  back down and that's really what all of this comes down to i mean i want to go back to your calls
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.400]  the fennel and we've got robert and tyland first i just loaded phone lines i'm gonna get to all of
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.920]  you but since i mentioned it go ahead and cue up my way i want to play it out to the break
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:54.800]  because the end part is so incredibly important he says now his tears subside
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:06.960]  i find it all so amusing and now his tears subside i find it all so amusing my enemies are a
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.360]  blessing this has been incredible this has all been turned to our advantage we are more informative
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.920]  and more influential than ever all of us together as a family because we didn't buy their propaganda
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:25.920]  and we didn't bow here's my way
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:55.920]  the record
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.240]  you know the truth is so good i sent the end of the song so let's get right to the end i uh
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.560]  you know what print me print me the lyrics from my way because they're just it's such poetry
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.000]  especially when you've been in the arena for most of your adult life and you've seen what
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.440]  what knowledge is what wisdom is because you can have knowledge but until you've had it's
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.520]  a lot of experience you learn how everything connects to everything else then you don't
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.360]  get that wisdom and i don't claim to be you know obi-wan kanobi or gandalf the gray here
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.720]  i'm just saying that everything's nothing but good no even the horrible bad things that
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.960]  happen i understand it's all part of god's plan and i don't ever get mad at god i just respect god
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:49.040]  and i whatever god's plan is i'm just here to do it and be as best i can i'm mad at myself that
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.840]  i'm too weak to actually carry out god's plan properly uh but i know you're the same way you
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:59.840]  know we're very humble people and that's why god has given us this whole operation all of you the
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:06.240]  listeners and viewers the crew our sponsors our affiliates everybody god gave us this power at this
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:15.600]  time and appointed us a billion years ago to be on the deck of this ship right now going into these
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:23.760]  waters to be the leaders standing up to evil god has risen us up god has trained us i now look back
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.160]  on my whole life and everything i've gone through the attacks and the pain and all of it was literally
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.120]  preparing me now because if they put all this weight on me 30 years ago i couldn't have took it
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.640]  or 20 years ago or even 10 years ago or five years ago now i can basically take anything
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.080]  as long as you're with me and if i'm taken out of the fight man i've had one hell of a run
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.680]  they can kill me they can put me in prison they do anything they want they're gonna destroy my
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.680]  family they're gonna destroy it anyways their soul's going forever all that matters
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:03.440]  it's a commitment more than i could chew bring it up
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:28.000]  all right let's move back into your phone calls and all the news and moving from some
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.200]  beautiful voice as blue eyes we got to talk about all those blue eyes and beautiful brown eyes that
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.160]  will never be seen by the lot of day that were stuffed out by the billions on our planet and by
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:48.320]  the 60 million here in america this is npr airing the sick macabre audio of a baby being murdered
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.360]  in a vacuum cleaner out of a woman's womb and the less putting all this ugliness out there
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.400]  celebrating it here it is this patient is not one of the patients you heard before she's asked
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:04.240]  that we not use her name she's from michigan she already has one kid she's having her abortion at
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:11.360]  about 11 weeks nearly all abortions in michigan are before 13 weeks and like many patients at
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.720]  northland she said i could record her procedure we're going to hear some of that now so i'm just
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.200]  going to get you set up on the table and we're going to do vaccination medicine i'm going to pull
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:27.200]  this out under your legs most patients are partially awake during the procedures they get ivy medication
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.640]  for pain and anxiety the lights are dimmed they're soothing music it actually feels a lot like a
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:39.040]  childbirth the medical gown your bare legs and stirrups and a person next to you saying you can do
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:48.240]  this it feels a lot like a childbirth it looks like they're getting off on it getting off getting
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.480]  close to the flame of evil let's just listen to this
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:06.640]  brandy she's one of the staffers her job is to monitor vital signs but it is also to hold the
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:13.440]  patient's hand and talk her through this whether it's a birth or an abortion a liberal it is often
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.040]  women guiding other women i hear this machine turn on now okay it makes a loud noise
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.520]  low it out low it out breathe it breathe it out and this doubles your cancer
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.600]  just keep breathing brandy tells her over and over i can't the patient says at one point when
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.840]  the cramps get painful yes you can brandy tells her you're doing it and then within just a couple
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:55.360]  minutes it's over it's over you're a liberal now you get a liberal thing she did it
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:06.480]  yes thank you guys so much thank you oh i didn't look too bad you did right you did just
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:13.280]  she'll be dead with cancer into here no you're okay we just capture ass we just murdered you not just
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:21.600]  your baby but it's liberal let's play clip one again here's the msnbc historian say the republicans
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:28.720]  want to kill our children and put us in camps here it is and a historian 50 years from now if
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.760]  historians are allowed to write in this country and if there are still free publishing houses
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.760]  and a free press what which i'm not certain of but if that is true a historian will say
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:46.160]  what was at stake tonight and this week was the fact whether we will be a democracy in the future
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.840]  whether our children will be arrested and conceivably killed we're on the edge of a brutal
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:59.200]  authoritarian system and it could be a week away but they want to kill the children or they
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.680]  want to sterilize them after they're born let's go back to your phone calls here ladies and gentlemen

[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:02.640]  that shows just lots of hidden information about this and it's they it's part of these
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:08.240]  this pharma drug war and and this pharma drug war is part of the information war to alex you know
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.960]  it's it's it's really important that people understand that millions and millions of people
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:19.680]  died especially of slow degenerative painful death conditions uh because of their denial
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.200]  to access to this natural medicine that people can produce very cheaply um and that's subversive
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:32.720]  because with the raw uh fanleaf juice plus the oil and proper hydration people can uh reduce
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.960]  almost eliminate their need for pharma so that's the big reason why that's been suppressed and
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.080]  there's three different studies that show that cannabis is anti-covid there's uh i believe
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:48.240]  a terpene a terpene in it or terpenoid that prevents you from catching so it blocks against
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:54.800]  uh transmission or catching COVID and then there's the anti-inflammatory aspect which
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.760]  can reduce the cytokine storm which is what makes it the most deadly causes this
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:06.480]  over uh an inflammation reaction which uh you know causes people's lungs to fill with fluid
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.520]  and then it goes really downhill from there uh so this is the verse of information let me just
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:21.040]  say this let me just say this right now to you i one trillion percent agree with you that the
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:27.760]  compounds not just the thc but all the compounds in cannabis have incredible health effects and
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:35.920]  is a miracle plant that god gave us that said really highly bred weaponized marijuana that
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.080]  soros and others have been pushing i still this 10 years ago people laughed at me now people agree
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.320]  it's causing mass mental illness mass schizophrenia so some of these strains they've created
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.160]  is really bad it's like saying an aspirin's good we've taken 100 w die or you know Tylenol
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.720]  breaks the fever we take a whole bottle you get liver failure uh those are you know aspirin's a
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:02.480]  plant too like like like like marijuana uh cannabis but absolutely uh and the cbd oils that don't
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.960]  get you high but what they do for people's joints and their bodies are just totally documented so i
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.280]  absolutely agree with you and there's big studies out on cannabis with cuba and everything else
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.760]  you're absolutely right sir but notice they're not pushing all the health benefits of it taken
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.440]  properly they're pushing weaponized uh marijuana that i mean i'm not a big pot smoker i smoke pot
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.280]  every couple months when i hang out with joe rogan for dinner or something i'll take a couple puffs
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.040]  he's always got the type you know the strain that like makes you wake up and feel really energized
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.760]  but i still not a big marijuana guy i'm kind of high naturally but i mean the pot i smoked in high
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:42.080]  school was like 30 times not as strong like you'd have to smoke a whole joint just to get you know
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.520]  a buzz going uh so that was kind of like beer compared to moonshine and so the marijuana
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.520]  out there now on the streets is like 200 proof liquor it's very dangerous well and it's also
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.160]  misappropriation you know you can drink a gallon of water fast enough to kill you um so you know and
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:03.280]  they do this with anything they do it with uh with you know food and and well people are already
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.680]  going to be high achievers uh it helps them not have heart attacks it helps them cool off a lot
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.840]  of executives spoke of a couple puffs at nine but if you're already kind of lazy and weren't
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.120]  motivated you're going to live in your mother's basement on it but i but i hear what you're saying
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:21.200]  brother and i appreciate it robert great points and look i haven't promoted or pushed cbd oil yet
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:25.200]  should have for 10 years but we're looking at some of the top producers of it and put it out
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:35.200]  which has no thc folks but has incredible health benefits so thank you
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:44.000]  i am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:52.400]  i am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore but the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.480]  with silencing us they know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed it's came

[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.880]  kari urban information coming up start the next segment but i'm going to take this video
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.560]  from medical dr john cambell who literally has tens of millions of years a week
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.680]  who is a mainline guy who's come out against the shots i'm going to post the whole 17 minute
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:11.120]  video at info wars dot com under the live show feed today so you can go there and share this
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:19.440]  critical critical information this is on excess deaths then we have a testimony also on the massive
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.440]  deaths at state legislatures but but i wanted to play a few minutes of dr john cambell on the facts
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.800]  around the world on the massive increases in deaths that cannot be denied from the injections here it
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:36.160]  is we are most welcome to today's talk wednesday the second of november now this is a video i was
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:42.640]  hoping not to have to make but the excess deaths are still going up especially in the united kingdom
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:47.120]  where we're going to be looking at today but it's not just the uk it's quite a few other
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.880]  countries as well but just before we go on to that a comment on yesterday's video
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.480]  perhaps about a thousand people reported yesterday on the comments do have a look at it
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:06.640]  that they'd had a covid-like illness in november december 2019 this indicates if you are correct
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.920]  and i don't see how a thousand or more of you're getting on for 2000 of you can be wrong uh there's
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:20.800]  a lot of covid-like illness around in uh november december maybe even something earlier uh 2019
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:27.600]  if that's the case there was a major uh failure of our surveillance and it also means that a lot
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.680]  of the measures that were taken afterwards were um well when those measures were taken they weren't
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.480]  really taken in the light of the fact that the pandemic had probably been around for longer than
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.640]  we thought so it's in quite major failures really but moving quickly on to today's information
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.720]  now this is epidemiologists from this is via a rally epidemiology the king's fund is a big
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:58.160]  uh research and research fund in the united kingdom deaths from cardiovascular disease
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:05.840]  and diabetes in particular show a significant uh excess just published in the telegraph uh
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.800]  which basically does seem to be one of the few uk outlets which are covering this i actually did a
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:18.480]  google search um or dot go search rather really on on um excess deaths in the bbc and and there was
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:24.160]  nothing related to this at all it's almost like well i wouldn't use the term cover up but it's
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.880]  certainly i don't see why it's not being reported now let's just look at this from an international
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.880]  context but we are going to look more at the particular causes of death the cardiovascular
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:38.960]  causes of death but here's some international context uh in this first of all now of course
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.720]  this goes back to january 2020 the excess deaths of course because we had a pandemic obviously
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:51.120]  we know this but when we look um at the current data when there's very few people dying from
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.960]  SARS coronavirus to now thank really still some of course but in the uk hits way down
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.320]  the majority of these excess deaths in the united kingdom which are still increasing
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:09.520]  are none covid causes and the numbers as we'll see are pretty high so the percentage there that
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.520]  that's the 15 percent line so well above 15 percent in the uk when australia last presented
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:24.720]  data which was back in uh back in about june 2022 um it was around about 15 percent excess deaths
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:31.280]  then island netherlands the united states and canada um now quite a few people have reported
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.360]  from canada that people that live in canada that's saying they're not overly impressed with the
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:42.560]  quality of the canadian data so quite how much we can rely on that is is uh not quite clear to me
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.760]  from this perspective but we see this is an international problem i'd actually set out
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:53.040]  to do this video on excess deaths in europe which are quite significant but i found so much data
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:58.560]  from the uk i thought we'd go without first of all but from the united states first of all before
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.760]  we go there now this is a particular case now i don't like doing particular cases but this one is
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:11.200]  in the public domain so it's mrs julia powell um well-known food writer she was in a film played
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:18.400]  by meryl streep i believe i haven't seen it myself but um reported to have died at the age of 49
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:26.800]  cardiac arrest caused by heart arrhythmia now of course this is pretty well true i mean if you
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:33.280]  get a heart arrhythmia that means the heart's not beating properly our mission take humanity to type
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:40.800]  one civilization and transcend hell and death through christ which has a lot more to it than
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:47.200]  you're gonna learn in sunday school everything the enemy does is a false counterfeit of what we
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:55.760]  will achieve through god but we won't be given the keys to the universe until we've proven in this
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:06.960]  battleground test we've got what it takes and then the real war starts this is like a picnic
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.120]  compared to the next level
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.880]  all right let me hit this news item and i'm gonna rampage to get to every one of these calls in
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:24.160]  the hour nathaniel pink sweater sky ice nine al killer kathleen ray chris thomper bart every one
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:31.360]  of you in the order you are received coming up here in a moment but i learned this and this is
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:45.200]  important to understand when they began six plus years ago to say i was the sandy hook man and
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.680]  obsessed on it all day and say that i sent people to harass folks and was obsessing on it which i
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:54.880]  barely even covered it they said in the news just apologize and stop sending people to our houses
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.760]  to harass us and i didn't know now i know a whole think tank democrats all come out in the news
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:05.040]  were running in there's all a setup and so i said well i didn't say those things you said the way
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.720]  i said about it isn't able to harass you so yeah i apologize stop making me the sandy hook guy
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.720]  boom all hell broke loose they sued me they came after me because they want you to admit
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.400]  they have the authority they want you to admit to the lies they're about to tell about you before
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.280]  they run their sire they don't want you to just bullishly stand up to them and say hey i didn't
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:32.480]  say that the way you said i said that so yesterday kairi erming the star basketball player who tweeted
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:39.840]  out videos of mine and things like that he apologized and said he would go to reeducation
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:45.440]  that's the term by the adl for his evil and he would pay a five hundred thousand dollar fine
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:54.400]  not under law but as a offering to them as his god and i said when this happened i said now
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:33:00.240]  they're gonna come after me that's the good cop oh thank you kairi we're gonna reeducate you now
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:07.360]  but then his basketball team who'd been standing with him as soon as he back down and said he was
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:17.120]  wrong suspending without pay breaking kairi erming post and pays five hundred thousand
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:25.920]  dollar fine to adl and then today brooklyn net suspends kairi erming after he shared a link
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:34.240]  to a documentary hosted on amazon oh amazon can sell a video or a film which is based on a book
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.040]  about jewish slavers i mean a part of it's about jewish slavery it's just kind of the history of
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:45.680]  north africa there were christians or muslims or jews that had slave ships no one denies that even
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.520]  but they're calling it anti-semitic so
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.040]  they're gonna really make sure kairi erming
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:07.920]  is an example to everybody else quote we have decided that kairi will serve a suspension
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:14.720]  without pay until he satisfies a series of objective remedies measures that address the harmful
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:22.080]  impact of his conduct the nets organization wrote in a statement erming faced the exact
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:28.480]  same type of cultural cancel culture persecution by leptis mob which alex jones and kanya west
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.400]  have been subjected and it goes through it all
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:40.000]  so the minute he rolled over to the adl who's playing good cop with him oh do what we say now
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.680]  kairi behave come to our facility be brainwashed and we'll get that suspension off for you kairi's
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.480]  already lost of course you got another big contract back a hundred million dollars for saying i'm not
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.400]  going to take your poison shot and instead of being vindicated
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.320]  oh he's a bad guy too he's got to be shut down let's go to your phone calls
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.600]  nithaniel in alabama you're on the air go ahead hey alex how's it going all right brother good
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:16.720]  to talk to you so i called about um obviously the listeners are speaking the truth and i wanted
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:22.080]  to talk about uh the catholic church a little bit so just like you like they they attack you
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.880]  because you're the truth and what if you think about it what other denomination has received
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:35.280]  as much attack as the catholic church pretty like on no no doubt they've received the most
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:41.200]  sorry i'm a little bit nervous and been working um well there's no doubt the pedophiles tried to
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.120]  infiltrate it and there's been a big battle to take it over and i would say the current pubs
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.760]  and on board with those guys but yeah there's definitely been a big plan i mean until a few
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.000]  years ago the catholic church was attacked by hollywood now hollywood loves the catholic church
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.120]  because i think they've kind of captured it not the church itself but i would say the hierarchy
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.400]  absolutely alex you're absolutely right it's on record that the communists infiltrate
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:10.000]  infiltrated the catholic church and uh just going a little bit on the satanic inversion
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.640]  the satanists they don't have black praise and worship they have black mass and it's a
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:21.040]  the satanic inversion of the truth just like everything else they do so i just thought i'd
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:27.280]  plant that seed for everyone listening and um also they have a an organization called paterna
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:34.720]  which is basically where they just teach men how to be true virtuous and moral men um and
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.760]  it's children are invited to come as well and uh just show them how to grow up and be be a true man
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.560]  well i know there's a lot of great people on other catholics fight the new world order
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.400]  we saw the coveted and kids under attack it's it's it's they're they're mad at
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.680]  conservative catholic groups they love the leftist ones thank you nathaniel let's go to ice nine
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:03.920]  in england you're on the air sir go ahead or man whoever it is alex jones man i love you man i
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:09.440]  love what you're doing you guys are amazing if you open my eyes and um i hope you give me a quick
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.600]  second to just say a few things before you cut me off because i'm going to say some stuff that's
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.400]  quite shocking but true and i've already been censored a few times when i got you're not being
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.880]  censored but you are you are on the clock i gotta get to everybody you got two minutes go
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.840]  yes first of all you could find me on bit shoot it's maybe messiah or you could check me out by
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:36.800]  finding my content with the hashtag jesus name challenge which proves that the name lord jesus
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:43.440]  is a direct translation from bal and isus or hasus which are both names of satan
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.840]  and uh the definition of an antichrist is a person office or group recognizes for filling
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.880]  the biblical prophecies of one who will substitute christ jesus is a satanic substitute for the name
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:04.160]  of yashua which means yaway is salvation yashua preached the old testament of yaway he prayed to
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.560]  yaway he um his name means yaway is salvation all the biblical prophets names testified to the name
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:17.120]  of yaway hallelujah means praise yaway but they've given everyone a satanic substitute and everything
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:23.360]  you're doing alex is going to be completely in vain unless you realize that the name jesus is false
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:33.680]  and satanic well i mean you know what you're saying sounds a little bit ferocitical uh judging me and
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.480]  saying what i do is in vain we're exposing the satanic new world order our our fruits are amazing
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:46.560]  and i know there's big debates about johova uh or jesus or yaway uh but when we talk about yaway
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.200]  or we talk about johova we talk about jesus we talk about the man of god the son of god
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.720]  the new testament that came here to to get the keys of hell and death and and and god is going
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.920]  to judge the heart not ferocitical definitions i appreciate your call uh but hey you're superior
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.360]  and i get that you've got to sleep well at night knowing that you've got all the keys and all the
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.320]  answers and everything else so i would just bear some fruit brother i would go out and fight abortion
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.920]  fight new world order fight the fentanyl fight fight for freedom because you know faith without
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:27.600]  works is dead show us how you are like yashua i love yashua grab i i want to go back to what
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.760]  that last caller brought up and very first he gave out his website and a bunch of stuff and said
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:35.040]  oh i don't want to be censored as if we're censoring people we're giving callers a couple
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:40.720]  minutes moving on the next person but if you don't understand history or the bible Pharisees
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.200]  were all about the laws and all the little rules they made and not about a relationship with god
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:54.480]  directly and so god knows who god is whether it's yashua or johova or jesus or hazus the god of the
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.360]  bible the god of the truth the god of the ten commandments the god of the gospel the god of
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:06.080]  jesus and so if you believe the name jesus is the son of god and you're following what jesus
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:14.000]  said in the gospels then you're following it you know god's not stupid god knows your heart god
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.600]  judges the heart look at king david who did some bad things but the end of the day love god and
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:27.120]  wanted to do good so god said you're a man after my own heart and so i see all the rules and all
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.360]  their names and all their things look at the mainstream churches they don't want to say the
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:38.960]  name of jesus and and these big mainline preachers don't say that so if the world hates the name
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:46.160]  jesus so much well then why are you thinking it's a bad name but yashua i mean look there's greek
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:53.520]  there's hebrou there's aramaic there's spanish there's german there's french there's russian
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:41:01.680]  there's japanese there's swahili there's hundreds of languages and people get caught up in the name
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.000]  are you saying the books of the bible aren't real are you saying that's what you follow that's the
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:22.480]  information take the take the situation we deal with today how they're openly trying to set up
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.840]  the state as god and all the fruits of it world government market the beast the bible being
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:36.160]  fulfilled so that helps that caller just get past it when you get to the name of the son of god just
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:42.480]  have a blank there but it's still about what the bible tells us is going to happen and what's going
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:50.720]  to unfold and so getting back to this the bible calls the spirit that comes to you the energy the
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:57.360]  wavelength of the transmission the message we're transceivers for it we receive and transmit we
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:07.120]  receive we also worship so worship is is transmitting back from the the reception this is spiritual
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.320]  this is this is interdimensional this is real and so
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.480]  why don't i say the holy ghost the holy spirit are we going to deny that let's just say we want
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.280]  the holy spirit we want god to come knock on our door show us your real god come into our lives
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.760]  make us new make us better how about that how about focusing on coming together
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:37.200]  it is a tool of the devil with all these denominations and all these false leaders
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.840]  fighting with each other over who's the priesthood that you've got to follow their rules to get to
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:50.480]  god god is the judge god is the arbiter and you'll know if somebody is of god or of the
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:56.480]  devil on whether the system is coming after them or not so that caller got what he wanted
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:07.440]  he got to tell me that nothing i've done means anything unless i say yaway
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:16.880]  and it's about him enforcing his will on us for the name when a name is just a human term for
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.240]  something we know satanism we've seen the fruits of it with a new world order we know god we've
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:29.280]  seen the fruits of that so i love the god that created us the god of genesis the god of christ
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:38.880]  yaway yashua jahova jesus said i came to fulfill the old testament not destroy the law
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:46.320]  and you've got groups fighting over oh jahova was a different god of the jews versus this god no
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:53.360]  it's the same god and anybody that has any connection to god knows that and i'll assure you
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.880]  god isn't sitting there thinking about what name in a human language you've got for god
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:04.640]  we know who god is the god that created us and the god that wants success for us i'm done talking
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:10.320]  about it tell you calls or the receive bart thanks for holding from massachusetts you're on the air go
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:20.720]  ahead alex shalom baruch hasham bless god you know you're a very wise man and i'm honored to have
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:29.680]  this moment with you i think that your point about the many layers of the onion and separation red
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:38.000]  versus blue black versus white the polarities i think that's the deception so are we anointed in
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:47.440]  christ and renewed god willing right but what i'm calling about is what you said earlier and i finally
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:57.760]  finally back to this conversation so calling from massachusetts very blue um red right i hate
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:07.760]  these labels maybe in purple i'm also a patriot jew and so it's a very tricky time to navigate
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:15.600]  and i'm sure there's many of them out there listening and that support you and it's it's
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.000]  unfortunately now we have to dance around the conversation but you know we'll get into you
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:29.440]  don't know about the yay and the whole juice i op yeah that's exactly where i was going with this
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:35.920]  and then you brought up israel two years ago i had heard a dream a voice say he's at the height
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:45.520]  of his power and obviously i took that to mean our enemy right and so it's very tricky how do we
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:55.760]  talk about this without all those layers of the onion because you're immediately labeled a racist
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:04.080]  but you know he will reveal things to us on our own time and how they're meant to unfold and
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:14.560]  i worry about the other israelites who are not pushing medicine at the top of the
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:24.080]  pharmaceutical structure down and not imposing there are those of us who are killing the earth
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:31.600]  and planting the seed who have seen that there is a father a son and the holy spirit all together
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:42.960]  so for your listeners i i beg that you open your hearts and look past labels there are
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:50.240]  ebrews there are israelites who are not absolutely there are good people of god in every group
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:54.320]  and there there is an obsession with the devil with israel and what's had to happen there
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.840]  and look at how israel is being bombarded the most of any western country with poison shots
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.680]  if they're supposedly evil masterminds that are in charge why are they locked down why are they
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.600]  being injected because they're being targeted and it's a sophisticated operation i appreciate your
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.880]  call all right listen i'm going to go into the next hour as long as we need to jade iris gray he
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:21.280]  knows i take over sometimes i'm going to get to every one of your callers so al killer and kathleen

[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.680]  all the rest of those just say god the living god the god that wants you always got to have a magic
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.760]  name as priest tells you in your you can do it right you're going to hell that's Pharisees and
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:48.080]  the history is full of those and jesus rebuked the Pharisees and i'm not saying the caller that called
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:54.080]  in as a Pharisee i just they obsess over stuff like that instead of getting out and waking people up
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:58.160]  and standing up against evil whatever name you want to give it buddy you better start fighting satan
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:04.160]  but he told us your work's nothing unless you do what i say use the names i say they're right back

[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.240]  for years and you know ever since he's been doing the fourth hour we just never happened to cross
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.680]  path i mean he just goes off their own statements it's like it's it's phd level understanding
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.360]  yeah he he's phenomenal he's on a whole nother level and the way that he is spraying things
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:54.080]  breaks things down for everybody um i want to touch on uh kanya west and elon musk but have
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.760]  we confirmed run to phantas is skull and bones because that worries me no i'm not confirmed
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.520]  that i've looked up roger stone says he is he went to Yale but i'm not guys search it again
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:10.800]  i'm not confirmed that he's skull and bones alumni but i mean that is a big problem yes i i was very
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.840]  surprised to hear that and you know because bush wasn't a bad governor in texas not great
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:22.400]  and granted i'm even super bad as president exactly that that's what scared that's what really
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:29.760]  worries me with him but um let me uh touch on elon musk and kanya west so your uh friend greg
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:37.360]  riz was on your other friend uh eddie bravo show and everything he all his um um complaints about
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:44.640]  elon musk they're all true everything he said is true he did fake the fact that he came from money
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:49.840]  he did fake that he was selling emeralds in uh new york city he did say that he received a scott um
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:55.040]  he was getting student loans when his dad paid for him to go to college so why make those things up
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:01.760]  now with i i think him taken over twitter and kanya west laid this outburst are
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:09.600]  are just perfect timing i think they're working together that that's my opinion on it and i i don't
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.960]  think we can trust either one of them until they they prove a little more to us um because at the
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:19.520]  end of the day what is elon musk say all free speech is good it's like jordan peterson pointing
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.400]  out obvious stuff that we learned like kindergarten cop boys have a penis girls have a vagina that is
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:31.360]  that's supposed to be groundbreaking um type of information that they're presenting to us they're
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:37.600]  i mean obviously free speech is good but what has he done so far his fruit hasn't proven anything to
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:42.480]  i hear you i i think look i've looked it up that he's not officially in skull and bones
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:46.720]  they admit who's members of skull and bones so it looks like he's not members of skull and bones
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:52.320]  but i'm asking rob dew and darry mcgreen are the great researchers look into what fraternity he was
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:58.320]  at if he wasn't at skull and bones because they've got a bunch of scrolling key and snake and whatever
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:05.120]  it's all about the same crap we need to dig into that definitely look at it well that's on that
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.240]  end but i'm i'm what i'm trying to get in with the elon musk situation i listen i told people
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:15.680]  i'm going to give you my real take on elon musk tomorrow uh during this special broadcast we're
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.400]  going to do and i think he's trying to be everything full spectrum dominance but we're
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:28.080]  definitely look at it what do you think again you know when i look at his you know the whole
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:34.400]  thing with the warner von bran book where he he predicts a man named elon or that's the title
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:40.640]  of yeah we'll become the yeah become the king of mars i mean are are they just throwing things
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:46.640]  in her face at a certain level and i again like like you said of course he's not running paypal
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.920]  stuff like that now but what has he i mean i hear you i hear you we should investigate elon musk
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.920]  i appreciate your call i know all the big money's pulling their money out of twitter right now i'm
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.680]  just saying it's really a paradox it's a conundrum i i don't know yet uh so he without said the cast
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:07.120]  first don't i'm investigating elon we're gonna do it in depth tomorrow thank you uh thumper in
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:14.880]  michigan you're on the air go ahead hi alex i wanted to call in and just uh push everybody to
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:21.360]  stay on topic for this weekend we got a big vote coming up and i really think that uh
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:29.120]  siden lost all his um independent voters when he brought up nuclear armageddon and we need to
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.880]  stay on that topic now you're right that really turned a lot of people against him that's right
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:40.720]  he said it and it scared the bejesus out of all the women and they all swung towards the right
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.480]  and we need to keep pushing that he said nuclear armageddon and another topic that nobody ever
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:56.000]  brings up is russia has 400 000 tons of depleted uranium so does the us we are the only two major
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:05.120]  powers that have that much depleted uranium and what the un wants is a big major war to scare
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:11.600]  everybody into agreeing to what the un wants so they'll use that depleted uranium to create such
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:19.920]  hideous optics that people beg the un to to make all this stuff stop and another thing i came across
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:28.160]  is depleted uranium the number one effect of depleted uranium um is even if it doesn't get in

[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.520]  on as far as the bad people and i'm not talking about musk or anybody like that as far as good
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.200]  people because i don't trust him but universities businesses are full of good people it's the global
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.600]  asset agendas is the problem but yeah there's more good people than bad people actually out there
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:41.600]  they're just isolated we've got to come together i don't mean just americans i mean people in power

[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.320]  on one of the things um if you don't mind the um when you were talking about offworld um i offworld
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.480]  entities can you just explain that a little bit more you said there was something in a vortex
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:13.840]  a creature and i wasn't sure if you were talking about that being satan or satan's trying to free
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:19.280]  that do you remember that when you were talking about that no i do i mean the globalist worship
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.800]  what they believe are interdimensional and the science shows it's their creatures they're getting
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:30.400]  their own not divine but satanic influence from those and they're trying with cern to break that wall
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:37.120]  and yeah satan is kind of an art type for what this is and it's obviously got a leader but yeah
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.520]  i know satan's very real yes okay thanks alec thank you now when i talk about these things it's not
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:51.920]  metaphorical that they're we're on a planet in space and we only see one tiny little percentage
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:58.320]  of the electromagnetic wavelength and that's only one spectrum so we are basically blind
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:04.000]  and all around us are all these other energies all these other systems and the globalists know
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.520]  that and they're dialed into very twisted very satanic forces like lord rothschild with the
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:15.200]  alliser crowley witch they're on screen uh hanging out uh there at the london museum
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:23.520]  all right we'll be right back with more calls chris ray carlos pink sweater sky your calls
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:28.640]  are all coming up straight ahead the order they are received but what you can promote
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:35.440]  is info wars dot com and bandot video have you shared those links today it's a live edition

[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:59.120]  about biden's speech and i think that people really in the media in our side of the media
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:06.000]  really need to stress that he's talking about preserving democracy which is a word for them
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.080]  it's preserving the people in power they didn't talk about liberty our freedoms at all he's talking
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:19.920]  about preserving their their government and uh people like chris hayes and biden they're talking
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:30.480]  about uh a a democratic vote that if the people vote for the wrong people that's gonna kill democracy
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:37.760]  just think that's such an ironic blatantly corrupt statement it's totally it's totally
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:45.280]  false it's it's exactly it's a total fraud and uh i think people need to really uh the people in
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:51.040]  the media in our side of the media really need to stress that i mean they're coming out and telling
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:56.720]  us what they're what they're working for and it's not and they're saying we're about to be violent
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:02.880]  imminently which sounds like pre-programming for a false flag to me yeah i mean in the general
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:08.160]  january sixth thing you know some bad stuff happened there you don't want to defend defend
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:14.000]  the people that were going in there and being violent but you know it's really understandable
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.440]  when you when you allow that stuff for eight months the eight months prior when people see
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:24.640]  that's the only thing that burning building shooting random people and then a few dozen people
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:28.720]  are violent and they blame millions you're absolutely right thank you so much chris gray

[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:16.800]  guy out there on the db right now but uh yeah you got your message has stayed the same forever
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:21.600]  since then so congratulations on all the x's well that's the big takeaway with alex's war
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:26.880]  that's been a hit movie we have the dbd is them for our store is that i mean i've been saying the
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:30.960]  same story for 28 years because it's the truth we haven't changed anything we're just warning
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:37.680]  what's coming and now it's here and then uh and what it's called about paul polosi that intruder
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:43.440]  is never going to go to court because paul polosi is on probation right he's on three years probation
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:50.240]  he will not want is that guy going to court because then everything's going to come out
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:56.320]  we don't know the truth the truth is never going to come out and there's intruders if he if he's
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:06.160]  arise in another year he'll be deported and be gone and try to be uh all you know forgotten
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:10.480]  about and all that no i totally agree with you brother well good to talk to you and it's good
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.600]  to talk to you again uh let's talk to carlos in canada the pink sweater and sky carlos thanks
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:22.400]  for holding on thank you alex i appreciate your call um listen free speech when you speak about
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:28.960]  the first uh um amendment in the united states it's in the constitution but the founding fathers
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:36.160]  were very wise because free speech relates to democracy you see there are two sides to free
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:42.560]  speech it's not just the right to say oh it's a gray sky or a blue sky no it's the right to be heard
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:48.880]  that means that there's somebody that has a right to hear and if i have a right to hear i have a right
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:55.840]  to have an informed decision when i go to vote i go to the polls i go to the i read the candidates
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:03.360]  what they say but i have the right to hear and it's the right to hear that protects democracy
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.040]  the fact that somebody goes in the soapbox in london somewhere to speak about anything and is
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:15.600]  protected by law okay is the right to be heard but the right to hear is what is being deprived
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:21.920]  and it's all about controlling the democratic process i called your program once to tell you
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:28.400]  democracy has three components the right to be heard which means the right to hear the right
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:34.720]  for an informed decision which is what democracy is about the second thing of course is the one
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:40.160]  person one vote if you cannot vote then you cannot have democracy and the third thing is that once
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:47.200]  the majority has voted the minority does not have the right to subvert violently or otherwise
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:53.600]  that which the majority has decided and that makes democracy the most powerful tool against
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:03:02.480]  the globalists now i have a question that i hope robert barns can answer for me because once i met
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.760]  with one of the people uh john humphries who wrote the uh... the charter of rights and
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:13.920]  freedoms for the united nations with uh... a renaissance and was uh... the gold lawyer
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:19.680]  and when they wrote this i asked what about the united nations and all the treaties with america
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:26.000]  and the the one thing that was clear was that america can only sign treaties according to the
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.800]  constitution with individual nations not become glomerates or not that's right exactly they only
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.400]  claim treaties over the constitution not true well then the united nations is totally out of line
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:43.200]  because they shouldn't be telling me that i should eat bugs because they make an association
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:50.400]  with the global world global groups or whatever it doesn't matter we have right now a leader in
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:57.920]  canada in in in daniel smith who clearly said who are these people we don't have we don't answer to
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.680]  them in that beautiful he's like who are these globalists something else what to do it's so
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:07.680]  simple it's so powerful and so true and once you expose what's some multinational group
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:12.000]  putting in politicians and leading us once the public gets that it's game over beautiful points
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.040]  thank you carlos pink sweater which means bill gates uh calling from the usa you're on the
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:27.520]  here go ahead uh hey alex um i i use a moniker pink sweater because it's very obvious what um
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:34.560]  the solution would be to a lot of the things i'm going to discuss right now uh and of course
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:42.640]  you know that i would never call for any kind of violence because i'm in a pink sweater um but uh
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:51.360]  in 2016 you know the left harped very hard about um you know trump colluding with the russians
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:57.600]  and you know joy bayhard and and whoopi goldberg are on the view talking about how you know head
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:07.120]  crews that anytime that uh a republican wins its election fraud and when a democrat wins it's a
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:17.360]  legitimate election um i want to talk about how uh forgive me sorry i've been on hold for a while
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:27.040]  the the playbook that they're running it it's been done on you it's been done on trump uh
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:33.680]  we're heading towards war with the russians and you know the way that they handled your case
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:43.520]  uh especially if you look at 2020 one of the big topics of uh of of uh the way that the left tried
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:49.440]  to you know discredit donald trump was that he didn't pay a taxes and you had just uh reported
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:56.080]  a while back i think this summer that irs just put out some sort of uh you know manifesto
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:06:02.320]  that they're trying to bring like you know 30 000 people in as like enforcers or bodyguards
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:09.040]  or armed guards you had a trial recently in which they claimed you had a lot of money that she didn't
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:16.320]  have and you know they illegally released donald trump's tax reports or uh tax returns and so i
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:22.240]  think that you know these kangaroo courts that are coming up there's a lot of different angles
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.600]  that they're going to try to attack oh you're absolutely right and when you're reading it it
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:31.520]  is literally made up crap they do not care they know nobody's stopping them at the executive level
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.600]  at the top they just believe they can do anything they want and it is dangerous thanks for the call

[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:53.680]  masturbation in school and i have a few citations here like the new york times article quote she
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:11:02.480]  had condoned teaching school children to masturbate that was 1994 we were looking at the bmj uh she
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:10.240]  said masturbation could be appropriate subject to teach in school i'm looking at the stanford report
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:17.680]  where she says quote i absolutely did this job as i felt it should be done and uh i also
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:25.680]  send you some video clips she's on the today show in 1994 talking about this and uh well i mean i mean
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:30.000]  we know she said it's on the record but i remember hearing the audio i could never find it again
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.480]  thank you for calling in with those great citations i'm told we have the clip guys go ahead and roll it
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:45.360]  on avocados i'll make comprehensive um whole education program if you will starting at a very
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:52.800]  early age i feel that it should be age appropriate it should be complete and we need to teach our
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:58.480]  children all of the things that they need to know and we know that many of our parents
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:04.480]  have difficulties teaching certain things and for that reason to make sure that all of our
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:10.480]  children are more informed i've always felt that we should it you know that we should make it a part
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:18.240]  of our school i i feel it's the only institution that we have where all of the children go
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:27.920]  and presently our in our schools it's very incomplete it's very spotty and we do only five
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:34.800]  percent of schools have a comprehensive program to address your specific question and regard to
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:42.560]  masturbation i think that that is something that uh it that's a part of human sexuality and it is a
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:57.440]  part of our out of time jdarr is coming up and on the saturday show i'll cover it
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:08.240]  don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you

[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:20.160]  the main beacons of resistance alerting the people not as of america but the world for the threat
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:25.040]  of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny that's why it's so essential today

[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:14.560]  analysis and i want to talk about how we got to where we are in terms of this revolutionary nihilistic
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:21.360]  philosophy that has pretty much taken over the the west the the elites of the western world
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:27.920]  and how the dogma that has been accepted is pretty much a dogma related to expanding that
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:35.040]  neoliberal post-human technocratic dystopian order to the whole globe in order to understand how we
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:40.000]  got to where we are it's very important to understand the the 20th century what led to the
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.200]  conflicts of the 20th century as you know we've covered in many lectures dr carol quickley's
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:50.720]  tragedy and hope and his other books like the angle american establishment how those texts
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:57.440]  show the planning behind the cold war i'm going to skip world war one and world war two i've
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:02.240]  covered those at length in the past but particularly the cold war which you could say is world war three
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:10.320]  was intentionally set up so that we could have the infrastructure of technocracy built i'm not
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.120]  saying there wasn't a real cold war that people weren't really ideologically battling but we do
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:22.800]  have a win in on the part of what quickly calls democratic capitalism that ends the cold war
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:29.520]  but what what set up the cold war this iron curtain was with the intention at the time of the cold
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:37.040]  war to to have an american century and an american predominance and so the the reason for the iron
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:43.120]  curtain for example comes out of george kenan and the american century notion or doctrine where he
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  wrote quote this is a declassified document we have 50 of the world's wealth but six percent of the
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:55.680]  population in this situation we cannot fail to object to the envy and resentment of the rest
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:00.480]  of the world he's saying our real task is the coming period to in the coming period is devise
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:06.000]  a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:11.760]  positive detriment to our national security to do so we will have to dispense with all the
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:17.600]  sentimentality the daydreaming and put our attention upon and concentrate upon everywhere
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:24.880]  our immediate national objectives we need not deceive ourselves that we can afford this luxury
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:30.400]  of altruism in this world of in this world so he's basically saying that we're going to have to
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:39.840]  have a reality a real politic at this cold war period and there's analysis given by f. William
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:46.480]  engdahl where he notes that america's leading post-war planners have been involved in this 1959
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:51.680]  war and peace studies project of the new york council on foreign relations in other words kenan
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:58.480]  at the cfr had put this out this would be part of the guiding philosophy in terms of geopolitics
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:04.000]  and foreign policy in terms of the united nations so this was actually a report given to the united
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.240]  nations and the point the point at this point was to have the architects of a post-us dominated
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:18.320]  post-war us dominated global policy they however chose not to call it an empire instead the united
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:25.520]  states would project imperial power under the guise of a colonial liberation policy support for
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:32.080]  thus democracy and free markets would be a central to this projection of power and and this extension
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:40.720]  of empire most effectively it would then combat the dialogue the diabolical propaganda in terms of
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:45.600]  what the ussr was putting out in other words now we have to fight the war in a new way the cold war
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:51.760]  war but the american century is key because we tend to think when we hear this we think of this as
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:56.160]  what would be in the best interest of the american city the average american citizen
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.960]  and unfortunately that's not the case and i want to be fair i know i understand the nuances here
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:07.520]  that the cold war was a reality that was very complex and in many cases many people in the
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:11.920]  intelligence apparatus that were fighting for this the for western freedom and whatnot they
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:19.280]  were fighting on the basis of classical liberal western ideas going back to you know roman law
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:25.760]  common law etc and they're fighting on the basis of halford mckindor's heartland rimland theory
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:30.720]  right that controlling eurasia is the key to controlling and having the upper hand in terms
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:40.880]  of global dominance when brooks adams for example is involved in setting a lot of us policy in the
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:49.120]  1950s this was precisely the justification that he had for the american global empire and that was
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:55.760]  because at the cfr they had determined along with the kip mckindor thesis that you had to control
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:02.560]  the heartland excuse me the eurasian heartland in order to control the rest of the globe at the
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:09.120]  same time brazinski and his famous grand chessboard book wrote that the united states must in terms of
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:16.320]  eurasia control this eurasia is of the first import for its control of geo strategy and the
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:21.920]  purposeful management of this geo strategic dynamic states that in other words to put it in a
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:27.440]  terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:34.640]  of imperial geo strategy are prevent collusion maintain security dependence amongst the vassals
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.160]  and to keep tributaries pliant and protected this keeps the barbarians from coming together
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:46.240]  in other words this is a quote from brazinski that the american approach is an empire it's an
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:52.560]  empire it's an american imperium but it's under the guise it's under the cloak of humanitarian
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:59.440]  democracy free markets etc and unfortunately until we recognize the reality this the the power
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.800]  structure behind the western imperium is very powerful private families private interests
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:09.680]  like the rockabillars who do not have it in everyone else's best interest to have an american
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:14.800]  empire that supports actual americans this is what people can't fathom and this is why we've never
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:21.280]  really been able to get anywhere in terms of stopping the takeover of our country and are
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:26.320]  devolving into this collapse that we're now in is that we've never been able to face up to and
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:34.400]  recognize who's really running things the fortune 100 the fortune 500 are not we think of these as
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:41.520]  a free market we think of these as entities that are fighting against the the regulations of a big
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:46.240]  government and all that well that is true at a certain degree at a certain level but everybody
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:51.280]  can see nowadays is completely uncloaked especially with all of the fortune 100 fortune 500 that attend
[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:56.560]  davos bilderberg etc that they're all on party with the same plan they're all on the same
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:04.720]  game plan they're all party to the same strategy which is to implement a technocracy that is
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:11.760]  malthusian anti-human post-human now why do we go back to all that cold war stuff well today what
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:17.920]  i want to try to do is chart the course from the end of the cold war to the rise of the war on terror
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:24.720]  to the putting on the back burner of the war on terror to suddenly now the war on humanity the
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:33.760]  war on viruses the war on whatever the next phase of this global war is the the war became global
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:38.560]  not just in world war one and world war two world war two but also in the cold war and that prepared
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:43.600]  the way for the war on terror and the big geopolitical strategists who write about this talk about that
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:50.960]  so it's not a conspiracy theory it's just a fact of the process of geopolitics and so this is where
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:57.840]  we got to the point where it's necessary to invade all of these countries to police the world and
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:04.240]  whatnot it's because the maintenance of a global empire that is not run for american interests
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:13.200]  it's a cabal a clique that brought american foreign policy back under the sway of interventionism
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.520]  and being the global policeman being the engine of a secret shadow government i covered that in
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:25.360]  the last several talks here in the fourth hour with the millner book with the fabian society
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:31.120]  with uh talking last week about a shadow government and and going all the way back to
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:36.160]  play-doh secret societies in the perfect ideal republic which is the technocracy it's modeled on
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:44.560]  play-doh's republic and so that same uh inner secret cabal running things with a shadow puppet
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:51.280]  governmental front of elected leaders is precisely how the western world is run
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:58.320]  and we are still at a stage when people cannot figure this out uh i had a conversation with
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:03.040]  somebody who was talking about a very prominent figure and this prominent figure who's very
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:12.640]  intelligent is just so terrified of talking about the notion of quote conspiracy well why would we
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:18.400]  think that quote conspiracy is something abnormal when if you read even just history let's not talk
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:25.360]  about geopolitics let's talk about history isn't history full of conspiracy courtly intrigues
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:32.880]  well absolutely history is full of assassinations and wars and spies and espionage it's all across
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:39.920]  everybody's history so the norm in history is actually conspiracy it's not abnormal but we live
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:43.600]  in a pot in a in a day when the population is so dumbed down that they don't even know american
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:48.080]  history they can't find america on a map but we have to know these things that we're going to
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:52.800]  figure out the solution to what we're really up against don't go anywhere this is the alexa
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:58.880]  johnson i'm your guest host j dire of j's analysis welcome back to the alexa johnson i'm your guest
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:02.800]  host j dire of j's analysis we're charting the history of the 20th century up to today
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:10.880]  which got us to this disastrous place of the emergence the uncloaking of the technocratic
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:16.880]  post-human world order and i'm charting that course from the cold war to the war on terror to
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:24.080]  where we are now and after the cold war as the cold war began to wind down when we had entities like
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:30.240]  harvard and the economists out of harvard and studies that were done in the rand corporation
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:35.840]  preparing for the sort of dissecting and looting of russia which occurred in the 1990s this was
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:40.880]  actually covered i think in some congressional inquiries in the 1990s the harvard crew that went
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:47.760]  in and sort of divvied up divided up russia and a lot of the the resources privatized it this was
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:54.800]  through collusion with a lot of former kgb kernels as well as russian mafia individuals some of whom
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:03.680]  putin later arrested and sort of deported and that that has a lot to do with today's drama
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:08.320]  when it comes to russia i'm not going to go into all that but if you don't know of course the rand
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:15.280]  corporation was founded in concert with the air force under kurtis lame that's who's lampooned
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:21.280]  in dr strangelove then we have the under jfk a lot of studies being done in terms of the cold war
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:28.960]  via rand and by the time we get to brzezinski who helps to basically end the cold war and bring the
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:36.480]  soviet union to a halt to a collapse this is done through the afghanistan operation when brzezinski
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:48.320]  utilizes the mujahideen as a way to bog down russia in the soviet conflict there and this leads to
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:55.840]  further pressure on russia or the soviet union i should say and as we as we said when that when
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:00.960]  the wall falls when that when the soviet union collapses the imf is who really is the key player
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:07.920]  to come in with these harvard economists and to divvy up and loot the country and so this was
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:17.680]  done as a kind of privatization personal private corporate debt restructuring you could say to
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:23.200]  to try again to further dismantle and destroy this country and this is no different action
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.760]  than what we saw in world war one and world war two when according to dr quigley you had a lot of
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.880]  these elite planners a lot of these people that came in and restructured these countries after
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:39.760]  the wars to be in an imf world bank debt model and we saw the imf world bank those are fabian
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:44.720]  institutions that are intended ultimately to bring about a kind of fabian socialism which is not
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:52.480]  anti-capitalist but united with monopoly capital this is what helps us understand the last few
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:58.400]  months of news when it comes to ukraine and the norstream pipeline because turns out the pipeline
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:04.800]  battles are a huge issue a key factor in a lot of this because in terms of the new world order from
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:10.880]  the western atlantis's perspective this is about the control of energy and the control and dominance
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:16.640]  of resources and so a lot of times when we hear about the human rights abuses and the need to go
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:21.680]  into these various countries for human rights abuses it turns out that was a cloak for western
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:29.840]  black ops western operations ultimately as serving private interests so this doesn't benefit us
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:36.000]  average americans the fact that a private corporation is getting access to a market
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:41.600]  isn't really helping us out it's only helping out those private interests and i'm not a socialist
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:47.760]  i'm not saying that we should nationalize all the oil or anything it doesn't work that way
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:54.640]  it's more of a bigger power play and if it was really about the resources in terms of you know
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.400]  if if we were told well we have to get those resources because we need it for our country
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:04.000]  because we use so much oil we're overextended but then why does biden shut down pipelines
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:12.000]  why does biden shut down american oil so this is just a further level of excuse
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:19.280]  for these foreign escapades to go into these other countries and it's not even in the long
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.240]  long term about getting the oil that's a big piece of this that was a big part of desert
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.440]  storm and all that as well and it's a big part of who's going to give you know put their pipeline
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:36.640]  and their oil and their natural gas and all that into the ukraine and servicing europe right
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.240]  right and so the pipeline battle is a big part of it but even that isn't really the end goal the
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:49.440]  end goal here goes beyond entities like haliburton and the different contractors and rathion and
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:54.800]  bowing and all the military industrial complex it actually goes to a long-term game of bringing
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:01.040]  about a full-on global technocracy and a lot of people think that in order to get to that stage
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:06.560]  to shut off you know uh it's necessary at this phase to shut off russian energy russian oil
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:13.120]  throughout that corridor and eventually bring about a giant global conflict now i don't know
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:17.200]  whether that'll happen a lot of people think it might happen it's very necessary people think
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:21.680]  that what's going on now might trigger that people thought that when that we had the south
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:31.120]  of cesia uh crisis uh what in 28 2008 2010 somewhere in there and so i don't know uh what will cause
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:36.560]  this people thought oh it'll be uh north korea it'll be china who knows but in my view it's very
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:42.560]  possible that given what we have in state department memorandum 200 which is a an official document
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:49.600]  under nixon through um uh henry kissinger to accept population control first on the third world
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:57.280]  but also eventually in the domestic population so that we know that the eventual goal is to have a
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:03.360]  drastic re uh reduction in global population and we know that that could come about through global
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:08.560]  war but it also might come about about through other means new viruses new releases this kind of
[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:17.600]  stuff monkeypox Ebola whatever right COVID 2300 whatever the next instantiation of the mutation
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:22.960]  of COVID might be any of those things might be the way to eventually reduce the population because
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:29.280]  remember population is also a human resource according to the global leap and they believe
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:33.600]  that eventually the human resource of human population will no longer be needed and in
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:38.240]  fact that they're just something in the way of progress and so the reduction of the population
[02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:45.760]  down to uh 90 95 percent in other words getting rid of 99 95 percent is an actual government
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:51.440]  project and policy now i don't think kissinger's documents say i want to kill 95 percent of the
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:57.360]  world but other uh people in uh government other people who are advising the consultants do have
[02:30:57.360 --> 02:31:02.640]  that philosophy do have that view and we have to understand that that's the overall objective
[02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:06.480]  that's never going to change from the vantage point of these people they really have adopted
[02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:10.880]  that malphusian perspective it's the official philosophy of the united nations which is one
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:17.200]  of the fabian institutions that these people put together the rockfellers especially in concert with
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:23.440]  the millner fabian group that philosophy of unesco according to julian huxley who wrote the
[02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:28.960]  philosophy of unesco is a drastic reduction in the world's population by any and all means
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:34.480]  so the real reason for the uh pushing of the sexual confusion degeneracy all of this stuff
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:39.920]  isn't about anyone's rights it's about the population the real reason for going into these
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:44.400]  countries aside from the control of resources and energy isn't really about anyone's rights
[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:48.880]  it's not even ultimately about the control of resources although that is a key
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:56.880]  important factor here it's about the eventual drastic reduction of population so again people
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:01.760]  on our side who analyze this stuff that that are called conspiracy theorists we don't know the exact
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:06.400]  means by which they're going to play all these cards or try to bring this about it might be global
[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:12.080]  war and there's a good possibility that we could see world war three or world war four to be specific
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:17.760]  it could kick off as a result of this conflict who knows i don't think that putin wants that
[02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:22.800]  but i also feel like you know with bio labs and all the information that came out about the bio labs
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:28.960]  in ukraine that russian and in the several years eight years or so of attacks on that border
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:34.160]  they felt the necessity to make this move whether you think it was a wise move or not
[02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:38.640]  not that was the reason for it don't go anywhere when we come out we're going to look at the global
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:46.240]  conflict welcome back to the auto show we were covering the history of the cold war and now i
[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:52.400]  want to talk about how that will transition into the war on terror when we come to the late 80s
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:59.280]  and early 90s and this again sets the stage for the next phase of the empire in terms of its
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:05.840]  decay and in terms of its transformation into its next business phase and again i'm not anti-american
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:10.640]  i'm not criticizing america american proper i think there's a lot that's positive to be said for
[02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:16.560]  the classic idea of america in terms of what its founders envisioned it to be in terms of the
[02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:21.920]  constitution and a non-interventionist republic you know a lot of the stuff that ron paul talks
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:25.760]  about all the time i think those are great points and positive things to be said about
[02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:32.160]  uh uh classic americana but as everybody knows if you listen to a lot of my talks if you listen to
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:36.160]  the lectures that we've done over the years going through quickly and others um you know this was
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:42.320]  basically transformed out of a non-interventionist uh non-involved we don't want to be involved in
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:48.720]  european wars and conflicts in the 1940s and 50s that changed when the national security
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:53.600]  uh stat uh state was established right when we got this uh sort of shadow intelligence
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:58.560]  government set up now it was already being co-opted back under woodrow wilson uh under
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:03.600]  the inquiry under a colonel edwin mandel house that was already in process but it didn't really
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:11.200]  occur until we get up to the time of f dr and then we get up into the the time of um bill donovan
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:17.360]  the beginning of the os s that's when we really get this uh this inner group set up again by
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:22.640]  british intelligence to bring back things back into the attitude of the european conflict and the
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:30.640]  european the british imperial model remember this uh halford mckinder strategy and and set up and
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.440]  characterization of the world is out of the british imperial model of running the world
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:41.440]  and so america de facto sort of adopted that strategy that model this is what we get with
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:46.880]  brzezinski and and his his many decades of strategizing as well as kissinger then both
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:54.960]  both working together in a concert with uh you know the the rockefeller model for global population
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.360]  depopulation and control and remember as well that this is not disconnected from uh clouse
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:06.640]  and davos and the world economic forum in fact it was kissinger the cia they're the ones that
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.480]  really uh picked out clouse and set up the world economic forum it's an extension of that harvard
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:18.640]  project so there's these are not different things they're all just extensions of the same group the
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:24.480]  same power structure the same model of global governance and it is not about the stuff that
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:29.120]  they portray in the propaganda it's not about bringing freedom and democracy to these people
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:36.320]  it's about extending the strategies of control and the techniques of control including things like
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:42.240]  color revolution which are a technology according to gene sharp according to other people in the
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:47.360]  national endowment for democracy these think tanks that that sit around and cook up rank
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:52.480]  corporation they cook up these techniques of regime change not because they want to make
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:58.480]  things better but because they want to extend the model ultimately of malthusianism that is the
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:03.280]  modus operandi the operating system of the elandesis western power block that's the ultimate goal
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:10.480]  and so it's a post modern imperialism it's a post human imperialism that is being extended
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:16.400]  and there may be uh of course there's bad uh stuff going on by the people that are picked out right
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:22.320]  we pick a a dictator in another country right you pick saddam or you pick a a leader like
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:27.440]  Assad right who is actually very popular and is there corruption in government sure there's
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:31.680]  corruption in every government but you'll notice that it's very arbitrary it's very low level oh
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:37.360]  they threw a baby out of an incubator which is all fake oh somebody uh used sarin gas
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:40.640]  so uh Assad is gassing his people that turned out to be all fake
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:46.960]  and so we notice that again it's a constant provocation and i think that it's very possible
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.200]  that we'll see more of that we've seen the ghost of Kiev you know a bunch of fake stories already
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:56.400]  in regard to the the ukraine conflict so it could get much worse it could get in in in terms of a
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:04.080]  you know big scale false flag involving uh big scale bombs right it could get really bad excuse me
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:10.000]  but the point here is that as we move out of the cold war uh what we what the reason that we have
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.800]  the war on terror was that this was seen to be a useful strategy for primarily targeting
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:19.520]  and reorganizing the middle east russia had been looted in the 90s and so they weren't really seen
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:25.840]  as a huge conflict but remember at this time uh putin had booted out several of the uh the
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:31.920]  the oligarchs uh so to speak who then went back i think to the uk and uh we're kind of hiding out
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:40.000]  in london and at the same time we had this uh breaking up and the destabilizing of the
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.480]  soviet bloc after this period this was a brzezinski strategy as well known as the arc of crisis
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.800]  and this is an engine strategy of engineered chaos engineered crisis partly for regime change
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:56.880]  but also to reorganize and reorient all of the post the soviet bloc satellite nations into
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:03.280]  a pro-western pro-democratic pro-american strategy but again it's not about america not about
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:09.040]  democracy not about free markets it's about uh fortune 100 fortune 500 having access to these
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:14.000]  countries and to control these markets and we saw that when we covered wall street in the bolshevik
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.640]  revolution that was an old strategy back then the bolshevik revolution was engineered by wall street
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:27.600]  no different we fast forward to today go 100 years into the future from that time bolshevik to to
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:35.840]  now it's the exact same fortune 100 fortune 500 big banks big fans of revolution regime change
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:44.640]  toppling leaders and that doesn't mean that the leaders in in charge were angels were were uh
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:49.360]  swede cakes uh were not corrupt i'm sure every government had obviously every government has
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:54.320]  corruption that's a reality here and it doesn't mean that i agreed necessarily with uh if they were
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:39:01.200]  uh socializing and nationalizing their resources i don't necessarily agree with that but that was
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:06.400]  the decision of those countries right and so what godofi right he tried to nationalize things
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:12.880]  Assad doesn't he uh i think he believes in nationalizing oil and and the bathast approach right
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:18.000]  of the bathast party uh that was actually set up by an older cia plan by the way if you read the
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.040]  mall's copland text but mall's cloaking in his famous uh game of nations memoirs you know the
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:28.480]  cia operative he talks at length about utilizing terror utilizing terrorists all throughout the
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.600]  middle east as a strategy that the cia had had used quite profusely and of course the same thing
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:41.520]  occurred in the 1979 uh conflict when it was the brzezinski strategy to recruit the muja hadeen
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:47.600]  then the muja hadeen begins to they sort of in my view they stay on the uh western intelligence
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:53.520]  payroll and uh roll a deck to give them a call if they need if they're needed and this
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:57.600]  might have something to do with the 1993 world trade center mommy it might have something to do
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:04.880]  with the big nine event so this takes us up to uh the time of 9 11 uh well actually before that we
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:11.680]  should mention other conflicts like nato bombing bosnia uh nato bombing syria and this uh allowed
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:18.400]  for uh certain conflicts certain strategies against again russian influence areas to be pushed back
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.120]  and then we had in 1999 the bombing of the chinese embassy
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:30.640]  and this was done by us jet which was a false flag to enrage and embarrass the chinese i'm not pro-china
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:36.640]  i'm just saying that this was part of this overall phases of these conflicts uh towards the end of the
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.240]  cold war moving into the war on terror then of course we have the big night 2001 big nine event of
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.920]  the ben laden uh you know gets the blame immediately within seconds after the big nine event this kicks
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:55.520]  off the international global war on terror and some people thought that the really the big nine
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:01.200]  event was kind of the initiation of the the big world war four right uh we could say if the cold
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:06.960]  war is world war three then big the big nine event 9 11 is the initiation perhaps of world
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:11.760]  war four because today's conflicts that we see in the ukraine although this this is still part of
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:21.120]  this big global war now it's a global war fought not by nation states primarily but by shadow
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:28.160]  inner core groups utilizing various things like in the case of the big nine event we have the
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:33.840]  seven nations plan of general resley clark right which kicks off and utilizes again a lot of these
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.840]  arc of crisis model that was for the middle east the seven nations plan uh and then utilizing
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:45.520]  still that principle of arc of crisis according to brzezinski and the war on terror then is the
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:49.920]  in many ways many people think and many analysts think really the beginning of the degradation
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:55.200]  of the u.s. military so the u.s. military begins to be degraded demoralized and you might even argue
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:04.000]  that the ever since 9 11 this is a long term demoralization and degradation strategy by
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:11.280]  some of these global elites to eventually shed america to to displace the importance of america
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:16.320]  in the global scheme and move on into that full on global governance we're going to get there
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:21.360]  and we got to eventually shed the engine of america pushing the global order and move into
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.440]  something future that's where we get to great reset when we come back welcome back to the house
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:32.000]  don't show me guest host j dire of j's analysis and when we were covering the the last 20 years
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:38.240]  at least since the the big nine event we were getting to the point of how the neoconservative
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:43.680]  model the bush the bush era preemptive strikes and and false flags and this kind of stuff
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:51.520]  kind of cave way to a different model excuse me of the brzezinski era with obama and that
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:56.480]  doesn't mean that there was any change in the game in the long-term goal or game plan in fact
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:00.960]  they all have the exact same long-term goal and game plan in fact there's a great book called a
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:05.200]  afghanistan invisible empire by golden fist real which argues basically that
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:08.800]  brzezinski more or less is a neocon it really doesn't matter at that level
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:15.520]  what the political party differences are but when we get to that level of a kissinger or
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:21.120]  brzezinski you know these big global strategists they may just disagree on the game plan not the
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:29.280]  end goal and so but this helps to explain by the way why today's democrat party all the democrat
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:35.200]  leaders the top democratic people they don't really seem too different than a lot of the neocons in
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:41.040]  fact they enforce all of the same top-down tyrannical control they they try to shut down
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:47.280]  anybody who disagrees the censorship all of these which are supposedly right-wing fascist ideas
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:54.000]  right and we know the neocons were influenced by Strauss who was a big fan of the nazi
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:00.400]  strategy we know that the neocons were influenced by Trotsky they were neotrotzkyite so they had
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:08.720]  a weird mix of revolutionary tyrannical top-down fascist control the democrats nowadays are pretty
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:13.280]  much the same they operate with the same type of strategy and that's why we don't see any difference
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:19.760]  in terms of foreign policy with today's democrats they do the exact same stuff that that we saw
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:25.920]  neocons doing several years ago the only difference might be that you know with somebody
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:30.560]  like bush you might get a just a straight up preemptive strike right and then what we have
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:36.720]  with the brzezinski obama style or today's a biden administration which is really just an extension
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:45.280]  of kind of the obama approach is to use the proxy war use proxy soldiers use these you know
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:50.160]  the these other strategic approaches rather than the straight up warfare approach of the neocons so
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:54.640]  really that's kind of the only difference it's just a difference in approach but it's exact
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:45:00.400]  same strategy so there's no difference in these strategies and this is why we never see any change
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.240]  in the foreign policy foreign policy is never any different it doesn't because it doesn't matter
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:08.000]  who's in in charge there might be a little bit of difference here and there on something like
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.640]  iran but other than that there's not a whole lot of difference between these different groups
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:20.960]  of the neocons and the so-called liberals when we come to the ukraine crisis this kicked off
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:26.800]  right around 2014 with the western aided coup in the ukraine and that is i mean the previous
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:31.680]  governments were good guys it just means that for many years you had for example on record
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:37.040]  soros putting money into the orange revolution in ukraine going back to the 80s and 90s and that
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:41.920]  was part of that color revolution model and the the cia and the national endowment for democracy
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:47.360]  and the republican institute all these different groups these ngos and private groups which formerly
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:53.360]  this stuff in the cold war might have been done by the cia now it's being done by these cover
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:58.400]  ngo operations and that's nothing new either we saw that going all the way back to the wall street
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:03.760]  the bolstering revolution when the corporations that were running the bolstering revolution
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:12.400]  were using foreign aid as cover the red cross remember this well now it's us aid right it's
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:17.760]  these kinds of covers that are used for this stuff and in 2014 you had the coup in the in
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:22.000]  ukraine and we're never told in the west what the real reasons for that are of course we're
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:28.800]  told that putin wants to take over the world he wants to set up a new soviet union and we're
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:33.440]  not told about you know the the warfare for many years on the border we're not told about the
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.880]  bio labs that are there that are working on you know genetic gene specific
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.120]  uh race specific bio weapons which is mentioned in the peanut document by the way race specific
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:48.960]  bio weapons uh gene specific bio weapons but it's important to get to the end goal which is
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:55.360]  that we don't know where things are going to go we know that the covid pandemic was a big uh
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:47:01.120]  uh step forward for this click for the global elites to move us towards the post human world
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:06.960]  and it's very possible that this war might move us in that direction if it kicks off into something
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:12.960]  bigger now a lot of analysts think that it won't turn into a global war uh in fact i had a conversation
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:18.000]  with a prominent uh colonel and he was of the opinion that you know putin doesn't want this
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:24.560]  kind of a war and so it's very possible that that won't happen but we don't know but if it does
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:29.200]  and or if it's something else you know if it's a bio release i mean this seems to be a very hot
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.080]  topic when it comes to the global elites given that they had a wuhan lab where we have this
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.080]  alleged leak or well i don't know is alleged i think it's proven now to come out of the wuhan
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:42.800]  lab according to the mainstream narrative now which is admitted and you had these labs in
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:49.200]  ukraine which were uh admitted eventually to be very dangerous very important right there next
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:55.200]  to to russia so it's starting to look like you know they they really like this uh this virus
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:02.160]  narrative or this a bio release or this uh you know uh the zombie virus release story or something
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:07.040]  like this who knows where it's going to go but if that's the route then you know we might have two
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:13.440]  things we might have a global uh uh war and a bio release and i think alex usually talks about how
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:17.440]  they'll probably do uh both they'll probably we might have a global war and then they'll release
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:22.160]  the bio weapons or they'll release the bio weapons then we'll have a global war maybe the bio weapon
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:27.920]  stuff is a false flag maybe the bio weapon is the cause for the global war to ramp ramp up to
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:35.200]  ramp ramp up to ratchet up who knows but regardless the we do know what the uh end goal is and that
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:41.120]  there's every possibility that we will eventually see in our lifetime a giant global war we can't
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:47.200]  control that we can try to stop that but if we understand the dangers here then we can be aware
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:52.320]  of you know avoiding this conflict at all costs it's not going to be good for anybody to to have
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:59.760]  that happen and remember that the people in the west pushing this do explicitly have a doctrine
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:06.160]  of malthusianism where they do want a post-human world and to bring in after a mass depopulation
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:14.640]  event or series of events a final transhumanist government a top down uh robot run global
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:20.080]  government now that might take it might be 2050 before they get to that but that is the admitted
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:24.480]  and stated goal by the people who run the west and who have this attitude and this this this
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:32.480]  strategy now uh i think Vladimir Putin is a real realist he's pragmatic and so i'm sure he's
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:37.280]  interested in integrating technology that he sees as useful for his his country as well
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:43.680]  but i don't know that you have on the part of russia earning these other countries outside of the
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:48.640]  the nato sphere an explicit doctrine of attempting to bring about a post-human world
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:55.520]  and that's that's the big thing here so does that make everybody in the west party to this no i don't
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:00.960]  think so i think most people in the west wouldn't agree uh that we need to get rid of most people
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:06.960]  on the planet right they would see this as something kind of weird and and uh sort of maniacal uh very
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:12.720]  uh you know mad science uh tyrannical type of thing and so most people don't believe that but
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:17.840]  they don't we don't understand that our elite in the west do believe this they're 100% committed
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:23.040]  to this they have meetings where they publicly talk about it and how to get to these goals
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:28.320]  and so we have to be aware of this and we have to realize that it's entirely possible that they
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:34.800]  could use uh you know global war or uh bio-release you know the first time i called into alex jones
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:42.960]  many many years ago i think back in 2006 or 2007 and i had just seen the movie i am legend
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:49.520]  and i had a conversation with alex uh over that and he said hey call back call back monday call
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:53.360]  back monday so i call back monday and we had a longer conversation about the movie because
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:51:01.040]  that dystopian movie presented a post-war bio-release zombie virus scenario right
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:11.760]  and it's just wild to see you know here we are in 2020 after this fake crisis of the the last
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:18.560]  three years or ramped up fake crisis which was uh now proven to be related to a leak from the west
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:26.240]  and in terms of wuhan lab and here we are uh with a a vast bio-release and then a bunch of
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:31.200]  death stabbies that everybody has uh unfortunately submitted to and gone along with
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:37.360]  and so uh are we looking at an i am legend scenario you know the great irony here is that
[02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:41.840]  you know again 2007 i first first called in and that's what we talked about and here we are
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:49.040]  many many years later and uh yeah it looks like they they went with that i am legend type of
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:52.240]  scenario even though everybody's not dead from a bio weapon i'm not trying to i'm not trying to
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:57.120]  say that obviously that's not the case but what i'm saying is that the people who are in charge
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:02.800]  they do seem to like this bio-release scenario they do seem to like this idea and this approach
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:10.080]  um and they do work on uh gene specific race specific bio weapons according to them according
[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:15.840]  to their papers their public policy white papers and so is that really where we want to go do we
[02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:23.440]  want to be ruled by uh an elite that are hell bent on malthusian depopulation
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:32.480]  and until we recognize that it's not communist it's not socialist it's not it's not even uh
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:37.840]  the the corporations themselves it's that the elite of these corporations of these private
[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:45.280]  entities they are all on the same page openly fortune 100 fortune 500 the big banks etc and
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:49.760]  this is their game plan and it's in all their books it's in claus's fourth industrial revolution
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:54.480]  book the last third of the book is about this bringing in the sky net technocracy you want to
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:53:03.440]  get my books go to jason ellison uh get them in the shop and support alex
[02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:08.160]  you know where the cia tunes in right you know where the russian's tune in you know everybody
[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:12.320]  tunes in right you know tucker carlson tunes in to and joe rogan and elon musk you know where
[02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:19.600]  they tune in right they tune in right here info wars tomorrow's news today we are witnessing
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:26.240]  the mark of the beast system openly rolled out and announced whether you believe the bible is
[02:53:26.240 --> 02:53:31.600]  inspired by god or the word of god or not what was written number 2000 years ago by john the
[02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:37.680]  revelator on the isle of patmos is coming true a world government that makes you take a mark in
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:42.240]  the hand or the head to be able to buy and sell and that you must worship the beast that means
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:46.800]  follow what the beast says or you can't buy or sell it's not just that you have to have the mark
[02:53:46.800 --> 02:53:54.880]  to buy or sell you've got to do what the beast wants you to do or you cannot buy and sell and
[02:53:54.880 --> 02:54:00.400]  that's where in late 2022 we are last week the world economic forum was given over 100 million
[02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:05.360]  dollars by government of canada to roll out a world id through the un based on the communist
[02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:11.360]  chinese digital social credit score system and now just today bill gates came out here's the
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:18.080]  article right here and his foundation donated 200 million dollars to expand digital id surveillance
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:23.200]  system for the same chinese communist control program so the social credit score and communist
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:28.320]  china and all the control you see is the model of this system being rolled out in spain rolled
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:32.480]  out in idly rolled out in germany rolled out in canada and now they're trying to roll it out here
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:38.720]  in america just a few years ago claus schwaab had the wf said you will have to take a microchip
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:47.120]  to buy and sell in the near future and now here we are so this is a huge huge issue that they can
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:53.040]  then dictate to you through this new digital currency through this world id every action
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:59.120]  you take in your life with a carbon tax through the social credit score through universal basic
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:04.320]  income as they shut off the regular economy and small businesses making you sign on for government
[02:55:04.320 --> 02:55:12.080]  handout but with that handout comes all of the rules of the game this is no longer theoretical
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:19.040]  on some drawing board or some computer this is something the bureaucrats and the megacorporations
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:24.640]  and major governments are doing and there's a race between the west and communist china
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:32.800]  to see with big tech who can put this in first so it's scary but at least we are exposing it
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:37.760]  and at least we know about it just last week paypal said if you criticize government if you
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:43.600]  criticize open borders or forced injections or anything else gun control we're going to find
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:49.120]  you two thousand five hundred dollars for what we say you're doing in your own personal life we're
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:54.160]  going to surveil you and then we're going to censor you but within days of the announcement they
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:59.840]  had to back off because of the backlash so submitting to this only makes things worse
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:05.200]  standing up to it saying no only makes things better and that's why it's so important today
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:12.320]  ladies and gentlemen to say no to world war no to nuclear war no to open borders no to pedophilia
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:18.560]  no to the satanism that is the new world order and you cannot do that better than sharing the
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:23.280]  articles and videos and links from info wars.com and bandot video to be the paul reveres of your

[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:57.440]  60 off in the history of info wars at info wars store.com thank you so much and join us during
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:08.320]  this important part of history you got us the amazing sponsor a few years ago that have been
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:13.120]  great the problem was everybody sold out of high quality but the same time affordable sat phones
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.480]  they finally got them back in they also have this amazing bivvy stick dongle that turns any phone
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:24.240]  into a sat phone spend a few minutes telling folks about info wars phone.com well first of all anybody
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:29.680]  who's watched what happened in florida absolutely saw people without power people without communication
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:35.520]  and the word when you lose communication is you panic the nice thing about satellite phone stores
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:41.200]  the owners have dedicated themselves to making sure everyone can stay in touch with their loved
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:46.240]  ones that they understand how fragile the electrical grid is and also the cell phone
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:50.720]  communication grid i'm told that there are hundreds of thousands of people without cell phones
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:56.000]  in florida and what was neat about satellite phone store alex they sent out vans and we're
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.920]  finding people that had to communicate to let their loved ones know that they're alive communication
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:08.160]  in a survival situation is paramount not just to be keeping in contact with your loved ones but for
[02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:15.840]  information services so the bivvy stick obviously is satellite to satellite you use your cell phone
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:19.840]  in airplane mode but this is probably one of the neatest things there is the difference between the
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:24.000]  bivvy stick and satellite phone is a voice communication but you're limited to the amount
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.720]  of text you can send with a bivvy stick you can give messaging and that's one of the things that's
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:33.920]  so important and and these are free just with a year contract they have these satellite phones back
