[00:00.000 --> 00:29.440]  It's Friday, March 13th, 2020. 234 days out from this incredibly important election and
[00:29.440 --> 00:39.360]  all hell's breaking loose. Old scratch. The Elzebub has been throwing everything he's got
[00:39.360 --> 00:47.520]  at Info Wars. But thanks to your prayers, the good Lord above, this old cat Info Wars
[00:47.520 --> 00:54.960]  keeps making it out of there. Nine lives, got a lot more than that. Thanks to you out
[00:54.960 --> 01:02.080]  there. We really appreciate the prayers. Man, I gotta tell you, it is gonna be one hell of a
[01:02.080 --> 01:12.720]  transmission today. I can assure you of that. I'm now completely sure and have clarity, very deep
[01:12.720 --> 01:19.760]  clarity, like staring into a pure blue sky devoid of any clouds. You just see 100 miles from a
[01:19.760 --> 01:29.600]  mountaintop. What's going on with the coronavirus? It is absolutely, totally a globalist creation.
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.320]  And it's real on many fronts. But understanding what it is gives you power over it.
[01:38.080 --> 01:43.120]  Well, I told you this two weeks ago. I said FEMA has already declared secretly a national
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.880]  emergency. And I said in two weeks, we're getting pulled. I personally were a little blurb for the
[01:48.880 --> 01:56.880]  live show. I said, within two weeks, President Trump, that was just about 14 days ago, I said,
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.960]  within two weeks, President Trump will declare a national emergency. They'd already secretly
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.520]  declared it and got it in place before they, before they rolled it out. You just type that into
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.760]  infowars.com or into Google or Bing. FEMA has already secretly declared a national emergency
[02:13.760 --> 02:21.200]  infowars.com in the search box after it. And it will, it will pull that up for you.
[02:21.200 --> 02:27.200]  And the subheadline was President to make an announcement within two weeks.
[02:27.920 --> 02:30.080]  That's what I was told by sources.
[02:34.880 --> 02:36.000]  And here it is today.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.080]  Bloomberg, Trump declared national emergency to speed virus response.
[02:43.920 --> 02:47.120]  Trump says he may institute domestic travel bans.
[02:48.640 --> 02:51.360]  Well, I tell you, Mike Adams has been dead on about that.
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.720]  And the way it's all being rolled out is too coordinated. It's too choreographed.
[02:57.600 --> 03:00.800]  Trump didn't want to go on with it at first. They were going to blame him whether it's nice
[03:00.800 --> 03:06.400]  going along. That's really what this is all about as a globalist, flexing their guns,
[03:08.640 --> 03:19.120]  flexing their guns, exercising their power and training us to submit to them.
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.560]  It's not about whether the virus is super deadly or isn't. It's about the coordinated
[03:24.560 --> 03:32.240]  operation. So we'll, we'll break it all down on the other side. You talk about profound information.
[03:32.240 --> 03:39.440]  This is it. And that's not bragging. That's not hype. That's the reality of what's unfolding
[03:39.440 --> 03:46.720]  on this planet. And you see the conniption fits and the mental gymnastics of the media
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.040]  twisting and lying about me and throwing everything they have against infowars because
[03:51.040 --> 03:55.680]  they don't want us on the air during this period and they want to arrest me.
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.000]  And any day now I could be arrested or killed. And that's, it's not a big, you know, drama queen
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.920]  thing. I'm a man. I asked for all this. I actually, I'm actually enjoying all of this because I expected
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.160]  it and it was coming and I talked about it years ago and it's only going to get more intense and
[04:14.240 --> 04:19.360]  I can take it. And I know you can too, because standing up for the innocent and telling the
[04:19.360 --> 04:25.440]  truth is worth it. And so I'm very honored, very thankful to God. God believed that I could stand
[04:25.440 --> 04:31.200]  against this and that you stood with me and that we've come this far together. So it's just a great
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.840]  honor to have the scum of the earth line about us and the antagonists. It's a great blessing. And
[04:36.640 --> 04:40.480]  I don't do a perfect job carrying this operation out, but I'm doing the best I can.
[04:41.280 --> 04:45.280]  And so you've got my commitment here to never let you down when it comes to fighting as hard as I
[04:45.280 --> 04:51.440]  can. I'm never going to give up or give in. I may give out, but that's when God decides it's time
[04:51.440 --> 04:56.160]  for me to give out. I'll hold the line as long as God keeps me strong. And right now, I feel stronger
[04:56.160 --> 05:06.160]  than ever. It's really smart to get high quality, storeable food at infowarstore.com. It's also smart

[06:27.760 --> 06:36.880]  There is a good consciousness. And it's now been mathematically insigned into the proven not just
[06:36.880 --> 06:46.800]  in humans, but many other animals. But humans site is greater than that of anything else on this
[06:46.800 --> 07:01.520]  planet. We know that made the image of God great potential. We're told now we're obsolete that
[07:01.520 --> 07:10.400]  the creator is being made obsolete by the computers it created. Let that float around
[07:11.600 --> 07:23.600]  few seconds inside your skull to load a crap in. But everything is to kill the potentiality you have,
[07:23.600 --> 07:29.040]  the destiny you could have to make you think you're weak. So let me now tell you what the
[07:29.040 --> 07:34.560]  coronavirus 2019 is. We now know from one end of the other exactly what's happening.
[07:38.480 --> 07:48.880]  It is a Chimera HIV style bug that comes back over and over again. We told you that six weeks ago.
[07:49.680 --> 07:56.640]  Mainstream news today. LA Times. They survived the coronavirus. Then they tested positive again.
[07:56.640 --> 08:03.360]  Why? It's HIV part two, folks. Just like the top Indian scientists and how much of others have said.
[08:04.560 --> 08:10.160]  But you're not supposed to know that. So let's just move on from that.
[08:12.800 --> 08:19.920]  You've heard Microsoft and Facebook and Google and Twitter and advanced micro devices and every
[08:19.920 --> 08:25.520]  other big computer tech company tell you for 30 years, we're going to build a world where you
[08:25.520 --> 08:32.800]  don't drive to work, where you telecommute. Well, that's great to do that sometimes. But if you watch
[08:32.800 --> 08:39.760]  what they teach school kids in England, going back 15 years with shows on TV and also here
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.480]  now it goes, oh, megaopolis. You only get meat on your birthday. The government decides when you
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.960]  can leave your house and decides what government job you've got and shows all these happy people.
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.520]  An adult watches that and thinks this is pure dystopia. But the five-year-olds watch it
[08:59.520 --> 09:02.960]  and they think it's completely normal just like being led into a big fat man
[09:02.960 --> 09:09.360]  who's a convicted pedophile and being sent on their lap. So all of this is conditioning of the
[09:09.360 --> 09:15.040]  youth and so they're canceling schools all over the country. By next week, all the schools in
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.080]  the country will be canceled. It's a giant virtue signal, a giant stampede, giant mob
[09:20.080 --> 09:26.720]  psychology, whether the virus is super deadly or not. And it's all a drill in global monkey
[09:26.720 --> 09:31.680]  sea monkey dude. Just like four weeks ago, we had drones shouting at people giving orders
[09:31.680 --> 09:42.080]  in China. Now it's happening in Italy.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.680]  And notice it's all socialist and globalist governments. Italy got taken back over by globalists.
[09:55.360 --> 09:59.760]  It's all big tech. It's all south by southwest. It's all the leftist groups. This is their next big
[09:59.760 --> 10:06.080]  hoax. And they've had this on the shelf for a long time waiting.
[10:09.840 --> 10:16.880]  And now they're rolling it out. It's all about the new world where you don't get to leave your house
[10:17.840 --> 10:24.480]  unless your smartphone, China does this, says you're cleared to go and that you're authorized to
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.560]  travel because there's going to be deadly viruses all the time now. And don't worry, the government
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.520]  and the corporations will have treatments for it like HIV. It's just going to come back over and
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.640]  over again. So this is airborne HIV. Just like HIV gives you pneumonia and cancer and heart attacks
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.800]  and that's what it is. So Obama and the U.S. government, the criminals that ran it then,
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.120]  created this kind of era sold to China for plausible availability five years ago. That's
[10:53.120 --> 10:59.200]  mainstream news. And then now they've released it as their big temper tantrum. And don't worry,
[10:59.200 --> 11:05.120]  they've got treatments for it all, but it's still going to kill you. So they wanted to depopulate
[11:05.680 --> 11:09.600]  and they now gave you a soft kill weapon that debilitates you and comes back over and over
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.600]  again. So you never really know the virus killed you. You're just dead. And if you try to run away
[11:15.600 --> 11:20.400]  or, you know, try to fight it, well, you know, just in mass, we were showed how to behave by communist
[11:20.400 --> 11:24.240]  China that killed over a hundred million of its own people. They're now the saviors showing us
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.240]  how to drag men, women and children out by their heads and take them and then kill them
[11:28.240 --> 11:31.760]  and burn them in mass graves or weld them into their houses. This isn't
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.360]  Will Smith and I am legend. It's not Omega man with Charlton. It's not the last man on earth
[11:39.360 --> 11:48.880]  with Vincent Price. It's the world 2020. And everybody gets into the hysteria. Everybody has
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.880]  a bunch of fun with it. And all of a sudden I can drive all over Austin at rush hour and get there
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.240]  twice as fast and restaurants are empty already. And it's kind of interesting. But now it'll be
[12:00.240 --> 12:05.760]  the new system with the new viruses like a weather report. You're hearing all this here first,
[12:05.760 --> 12:11.920]  you will watch all this become reality. Like a weather report, like an allergy report. Remember,
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.440]  allergies used to be bad 20 years ago. Now everybody has them. It's the GMO. We're dying. We're being
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.160]  killed. This has all been done before. It's it's all planned out. Planets being killed very slowly,
[12:20.160 --> 12:22.720]  but you never know what hit you because you're powerful. If you knew it was hitting you, you'd
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.200]  mobilize and go to next level and defeat them. But no, it's it's all creeping death. The 5g is
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.920]  going into lower your immune system and track you at the same time. And the sterilization is
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.600]  intensifying and just like weather reports or allergy reports, it'll just be the corona family.
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.920]  And then once you buy into that and accept it, well, a new family of viruses and oh,
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.720]  there's a new vaccine for that. And if you don't take it, well, you let others get it,
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.480]  even though they're not protecting when they take it. And this is the tyranny. It will be
[12:52.480 --> 12:58.720]  medical. You know, with Paul Revere, one is by land, two is by sea. The British came by land.
[13:00.400 --> 13:09.920]  It'd be one light up in the church table. But if it was by sea, it'd be two lights, right?
[13:09.920 --> 13:20.320]  But see, it didn't come by land or sea. It came by fear and panic and a virus. And Trump tried
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.600]  to block it. He tried to not make a big deal about it. He understood it. And then we said, no,
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.160]  you can't get behind it because they're going to hype it. You can't defeat a hype at this level.
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.720]  The left's all behind it. You got to take control of it. But the president knows now
[13:34.720 --> 13:42.000]  and understands. And this is a medical tyranny. And it's a big test. Can they put out a manmade
[13:42.000 --> 13:50.480]  virus and then shut up the German and the Russian and the Indian universities that scan it? No,
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.560]  this thing's manmade. Oh, we'll cut your funny if you say that. Okay, we'll draw it. The Indian
[13:54.560 --> 14:01.200]  universities, others didn't say they were wrong. They just pulled it. And no one discussed this
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.360]  where it came from. And now we're all being told do this. We don't know how deadly it is. It's
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.680]  killed a thousand people in Italy. Who knows even what that is. And now there's other strains that
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.920]  are more deadly. And this is all a test to see how we behave and how we act and all the schools
[14:17.920 --> 14:21.920]  and everything are being canceled so that in the future, when they snap their fingers and say,
[14:21.920 --> 14:29.120]  everybody's got to stay in today, your carbon footprint, you can't travel around your smartphone
[14:29.120 --> 14:31.840]  didn't say, I mean, there was an article out two weeks ago in China where they said, oh,
[14:33.040 --> 14:36.560]  our smartphones, our surveillance, you can't even go out without a smartphone. Now they'll arrest
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.800]  you. And they track everyone in real time and where you were, what you did. And it's all to keep
[14:40.800 --> 14:46.240]  people safe. And it's a giant control freak straightjacket, not to keep us safe, but to enslave
[14:46.240 --> 14:54.160]  us. So if you wondered how they counter Trump, this is how they do it. And it's a paradox because
[14:54.160 --> 15:00.000]  if he doesn't buy into the hysteria that's impossible to defeat at this level, the stampede,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.280]  he will be overrun. But instead, he's running like a wilder beast running from a lion with all
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.240]  the other wilder beasts. And now he'll he could be overrun anytime he doesn't stampede right where
[15:10.240 --> 15:19.120]  they want him. So he can either stop and be overrun by it or he can go, Jones is right, I've got to
[15:19.120 --> 15:29.120]  run with it. And make no mistake, the White House listens to us. It's not bragging. But they know.
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.400]  And you know, too, don't you see, we're the Oracle, not Alex Jones, this whole operation
[15:34.400 --> 15:41.040]  is the zeitgeist. We are the human resistance. We have chosen the path of the pro-human future.
[15:41.040 --> 15:48.160]  And God has given us the flame of enlightenment. We are the true electrochemical supercomputers.
[15:48.160 --> 15:54.400]  We are the superiors to the bubbles. We are the masters of earth and the future all dimensions.
[15:54.400 --> 16:03.440]  And we will succeed. We will overcome. I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMG Tax. Tell us how
[16:03.440 --> 16:08.880]  your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS. My team of lawyers

[16:23.440 --> 16:31.200]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through
[16:31.200 --> 16:35.760]  the representation known as non-collectible status with the government. If you owe the IRS
[16:35.760 --> 16:42.240]  more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right

[17:03.680 --> 17:09.280]  know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too
[17:09.280 --> 17:16.480]  much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[17:16.480 --> 17:22.160]  before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know
[17:22.160 --> 17:28.080]  you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors. They'll immerse you

[17:53.360 --> 18:03.840]  That's 800-506-6740. We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to
[18:03.840 --> 18:08.560]  use them and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden. I mean, it's just
[18:08.560 --> 18:12.720]  what we're meant to do. It feels good when we do it. But we do sell high-quality, swarble food.
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.560]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle? I said, I think it's going to be
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.280]  really big. And they said, well, we can handle probably this. We're not sure we're investing
[18:19.280 --> 18:22.640]  everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund. I said, no, I think this is going
[18:22.640 --> 18:25.760]  to be huge. I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though
[18:25.760 --> 18:28.640]  the prices are going up for you. So those are the type of discussions we have. And I'm just giving
[18:28.640 --> 18:34.160]  the inside base of all of all of this. This is 100 times regular volume plus. It was 100 times a
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.040]  few days ago. Now it's about 200 times. Okay, at infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue,
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.000]  first come, first served. But the fact that the orders are so ultramassive, it's dizzying. I mean,
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.720]  this is just insane. We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe. And then,
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.360]  if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales. But everybody gets their
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.440]  order in, we'll get your food. But that's how big this is. So what you're getting is 100% the
[18:57.440 --> 19:05.440]  straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com. This should really be easier than it is. I'm not
[19:05.440 --> 19:11.280]  here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I
[19:11.280 --> 19:17.120]  absolutely know work that if you will listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see
[19:17.120 --> 19:24.080]  how amazing it is. And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will
[19:24.080 --> 19:30.480]  help us. And it's symbiotic. My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the
[19:30.480 --> 19:35.680]  good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and I didn't
[19:35.680 --> 19:40.880]  listen. And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago,
[19:40.880 --> 19:49.200]  sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now
[19:49.200 --> 19:55.520]  at infowarstore.com. And I'm telling you folks, get it. It's amazing. Discover the benefits.
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.120]  And it funds the info war a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[19:59.120 --> 20:15.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:15.040 --> 20:32.400]  I have received the transmission. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.640]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:38.640 --> 20:49.200]  If you can receive the transmission, you're in touch with the creator.
[20:51.360 --> 20:55.680]  If you're receiving this transmission, you want to be with God.
[20:57.120 --> 21:04.000]  They gave us everything good and not with Satan. It was very real. And once you destroy you
[21:04.000 --> 21:12.000]  and your family forever. All right, let's get right into it.
[21:13.760 --> 21:17.200]  I had several guests scheduled and they're great people, but I canceled them.
[21:17.200 --> 21:23.760]  No disrespect because I want to talk to the Oracle. I want to talk to the people.
[21:25.040 --> 21:29.040]  I want to do what the globalist hate more than anything. They've taken the comment pages off
[21:29.040 --> 21:34.080]  most newspapers. They're shutting down town squares. They don't want speech anywhere. The
[21:34.080 --> 21:39.600]  establishment, not the local government or the average person, but this town square still exists.
[21:39.600 --> 21:44.240]  And it's bigger than ever. Thanks to your word of mouth, which is the currency of liberty,
[21:44.240 --> 21:49.600]  which is the blood of freedom, which is the hope in the middle of despair, which is the dawn after
[21:49.600 --> 22:00.000]  the freezing night, which is the oasis in the Sahara desert, not just the fulcrum, not just
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.720]  the thrust, not just the will, but the entire existence of consciousness is based around
[22:06.720 --> 22:20.080]  belief in order. And the globalist promise you order, but all they bring you is disorder, don't
[22:20.080 --> 22:27.120]  they? So let's lay it out. I'm going to give the number out in a moment.
[22:27.120 --> 22:41.040]  I have been thinking very deeply about what's going on. And the system has been attacking us
[22:41.040 --> 22:44.240]  because they don't want me to be focused. They don't want you to be focused.
[22:50.560 --> 22:56.880]  We had a pretty profound last segment, I think. And as I sit back, I think the best thing for
[22:56.880 --> 23:04.320]  me to do is just lay this out very, very woodenly, very methodically. So let me just,
[23:04.320 --> 23:09.360]  let me just make it in basic statements, and then we'll drill into it all and take your calls.
[23:13.200 --> 23:18.800]  This entire event is completely staged and has a real bio weapon in its heart
[23:20.240 --> 23:25.840]  that is an entire class and family of engineered chimeras that are going to cause
[23:25.840 --> 23:34.400]  autoimmune disorders, pneumonia, cancer, attacks on nerves. We now know what it's doing.
[23:35.680 --> 23:40.080]  And that's why when you tune in now, or you tune in the national news, it's like,
[23:40.960 --> 23:45.280]  it's an autoimmune virus and it keeps mutating and it comes back and back and back. You heard
[23:45.280 --> 23:55.680]  that six weeks ago. The most prestigious Indian university that deals with CRISPR gene editing,
[23:55.680 --> 24:00.000]  look at this, it said, my God, this is completely artificial. Jesus, this is, excuse my French,
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.960]  this is out of control. And then others said the same thing, we know. So people that are debating,
[24:06.960 --> 24:12.560]  is it super deadly or isn't it? But everyone instinctively scared because, yeah, it's deadly,
[24:12.560 --> 24:21.360]  folks. They have introduced airborne 2.0 HIV and nobody's getting away from it. Everybody's
[24:21.360 --> 24:27.040]  already got it. And six months from now, when the kids are everywhere, and that's what Trump knows,
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.320]  he has been trying to hold back the kids and understand why. Well, he tries to assess what's
[24:30.320 --> 24:35.360]  happening. When everybody finds out that basically 90%, it's not going to be 70%.
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.320]  We told you, you know, six weeks ago, it'll be probably half. No,
[24:41.600 --> 24:46.640]  everyone's going to get this. You could go hide out in a basement somewhere. You're not getting
[24:46.640 --> 24:52.000]  away from it because once it gets in a body, the human body incubates it, spews it out. It's a tiny
[24:52.000 --> 25:01.040]  bio-weapon virus that floats around last days, even in the sunshine and is coming for you. So
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.680]  the globalists told you, we're going to sterilize your boys. We're going to reduce population.
[25:05.680 --> 25:09.920]  The Western sperm counts down 87% if you average Europe and the U.S. together.
[25:10.480 --> 25:17.680]  Some cities have 97% sperm count downs. We're being murdered.
[25:21.920 --> 25:26.880]  And so now this new virus comes out and, oh, the government's going to save us and the institutions
[25:26.880 --> 25:33.440]  are going to save us and, oh, some say it's super deadly. Some say it isn't. No, it's totally deadly.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.640]  And they did it. The globalists have technology to reverse this.
[25:42.880 --> 25:47.120]  Human immunity is amazing and we always do things that the globalists don't think we can do.
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.720]  So I don't think this is even a case of panic because your soul's being killed.
[25:50.720 --> 25:54.800]  Your consciousness is being drained. The globalists are destroying our attention spans,
[25:54.800 --> 25:57.680]  our connection to God and family. We're already dead anyways.
[26:00.640 --> 26:05.600]  I use the cheesy analogy, but it's a great scene. Rathakon Respott knows that it's going to detonate.
[26:05.600 --> 26:08.960]  They're going to die. If he doesn't go into the reactor, they're all going to die anyways.
[26:08.960 --> 26:12.880]  Why doesn't he just stop it? And he goes in and Captain Kirk doesn't try to open up
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.960]  the chamber to save him. And they grab him and hold him back and they said, he's dead already.
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.440]  Now, you've got to get in that position. You're dead already. You don't just think they
[26:23.440 --> 26:28.080]  started putting fluoride in the water in the late 40s that lowers IQ and brain damage and
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.160]  or injected poor white and poor black folks with syphilis starting in 1949, because the people
[26:34.160 --> 26:40.480]  running things were nice folks. You think they stopped in 1949 shooting black people up with
[26:41.680 --> 26:51.840]  syphilis? That's a microscopic worm that eats your brain. No, they've already loaded us with
[26:51.840 --> 26:57.040]  all sorts of nanotech. That's just an artificial virus that they can oscillate. We have the patents
[26:57.920 --> 27:05.200]  to trigger the viral spread when they want. They can, they can aim 5G beam at you and activate
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.160]  the viruses and nanotech already embedded. And that's not science fiction. That's 2020.
[27:11.040 --> 27:18.480]  So yeah, but the people doing this that serves the fallen one, the fallen one, you know, like
[27:18.480 --> 27:24.720]  in the 1980s, the thing crashes in the ice, they pick it up. Yeah, much worse than that.
[27:25.840 --> 27:31.840]  This thing, like Biden said, you know, you know the thing. He's talking about his guy.
[27:34.560 --> 27:41.280]  Just get right with God because it's 2020. We warned you. And I said, I said in game, I said by 2022
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.920]  they will begin the next giant depopulation operation in their own emissions. And they don't
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.480]  just do all this because they're not going to do it. They're going to kill you and your family.
[27:50.480 --> 27:55.680]  And most of us are already dead. We'll all be getting cancer soon. We'll all be sterile soon.
[27:55.680 --> 28:02.960]  It's over. But what matters is getting your spirit right with God. All these globalists,
[28:02.960 --> 28:06.800]  all these lawyers, all the establishment types that think they're part of the system,
[28:06.800 --> 28:13.280]  they're all a joke to the devil, to the, to the alien that God told us about. And so
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.560]  the big guy's in charge, and this is a test, and we're going to make it through this. But let me
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.400]  tell you, just like Christ pointed, I'm going to compare myself to Christ is just like Christ
[28:22.400 --> 28:29.200]  pointed at Jerusalem and said, by the time your generation has passed, not one stone will be left
[28:29.200 --> 28:36.560]  on top the other that Google, Facebook, Bill Gates, all of these people before this generation passes
[28:36.560 --> 28:42.240]  everything they've done will be destroyed and they will be the known failures of the universe.
[28:42.240 --> 28:47.440]  They are the slaves of Satan and they have failed. I'm going to tell you what's coming next when
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.000]  we come back and give the number out. But I am so honored to be here in defense of human liberty
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.880]  with you. And I could feel your prayers. Keep them up. We'll be back.
[28:59.760 --> 29:05.680]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com. Like you, I was a
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.160]  prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[29:10.160 --> 29:14.240]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden,
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.160]  and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.360]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.600]  our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help. Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com,

[30:11.360 --> 30:17.920]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[30:17.920 --> 30:23.360]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[30:23.360 --> 30:30.320]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[30:30.320 --> 30:35.120]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[30:35.120 --> 30:39.520]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[30:39.520 --> 30:44.960]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you
[30:44.960 --> 30:49.760]  whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook,
[30:49.760 --> 30:53.840]  on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[31:00.960 --> 31:04.000]  Hannah meant about pronouncing that right. What do you think's really going on? And thanks for
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  calling. So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago. I was getting ready. I went to buy a bunch of
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.920]  toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit. And I had my phone, I had my show going on,
[31:13.920 --> 31:17.600]  sticking on my pocket so I could hear it. I wasn't using headphones. This lady starts,
[31:17.600 --> 31:21.600]  she says, who are you listening to? Who's that talking? I said, this is Alex Jones. And she
[31:21.600 --> 31:27.200]  just got, her eyes got wide open and she says, really? I thought he was off the air. And I said,
[31:27.200 --> 31:31.440]  no. And I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go. She
[31:31.440 --> 31:37.200]  wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowords.com and just said she's still on. I run into people
[31:37.200 --> 31:41.520]  at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love
[31:41.520 --> 31:44.480]  you. I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air? And I'm like, we're on
[31:44.480 --> 31:48.080]  hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations. We have our own streams at
[31:48.080 --> 31:52.400]  infowords.com and band.video and they go, really? They said you were off the air because they took
[31:52.400 --> 31:59.440]  the deplatforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform. Info wars, info wars, info wars.
[32:00.720 --> 32:05.040]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically. You want to
[32:05.040 --> 32:10.640]  drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually. There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere
[32:10.640 --> 32:17.840]  you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar. Your bang for your
[32:17.840 --> 32:25.280]  buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit
[32:25.280 --> 32:29.920]  of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be
[32:29.920 --> 32:35.840]  slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, we have to make the
[32:35.840 --> 32:42.240]  effort 110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack,
[32:42.240 --> 32:46.720]  attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalist and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[32:46.720 --> 32:50.320]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[32:50.320 --> 32:55.040]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for
[32:55.040 --> 33:00.000]  us, for myself, my family, your family, because we're in this together infowarstore.com.
[33:00.000 --> 33:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.280 --> 33:23.120]  That thing, it didn't want to be that dog.
[33:23.120 --> 33:36.400]  It wanted to be us. And it waits towards sleep in the dark, and then strikes.
[33:44.080 --> 33:48.240]  But some of us aren't sleeping, or we sleep with one eye open.
[33:48.240 --> 33:58.240]  And it's a real pleasure to take on the creature.
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.920]  All right, I want to give the number out. I want to take your calls throughout the entire broadcast.
[34:09.920 --> 34:18.400]  And then the big baggage takes over in the fourth hour.
[34:19.840 --> 34:27.520]  The toll free number to join us on this Friday edition is 877789 Alex 8777892539
[34:27.520 --> 34:32.640]  first time callers. See, I do open phones on Tuesday or Wednesday. The first time callers on
[34:32.640 --> 34:43.760]  Friday 8777892539. I haven't gotten to the other big story. There's a live feed headline up today.
[34:45.840 --> 34:52.640]  And the subheadline is very interesting. Trump set to declare national emergency.
[34:53.360 --> 35:00.240]  And then the subheadline at infoworks.com is the fact that the deep state wants to
[35:00.240 --> 35:06.800]  assassinate Trump and blame it on coronavirus. Oh, make no mistake. The ether has been swimming
[35:06.800 --> 35:14.560]  with that for about a week here at the office. And I wasn't ready to go to it until Wednesday.
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.960]  And then I came up here last night to shoot a video on it. And I didn't get it done because
[35:20.960 --> 35:25.920]  I was dealing with other stuff. There's a lot going on. But I will talk about that
[35:25.920 --> 35:33.280]  at the start of the next segment. But can we pull up on infoworks.com,
[35:33.280 --> 35:39.200]  the main feed of the show? If you just go to infoworks.com or newsworks.com,
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.840]  and you'll see the live feed of the show right there. And it says Trump set
[35:47.840 --> 35:54.720]  to declare national emergency. Leftist targeting 45 for assassination. We blamed on coronavirus.
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.360]  Well, that's quite a claim. It's like the claim we said six weeks ago that they're going to,
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.560]  that the virus comes back and like HIV over and over again, and you can't get rid of it. Oh,
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.640]  that's now Reuters AP. Everything today.
[36:15.920 --> 36:22.080]  Truth is, the globalist problem is their science. So they can use science for evil,
[36:22.080 --> 36:25.360]  but there are other institutions and universities and people that aren't evil.
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.000]  They go and they look and they tell us this and they're like, shut up. It's not true.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.920]  Shut up. University of Wisconsin. Shut up. University of New Delhi. Shut up. University in
[36:36.720 --> 36:42.800]  Switzerland. We're like, Hey, this thing has HIV delivery system.
[36:42.800 --> 36:52.560]  Oh, shut up. Then like, Oh, yeah, HIV drugs treated people like what Alex said that six weeks ago.
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.120]  And again, it's not that we're that smart. We understand how stuff works. That everyone's
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.760]  not evil. Everyone's not involved in conspiracy. That's the globalist problem is there's all these
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.240]  professional classes and all these smart people that are out there that actually have studied
[37:08.240 --> 37:12.720]  things and they know what they're seeing and they're going, Hey, this, this is, this is manufactured.
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.040]  They're like, shut up. Shut up. Your funding's cut. They're like, Whoa. Well, the university says
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.440]  I'm fired. If I don't withdraw my paper and say it's wrong, but I'm not going to withdraw my paper
[37:21.440 --> 37:28.000]  and say it's wrong. I'll just withdraw my paper. And then three more universities come out and say,
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.200]  Yeah, not only is this artificial, it's been weaponized.
[37:33.200 --> 37:41.440]  And that's really the big story is that it's mutating and it's the perfect cover
[37:43.120 --> 37:50.560]  for an off the shelf bio weapon that you can go and tweak parts of it and then release it on a
[37:50.560 --> 37:55.440]  certain group as race specific or even on an individual and then it mutates and becomes harmless
[37:55.440 --> 38:05.360]  right after it has a very quick half life. Think about that. And again, I have the virologist on
[38:05.360 --> 38:09.840]  I have the bio weapons experts on I have the, you know, author of the US weapons treaty on we got
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.240]  to get Francis Boyle on a set by the way. I don't know why this week I forgot to tell the producer
[38:14.240 --> 38:20.480]  just default get him on every week because the only person who's been more accurate than Mike Adams
[38:20.480 --> 38:27.600]  and in some ways has been Dr. Boyle. And I get Mike's real concern about this and how he says
[38:28.320 --> 38:32.240]  six weeks ago, it's going to totally lock everything down because the hype and because of
[38:32.240 --> 38:41.920]  the nature of this virus, it's super deadly to some people and it's mutating and it's man made
[38:41.920 --> 38:52.080]  and it comes back. Wow. It comes back like a zombie. So I'm going to lay out the evidence
[38:52.080 --> 38:57.280]  that they are. I mean, God, I heard this week's ago from folks in the office and I ignored it
[38:57.280 --> 39:02.000]  at the drumbeat intensified three days ago when they were saying that Trump's infected and
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.480]  Trump's got it and and and and and Balasaro. Everybody they hate needs me, you know, has it
[39:08.480 --> 39:13.280]  and sure enough, it's just playing. It's like whatever the worst thing is the globalist can do,
[39:13.280 --> 39:17.440]  they do. But let me hit this right now for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[39:19.200 --> 39:22.000]  This is very, very important. You can see my green folder here.
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.800]  Got a green folder right here and I'm going to show TV viewers that with an overhead shot
[39:34.800 --> 39:43.120]  and it's a New York AG order and then we open it up and just look at all those articles. That's
[39:43.120 --> 39:51.520]  just part of them. Hundreds of articles, hundreds attacking Alex Jones and what happened? The New
[39:51.520 --> 39:57.280]  York Attorney General, who is not a fan of Trump, though she is a lovely lady, said I ordered Alex
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.000]  Jones to immediately stop selling and marketing products as a treatment for cure for coronavirus
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.160]  on his website. If he doesn't see some assistance activities immediately, I won't hesitate to
[40:06.160 --> 40:11.920]  take legal action and hold him accountable for the harm he's caused. Then she went on to make even
[40:11.920 --> 40:20.880]  more claims that aren't accurate. And then it got picked up. But you know what? Nobody picked up
[40:20.880 --> 40:27.840]  was the actual letter from the Attorney General. It doesn't say any of that. But see, they're smart.
[40:27.840 --> 40:38.480]  They put out a letter, a PR statement that they said was her statement. And then in very few of
[40:38.480 --> 40:48.320]  the releases did they put the actual letter. And the mind control is incredible because we're so used
[40:48.320 --> 40:52.320]  to honesty from people that I had lawyers here today and they're like, yeah, here's the letter
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.480]  from the, I'm like, no, no, the letter's here. It's a little link down here. And in my crew,
[40:56.480 --> 41:01.680]  like for an hour, I'm like, no, no, sir, here's the letter. Here's the letter. I said, listen,
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.760]  that's not a letter. That's the PR firm. The legal letter says the says
[41:07.680 --> 41:14.080]  completely opposite of what they're saying. And see, that's the mind control because we take
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.400]  things at such face value that when we search Google and it says a gas station, the next gas
[41:18.400 --> 41:22.240]  station is five miles. If you don't pay Google now, they don't tell you where your gas station is.
[41:22.240 --> 41:27.280]  Your gas station can be in a quarter mile. And somebody needs gas right now. They don't tell you
[41:27.280 --> 41:33.760]  now. But they know you take stuff at face value. So this isn't about Alex Jones. It's about the
[41:33.760 --> 41:40.160]  process that I was with two lawyers this morning and my crew. And I was not getting mad. I kept
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.960]  going. I was like, hey, no, no, no, no, go out there. There's another official letter on the
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.480]  letterhead. It's just right under the email. They're like, no, no, we have a letter. I'd be like, no,
[41:48.480 --> 41:54.160]  no, no, no, that's a PR letter. And I just kept like, I said, please, please listen to me. Listen,
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.880]  they put that out as propaganda. The real letters here and they just, they were, they couldn't,
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.240]  they couldn't, I talked to crew, I would beg them, I'd say, please listen to me, please, please.
[42:03.200 --> 42:09.040]  This is a Psyop. They have put this out. But see, we're all just one dimensional now. So we see that
[42:09.840 --> 42:12.560]  and that's how they get us. And they're doing it everywhere like that.
[42:12.560 --> 42:21.200]  We never said that we had products that would cure you of coronavirus.
[42:22.640 --> 42:26.640]  We never said the toothpaste we sell, I'll play the ad when we come back,
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.400]  is about tooth whitening. It does have nano silver in a Homeland Security report
[42:31.440 --> 42:36.880]  years ago talking about antiviral properties. But see, that's what I mean. They're really crafty.
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.680]  They put out a press release that says all these things that aren't true. No, that's not a legal
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.600]  document. And the legal document, they just say, hey, you might want to clean your website up and
[42:45.600 --> 42:50.400]  the disclaimer at the bottom is not big enough. But they didn't say that, see, and no one sees that
[42:50.960 --> 42:56.960]  because they can. They're a dream. They only see the front page saying letter, they train general.
[42:57.680 --> 43:03.600]  Think about that. Rich in Alabama. Rich, thanks for calling. Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it. First
[43:03.600 --> 43:10.640]  thing, I love the turbo force. I drive truck for a living and it's amazing. Coffee kind of gives
[43:10.640 --> 43:15.280]  you a little crash there at the end, but that purple force is amazing. How is turbo force
[43:15.280 --> 43:22.240]  different than coffee? I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours. I don't
[43:22.240 --> 43:27.360]  feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee. And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I
[43:27.360 --> 43:33.520]  don't need anything to go to bed. I'll, you know, knock out them. I'm out cold. Well, that's what
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.760]  we went out to a top developer who did want his name on it. And I said, what would the ultimate
[43:37.760 --> 43:43.760]  long, say 10 hour energy be? Is that possible? That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch
[43:43.760 --> 43:48.080]  of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time released. And there's more
[43:48.080 --> 43:53.840]  money in it than anybody else puts in our product. So that's why turbo force has such a great effect.
[43:53.840 --> 43:56.640]  And so I really appreciate you. And I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[43:59.920 --> 44:04.960]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s family of listeners and viewers
[44:04.960 --> 44:11.280]  that without you, we won't be on the air. And I spent a lot of time thanking you. But I really
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.600]  think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.560]  better and raising the alarm as modern ball of ears. But something I should spend more time on is
[44:20.560 --> 44:27.120]  just reminding you that these products are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've
[44:27.120 --> 44:31.840]  seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.720]  are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation
[44:36.720 --> 44:43.600]  anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[44:44.240 --> 44:50.960]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[44:50.960 --> 44:55.680]  and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better. So visit
[44:55.680 --> 45:03.440]  infowarstore.com today. I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.560]  tried it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.000]  toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing? Just sitting in here telling me you
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  got to get up there and tell people. And so here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.200]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[45:23.200 --> 45:28.480]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.160]  is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[45:34.160 --> 45:38.960]  that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good.
[45:38.960 --> 45:44.720]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[45:44.720 --> 45:50.480]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way
[45:50.480 --> 45:54.640]  it feels.
[46:00.640 --> 46:08.240]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly. Now could somebody listen to me and go out and
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.720]  buy a gun and use it wrong? Yeah. Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man. I love women.
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.040]  You got to go out and get a girlfriend. You may have problems with her. You may get a divorce.
[46:17.040 --> 46:22.000]  You may whatever. The point is I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.840]  when I left. Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storeable foods, we've got

[46:59.520 --> 47:16.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.280]  By the way, I didn't lie to you. I just changed my mind.
[47:24.720 --> 47:28.400]  I canceled two guests today, but I was thinking, why didn't we get Dr. Francis
[47:28.400 --> 47:33.840]  Boil on this week? My fault. Just default, Daria. Just set him up every week when he can do it.
[47:33.840 --> 47:36.720]  Or anytime he wants some of the developments, he's like, yeah, I got big developments. He's
[47:36.720 --> 47:40.480]  coming on for like two segments, bottom of the next hour, but I'm going to go to your calls,
[47:40.480 --> 47:47.600]  Julian and Brian and Josh and Cindy and Janet and Cecilia and Matt and Bruce and Joe here in just a
[47:47.600 --> 47:56.000]  minute. But I want to finish up on 20 articles last night. When I say hundreds, it's thousands.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.880]  It's in every newspaper. It's pushed because Trump doesn't know how to take control of the
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.760]  State Department. There is Operation Mockingbird that Congress reported on in 1977 in the church
[48:05.760 --> 48:14.000]  committees. And even cruise ships get a little handout attacking me in the morning. I'm not
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.800]  joking. Everybody watching knows you're like you walk in a bar or you turn on TV. It's Alex Jones
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.720]  as a demon, Alex Jones as a man. Why are they doing that? Because they know we have their number,
[48:24.720 --> 48:34.240]  not me. This operation is seen as the people. So I love the first mother Jones and media
[48:34.240 --> 48:39.680]  matters towards Soros report single after me three days ago. He goes, Jones is really weird
[48:39.680 --> 48:44.480]  as an opportunist that just wants to make money off people and scam him. He's telling him that the
[48:44.480 --> 48:49.840]  virus is not that deadly and that's a bunch of hype. But then he says he sells products that
[48:49.840 --> 48:58.800]  cares coronavirus. No, I didn't say it cares coronavirus. I said it's known that sunshine kills
[48:58.800 --> 49:08.640]  viruses. It's known that they die just probably a few hours. They're not sure yet, but of course
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.840]  you put nano silver up against a virus that kills it. That doesn't mean it protects you
[49:13.840 --> 49:19.520]  from the virus gets in your lungs and starts replicating and eats them.
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.480]  And as a citizen, as a human, I'm going to say that we're already selling toothpaste
[49:28.480 --> 49:34.640]  that has nano silver in it. It's there because that's known to good to go for bacterial viruses
[49:34.640 --> 49:40.160]  in the mouth. Look at that Photoshop photo now they put up. Now they're like photo shopping
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.080]  with like huge Stalinistic parents. It's getting wearer and wearer. And so then it opens up like
[49:46.080 --> 49:53.040]  attorney general says New York stop saying you have a cure. Man, if I said I had a cure for
[49:53.040 --> 50:00.720]  somebody that gets coronavirus, I want you to like kick my teeth out because I'm the one that says
[50:00.720 --> 50:09.760]  silver is not a silver bullet. Just like I say vaccines are a silver bullet. Everybody knows
[50:09.760 --> 50:14.320]  that you think I'm going to get on air and say I got toothpaste that makes you not get sick.
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.200]  But see that's what they say I did. I have hundreds of articles hundreds of them. I got a whole
[50:19.200 --> 50:26.000]  stack of them right here saying that I'm saying I'm selling a cure for something. None of you
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.040]  ever heard me say that. I read a Homeland Security report separately how Homeland Security found
[50:31.040 --> 50:39.680]  it to the congressional record. Hell, I'll just show you that nano silver kills the entire SARS
[50:39.680 --> 50:44.560]  corona family up until that point. I'm not saying this new one, but of course it does. Sunlight
[50:44.560 --> 50:53.040]  kills it. I'm not selling sunlight. I'm talking to my audience about real things. I mean, yeah,
[50:53.040 --> 50:56.800]  maybe if you virus goes in your mouth, this is just hypothetical. I'm not making I'm just a person
[50:56.800 --> 51:00.880]  talking. This is what I think personally, you know, maybe one goes in your mouth. You've already
[51:00.880 --> 51:06.400]  brushed your teeth or something. Maybe it helps some that every we sell it for tooth whitening.
[51:06.400 --> 51:17.920]  My dad is a licensed dentist that the product says tooth whitening tooth whitening super blue
[51:17.920 --> 51:26.080]  whitening toothpaste not cures coronavirus. But I was going man, look at this Homeland Security
[51:26.080 --> 51:31.680]  report. This is really cool that nano silver. So when I said point blank range ago, oh my god,
[51:31.680 --> 51:36.400]  he needs to just take it out of it. Don't point blank range means let me put this to you this way.
[51:36.400 --> 51:43.680]  The only way to kill anthrax, the Pentagon says is to burn it. Okay, so I said anthrax in a fire
[51:44.480 --> 51:50.400]  dies at point blank range. It's because it's in a fire point blank range doesn't mean it's super
[51:50.400 --> 52:00.880]  powerful. Firing a ICBM 6000 miles and hitting a city is powerful. Point blank range means you've
[52:00.880 --> 52:05.040]  got to be right up against it. Well, how do you get a bunch of silver into your lungs at point blank
[52:05.040 --> 52:10.160]  range? The studies all say like the coat the cell and it also kill you know, it goes in like a silver
[52:10.160 --> 52:16.480]  so small that it like attaches to the virus and silver picks up electrode, you know, you like
[52:16.480 --> 52:20.000]  you walk your feet on the carpet and you touch somebody that shocks you. Well, that doesn't kill
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.880]  you but a virus, you know, I got my doctor. I just read the medical stuff. But it's not a panacea.
[52:24.880 --> 52:31.440]  I'm not saying the products we sell that we've been selling for years are for the damn coronavirus.
[52:32.720 --> 52:39.680]  And I will not sit here and watch these people do this because they took some clip out of context
[52:39.680 --> 52:49.280]  where I'm reading. Where is it? I got it right here. That's mainstream news but I had on boosting
[52:49.280 --> 52:54.960]  immunity and I don't even have it here. I didn't plan this out. Guys, will you find me the, oh
[52:54.960 --> 53:02.320]  here it is. I got the silver, got the silver, silver file right here. This might need to go turn
[53:02.320 --> 53:11.600]  their car off. I'll turn mine on too. Bust some fun around here.
[53:14.320 --> 53:22.400]  Here is the document. Ladies and gentlemen, oh look evil, major medical study. The history of
[53:22.400 --> 53:30.480]  medical use of silver and it's a big university report on it in all the ways it's used for thousands
[53:30.480 --> 53:36.000]  of years in modern medical. And hordes of, I got all these articles and then I've got the actual
[53:36.000 --> 53:47.280]  homeland security in Texas A&M and Pentagon reports right here, ladies and gentlemen, laying all of
[53:47.280 --> 53:51.520]  this out where they were just saying the congressional record. This is the congressional record
[53:51.520 --> 53:56.400]  that the Pentagon did a study and found that nano silver was taking out the SARS corona family of
[53:56.400 --> 54:00.240]  virus. We're not saying this virus, here's the Department of Army. That's me just covering an
[54:00.240 --> 54:07.600]  article. I'm not saying that our toothpaste is going to do that. I'm not saying that that is
[54:07.600 --> 54:15.920]  the case. No, ladies and gentlemen, that is not what I am saying. But again, that's how this system
[54:15.920 --> 54:24.880]  operates. That's how the deception operates. And if you simply go and if you simply check this
[54:24.880 --> 54:29.840]  information and if you give me a doctoring cam shot, that'd be awesome. You can see the actual
[54:31.520 --> 54:34.960]  not going to do it. All right. It's all right. You don't need to give it over cam shot.
[54:37.440 --> 54:42.880]  Nobody's going to even aim their camera at my overhead shot. All right. So that works now.
[54:42.880 --> 54:50.720]  Well, I have a letter right here, ladies and gentlemen, that we can't do an overhead shot on
[54:50.720 --> 54:57.040]  when we're not probably going to rebroadcast. Hey, we'll go to rebroadcast. I'll come back later.
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.480]  I'll take your phone calls and I'll address this. But oh, we can do it now. So if you zoom in here,
[55:02.480 --> 55:09.680]  here is the actual letter, ladies and gentlemen, from the Attorney General of New York. And it
[55:09.680 --> 55:14.800]  just says, Hey, the thing on your website isn't big enough saying that you don't claim to treat
[55:14.800 --> 55:20.480]  any diseases. And if you are saying this current stuff, we like you to stop doing that and please
[55:20.480 --> 55:26.800]  contact us. But if you actually go to any of the news, it's a totally other statement that
[55:27.840 --> 55:32.240]  I guess just comes out of somebody's rear end. And again, it's not that info wars is under attack.
[55:33.360 --> 55:36.400]  It's that this type of crap is going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:38.400 --> 55:43.680]  And the fact is people want to go out and find things they think are going to make their lives
[55:43.680 --> 55:49.600]  better. And I as a personal person can tell you, my teeth are great brushing with nano silver.
[55:49.600 --> 55:54.640]  And if I've got a cut and I put the approved that the company we buy it from sells to Walmart.
[55:54.640 --> 55:59.040]  How is the is the only company approved with over the counter stuff that we private label
[55:59.040 --> 56:04.400]  that actually got FDA approved. And it's super strong for topical use do not ingest super silver
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.240]  or the big national brand that's sold in stores. I mean, what do you think we're selling your BS?
[56:10.320 --> 56:16.800]  But putting skin cream on does not protect your lungs. This is for wounds or for a coating.
[56:16.800 --> 56:20.080]  And then it does kill stuff at point blank range. It's all certified for that.
[56:21.120 --> 56:25.840]  And everybody knows that. And so the attempt in the media,
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.360]  the attempt to sit there and act like we're bad, the attempt to say
[56:33.120 --> 56:35.840]  with Mother Jones and media matters, literally, George Sorrell is running and
[56:35.840 --> 56:43.440]  tattling and lying to the attorney general in New York and saying, he says this cures Corona 19.
[56:43.440 --> 56:50.240]  I never said that. And I would never do that. Hell, we can't even keep the tooth paste and the
[56:50.240 --> 56:54.960]  wound shell and the immune gargle that just got back in stock. It's gonna sell out like two days.
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.800]  We can't even keep it in stock. I know for a fact from the factory that makes it
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.800]  that Walmart is buying millions of bottles of it. But oh, no one says a word about Walmart.
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.640]  And by the way, I don't care where you get it from info wars or from Walmart.
[57:13.840 --> 57:20.320]  Walmart can't keep it on the shelves. A gargle with nano silver and other cool stuff in your
[57:20.320 --> 57:27.520]  mouth is good for the teeth, baby. Nobody's denying that. And so again, that's where I'm
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.160]  at here with this. It's just crazy. Everybody heard what I said. Everybody heard what I've done.
[57:32.160 --> 57:37.200]  And I just told you correctional record with the company we use what they said about nano silver,
[57:37.200 --> 57:42.400]  not our products, but the nano silver we use on them. And I'm proud of the products we have.
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.600]  So I did not tell you this protects you from the front of ours and it doesn't.
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.880]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history,
[57:54.880 --> 58:00.640]  the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[58:00.640 --> 58:07.440]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change.
[58:07.440 --> 58:13.840]  And how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system
[58:13.840 --> 58:20.960]  fails. The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores
[58:20.960 --> 58:27.440]  could be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[58:27.440 --> 58:32.880]  you a fighting chance in the next level. And being without puts you at the mercy of others
[58:32.880 --> 58:39.440]  or makes you a slave to a dying system. Buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water
[58:39.440 --> 58:57.840]  filter today. Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from info wars store.com.
[59:09.520 --> 59:15.680]  control your health. Not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning
[59:17.040 --> 59:20.320]  and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today.
[59:20.320 --> 59:24.320]  You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[59:24.320 --> 59:27.920]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[59:27.920 --> 59:31.280]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[59:31.280 --> 59:34.960]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[59:34.960 --> 59:38.880]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay,
[59:38.880 --> 59:41.680]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why
[59:41.680 --> 59:45.120]  you need to go to info wars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[59:45.120 --> 59:49.040]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad
[59:49.040 --> 1:00:09.840]  and the turbo force is good. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:22.240]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:33.120]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:40.000]  edition. I tried to take off about a month ago for the first vacation of a year and I'm not
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.600]  complaining. I just I need a vacation. I need to reset and I was gonna try to take off next week,
[1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:50.000]  but I don't really think I can do it because it'll just like park trucks in here and like turn
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.880]  their horns on the whole time. So I'm staying. That's it. The latest incident with the horns
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:58.320]  honking for like five minutes. I've obviously got to be here. There won't be a broadcast,
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:03.200]  but I'm being sarcastic. I want to take your phone calls now.
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:09.680]  And I sit here and look at this news. I told you I was gonna get into Trump last segment, but
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:19.520]  couldn't do that because hell of them cats here are the mice play. But I'm gonna try my best here
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:25.840]  to take your phone calls. And I've said this because 20 years ago I could do it. I used to like
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:30.480]  be so good at just going to callers and the callers got habituated to just saying one minute
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:35.280]  content and then moving on. And it was so much more interesting. But we have so many great
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:40.400]  callers here. I'll just go to a caller and then they'll talk two minutes and I'll talk five minutes
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:50.800]  and they'll talk a minute and then they'll talk. I'm going to talk to Brian, Josh,
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:02:03.120]  Roque in Afghanistan and Joe next second. And I'll go to Josh and Matt and Cecilia and Cindy
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.640]  and everybody else after that. But I'm going to who called in first and I'm just going to come out
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:12.480]  of break. I'm going to talk 30 seconds and I'm going to go to your phone calls. But
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:19.520]  I got distracted with the truck that just happened to be parked right up against the studio wall
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:23.440]  honking during the break. I'm not complaining. I didn't really get the point somewhere to make
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:33.360]  earlier. It's just so crazy, man, to watch the Democratic Party just say, Hey, the Republicans
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:38.000]  are beating us because they're more corrupt than us. We have to get rid of our morals to defeat
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.640]  them. And that's how they got seduced the last 10 years. Of course, the blue blood Republicans
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:48.720]  were horrible. And Democrats used to oppose them. And I supported some Democrats because they were
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:53.840]  doing good things like being anti war and anti torture and things. But once they went, Oh,
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:59.440]  we've got to be more evil than the bad guy. The end justifies the means they have just turned into
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:11.680]  total criminals. I mean, they will accuse you of something. They will sue you. They will indict
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:16.240]  you. They will lie about you. And they just do it like it doesn't matter. And they say, Hey,
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:22.400]  hey, you're bad. We're doing this to you. Look, because you're a Nazi. You're like, actually,
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:30.240]  you're funded by a Nazi collaborator. And they're like, shut up, racist. And at a certain point,
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:41.840]  you just go, man, you're, you're crazy. You are crazy. And I just can't let you run my life.
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:48.080]  And so whatever you do to me, go ahead. Because I'm not submitting to you. And then they come
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:54.720]  start a fight. And the left, I've seen it, they will hit you. This is so archetypal. This is so
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:04:01.360]  emblematic. It's so illustrative. They will hit you. And if you hit them back, they call the police.
[1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:04.880]  I'll never forget the first time I ran into Antifa. Maybe the second time I ran into Boston
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:10.800]  before that was a 2008 DNC Denver, Colorado. And man, Antifa walked over beside me and
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:16.000]  hit me with her elbow. And I just elbowed him right back. And they went, officer, he just hit me.
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:26.080]  And I looked at this guy. And what I saw was dishonor. Well, that guy was honorable compared
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:30.160]  to him. Now they'll attack women and children first. You watch these videos, they see a little
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:35.680]  kid or old woman or gone on a wheelchair. If you've got a guy on a wheelchair, Antifa is like
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:43.360]  flies on SH-T. I mean, they come in to attack like the normal person would like never attack a woman
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:48.400]  or somebody on a wheelchair. That's who they are, man. And you just got to come to grips with it.
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:54.240]  They are the scum of the earth. Start your engines, your calls in T minus 60 seconds.
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:04.400]  Hey, Steve, how you doing? Hey, Alex. Oh my God. Long time listener, first time caller.
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:09.920]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce. And I was in
[1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:14.720]  there until June. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:20.080]  me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about
[1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:25.040]  five or six years. And the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:28.640]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:32.080]  you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now I wasn't supposed
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:36.160]  to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have it. But I ordered it, had it shipped to
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:42.000]  me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:46.560]  saved my life. If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though, anybody's traveled
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:52.320]  overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:57.040]  It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense is
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:02.800]  over the top good.
[1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:23.360]  You can taste it, you can see it, you can face it, you can hear it, hey, you're getting
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:39.120]  better. You can face it, you can take it, you belong.
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:47.280]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday edition.
[1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:52.960]  President Trump has set to declare a national emergency as we told you it's already in place.
[1:06:54.560 --> 1:07:05.120]  Within two weeks, there will be major cities quarantined and a giant biological warfare drill.
[1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:11.840]  The left is trying to parlay that the patriot president of Brazil has it and the Trump has it.
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:16.160]  The Brazilian president has tested negative. The media is running with the fact that he has it.
[1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:20.880]  They're not talking about quarantining Trump, we're moving him from power. They could release a
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:26.720]  designer bio weapon on the president and said that coronavirus did it. That's something I'll
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:29.520]  cover at the bottom of the hour. I said I get to it earlier, but I got sidetracked.
[1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:36.000]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls here. We've got Rogue and we've got Bruce and we've
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.200]  got Joe and we've got Johnson, Cecilia and Janet and Cindy and Josh and Brian and Julia.
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:48.640]  Brian, in California, thanks for calling on this Friday edition.
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:52.880]  Hello, Alex. Hey, buddy, go ahead.
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:58.240]  Good, I'm taking it you can hear my audio correct.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:02.720]  Yeah, I gotta give each caller about a minute or two, bro. I can't do the test, test, test.
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:07.120]  I hear you good, man. No, okay. Well, let me guess, you can't hear me, right? It's real low audio,
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:11.760]  do you? Yeah, to me, but I can't. Yeah, that's that's that's our biggest problem, the calls.
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:15.120]  They just don't sit in the follow the other. They're not going to stop it. So I'm sorry,
[1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:17.760]  sway this. Anyways, sir, go ahead and make a point.
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:25.360]  All right, I'm gonna let you go about a minute. Okay, basically what I called about was a whole
[1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:31.840]  laundry list of items, but what I'm thinking now, I've been observing the San Francisco situation.
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:39.120]  You know, I started posting my beliefs that we were going to be the first beta city for quarantine,
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:44.640]  and people were laughing and everything, and then up as it's gone on, the laughing people are
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:50.800]  finding out it's going on in their cities now as well. But what I believe, seeing they're releasing
[1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:57.040]  all the kids out of the schools, they're going to want them, they'll come up with, we don't want
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:05.520]  them to get sick. So I'm looking at curfews next up in San Francisco that is. Well, what do you
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:16.560]  think's coming next? Curfews. Um, what, what, um, I believe, you know, we got criminal minds out
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:23.840]  there too. So I, um, I went down to meet my son picking up his girlfriend yesterday. It ends up,
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:29.520]  he didn't show up, so I'm there. And then I was trying to let her know I could come in because
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:35.520]  he lives, I live downtown San Francisco. So she's tripping out. I says, well, I can pick you up for
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:42.800]  the next two weeks. And she doesn't, no one seems to understand that the human reaction is a bigger
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:46.720]  problem to me than the violence. You don't understand what I'm saying. No, you're right.
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:51.280]  You're right. Thank you so much, sir. The panic is the real issue. And it clearly, the system is
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:55.360]  trying to create as much panic as they can. Whether the virus is a big threat or not, this is the
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:59.840]  big global smooth. I totally agree. And, uh, again, I wasn't mad at the caller. We just do like this
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:03.760]  dance. Like, do you hear me? Do you hear me? And it just, it always happens there. And when I call
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:07.760]  in, I have low audio too. They just go, Oh, the audio is great. So whatever, I'm behind the crew.
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:13.840]  Just where it is. It's the callers and me that are wrong. There's great audio. Uh, let's see, uh,
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:18.960]  the next caller, uh, let's see of Rogue. Now they're way over in Afghanistan. So maybe there's
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:25.360]  a reason the audio will be low there. Uh, Rogue in Afghanistan. How am I coming to you? Hi. Hi,
[1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:31.520]  Alex. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. How am I coming to you? Okay. Okay. So real quick. How am I coming
[1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:37.120]  to you? I hear you clear. I hear you. Good. Wonderful. Thank you. Go ahead. Sorry. So real
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:43.920]  quick. I'm a DOD contractor here in Kandahar. So if you go to usajobs.gov, there's a job posting
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:51.280]  called public health advisor, quarantine program with the CDC. It was posted on November 15th,
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:58.960]  2019 until May. And there's multiple positions at 16 different places across the country.
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:06.640]  So I meant to cover that yesterday and I covered it two weeks ago. They were getting ready then.
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:10.880]  They knew what was happening in China back then. And again, that just shows that, well,
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:14.320]  what do you think is a DOD contractor? You're a person that knows these type of things and
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:19.040]  understands how it works. What do you think? This is already pretty planned. They were already
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:25.520]  preparing for this. They knew. Absolutely. And now we know that China was covering it up and
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:29.920]  obviously the Pentagon knew what was going on. What does your gut tell you is going on Rogue?
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:37.760]  This is all part of the globalist, the globalist agenda. That's what I think. And we really need
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:42.320]  to pay attention to this whole new 5G network thing and what are the possible risks towards our
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:48.240]  health? And that's all. What are other contractors in Afghanistan and other people that are out
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:52.000]  there in the real world? What do they think? Well, I'm over here. I'm spreading the word too. You
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.040]  got some guys that believe in what's going on. You got some guys that are just ignorant. They just,
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:06.240]  you know, call a conspiracy BS. So just don't be a sheep. Yeah, I had it printed off yesterday.
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:10.400]  I covered it last week what you're talking about. I had it printed off at my stack yesterday. Tell
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:14.640]  folks again where they go to search that. This is a great call. I really appreciate you, sir.
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:24.000]  USAJobs.gov. USAJobs.gov. And what do they search? Quarantine? Public Health Advisor.
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:29.280]  Public Health Advisor. Yeah, I had the print out yesterday and it said quarantine
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:36.560]  sites all over the U.S. in November. Correct. Yeah, I had that in my stack. We should do a whole,
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:40.800]  I think I went to do a whole segment on that whole thing. Yeah, there it is. Public Health
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:45.040]  Advisor Quarantine Program. And there it is, November 15th. Just like you said, click on that.
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:48.640]  This is an official website for the U.S. government employment.
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:58.640]  $51,440. Correct. $93,000 per year. Workforce schedule full time. And then it shows the
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:05.520]  different sites all over the U.S. Wow, how incredible is that? Amazing. It's crazy. Anyways,
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:12.560]  longtime listener, first-time caller, 10 years. Thank you for what you do and love your products.
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:16.160]  Rogue, thank you. And by the way, I wasn't trying to be a jerk to the last caller the next one.
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:22.640]  I'm pissed that I can't get to college quicker. I want to get to all of you. I want to shut up
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:26.480]  and I want to get to you. But then I've got to like, because I'm slow, I'm like,
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:30.400]  hey, say that again. And then I'm like, wait, wait a minute. I had that a week ago. I barely,
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:35.120]  I get mad at myself. I'm like, why didn't you cause? I'm just trying to tell you why I'm a
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:40.880]  jerk. Okay, folks, because I am a jerk. Okay. It's just that it's not you. I'm just like,
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:46.240]  I'm overloaded, man. And I'm not complaining. I'm just saying it's like, I already knew what he
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:51.680]  was saying was true. And then I'm pissed that he's telling me this and I didn't cover it.
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:58.800]  All right. Because if we've had a huge deal, I'm going to say this, we're going to go to break.
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:02.640]  I said, I'd get to four calls. I got to two. I failed. I'm coming back. I'll go to three calls
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:08.560]  next thing. Or I'm going to hit myself in the face. How about I'm seriously, maybe I put a dog
[1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:12.400]  shock collar on myself. I'm not joking. And if I don't go to the number of callers, I say,
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:17.760]  I'm shocked for real. Plus that'll get the ratings, get folks to tune in and see what's going on.
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:28.400]  But it's manmade. They were pre-positioning. They knew China was covering it up. Trump's not bad
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:34.240]  for doing that. I mean, here's the articles. Trump's declared an actual emergency to speed
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:39.360]  virus response. I haven't plugged the clip yet. And then look, this is our video on banned out
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:43.680]  video. For whatever reason, we can't even find the article. I'm not Matt the crew. It's just
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:51.280]  the way Google blocks stuff. Now we wrote an article on March 2nd saying exclusive female
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:55.360]  declare secret national emergency ahead of coronavirus pandemic. And I said within two weeks,
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:00.000]  Trump will declare an actual emergency. Yeah, there's the video, but we can't find the article.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.720]  And it's not the cruise fault. I Google so blocked now we can't even find our own stuff.
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:08.960]  But look at this. Trump declared an actual emergency just like we told you, but it's not
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:14.480]  like I told you, I talked to people at the White House and I talked to people in the military.
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:19.360]  And then I talked to people that talked to folks separately and they all said, yeah, no, it's on.
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:29.520]  And we think, you know, 3 million dead is what we're preparing for. 3.2 million. It's like...
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.400]  So here we are. This is going to get crazy. I don't know what the hell's about to happen,
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:42.320]  but we're going to take your phone calls one way or another. So just get ready. I'm coming out of
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:48.000]  break. I'm going to your phone calls. The most important thing is to get you on air.

[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:32.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:38.560]  world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:45.920]  that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:51.440]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:56.320]  the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.

[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.480]  Everybody needs food, I'm proud we're selling high quality food. Elections, globalism, the economy,
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:07.600]  the bubble, this is something you need on your checklist to have done, but for me it just is a
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:12.880]  bummer to know that everybody needs food and I had long discussions this morning, over an hour,
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:16.400]  long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this. Right now the folks
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:21.120]  run the plants to get the best idea we have, but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:25.760]  people aren't getting pissed, but understand the last food company, the biggest food company,
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:30.720]  is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having discussions with me about
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:35.040]  stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just saying we're done
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:39.040]  because people aren't going to take food orders out 10 weeks. We don't want to sit on your money
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:42.240]  10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest,
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:46.400]  under promise, over-delivered, but technically it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you to
[1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:50.640]  get a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back again. We want relationships

[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:19.600]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star. When I grow up, I want to defeat Satan.

[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:44.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:50.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:59.360]  If the globalists think defeating me will defeat the human spirit, they're wrong.
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:05.360]  But they're little demons. They can't figure that out. That's why they're demons.
[1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:10.160]  All right, I'm going to take three calls in this segment. I'm going to take four calls
[1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:14.240]  next segment, or I'm going to just walk off the show. My fault. I don't get it done. So we're
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  going to do it right now. Let's go to Cindy in Maryland and Janet. Then we'll go to Josh.
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:23.600]  Let's go to Cindy in Maryland. Cindy, thank you so much for calling on this Friday.
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:28.320]  Alex, I am more excited to talk to you than I would be the president.
[1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:32.240]  Well, I'm excited to talk to you, Cindy. I always like talking to ladies.
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:38.800]  Hey, look, and you know, you're always plugging, you know, the supplements and things like that,
[1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:47.680]  but not your apparel. I bought that Liberty or Death sweatshirt. It is my favorite, favorite shirt.
[1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:51.440]  And right now, it's funny you say that. My wife wears that all the time.
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:55.280]  She's got that liberate. Is that the gray one? Is that the gray one?
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:22:00.320]  Yes. And it is so comfortable. Everybody's like, where did you get that? Where did you get that?
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:07.200]  So I tell them, but you know, people don't believe in God. They haven't looked at the female form.
[1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:10.800]  I mean, just women are amazing. You know, you're an amazing person, Cindy.
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:16.960]  Thank you very much. No, I mean, I'm just saying that God made a really good thing there.
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:21.440]  I, yeah. Well, thank you very much. I think so myself.
[1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:32.720]  But look, I want to know why, you know, we hear that this virus, it started in Fort Dietrich.
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:38.720]  Okay. It started in Fort Dietrich. I have a friend that works there. Oh, tell us about that.
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:44.160]  We know the Obama scumbag, a lot of people be transferred. I totally agree with you.
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:48.080]  They'll take a test virus out of Dietrich and they'll transfer it to university.
[1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:51.920]  We know it came out of North Carolina. That's confirmed. Wow. So tell me what your friend told you.
[1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:57.920]  Well, I mean, she told me exactly what I know. What I told you, it started there.
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:02.240]  Let's see how I say we're going to take three calls today. I call like this. No, no, no. Tell me, like,
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:05.680]  the anthrax attack came before Dietrich. You see, I have a friend that works there.
[1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:12.640]  Just tell us what she said. Well, she told me that it was, it, they were working on it there.
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:21.200]  And then it was transferred. It was out into the, and she couldn't go into details, of course,
[1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:25.040]  because of the security. And she shouldn't have been telling me this to begin with.
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:31.120]  Yes. But it's scary. I mean, because she was like, you know, it was very,
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:39.520]  she said, you know, that when they handled it, you know, she said it was very, very scary because
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:43.600]  that's what she does. She said, I'm sorry. So she was saying it was one of the most
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:48.480]  scary weapons they have. Yeah, it was. It was the worst one they had in there.
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:58.000]  And she said that it just, it was going. Well, I know this. It's super small. It keeps mutating.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:02.480]  It keeps coming back like we reported six weeks ago. That's not confirmed mainstream news is
[1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:09.360]  reporting it. It's basically like HIV. It keeps coming back. You can't get rid of it. How uncool
[1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:15.040]  is that, man? I know. And I was like, how can you? So I was like, Oh, America, you don't like
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.080]  giving your little boys transgender drugs? How about we just kill you, everybody? Like we tried
[1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:25.440]  to just cut your son's balls off. We tried to just let you die quietly. But since you didn't,
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:30.960]  you've chosen the path of pain. Well, all the globalists hiding out in their bunkers,
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:36.800]  they've chosen the path of death. Exactly. By my hand, but I can tell you
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:45.600]  you, the angel of death is coming for them. Yeah. So anyway, I want to know why Obama is at home
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:53.520]  from a highest tree for taking that out of there. We don't wish any harm on the puppet Obama. We
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:59.680]  just want him to tell us who, who can, you know, prison is punishable by death. You know that.
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:04.080]  No, I hear you. I'm just saying Obama is just a puppet, but I hear you. God bless you, Cindy.
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:07.920]  I'm not saying your story is not true.
[1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:11.520]  I'm just telling you that
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:18.880]  if that's true, your friend is to go public for she ends up getting hung from a tree by the globalists.
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:32.000]  Let's go to Josh in Colorado. Then we'll go to other callers. Josh in Colorado. Thanks for holding.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:42.160]  God bless, Alex. Quick point. Obama said in 2014, October 24th, Ebola is a quote unquote trial run
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:47.920]  for a more deadly or airborne disease. And that's, oh, I meant to cover that. That's what
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:53.200]  they, the UN member a year ago, disease X is coming. It's coming. We'll have a worldwide pandemic.
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:57.440]  Give up all your rides and you won't go to work anymore. Drones will deliver all your food and
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:03.840]  robots will grow the food. You'll be in prisons from the viruses. This is the takeover. It's
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:12.160]  happening. Second point. There's a video I found. I sent it to Savannah Hernandez on her Twitter
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:20.720]  message. It shows what's happening when the gain of function happens, the mutation. It's the same
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:26.560]  thing that happened during the Spanish flu. People have their autoimmune rushed to the lungs
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:33.040]  and then they have a massive seizure and there's a video I sent her and I've never seen anywhere.
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:39.840]  It is a bunch of people in the back alley of some Chinese place and there's hundreds of people
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:45.680]  flailing around on the ground. Jesus, I hear you cry. China wants to hit its own people.
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:50.160]  It's a bio attack on their own people, incubating them as a weapon, pure evil.
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:54.000]  Tell me the name of the video. You send us Savannah Hernandez on Twitter,
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:00.800]  private message, but give us the name, brother. We'll find it. It was tweeted by a Twitter name
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:27.040]  waitingfish3204 on February 16th, 944 AM. What's the name of the video? It's just a
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:34.800]  Twitter video. It doesn't have a name. Oh, there it is. Good God. Master and false Jesus.
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:38.720]  Excuse me, Lord. And if you look at it, what some of the doctors that I don't know,
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:42.800]  it's hard to see. You might need to have video editors. It doesn't look like they're wearing
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:49.440]  masks. They're all. Yeah, no, no. I mean, this is it. Look, look, America and the world was coming
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:55.120]  back. They launched this giant attack. And now they don't want to tell you what nano silver
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:00.240]  and cloyal silver does. Folks, the studies don't, don't buy my products. This is not about my products.
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:11.200]  Go look at how nano silver coat cells and how it kills viruses. It gloms on the viruses and stuff
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:17.440]  too, but it gloms on the cells. And it's like the silver's like, no, this sells mine. And let's be
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:23.760]  honest, it's toxic. Let's not lie about that. It's true. They go, Oh, it's dangerous. They,
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:28.000]  well, why do I go to hospitals and all they've got now silver?
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:33.040]  Because that's all they've got. Everything's not working anymore.
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:38.080]  And you use what you've got in a crisis. So I just want to tell the global is everybody's
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:44.000]  trying to take me down. I'm not going to kill you. Mostly you are going to be dead soon. So just

[1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:02.720]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day. It's really
[1:30:02.720 --> 1:30:07.200]  strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive boy and the
[1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:11.520]  coffee adds to it. But wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the Chiapas

[1:30:56.480 --> 1:31:02.800]  at infowarstore.com. Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish. They think the west is dead.
[1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:06.160]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots off internet, you'll just forget about
[1:31:06.160 --> 1:31:10.320]  us. And then they'll be the only information out there. Well, so far, that's not been working too
[1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:15.360]  well for them. Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly, but the resistance to globalism

[1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:04.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:26.960]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:37.200]  And Dr. Francis Boyle, professor, author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law that came to U.N. Long
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:42.000]  has been absolutely on target. It's actually frightening how on target he's been. I don't
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:45.120]  get suspicious he might be behind the attack. It just kind of gets like, how does this guy,
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:49.840]  well, he's an expert, expert of experts. He was gracious enough to join us on short notice.
[1:33:49.840 --> 1:33:54.720]  We'll go back to your calls next hour, but Governor Abbott and we had Gary Haven who met
[1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:59.440]  with the governor an hour before billionaire Gary Haven, philanthropist, patriot. He met with him
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:02.880]  and he said on air the governor is going to declare an emergency next week. Well, it happened
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:09.040]  earlier than that. Trump's about to declare an emergency. The Democrats said you didn't do enough.
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:15.280]  Now they're saying, oh, don't block flights from Europe. They are openly trying to use this as a
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:20.480]  political weapon. It should extinct their party forever. We need a new second party or third
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:25.920]  party in America. We're going to go to him. But here's the governor still speaking. We backed
[1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:31.840]  the DVR up. Here he is like five minutes ago. Here's the governor declaring the Texas governor
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:37.360]  announces martial law powers. And of course, we brought you live the Massachusetts governor.
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:46.160]  Governor Abbott of Texas, let's watch. Last week, DSHS announced that 10 public health labs in Texas
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:53.280]  are now equipped to perform COVID-19 testing throughout the state. DSHS has established a
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:59.040]  website for COVID-19 to share up-to-date information. It'd be helpful if you get that out.
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:18.960]  Well, it is dshs.tesas.gov backslash coronavirus backslash. Again, it is dshs.texas.gov backslash
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:29.840]  coronavirus backslash. Now, the state has also asked health insurers and HMOs operating in Texas
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:37.040]  to waive costs associated with the testing and telemedicine visits concerning coronavirus.
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:47.120]  We have a long list of health insurers that have agreed to comply with that request.
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:35:57.920]  Very importantly, for the uninsured, if an uninsured person needs testing for coronavirus,
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:07.040]  there are two options. One is public health testing or private laboratory testing. For
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:14.000]  public health testing, it requires consultation with local health departments. If the person
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:19.360]  meets public health criteria, then the person is eligible for testing through public health
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:25.200]  testing with no cost to the person. Private testing can also- And again, I have the transcripts
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:30.640]  of what he said. He declared state of disaster over coronavirus as drives through testing to
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:34.320]  start in San Antonio. I believe this virus is already all over the place. I think it's going
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:40.800]  to create a giant panic. Again, let's go ahead and go to Dr. Francis Boyle here, taking time off
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:45.440]  there in his office to speak to us today. I could ask a lot of questions, but what's front and
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:51.360]  center for you as one of the leading experts on this who has predicted exactly what's now unfolded?
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:37:02.240]  Well, Alex, let me say that I fully applaud President Trump for cutting off travel from Europe.
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:09.760]  I think he should have done it sooner, but at least he did it. And I support him. Those European
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:19.680]  leaders are absolute idiots. They have this ideological commitment to the EU and their
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:26.880]  little bitty Schengen agreement. So they kept open borders out over there and allowed this
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:37.120]  to travel all over Europe. Indeed, now Tedros of the WHO has said that now Europe instead of China
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:45.840]  is the epicenter of the coronavirus. So, of course, Trump should have shut it off.
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:52.000]  And I have no criticisms at all. And I do not believe those who criticize President Trump for
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:58.640]  this are acting a good faith. I do believe, however, that President Trump should add
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:06.000]  Britain to the list there. I know he's got good relations with Prime Minister Johnson,
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.880]  but I'm very sorry. We need to protect the American people. They have a very dangerous
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:18.560]  situation there. And Britain, indeed, yesterday, Prime Minister Johnson said a lot of British
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:26.800]  people are going to die. So I regret to say I think that should be cut off. And I'm not anti-European.
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:35.600]  I have citizenship in the EU member state, along with my native born American citizenship,
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:39.360]  and I travel with both an EU and an Irish passport.
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:43.920]  Sure, but the fact is, Europe is like thousands dead in Italy alone. Why is Italy so hard-headed?
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:47.040]  I don't mean to change the subject here, but why is Italy so hard-headed?
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:55.360]  I guess they did not act immediately and effectively to shut it all down as soon as possible.
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:04.320]  South Korea, which is also a democracy, seems to be doing a very good job now in getting this
[1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:13.440]  thing under control. They have massive testing, 10,000-day quarantines, and everything like that.
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:24.080]  So maybe South Korea is turning a page here, I can't say, but in Italy, Germany, France,
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:28.320]  now Britain, I think it's completely... I know you don't like to cover old ground,
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:33.200]  but to me, it's seminal that six weeks ago you were here saying it's man-made, major university
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:38.640]  saying it. Now, if that's big news now, saying it's man-made, the fact that it's mutated,
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:44.720]  the fact that there's reinfections, that's now confirmed. The providence of this,
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:51.120]  what's behind it, to me, that's pivotal. Well, as I said, Alex, right, and you see
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:40:01.360]  the CDC, HHS, NIA, Tony Fauci are all covering this up, that as we went through this before
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:05.840]  in great detail. You were right, when you said three weeks ago, they're screwing up covering
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:11.040]  this up for Fauci. We're not making... Clearly, Trump early on had advisors covering it up,
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:18.960]  his instincts kicked in, he's not doing that now. It appears he's not trusting the advisors he has
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:26.960]  now, but I think he's got to fire all of them, because Azar, Fauci, CDC, Redfield, they're more
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:34.320]  interested in covering their own behinds here, because they were funding this death science
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.800]  research there at the University of North Carolina. And by the way, I just got to say this,
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:43.520]  I don't want to inject myself in here, but I confirm through lawyers that just having you
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:48.720]  and others on, piss them off, so somebody inside the CDC put the word out to try to shut us down.
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.800]  I'm sure you've seen the news. They're everywhere. They're calling for SWAT team raids on us right
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:41:02.240]  now, doctor. That would not surprise me, Alex, as you know, I'm totally centered on the mainstream
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:08.640]  news media, not only here, but in Europe for obvious reasons. Ever since I blew the whistle
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:18.400]  on the Amerithrax coming out of a US biological warfare program, so it's par for the course.
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:22.720]  I think Trump just has to fire all these people. I agree. What does the president do that he's
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:28.480]  definitely listening? What does he do? Well, it looks like he's going to proclaim a national
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:38.320]  emergency later today and inject billions of dollars into helping frontline people combat
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:44.240]  this. That's good. And applaud that. I, you know, with all due respect to the markets,
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:49.760]  we have to take care of the people first and foremost, the American people. And the markets,
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:56.160]  I think, will take care of themselves. So, you know, I know the president's a businessman,
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:04.640]  but right now the priority has to be the American people, get everyone tested and free of charge
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:14.240]  and mass testing, and then if necessary, telling them to, you know, quarantine at home, shutting
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:22.960]  down all schools, churches, public events and try to shut this down as best as can be done. I also
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:34.800]  think given the deliberate stalling and delaying and covering up from these so-called advisors in
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:41.040]  Washington, D.C., state and local governments, I've said this before in our last interview,
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:45.760]  they're just going to have to charge out there on their own, just like... Well, you said that
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:51.600]  just last Wednesday and that's now happening. Stay there. Dr. Francis Boyle is really knocking
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:55.600]  out of the park. Stay with us. We'll cover all this straight ahead in another hour of your
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:01.440]  calls straight ahead. We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:05.520]  and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden. I mean, it's just,
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:08.960]  it's what we're meant to do. It feels good when we do it, but we do sell high-quality,
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:13.280]  swarble food. I told my patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle? I said, I think this is
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:15.920]  going to be really big. And they said, well, we can handle probably this. We're not sure we're
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:19.280]  investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund. I said, no, I think
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:22.480]  this is going to be huge. I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food,
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:25.120]  even though the prices are going up for you. So those are the types of discussions we have.
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:29.360]  And I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of this. This is a hundred times regular
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:33.440]  volume plus. It was a hundred times a few days ago. Now it's about 200 times. Okay,
[1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:37.920]  at infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first served. But the fact that the
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:42.960]  orders are so ultramassive, it's dizzying. I mean, this is just insane. We're expecting to have to
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:48.240]  put six to eight weeks to be safe. And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:52.880]  to suspend food sales. Everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food. But that's how big this
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:57.040]  is. So what you're getting is a hundred percent a straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  It's really smart to get high quality, storeable food at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:07.360]  It's also smart to drink filtered water with Alexa pure system is one of the highest rated out there
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:12.800]  and extremely affordable. And it's just as important to have your immune system boosted during times
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:20.080]  like this. And DNA force plus with PQQ CoQ 10 and so many other amazing ingredients is the base
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:26.000]  foundation for your entire body, your mitochondrial output inside your cells, your telomeres and so
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:34.400]  much more. DNA force is now after four months of being sold out back in the stock 40% off. This is
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:40.720]  our flagship product. I'm so proud of it. And I had run out of it as well. So when I got it last
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:45.600]  week when it came back in, I was so excited. It's now available at infowarstore.com. You're
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:50.480]  getting a wonderful formula and it funds the information war with the important fight that
[1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:54.000]  we're carrying out for not just the American people, but the people of the world. So please
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:45:01.280]  your DNA force plus today at infowarstore.com. We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:06.720]  Humanities waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes,
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:11.440]  how they're building a post human world. But we know they're going to strike back and the UN has
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:17.120]  said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:24.080]  populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:29.920]  in a giant clowered and pivot program. The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:37.520]  us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a critical time
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:43.440]  to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:49.120]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck. So spread the word about band.video
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:56.080]  and info wars.com forward slash show that is so important. You are at the center of the resistance.
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:02.320]  You are our only hope. Rich in Alabama. Rich, thanks for calling. Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it.
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:09.600]  First thing, I love the turbo force. I drive truck for a living and it's amazing. Coffee kind of gives
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:14.560]  you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing. How is turbo force different
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:22.240]  than coffee? I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours. I don't feel the jitters
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:27.680]  like I do drink and coffee and it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go
[1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:34.160]  to bed off, you know, knock out them. I'm out cold. Well, that's what we went out to a top developer
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:39.520]  who did want his name on it and I said, what would the ultimate long, say 10 hour energy be? Is that
[1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:44.240]  possible? That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:48.880]  healthy and natural that are time released and there's more money in it than anybody else puts
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:54.160]  in their product. So that's why turbo force has such a great effect and so I really appreciate you
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:47:03.920]  and I'm glad that you like turbo force. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:21.600]  We're in the middle of history right now. If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:25.840]  you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:32.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle is going to leave us for about 10 minutes and then I'll go back to
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.960]  load the phone lines. But guess what they're now finding in Newsweek and
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:49.200]  the Associated Press. The coronavirus is eating men's testicles. Oh, what a surprise.
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:57.280]  It destroys fertility. So Dr. Boyle, I've got a lot of questions for you. We can talk for 10 days.
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:00.880]  Hopefully you'll join me on the Sunday show or the Monday show, whatever you can do for a full hour
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.920]  or maybe you can host if you'd like Sunday for an hour. That's even better without me interrupting.
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:10.320]  But the way it's a commuter, the way it keeps mutating, I've got articles right here that
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:14.880]  they're saying, oh no, people that are here to, they survived the coronavirus, then they tested
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:22.080]  positive again. You and Mike Adams and the reports six weeks ago were saying this. It has an HIV
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:27.200]  delivery system and then it just keeps coming back like HIV. It's like you beat it and then it goes
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:32.640]  away. There's so many points to cover, so many angles to go with. But the fact that it's man-made,
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:37.760]  who would do this? Where did it come from? And then now they're trying to blame Trump and bring
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:42.080]  down the economy with it. To me, I think this is, it just looks like the biggest salt to take down
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:46.800]  America. I'm going to stop talking for 10 minutes. You've got the floor. You just cover whatever you
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:59.440]  think's most important, Dr. Boyle. Well, again, Alex, as we went through before in detail, the HIV
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:10.480]  is in there. And I already mentioned to you this scientific study where one of the Wuhan BSL4 people
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:19.920]  worked with the Australian government to mate HIV with coronavirus. And then I also think they took
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:31.680]  the UNC Dana Function coronavirus and back there in Wuhan put them both together to create this
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:40.880]  turbocharged biological weapon that then leaked, I believe, accidentally right now. I was about to say,
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:44.480]  if it's man-made, you can prove where it came from. Why the hell would you release it?
[1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:53.600]  I think it was an accident. And the problem is, Alex, that all of these BSL3 and BSL4s leak,
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:58.640]  we know. You've proven that it's on record. Why doesn't Trump just come out and address the nation
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:03.040]  and admit it? The spot marker will go down 10,000 points. Like you said, that doesn't matter.
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:07.920]  Truth matters. He will politically win by that and will mobilize like when Germany was bombing
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:14.080]  Britain. Britain was against World War II until the Nazis attacked. If Trump, like Churchill,
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:19.360]  just says, we're in trouble, it's horrible. Let's fight. That's what we need. Not a bunch of
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:25.680]  cowering. What do you say? I agree with that. I'm happy to speak with President Trump about this
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:33.120]  if he wants to talk with me and the amount and extent of this Nazi biological warfare work
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:41.760]  that has gone on here for quite some time. And that was funded by the National Institutes of Health,
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:46.400]  the Center for Disease Control. And you're right. You said this a month ago, and I'm like,
[1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:48.880]  he needs to burn them all because they're going to set him up.
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:54.000]  Well, I don't know if they're setting him up, but they're certainly covering their
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.920]  own rare ends here. They're all up. Sure. But the globalists in the process blame
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:02.160]  Trump. So I'm just saying it's the right thing to do. Plus they're going to blame him for it.
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:09.280]  Burn them. It's clear he's being blamed for something that was in operation here long before
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:18.720]  President Trump. Indeed, it was the Obama administration that put a pause on this dual
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:26.240]  use DNA genetic research and then lifted the pause. That's right there in that University of North
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:33.120]  Carolina article I mentioned to you. If you look at the at the footnotes and the small print,
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:41.200]  it's all there. So this preceded President Trump. But as I said before, you know, as President
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:47.440]  Truman said, the buck stops here. So he's no, you're right. You were saying three weeks ago,
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:51.120]  if he doesn't take action now, but he is starting to take action.
[1:51:52.720 --> 1:52:01.440]  He is. But again, he's got advisors around him that are trying to restrain him from
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:07.600]  taking, I think, what is even more effective action that's going to be have to be taken at this time.
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:13.360]  Well, listen, I could ask questions a thousand times. We really appreciate you. And I know
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:17.600]  you're busy, man, but I'll be come on Sunday and maybe in hosting hours. There it is. Lab
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:22.560]  made coronavirus fairs debate. That was five years ago. Scientists and said in major publications,
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:29.440]  these scientists, why is this going on? And then now it's here. And we know it does kill a large
[1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:36.640]  number of people. What's scary is the HIV aspect where it reinfects as a top bio weapons lawyer
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:42.640]  that wrote the U.S. law and then the UN adopted. Just in a minute or two, Dr. Bull, could you explain
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.640]  a regular flu virus or something else? You get sick, you defeat it, whatever.
[1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:56.640]  They're in the news, AP LA Times saying, okay, it is coming back. What type of virus comes back?
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:01.040]  Is that not a autoimmune chimera like HIV or what's happening?
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:10.480]  Yes, you know, it's total disinformation to say, well, the flu, it kills more people than this.
[1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:17.280]  That people are saying that are just trying to deceive you. This is clearly a turbocharged
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:23.680]  offensive biological warfare weapon that has never been released before.
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:27.120]  And if you're going to release it, you do it on your own people to be the victims. You don't get
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:34.640]  the blame. Well, as I said, I think, well, this was being stockpiled on both sides by both
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:37.600]  China. Exactly. So it's hard to know who did it.
[1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:45.840]  Well, I think that UNC article makes it quite clear that this goes back to the University
[1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:52.880]  of North Carolina. And you'll note there was a pause on it. And then the Obama administration
[1:53:52.880 --> 1:54:00.960]  lifted the pause. So it's all in that article that we discussed, Alex.
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:06.000]  Now, and I know, Professor, you teach classes. So you'd like phase one, phase two. Well, you
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.800]  missed the previous class, but we have huge, the audience is way bigger than a month ago.
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:16.720]  So I get it, Professor, you teach in phases. And then that makes sense. People should go back
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:20.640]  and watch the previous interviews. We should categorize them as that. But this is just,
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:28.080]  this is just maybe Alex, what you should do is put together the interviews we gave.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:34.320]  I think starting was at Mr. Sharon, but you were out of town at that time. So I gave him.
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:37.840]  No, you're right. We should take interviews from like six weeks ago and just say,
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:43.280]  Professor Boyle's class on coronavirus and just have it all right there.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:47.840]  I would not say class, but you know, I don't wish to sound professor.
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:52.000]  Whatever, whatever you call it, Professor Boyle's analysis.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:59.840]  But I think, yeah, analysis, but I think it would be helpful if you went back to the first half
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:07.200]  hour interview I gave, I think it was Mr. Sherwood or Sherrod. Yeah. Right. And then I gave you,
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:11.600]  that was on a Wednesday. Then I gave you an interview on Friday.
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:15.280]  No, you understand. I've been there for you for almost 20 years. You're a great guy,
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:18.240]  respect you. You're really smart. Everybody knows you're prestigious.
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:25.040]  I hate myself doing this. I hate you being so accurate. Like I wanted you to be wrong.
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:28.640]  I was telling crew like six weeks ago, oh, I think Boyle's, I'll be honest,
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:33.600]  I think Boyle's just worst case scenario. That's what lawyers do. And now I'm just like, no,
[1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:41.280]  Boyle's dead on. I feel sick right now. This is, we're living in 2020 under a bio weapon attack
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:47.200]  and we don't know who the hell launched it. Well, that's why I've tried to appear on your show.
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:55.680]  I think it's important to understand. It's like the Pogo Cartoon. We met the enemy and he is us.
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:02.880]  And that's what's going on here. It came out of that UNC lab with the approval of all the people.
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:09.600]  Exactly. They think they're going to cook this stuff up in labs. It gets out. Everyone's to blame.
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:14.080]  Why did you do it? Why did you build it? It goes back to the atomic bomb. But now...
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:23.440]  Well, I publicly condemn this UNC research as far back as 2015, if you have a look at that.
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:27.440]  No, no, I had you on at the time. That was what's, I've got a good memory still.
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:33.600]  I remember you freaking out about level four labs doing level, you know, all the,
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:38.400]  we're here now. So let me, in the closing minute, Professor, because you've got the crystal ball,
[1:56:38.400 --> 1:56:40.960]  you live this. What's coming next?
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:50.640]  I regret to say it doesn't look good, Alex. Yeah, I regret to say it because of this
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:59.440]  criminally, criminal malpractice advice that all these advisors have been giving to President
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:06.080]  Trump. It domestically, it looks like it might be a little too little too late. I think...
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:15.600]  A dollar day or a day light, dollar short. What has to be done now is, as you just saw Governor Abbott
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:21.920]  do. Hold on. I know you got to go. Do five more minutes back in two minutes. Five more minutes
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:27.840]  with Dr. Boylar. Thank you, sir. Man, I just, I got four kids. Man, I'm so pissed right now.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:32.560]  I can barely do this show. I know you're all... Man, they just canceled my kids' school. They're
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:38.400]  shutting all of Austin down. They're declaring martial law powers right now. It's all happening.
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:43.680]  This is a debate. It's not a joke. It's happening now. We'll be right back.
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:51.920]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long, but man,
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:56.080]  I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him, everybody.
[1:57:56.080 --> 1:58:01.760]  I mean, I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said, about two months
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:06.560]  ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have a warehouse full of hundreds of
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:11.840]  thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment,
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:16.240]  defend the First Amendment, infowars.com. And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular
[1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:20.400]  sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:24.000]  even disrupting things. People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well,
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.160]  we're being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Buchanan, let me just
[1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:33.280]  ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very
[1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:38.880]  element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the
[1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:44.880]  loudest sound of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.

[2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:20.480]  All right, Dr. Boyle, where do you see this going? What President Trump should do? The other
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:24.400]  topics in those last five minutes, we really appreciate you as the author of the U.S.
[2:00:24.400 --> 2:00:29.200]  Biological Weapons Law on what's happening. You called it all the last six weeks.
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:33.040]  You've been dead on. I'm just scared to hear what you're going to say next.
[2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:39.840]  Well, again, trying to be positive about this, I really think we're going to need
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:48.880]  governors and mayors to step up to the plate and just take their own action because it's obvious
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:55.440]  because of the people around President Trump giving advice that it's not properly being done.
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:01.040]  And so I commend, I didn't hear the whole press conference there of Governor Abbott,
[2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:04.560]  but that's what we're going to need all over the country, that governors just...
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:06.080]  He used to declare an emergency.
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:11.440]  Right. That's what we're going to need. Sure. And then act accordingly. And also,
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:18.480]  provide as much free testing, free testing for everyone. I don't think it should be
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:23.600]  limited by insurance plans or anything else. They're doing this now in South Korea. You
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:29.360]  can just drive through a parking lot and get a test. Everyone should have a test to find out
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  exactly what's going on here. And then if it's positive, a media quarantine for at least two
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:43.600]  days. Right. I think Governor Como did the right thing there in calling out the National Guard to
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:49.360]  surround New Rochelle. I'm afraid we're going to be seeing more of this happening. Yes.
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:55.040]  What do you make of Democrats? I don't know if you've seen the clips with your academic life, but
[2:01:55.040 --> 2:02:00.800]  CNN and MSN are like, oh, bring down the economy. It's all Trump's fault. Rooting for the virus.
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:05.600]  It's like they're cartoon characters. To me, I see that I go, these are bad people.
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:08.400]  Like, rooting for bad stuff to happen. It's crazy.
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.480]  Well, again, I'm a political independent. I'm not really here to criticize the Democrats
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:19.600]  and the Republicans or anything like that. No, I understand, but they're like frothing,
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:22.800]  hoping for politics. The Democrats are trying to make political hay out of this.
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:28.800]  You are correct. For everything I've seen, you are correct about that in watching the
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:33.760]  mainstream news. I don't think that is the appropriate way to proceed here.
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:42.160]  We need leadership and both sides to put aside. Exactly. Why don't they get,
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:46.800]  they could be their kids that die. Don't they get that? They need to be like really trying to find
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:53.360]  the truth. You're exactly right. But the same with Republicans too. For example, I read in the
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:02:59.200]  New York Times today this, this new package, the Republicans are saying, well, there has to be
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:05.200]  an anti-abortion provision in the bill. Well, that's already prohibited by the Hyde Amendment. Come
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:10.720]  on. Let's, let's just focus on this particular problem. I agree. Don't make it political because
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:16.720]  they've, they've definitely been doing that. No, we, you know, we can't resolve all the problems
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:24.880]  in the world here. Racism in America, poverty in America, et cetera. We need to focus on
[2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:33.840]  the Corona virus and, and trying to stop it and contain it and get proper medical treatment
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:40.800]  for all American people, poor or rich, because whatever the financial aristocracy believe,
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:46.160]  they're in the same boat with the rest of us. There's not going to run debunkers. Did you see
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:52.640]  literally most of the billionaires have run debunkers? It's not going to help them unless
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:04:01.440]  it's completely sealed off like a, a BSL for lab. That might help. I don't know how long
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:06.320]  they're going to be able to survive in their bunkers because if they're breathing the regular
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:11.680]  air like the rest of us, they're going to get it. Well, Dr. Boyle, thank you so much for the time.
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:15.200]  How are you going to learn more tomorrow? If you can join us on the Sunday show, it'd be great.

[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:09.520]  You know at first I was happy this morning and then I got really scared
[2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:15.280]  because I'm not worried about stuff anymore.
[2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:18.240]  Turn this up for a minute.
[2:06:28.160 --> 2:06:30.240]  I felt sorry for the evil attack in me.
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:35.520]  Just, I mean, I'm like an insane killer.
[2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:46.080]  You know what I mean? Let me tell you, I was a psycho machine and I sit there and I watch
[2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:50.800]  all these people acting tough and I watch them because they run the system and they're tearing
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:56.480]  away the veneer of civilization. They're getting rid of the checks and balances that have protected
[2:06:56.480 --> 2:07:03.200]  them and I just sit back watching them like they really know what they're doing because I'm just a
[2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:09.440]  nice sweetheart, you know? But I know you as an audience who are activists get this. All right,
[2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:14.880]  here's the deal. Mike Adams is popping in at about 30 minutes. I want to get
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:24.080]  to Julian and Anthony and Josh and Janet and Cecilia and Matt and Jim and Bruce and Joe.
[2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:29.760]  I want to go to those calls before Mike Adams. So just don't thank me. I love you so much too.
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:36.160]  Let's just go to each person. Let's go to New York first. Let's go to Janet and see what Janet
[2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:42.080]  has to say. Janet, thank you for calling into the show. Don't thank me. Thank Janet. Janet,
[2:07:42.080 --> 2:07:47.840]  you're on the air. Oh my God, Alex, great to talk to you. Hey, I just have two things I want to say
[2:07:48.720 --> 2:07:53.600]  and I want to get your opinion on and I want to put it in other people's brains. What do you think
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:08:01.280]  about Gavin Newsom's executive order that he passed where he can commandeer private assets?
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:08.480]  And also, why are we not seeing any of these families of these people that died
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:15.360]  doing interviews? If this was a shooting, if this was... No, I agree. It's a giant power grab. The
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:21.360]  whole thing's synthetic. Before the body was dead, before the body was cold. Well, tell us what you
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:26.320]  think. No, I'm the whole thing's synthetic. I'm not saying the virus... In fact, I believe the virus
[2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:33.440]  is a bio weapon that is like AIDS. It comes back later. But this, this is their big introduction.
[2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:38.400]  This is the big globalist move. Everything we were worried about. This is it. What do you think,
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:44.160]  Janet? Oh, I agree with you totally. And yes, people are dying. I can't believe what I see
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:51.680]  coming out of Iran and China. And people are just not waking up. I tell, I am telling people all
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:56.560]  the time. I had three kids. The last one is in college. I have to go get them today because
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:05.360]  they shut down college. They were pretty much my oldest one was conservative, libertarian. The other
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:13.440]  two were pretty liberal. And you know what? I talked to them. I talked to people I know,
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:19.760]  and I get this message out and I say, you have to look at the stories that are not being told.
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:25.280]  Beautiful. And you know what? Our governor is going to be the next one that puts this executive
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:31.680]  order out that he can commandeer private assets. Oh, it's a total power grab. It's total authoritarianism.
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:35.760]  And I don't say this that tough because this will make them come after me, but I'll say this right now.
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:46.320]  This is a synthetic globalist operation. And if the globalist knew that they were going to be held
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:51.040]  accountable for what they've done, they wouldn't do it. And so I've been really nice about this.
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:55.040]  Even two months ago before this happened, I said, I think they're going to launch a bio weapon.
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:04.720]  And if you hurt my family, hold you responsible. And see, it's not some big tough guy thing.
[2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:11.600]  It's killing people. It's like taking a crap. It's so easy. I mean, it really is, folks.
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:17.120]  Like it's like eating food or having sex or taking a dump. And it's like, we're meant to do it.
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:23.040]  Like, you know, these people train guys to kill people. You want to train me to kill people?
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:30.480]  I'll do it all day long. It's so easy. I don't want to do it. But the thing is, you're absolutely
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:36.240]  right. They think they're going to carry this out. And then we aren't going to dig them out of their
[2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:44.160]  holes. No. Anybody I know dies from this manmade virus. I hold the establishment responsible.
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:55.040]  And kill me. Go ahead. I've already won my people who are our people. And I am their people. We're
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:11:01.600]  going to kill you. And so just let them know. Hey, jerks, we know you're behind all this.
[2:11:02.480 --> 2:11:07.920]  And we know what you pulled. And you're not going to rest while you did this. And that's all.
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:12.480]  I mean, I really actually completed my mission. I'm not going to commit suicide and never do it.
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:17.120]  But let me tell you something. I've been working really hard, man. And I just, I want everybody
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:21.840]  to know, like, I want to keep going forever. I'm not scared at all. I'm ready to meet God.
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:27.120]  And I want the globalists to know you're going to die. And you're going to go to hell.
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:29.600]  And we're going to get you. I appreciate your call, Janet.
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:36.480]  We have another guest on right now, don't we?
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:49.680]  Yeah, Mike Adams is coming on. But I just think that's a good statement for people. It's not
[2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:54.560]  like some tough statement, like, I'll kill you. I'm just saying, you kill me, I kill you.
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:00.480]  I mean, that's what this comes down to. Like, people didn't mess with folks. People used to ask,
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:06.640]  like, why are people so polite in Texas? Well, because if you were impolite, somebody would kill you.
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:13.520]  That's really what it comes down to is in the final equation,
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:19.040]  and it's like that Iron Maiden song, The Trooper, that we can go out to break.
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:23.440]  Let's try to queue up The Trooper in a minute if you guys can do it. Let's play a minute of The
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:31.440]  Trooper because you'll fire a musket, but I'll run you through. And when you're waiting for the next
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:39.840]  attack, you better stand because there's no falling back. I'm a soldier. It's like a farmer.
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:47.920]  I'm ready to die, and they don't know how to deal with somebody like that. Like, I'm so ready to die,
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:54.720]  but I want to make sure on the way down, I dig you with me. And they're so scared of that. They
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:13:00.480]  don't know what to do when somebody's ready to die. They don't know what to do. They sit there
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:06.400]  all night long and are scared. And they sit there on their knees to their god, the devil,
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:13.200]  begging for power and begging for Satan to empower them to defeat us. They will not defeat us.
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:21.120]  They will burn in hell. It's like the Twisted Sister song. You're gonna burn it out. You're gonna
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:28.240]  burn it out. You're gonna burn it out. You're gonna burn it out. You're not gonna get victory.
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:32.320]  And all your money and power means nothing when you're a slave.
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:40.000]  All right, it's been all the longest here. Let's go ahead and go to Joe in New Jersey. Joe, thanks
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:46.560]  for holding. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, how you doing? I'm on fire, brother. I'm very close to God right
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:55.600]  now. Man, I saw Indiana postpone the primaries. And I wonder if that's going to be a precursor
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:03.600]  into maybe postponing the election along with their posting pictures of Trump with these leaders who
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:09.600]  are positive or supposedly positive with coronavirus. Oh, they're a hundred percent
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:14.320]  getting ready to say Trump has coronavirus, then kill him and say it killed him. That's it. Or
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:19.120]  the 25th Amendment, which he's disabled and can't run out of the country,
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:28.560]  and then bring Hillary into on a broker convention. The left is cheerleading coronavirus like it's
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:32.720]  their mascot. Like if the Democrats were a football team, coronavirus is their mascot.
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:40.720]  Yeah. I think they're trying to, you know, because they're hyping up the whole Trump
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:45.840]  thing sick or, you know, Trump's thick. They're shutting everything down and and they don't want
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:52.560]  more than 250 or 200 people in one place, one time. So it shuts his rallies down.
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:58.640]  If you could take him out through the 25th Amendment because he's disabled or they say he's
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:03.840]  disabled and they put and they put Pence and no one can see the amount of people that still back
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:10.000]  Pence because you can't congregate with people. No, I totally agree with you. This is their look.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:17.760]  They failed on every front. So they launched a chai-com bio weapon attack. Try to discredit the
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:21.920]  president. I don't think it works. What do you think? No, I don't think it'll work either. I'm
[2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:26.240]  just, you know, they'll pull anything they can out to do whatever they can and nothing's worked
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:31.440]  yet. And there's too much of a backing in this country to let anything like that happen. So what
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:40.240]  happens when the unmovable object meets the invincible force? Well, you get big bangs. You get
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:48.400]  new universes. You get the future. And we're about to see it happen on this planet straight ahead.
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:58.960]  infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:03.840]  an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:08.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:13.360]  a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:18.240]  an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:22.240]  flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:26.800]  had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location. And rather than move it back to the
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:31.600]  warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't
[2:16:31.600 --> 2:16:36.320]  know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:44.400]  system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:51.600]  of bonuses too. And the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even 200. Go to myownpowergrid.com

[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:02.880]  years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:06.800]  and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped

[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:03.760]  going? So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago. I was getting ready. I went to buy a bunch of
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:09.200]  part of the paper and some things before crowds really hit. And I had my phone, I had my show
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:13.440]  going on sticking on my pocket so I could hear it. I wasn't even in headphones. This lady starts
[2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:17.760]  to say, who are you listening to? Who is that talking? I said, this is Alex Jones. And she just
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:23.520]  got her eyes got wide open and she says, really? I thought he was off the air. And I said, no. And
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:27.520]  I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go. She wrote
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:33.040]  down, you know, band.video and also infowars.com and just said, she's still on. I run into people
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:37.520]  at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you.
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:40.720]  I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air? And I'm like, we're on hundreds
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:43.920]  of radio stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations. We have our own streams at
[2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:48.480]  infowars.com and they go, really? They said you were off the air because they took the
[2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:58.480]  platforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform infowars, infowars, infowars.
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:02.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:02.480 --> 2:20:16.720]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:22.880]  I want to go to your calls, but let's do a review right now. The Iron Maiden
[2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:37.120]  and the Trooper. Let's hear a minute of this right now before your phone calls.
[2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:55.120]  You better stand. There's no turning back.
[2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:18.240]  We're going to have only men and those that love liberty go forward.
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:24.720]  All right, let's get into it right now. Your phone calls, almost live Friday edition. I am
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:31.600]  your host Alex Jones and I am exhausted, but I'm here. Notice they said that Brazil's
[2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:38.640]  Balacerno says he's tested negative, but he's really got the virus and Trump's got it.
[2:21:39.280 --> 2:21:44.080]  So they can hit him with a bio weapon or whatever and say, oh, Trump died from coronavirus.
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:49.920]  Who's been holding the longest here? A lot of great callers. I respect you all.
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:58.480]  The longest holding caller is Julian in Kentucky. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:02.720]  Hey, Mr. Jones, God bless you. It's good to talk to you.
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:09.120]  Yeah, I've been listening to you about three years and I support you, but you know,
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:15.840]  I'm worried about the president and it just seems he's he's surrounded by a bunch of fools.
[2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:22.400]  They don't try to protect him at all. And you know, he's got to have this virus by now.
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:31.440]  And I've noticed I don't see a lot of the Democrats with the coronavirus, but you see Gates calling.
[2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:36.560]  Isn't that funny? They exactly it's a cover for a bio weapon. That's what I was thinking three days
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:42.800]  ago. It's a cover for it to hit CPAC. It's a cover. Exactly. They just keep. Yeah.
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:49.360]  And most people that Trump's come in contact with has had this virus,
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:55.920]  but I just find it funny that none of the Democrats have it. And at least if they do,
[2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:01.120]  I've not seen it come out yet. But I support the president. I'm actually worried about him.
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:09.040]  I know he's doing his best. He's 73. And I just don't know what's going to happen with him or
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:15.600]  this country, but this is a spiritual battle. And the battle lines have been drawn. Just better
[2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:23.520]  be on the side of good because God will prevail over this. It's scary, but everyone needs to get
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:31.840]  their heart right with the Lord, but support your president and beautifully said, Julian, God bless
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:39.520]  you. Thank you so much. That's absolutely true. That sums up the whole show today. Anthony in
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:44.320]  Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, how's it going? Thank you for taking my call.
[2:23:44.320 --> 2:23:49.040]  It's a pleasure to take your call, brother. Awesome. Awesome. So I want to continue to
[2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:55.040]  agree with the last few callers about this whole thing with these leaders and celebrities. They
[2:23:55.040 --> 2:24:01.280]  just happen to be the ones getting this coronavirus, but the general public doesn't seem to be picking
[2:24:01.280 --> 2:24:06.720]  it up much like people that I know haven't picked it up around me. It's all these celebrities and
[2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:11.440]  the famous people, right? So I'm a little worried about Trump, like the other callers are saying.
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:15.920]  I think that this is just- That's what the whole office is like a week ago. And then I was like,
[2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:20.720]  God, whatever. Then two days ago, it was like, everybody's like, no, it's an excuse to kill
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:24.160]  Trump and say it's a bio weapon. And that's where the clicking is all they do is like,
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:31.200]  he's got it. He's got it. Take him out. He didn't. He created it. He did it. And Trump's got it.
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:36.320]  Exactly. And I think because of his age, and they say that he eats McDonald's and all that,
[2:24:36.320 --> 2:24:41.200]  they're just going to use it as an excuse to see that he was, you know, not healthy enough to fight
[2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:47.120]  it. Well, I know this. A group collective, the Oracle of the people is saying they're trying to
[2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:54.800]  poison Trump and give him the coronavirus. They're hyping it up massively. So that's where
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:24:59.200]  they're actually saying now. Yesterday, I'm like, well, they blame him for corona and say
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:04.640]  he's got it. Now they're actually saying it. Well, that's crazy. And he's going to speak at
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:08.640]  three o'clock now. So it's going to be interesting to see what he's going to say. That's right.
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:12.960]  Right. The war room starts. We're going to cover that live. God bless you, Anthony. Let's keep
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:21.280]  moving here to these amazing callers. Mike Adams is coming up. Let's go to Celeste or Celisa.
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:29.200]  I can't, I can't read anymore. A beautiful name calling from Cecilia. I don't know Cecilia. They
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:34.880]  got a little hotel in Austin called St. Cecilia. Cecilia from Seattle. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:43.440]  Hi, Alex. I've been listening to the show and I think I had this coronavirus already.
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:48.560]  They said it's been, last week they were saying it's been in Seattle already about six weeks.
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:57.680]  And kind of it was Martin Luther King weekend that I came down with the flu and it was a fast
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:04.880]  onset. And, you know, I was fine that day before and then morning of I didn't feel so great. And by
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:13.360]  the afternoon I was like, I have to go to bed. So it was heavily involved with the lungs. I didn't
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:18.240]  have any sinus stuff. I really didn't have a sore throat, but I was just this constant coughing.
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:23.680]  So I had it about six, seven days. And then someone says, Oh, this is the flu that's been
[2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:29.680]  going around last three weeks. So I was like, hell with that. And so I called the clinic,
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:34.560]  I went into the clinic and they tested and they said, Oh, did you get vaccinated? And I said,
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:40.640]  No. And so they tested me. And I said, Well, is it the strain that you were vaccinating for? And
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:46.000]  they said, No. So I said, Well, what was it? And they said, Oh, well, you know, it's the strain.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:49.120]  I can't remember the exact conversation. I think she said it's the strain.
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:54.320]  Well, they're even saying take the flu shot or the measles shot now, which only in studies,
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:58.640]  I even have the articles here lowers your immunity. So they go, Oh, jack up here immunity,
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:01.200]  because you can only have one virus at a time. Well, that's not true.
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:04.480]  Well, you die is getting a couple of hours at one time.
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:10.560]  Well, I live alone. And so I stopped quarantined and I canceled everything and I didn't go out
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:15.600]  and I called everybody and said, you know, don't come near me, whatever I have, you don't want it.
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:24.720]  But I'm 64. And I would just kind of like to put out that, that, you know, I survived it.
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:30.720]  I did cough for about like, after I recovered for it, I did cough for about two more weeks. So
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:36.480]  there was a lot of lung involvement with this, for sure. And I think if you were older, I did
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:42.560]  notice that when I laid flat, I had to bolster myself with pillows. Because I'm not trying to
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:50.160]  scare you, but have you seen the reports that it comes back? Well, I have not experienced that,
[2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:57.040]  but I, you know, I super cleaned up my diet. I stopped eating any dairy, any sugar,
[2:27:57.840 --> 2:28:04.080]  a lot of vegetables. I do use your, your immune, your iodine and I use your immune gargle. And
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:09.280]  so the kind of the B, I went heavy on the B vitamin D vitamin C.
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:14.320]  That's smart. Cecilia, thank you for holding for an hour. I'm so honored to have you on the show.
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:23.120]  We're going to get to Matt, Jim, Bruce and Josh before there's a takeover by Dr. Nick Baggage.
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:29.680]  But I am going to have Mike Adams, who predicted the shutdown of the US,
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:34.880]  who predicted the checkpoints, who predicted the martial law now being announced on.
[2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:40.560]  You can say what you want about the virus, but the panic is the key and Mike Adams has been on
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:47.440]  target. So is info wars, but Mike Adams has been in flago info wars.com news wars.com

[2:29:53.520 --> 2:30:02.560]  Across the western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics,
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:10.320]  men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events. This is men invading women's
[2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:17.040]  spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away. All in the name of the liberalism and openness
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:23.440]  and that every day I have stacks of news articles just like today. UK team find under house arrest
[2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:30.240]  for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings. UK mother spared jail for
[2:30:30.240 --> 2:30:37.360]  misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety
[2:30:37.360 --> 2:30:44.080]  in the new royalty. That's the thought police. If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason
[2:30:44.080 --> 2:30:50.400]  you get fined and you go to jail. This is tyranny. These people are bullies and it's sick and it's
[2:30:50.400 --> 2:30:55.920]  evil and it's part of a scientific anti human takeover. Resist it. Speak out against it. Hey
[2:30:55.920 --> 2:31:03.040]  Steve, how you doing? Hey Alex. Oh my god. Long time listener. First time caller. Look in January
[2:31:03.040 --> 2:31:08.560]  2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June
[2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:12.720]  and I kept hearing doctor group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me tell you
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:18.720]  something man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:23.440]  and the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day
[2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:26.880]  when I kept hearing you and doctor group and those commercials, I said, you know what? I'm
[2:31:26.880 --> 2:31:30.240]  going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now I wasn't supposed to have any
[2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:34.640]  nutritional stuff. They don't want you to have it. But I ordered it had accepted me. I got it.
[2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:40.480]  I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life.
[2:31:40.480 --> 2:31:45.200]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though. Anybody's traveled overseas.
[2:31:45.200 --> 2:31:50.720]  You absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense. It's true folks.
[2:31:50.720 --> 2:31:55.440]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense is over the top good.
[2:31:56.160 --> 2:32:03.840]  I don't sell firearms but I promote them constantly. Now could somebody listen to me and go out and
[2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:08.320]  buy a gun and use it wrong? Yeah. Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man. I love women.
[2:32:08.320 --> 2:32:12.640]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend. You may have problems with her. You may get a divorce.
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:17.520]  You may whatever. The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful

[2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:28.640]  Jones. Well, we've got a clip for you in a moment. Hillary Clinton says, take that flu shot. It'll
[2:33:28.640 --> 2:33:34.240]  protect you from Corona virus. Even though I've got, in fact, the study was in there yesterday.
[2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:39.440]  Give me that article that if you've taken the flu shot in the last two years, it lowers your
[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:45.680]  immunity to Corona. That was in mainstream news. But Hillary, who loves you, who the hell advises
[2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:52.640]  her, Satan says, take your flu shot. It's simply insane. Mike Adams joins us now. I'm going to
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:58.320]  take your calls into the next hour. Everybody stay right there. But here's a clip of President Trump
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.520]  says he may institute domestic travel ban. The word is it's going to happen tonight or tomorrow.
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:11.120]  All predicted. Well, we didn't predict that we had whiteout sources here a month ago. Here's the
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:18.720]  president travel restrictions within the United States. We haven't discussed that yet. Is it
[2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:23.440]  a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,
[2:34:23.440 --> 2:34:29.120]  you see what they're doing in New Rochelle, which is, which is good, frankly, it's the right thing.
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:35.040]  But then it's not enforced. It's not very strong. But people know they're they're being watched
[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:40.480]  New Rochelle. That's a hotspot. So we're all learning to stay at home, to work from home,
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:46.320]  to have drones watching us flying over us. China, the communist, the model, the southern border
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:53.520]  stays open. But your school shut down. You can't leave your house. The left loves it. Here is a
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:35:00.640]  clip of B roll of the police with drones in Italy. Turn the audio on folks. Let folks hear this.
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:11.520]  So you ever wanted to see martial law, folks? This is it.
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:18.960]  And the left says shut down every city. Don't let you leave your house. But they they actually
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:22.800]  are saying Trump shouldn't stop flights from Europe. The Democrats have introduced bills.
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:28.400]  Judges are filing things to block it. We're going to shut down your city, but your border
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:36.560]  stays wide open. Like a big old, you know what, like Tony Montana says, this town is like a big
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:42.880]  old, you know what, Mike Adams natural news.com has been on target about this. He's been right on
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:47.280]  pace with what's going to be announced schools being shut down over the country. Announcements
[2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:51.680]  of martial law governors announcing martial law powers. Mike Adams, what's coming next?
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:56.080]  Well, thanks for having me on Alex. And yeah, every time I announce something on your show,
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:02.640]  it's often the first time people have heard it and I get attacked. By the way, it's kind of crazy.
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:08.320]  God, I mean, I like you and I've known you for like 15 years, but I'm a little suspicious here.
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:12.880]  And I'm not saying that literally you've been dead on so far. How are you doing that? I know it's
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:16.640]  crazy. Well, it's because I've been running the models, you know, I've got the spreadsheet and
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:21.360]  I've been running the numbers and it's it's very it's quite catastrophic. But there's some good
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:26.880]  news in this. So so one thing is, you know how you look at the election map of who elected Trump,
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:33.200]  you know, so called fly over America and rural America is going to be in great shape relative
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:38.640]  to the cities. The liberal cities will be the death zones. And you're already starting to see that.
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:44.320]  Like 10 commandments, the Pharaoh's curse. Well, I suppose I mean, I'm not a Bible scholar. I don't
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:48.800]  know that whole story. But look, the liberals have set up their cities to be filth ridden,
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:54.240]  lawless, you know, feces in the streets, homeless camps that aren't enforced with any kind of
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:58.880]  standards. And let me tell you something, Alex, there's going to be a wave of new homelessness
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:03.680]  after this thing is done and over with because we're going to have a lockdown. It's coming.
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:09.440]  We're going to have an economic disaster in the short term with a strong, strong recovery on the
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:13.680]  other side of it, by the way, which is why we got to get through this quickly so we can have that
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:18.720]  recovery still this year. That can happen. But there's going to be a lot of new homelessness
[2:37:18.720 --> 2:37:22.640]  over America. Believe you're like the Oracle here. So I love that. Well, tell me about the
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:26.720]  recovery on the other side. I like to hear about that. Well, it's it's very clear. If you study
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:31.440]  the epidemiology, the sooner Trump starts the shutdown, which has really already begun.
[2:37:31.440 --> 2:37:36.640]  And you said he changed trajectory a couple days ago. He did. Trump is now on track to
[2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:40.640]  save his presidency and save America and save millions of lives who would have otherwise
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:45.600]  died. And we got to give the president credit. He's starting to really take aggressive leadership
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.000]  action. We got to give listeners credit for lighting a fire in his ass. Absolutely. Yeah.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:55.600]  I mean, he was on a trajectory that was looking very bad, but he changed that March 11th. So,
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:38:01.920]  so he's on a great trajectory now, just 48 hours later. He is taking charge. He's going to declare
[2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:06.560]  a national emergency. As you and I talked about, I don't know, 10 days ago, he's going to shut down
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:10.880]  travel eventually to certain cities that are the hotspots. And he's openly talking about that now,
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:15.680]  which is exactly what we need to see. But the bottom line, Alex, is the only thing that stops
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:23.360]  this now is social distancing, extreme shutdowns, which are starting to begin. And folks, it's not
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:28.240]  a conspiracy to try to embarrass Trump. This is literally the only medical way to stop this.
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:32.960]  And the sooner we start the shutdowns and just have the school shut and everybody stay home
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:38.400]  for a period of time. Dr. Fauci says it might be seven to eight weeks. Okay, this is why you
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.040]  should have preparedness for 60 days or 90 days or more. I get all that might, but let's let's
[2:38:43.040 --> 2:38:48.640]  drill down because I respect you. You're a smart guy. I really respect you. Why is it so? How deadly
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:53.520]  is it? Like, why are we freaking out like this? I'm not saying you're wrong. Just tell me. Sure.
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:59.760]  No. Well, because if you don't start the shutdowns early, then your hospital systems get overrun
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:04.080]  about six to eight weeks later. Totally brings down the economy. I get it. But how do we know it's
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:11.680]  that deadly? Well, we look around the world, look at Italy. Now, Italy was late and a 5% plus
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:18.880]  mortality rate and their hospitals are in a state of collapse right now. Italy is at risk of literally
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:25.600]  failing as a nation if they do not get a handle on this. So I agree. So, so, so looking at it now
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:29.760]  in hindsight, you first, that was a man made. That's been confirmed. Yes. How bad is it? There's lots
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:33.440]  of different strains. That's what I'm concerned about is the fact that it comes back. Like,
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:39.200]  that's an LA times and AP today that it comes back. It's like HIV. That is this is like airborne
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:43.280]  HIV. It sounds like it's a zombie virus. Basically, yeah, it keeps coming back from the dead. So
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:47.760]  that's why people are so scared that elites are going to bunkers. Well, look, if the death rate
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:53.120]  were only 0.1% like the seasonal flu, then we could all ignore it. We would just accept every
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:58.080]  year we're going to lose 40 50,000 people. That's what happens with the flu. We don't shut down the
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:03.440]  economy for that. It's just an accepted risk of living panic by the establishment is they're
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:09.200]  using it for their advantage, but it's real. Well, it is real. Yes, they the left wants to
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:14.240]  destroy Trump with this, but I want Trump to succeed. I want America to succeed. And I got to
[2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:19.680]  say, Alex, those people out there that have been saying that fear is bad. I strongly disagree.
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:27.040]  You need to have sufficient fear early enough to you have fear for a reason. Well, right. If
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:32.640]  you've got a tiger that's that's about to eat your head off and it's 10 feet away. Oh, you probably
[2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:37.200]  you should have some fear because something's bad is about to happen to you. The question is,
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:44.000]  can you use fear to drive you to action to stop the threat and save lives? So fear itself is a
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:48.800]  survival mechanism. We wouldn't be here without some level of fear. And by the way, our brain
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:53.200]  telling us what's bad, it but yes, they want us to give in to fear. No, we're supposed to take fear
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:58.400]  and become an energized by it. And it's the lack of information from the mainstream media and the
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:03.680]  censorship of the tech giants that has led to nationwide complacency, which will be followed
[2:41:03.680 --> 2:41:10.160]  by panic hoping this brings down America. Yes. And they're so one dimensional. If they were successful,
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:15.360]  Trump won't be blamed. Now they're going to be blamed. You know, Trump is in a real tight spot,
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:20.080]  no matter what he does, he's going to be condemned. But he has made the right choice to block flights
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:25.200]  from Europe. He needs to deploy the military to the US border, believe the left block the border
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:30.320]  said he wasn't doing enough. And when he blocked the flights, they got mad. It's just it's classic.
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:36.720]  This is what we expect. But Trump is in he's pulling himself out of the trap now. The next
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:40.640]  thing that needs to happen is he's got to deploy the military to the southern border,
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:47.040]  block the border, block all illegal traffic today right now. Exactly. Use the crisis to fix the
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:51.600]  real crisis. Well, yeah. And remember, they're going to be infected people from Central and
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:55.600]  South America coming through Mexico. It's a giant criminal inflow of drugs and stuff.
[2:41:55.600 --> 2:42:00.320]  That's the country's energy. So let's just upfront. I mean, he said, I was just saying,
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:03.760]  Oh, stop virus. Let's just say no, we're shut the damn country down.
[2:42:04.720 --> 2:42:07.760]  You're going to have to you're going to have to shut it down. The question is,
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:12.400]  do you do it now and take the hit early where it's smaller? Or do you wait and do nothing
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:17.200]  to where it becomes catastrophic and it ends the Trump presidency? You do it early and it's
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:20.720]  much easier to deal with. And that's that's what's going to come back one more segment.
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:25.840]  But how obvious is it where Democrats say you're not doing enough shut down the airplanes,
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:32.320]  he does it and they say is bad. They are literally a joke. Democrats are demons. They want America
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:36.880]  to fail. We want America to survive and succeed and prosper. And that can happen if we do this
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:43.360]  right. But you're right, Mike. This is a big assault. This is it. Anyway, you look at it.
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:47.280]  This is a big assault and we're ready for it and we're still on air because of you,
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:52.800]  the listeners, I salute you and I thank you listeners. Seriously. Thank you for keeping us on air.

[2:43:26.720 --> 2:43:31.600]  the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:38.720]  thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine,
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:45.840]  atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling

[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:24.480]  I have the Associated Press reporting. Mexico preparing to close border with the U.S. to stop
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:28.560]  coronavirus. How dare they? They're not allowed to have a border.
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:37.040]  There's so much crazy stuff happening. Governor Abbott declares martial law powers.
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:45.200]  Of course, Mike Adams continuing. Let's go back to the beginning. It's man-made. It's being used
[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:52.400]  to attack Trump and America and the economy. You can cover the martial law. We can cover
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:56.800]  the big events. We can cover the death rate. But what about the providence of this? I think to
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:48:01.200]  attack the globalists, just like Trump's done, you pointed it comes from China. They're trying
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:06.480]  to say it comes from America. Well, we know from Francis Boyle, who's been a frequent guest on your
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:12.560]  show that the origins of the engineering of the virus began in America and that thanks to Barack
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:17.440]  Obama, it was allowed to be transferred to China. Now, we also know, by the way, Joe Biden has been
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:24.720]  part of technology transfer to China involving military F-35 jet technology, for example,
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:30.560]  and many other things. Look, the Obamas and the Bidens and the Clintons are treasonous criminals.
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:36.240]  And they have set into motion these weapons systems that are now devastating the entire
[2:48:36.240 --> 2:48:41.920]  planet. Was that by design? It seems so. When Hillary's out there saying, hey, take the flu shot,
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:47.120]  when we know the flu shot increases your mortality, if you get the virus, you know that this is a
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:52.240]  weapon system. They want you to die. They literally want you to die. This is the depopulation kill
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:49:00.000]  switch. So where did it start? Well, it's a lot of bad decisions, a chain reaction of bad decisions
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:05.520]  and corrupt officials and betrayal of our country, which is why Trump has got to beat this. And I've
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:09.680]  got three predictions for you here, Alex, if it's okay to share these three predictions of where
[2:49:09.680 --> 2:49:15.280]  this is going. Trump's about to have a conference in what, 10, 10, 20 minutes, I think, right?
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:20.480]  Just coming up. There's a very good chance that Trump will announce a state of emergency, not 100%,
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:25.760]  but a very strong chance or at least prepare the country for that declaration to happen soon.
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:31.520]  Secondly, Amazon.com, people are relying on Amazon to get all their products right now,
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:36.800]  to get things because they don't want to go out to grocery stores, for example. Amazon.com,
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:41.840]  all of its warehouses are run by human beings with the help of some automation.
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:48.160]  The people are going to have to go home pretty soon. The Amazon.com fulfillment warehouses
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:51.920]  in many regions around the country will be shut down. That's my prediction today.
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:57.200]  The third prediction, members of our Congress will be infected and killed by this virus.
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:02.080]  And that's partly because they're extremely elderly in many cases. Some of them are like
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:06.000]  walking dinosaurs, even on a good day. But the other reason is because
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:09.680]  they're hooked on pharmaceuticals. They're not healthy. They don't use-
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:15.600]  But my- Could this be the cover for other viruses in the same family that are more deadly to release
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:22.000]  a bio weapon? This could be the perfect assassination cover to even kill the president.
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:26.640]  Well, you're absolutely right. In fact, there could be more lethal strains that were already
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.600]  in the freezers, ready to be thawed out and deployed. And you're exactly right. This could
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:37.360]  be a cover story. Oh, all these conservatives just happened to die from the coronavirus
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:42.960]  when it was really something much more vicious. Absolutely. Fortunately, we've got young,
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:47.920]  healthy people like Rand Paul, who I think even if Rand Paul were infected, he could survive it.
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:51.520]  His father is a doctor. He's got good medical knowledge. We need people like Rand Paul.
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:56.560]  We need Trump to survive if he's infected. We don't want anybody to die from this,
[2:50:56.560 --> 2:51:02.640]  even if they're politically on the other side of the aisle, let's say. But the truth is,
[2:51:02.640 --> 2:51:07.520]  we're going to lose members of Congress. You can count on that. And the elections are already
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:13.920]  starting to be thrown into disarray. It's unclear now how we can have elections until we get through
[2:51:13.920 --> 2:51:18.160]  this because of the quarantines. Who's going to go out and vote? And then if you start having
[2:51:18.160 --> 2:51:22.640]  electronic voting systems to replace that, of course, the Democrats will use that as an opportunity
[2:51:22.640 --> 2:51:27.680]  for more voting fraud. So this is how they could steal the election is to say, oh, everybody has
[2:51:27.680 --> 2:51:32.160]  to stay home. Let's let people vote on their iPhones. And then guess what? All the votes are
[2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:38.640]  fraudulent, and all the dead people vote even more than usual in Democrat areas. So Trump has
[2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:44.240]  got to conquer this well before the election day in order to protect the integrity of the elections
[2:51:44.240 --> 2:51:49.280]  and not allow Democrats to steal it, Alex. Mike, there's no doubt now.
[2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:54.800]  Six weeks ago, you predicted they would start locking down US cities. Let's talk about that.
[2:51:55.360 --> 2:52:00.720]  There are canceled schools all over the United States. What do you expect to happen next week,
[2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:06.800]  the week after? When does this peak? We're nowhere close to peaking yet. We're still in the early
[2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:12.320]  stages of this. So the next six to eight weeks, we're probably going to see numbers get a lot worse.
[2:52:13.200 --> 2:52:18.480]  So that's one thing to keep in mind. If you're not ready to survive 90 days in isolation or longer,
[2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:23.040]  as we've talked about before, then you need to take steps. Everybody to get prepared for that.
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:27.440]  You might be isolated for an extended time. The National Guard will be deployed in every region
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:31.200]  that has these outbreaks. It's already happening. I think five more states today.
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:36.400]  Airports will be shut down in certain regions. I expect that soon for Seattle, New York City,
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:40.960]  Boston, Atlanta, Denver, and San Francisco. So those are the cities I'm predicting.
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:44.320]  Airports will be shut down, which basically shuts down all the connection hubs
[2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:49.840]  for most of the major airlines across America. I don't expect a shutdown of private aviation,
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:54.240]  what's called general aviation, private jets. Gary Haven will still be flying around
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:53:01.040]  the country. Thank God. But commercial aviation will not be allowed to proceed in many areas.
[2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:06.480]  Road travel will be allowed to proceed for quite a long time, except in certain areas that get
[2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:11.600]  very, very bad. This is good news. It means that UPS and FedEx and the USPS can continue to deliver
[2:53:12.160 --> 2:53:17.360]  packages. They're very important for even pharmaceutical supply, for local pharmacies,
[2:53:17.360 --> 2:53:22.800]  people who need insulin, for example, or nutraceuticals or food or water filters,
[2:53:22.800 --> 2:53:26.560]  all the things that people need. It looks like those deliveries will continue. However,
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:28.800]  What about the importance that crime is suddenly exploded?
[2:53:29.520 --> 2:53:32.560]  Well, it's going to explode in the liberal cities again. That's where it's going to be the worst.
[2:53:32.560 --> 2:53:36.560]  So this is again, Democrats, yeah, actually, absolutely. That's what it is like Baltimore
[2:53:37.200 --> 2:53:42.560]  and Chicago and LA. It's all exploding. Yes. And, you know, Governor Abbott today declared a state
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:46.800]  of disaster for the state of Texas. He probably implies this, but I wish he would have added,
[2:53:47.360 --> 2:53:52.240]  and all Texans, please shoot looters. That's what he should have added to that declaration.
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:55.760]  Now, I don't know if that attitude is going to be everywhere else in the country, but it should be.
[2:53:55.760 --> 2:54:01.600]  Anybody who goes around looting other people's stuff deserves to be shot. And that will happen
[2:54:01.600 --> 2:54:05.840]  in Texas. So looters will not have a lot of success, especially with the National Guard
[2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:09.280]  on the streets. So anybody who tries to go out and steal from other people, you're going to get
[2:54:09.280 --> 2:54:13.760]  swept up by the guard or you're going to get shot by some Texas rancher very, very quickly.
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:17.680]  So, you know, if you're in the country, you're in much better shape right now. If you're in the
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:23.360]  city, you're in a death zone. And that's a mistake. You might want to get out while you can. If you
[2:54:23.360 --> 2:54:28.480]  can't, you better be prepared to hunker down and survive a zombie wave that's coming. That's the
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:35.520]  truth. Uncensored. Let's talk about Mike Adams, the providence of this virus. I mean, it's man-made,
[2:54:35.520 --> 2:54:39.840]  that's admitted. It shows up right on time. The media tries to blame Trump for it.
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:42.640]  What do we know where it came from and who's behind it?
[2:54:42.640 --> 2:54:48.080]  Well, yeah, again, this was engineered. This is a biological weapon system. No question about it.
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:53.360]  It's got elements of MERS and HIV and SARS-CoV-1 and, you know, many, many other elements in it.
[2:54:53.360 --> 2:54:57.840]  So it was designed. It was engineered as a weapon against humanity. It was given to China.
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:03.280]  China purchased it from U.S. universities. I think Francis Boyle is absolutely correct.
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:09.280]  And then China began tweaking it. Remember, like six weeks ago, I did an interview with you on this.
[2:55:09.280 --> 2:55:14.480]  We thought maybe this virus was version 12 and they were working toward version 20.
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:20.720]  Well, what if they have already version 16 or 18 or 20 in the freezer? Version 12 got released,
[2:55:20.720 --> 2:55:26.000]  but now they're saying, well, gosh, they're going to deploy version 20, which is even more deadly,
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:31.680]  as the bioweapon to kill certain areas like Washington, D.C. Now that they've softened up
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:37.280]  America with this first wave, and China allowing their people to have the infections first,
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:42.320]  means that they have achieved immunity first. And that's right. And then they create the narrative
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:48.480]  that it's China's the victim. They're not bad. And then they have the perfect bioweapon launch
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:53.680]  point. That's how you would do this. Well, exactly. And the fact that they're willing to sacrifice so
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:58.560]  many of their people and then achieve immunity quickly with a draconian lockdown means they
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:03.920]  will now have a mobile military force that is immune to the virus that can literally invade
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:08.800]  and survive California if they choose to do that because their troops won't be affected by the
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:12.880]  virus. They're already immune. So think about, you know, I'm encouraging everybody think about
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:18.480]  these issues and the traders we have with Governor Newsom and Sacramento County deliberately releasing
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:23.600]  high risk patients in California. Seriously, Trump should arrest those people right now,
[2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:28.240]  deploy the military to Sacramento County, shut that thing down in terms of allowing the high
[2:56:28.240 --> 2:56:33.120]  risk patients to be released. Those people there are trying to sabotage America that cannot be
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:37.440]  allowed to happen. It's hard enough to beat this virus when we're doing the right thing.
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:41.680]  They're trying to do the wrong thing on purpose. Oh, they openly wanted the Democrats wrong CNN
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:46.160]  saying let's use it to bring down America. That's their plan. The fact that they say it publicly
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:50.160]  shows the weird bubble they're in where they hate the country so much. They think that's normal.
[2:56:50.160 --> 2:56:55.280]  It's bizarre. Mike Adams from naturalnews.com. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. God bless.
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:58.640]  All right. God bless you, Josh and Jim and Bruce. I'm going to take your call.
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:04.560]  And the Dr. Nick Beggars is going to take over. In times like this, I barely even plug the products
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:09.520]  we have. We have ultimate turmeric formula body. He's great for your immunity. That's on record
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:15.280]  with the turmeric. We have DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10. Really strong formula to
[2:57:15.280 --> 2:57:20.640]  clean out the mitochondria boosts whole body. We have the silver salt products. We have all
[2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:25.120]  the great toothpaste and immune guard will back in stock, but it's going to sell out.
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:33.440]  Watch it. It will be sold out by like Tuesday, I predict. It's crazy. But I just want to keep
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:35.920]  the show on the air. These are great products you already need, but let me tell you.
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:42.640]  I actually wish we weren't selling products this way. It's a very sick feeling right now.
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:49.760]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars,
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:56.160]  it's because we're awake. We're alive. We're passionate and we're not giving up.
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:58:01.120]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:05.760]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:11.760]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have
[2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:16.800]  literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:22.320]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:58:22.320 --> 2:58:26.720]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:34.160]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:41.200]  awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God. And that's
[2:58:41.200 --> 2:58:50.480]  all we ever have to know is that God is in charge. I spend a lot of time reminding the infowars,
[2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:56.400]  family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air. And I spend a lot of time
[2:58:56.400 --> 2:59:01.600]  thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really
[2:59:01.600 --> 2:59:06.080]  changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres. But something I
[2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:11.920]  should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[2:59:12.480 --> 2:59:16.400]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration,
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:21.440]  the water filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there. And
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:28.560]  you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists this hard. So it's not
[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:36.640]  a burden to support infowars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for
[2:59:36.640 --> 2:59:41.280]  justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life
[2:59:41.280 --> 3:00:01.920]  so much better. So visit infostore.com today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:01.920 --> 3:00:13.360]  I am actually super calm right now, and I'm super exhausted. It's just the magnitude of
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:36.320]  everything going on. It's so crazy. It makes my head spin. Josh in Florida, thanks for holding
[3:00:36.320 --> 3:00:40.320]  them, Jim and Bruce. You're on the air ahead of Nick Baggage coming up. What do you think is going
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:48.960]  on? Thank you for this emergency war council on infowars. We now have the left arm of the media
[3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:55.040]  and sports entertainment and the right arm of the scientific military industrial complex. They
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:01:04.160]  have now formed a pincer attack on the West by order of the U.S. and the World Health Organization
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:12.800]  for the Chinese world government model. Our flanks are now under siege, which has not been seen
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:21.920]  since 9-11. China has implemented a scorching burn tactic to route all the internal and
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:32.000]  external threats against them. And this is world government bringing the West to our knees. On
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:39.360]  December 17th, I called in and spoke about the apex of division being reached, and you correctly
[3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:45.040]  said after I brought up that point that there's going to be a foreign power. We have reached
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:54.640]  the penultimate event at the apex. So after the apex, this was the swing, and you called it,
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:00.080]  and we called it together, and I really appreciate you taking phone calls because this is how we
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:03.040]  work out. I remember the discussion. What do we talk about brainstorming together?
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:09.200]  We talked about, I called in and said they have reached the apex of division in this country,
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:12.800]  that they've reached the highest point of where they cannot. I remember your call. You said the
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:18.480]  race war didn't work. Now they're going to do something better. Yep, and they've reached the
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:27.120]  apex. So once you reach the apex, there's only one way down from the summit before you get another
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:34.800]  apex, and this was their move. And you correctly said that be careful of a foreign entity. I was
[3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:41.040]  saying it was going to be the left, and I thought this was going to stay internal. You correctly
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:46.640]  said be careful of a foreign power. And now under the directive of the UN, world government,
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:53.760]  how does every arm win? How does the left hand and the right hand, the military industrial
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:03:00.000]  complex, and the Hollywood media, how do they all win? Instead of making bombs, they get to make
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:07.280]  masks. Instead of rushing a gate, they get to pull this up. And now every leftist has their
[3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:14.960]  shutdown and their event to then hype up the virus exactly. And this is Tom Cruise getting
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:20.560]  ready with, oh, trouble never be elected. You know, he'll be elected when space aliens land,
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:28.480]  and he's just all exactly. So yeah, so they get to hit every agenda gets to be,
[3:03:29.440 --> 3:03:36.240]  everybody gets to have their, every global agenda is able to be hit through this virus.
[3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:43.120]  Instead of assassinating Trump, they could just say it was coronavirus. Once one celebrity or
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:49.120]  politician dies in this country, people are going to go crazy. That's all it's going to take.
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:55.520]  God bless you. Josh next segment, I take Jim and versus calls, then Dr. Nick beggars next over.
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:01.760]  Let's play this clip of the virus guy that wanted to overshadow the president two nights ago, Tom
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:08.080]  Hanks. Here he is. But there's an American presidential potential candidate, not even nominee
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:12.160]  yet. He wants to make America great. Is that what Donald Trump's going to do? Well, here's the problem.
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:17.360]  America's already great. So I don't know what he is talking about. He don't think if he's becomes
[3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:21.440]  a president here, make make it great because the States is already. I think that man will be
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:27.040]  president in the United States right about the time that spaceships come down filled with dinosaurs
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:36.400]  and red cakes. I'm not like Tom. Take it from me. How about that? But oh, now it didn't go the way
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:45.360]  Tom Hanks said. Imagine Tom Hanks when he meets God. God's going to say, hey, son, get out of my
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:51.120]  face. Get in my presence. Two more calls straight ahead. The Dr. Nick Beggars is ready.
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:04:58.400]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically. You want to
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:04.000]  drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually. There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:11.200]  you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar. Your bang for your
[3:05:11.200 --> 3:05:18.640]  buck beer gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit
[3:05:18.640 --> 3:05:23.280]  of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be
[3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:29.200]  slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, we have to make the
[3:05:29.200 --> 3:05:35.600]  effort 110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack,
[3:05:35.600 --> 3:05:40.080]  attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen
[3:05:40.080 --> 3:05:43.680]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[3:05:43.680 --> 3:05:48.400]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for
[3:05:48.400 --> 3:05:53.360]  us, for myself, my family, your family, because we're in this together info or store.com.
[3:05:53.360 --> 3:06:13.920]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. You know, maybe, maybe I'm
[3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:21.040]  wrong, but I was following my gut, my intuition. I don't feel weak right now. I feel like I've
[3:06:21.040 --> 3:06:27.840]  almost completed my mission. I feel so exhausted. The Holy Spirit is just pat me on the head saying
[3:06:27.840 --> 3:06:34.160]  you did a good job, son. I think something really big and bad is about to happen. And I think I may
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:39.760]  be taking out at least off air very soon. And I don't say that to be dramatic. I want to tell you
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:49.440]  all I love you and I appreciate you. But there's a lot of big stuff going down. Maybe that's going
[3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:55.520]  to change. But Trump is set any minute to declare an actual emergency. It was already
[3:06:55.520 --> 3:07:00.960]  cleared three weeks ago. As soon as that's ready to go live, as soon as the president walks up the
[3:07:00.960 --> 3:07:05.920]  podium. In fact, let's just, while I take calls, put Trump up on screen. Just put the feet up on
[3:07:05.920 --> 3:07:13.360]  screen. As soon as he comes out, we'll go to the president. Jim in Colorado, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:20.160]  Well, I got the answer you guys are looking for. And I know probably kind of
[3:07:21.680 --> 3:07:24.800]  be hard for you to understand. Well, that's why we're taking the calls. Let me tell you,
[3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:31.680]  nothing's better than the callers. Go ahead. Your government hates you. They don't like any of us.
[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:37.280]  They, they hate all of us. They hate you. They hate the fact that you exist. They hate the fact
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:45.040]  that you're here. They could do it better. You lost your rights a long, long time ago.
[3:07:45.040 --> 3:07:50.960]  Yeah. It's been the type of folks that think they could run everything better than you. I agree.
[3:07:50.960 --> 3:07:56.720]  That's the attitude of the globalist. But not everybody in government's like that. I mean,
[3:07:56.720 --> 3:07:59.280]  I'm not kissing government's ass. I used to always attack the government because I saw
[3:07:59.280 --> 3:08:03.520]  it as the enemy. It's evil people in control of it. The average person in government actually
[3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:09.040]  is more awake to the general public. That's not for me an ass-kissing ceremony. I think that's
[3:08:09.040 --> 3:08:19.200]  what I really found. Your government is, it's null and void. It lost it. You lost sovereignty
[3:08:19.200 --> 3:08:24.320]  a long time ago back in the 1860s. No, I understand that people can say at the end of the Civil War
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:30.160]  and all that. But it's about will. It's about what's right. That's what really runs contracts.
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:34.720]  Yeah. Well, did you see what happened in Virginia when you, all you guys went there
[3:08:34.720 --> 3:08:38.400]  and you, you stood around with your guns and nothing happened? And you know why the governor
[3:08:38.400 --> 3:08:42.320]  put a fence up against the, the Capitol? Cause he knows the rules of the game.
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:48.880]  Actually, the governor back down, I love that you like, you guys all showed up. You guys all
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:52.800]  stood up. They backed down on their gun grab. What are you talking about, man?
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:57.120]  You didn't stand up for nothing. The fact that that governor announced that he was going to
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:09:02.160]  start killing babies. When you start killing babies, guys listening, he's watching.
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:06.640]  Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Jim, Jim, Jim in Colorado. Listen, brother, I'm not your enemy,
[3:09:06.640 --> 3:09:12.640]  but when we go out and protest against abortion or we file lawsuits against it or we go have a pro-gun
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:19.760]  rally and we, and you say we didn't do nothing. You calling in sound pretty pathetic, telling men
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:23.440]  and women that went and showed up and did something on their own time and money that were
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:29.440]  pieces that we didn't do nothing. That sounds like a load of crap to me, son. It's not a load of crap.
[3:09:29.440 --> 3:09:34.480]  You stood there and you, I'm done listening to you, man. You get up, you fix it then, son.
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:42.400]  That's disgusting. What the hell are you talking about? Hell, I was sleeping and tired. Now I'm
[3:09:42.400 --> 3:09:48.560]  awake. That was the most disgusting thing I've ever heard. He's not pissed at the governor,
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:55.760]  the abortionist. He's not pissed at the whole globalist operation. We that went out there
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:10:03.040]  and protested. We didn't do nothing. People that do something are the problem.
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:12.080]  I've never heard such a demonic voice gibbering in my ear. Go back to Satan. Get behind me, devil.
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:19.280]  Bruce in Ohio, you're on the air. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Can you hear me?
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:23.520]  No, yes, sir. Thanks for calling. Thank you. First time caller, long time
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:29.200]  lister since about 2010. I love your products. I've been using them for four or five years.
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:37.440]  They're all great. My question is in the past couple of years, I think you've had some experts
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:44.560]  on predicting a global economic crisis, at least one in the United States, if not the entire world.
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:47.920]  Well, I predicted they'd use a bio weapon as the cover for total tech government.
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:54.320]  Do you think this virus could have been designed to distract people's consciousness from the
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:11:01.520]  economic crash? Oh, absolutely. It's a global reset cover. I don't think I know and I predicted it.
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:06.320]  This is synthetic. The whole thing's a fraud and a hoax. Doesn't mean it doesn't kill people, but
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:11.760]  the whole stampeding, limping over the edge of the cliff event. This is it. This is the
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:16.320]  new world we're striking back. And I think we get that point out and the fact that it's man-made,
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:20.560]  they've got to back off. We don't. We're screwed. Trump comes out and says, looks like man-made
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:26.640]  Wuhan and he brings up the files with the man-made. He checkmates them all. But Anthony Fauci and all
[3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:29.600]  them, I'm not even saying we're the villains. I'm not sure about them. I don't want to make
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:33.920]  claims that people make without all the proof. But let's just say this, he's getting bad advice
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:40.800]  and Trump's got to fire all barrels at this situation. He points out his man-made game over
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:47.040]  for them. Two more quick points, Alex. Most people in this country, would you agree or not,
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:54.960]  live pay to pay month to month on their income? Yes. What is this going to do to people's credit?
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:02.320]  Don't you think that this morning at 5 a.m. when I got up, I wanted to come on here and talk about
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:08.560]  pay check to pay check. Half the public, roughly, is on that. What happens when they can't go to
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:13.840]  work for a couple months? It will create a social bomb. And you just said it all, brother.
[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:22.560]  Exactly. And last thing, thank you for having me on your show. Dr. Steve Pacinic and Dr. Boyle seem
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:30.480]  to have a difference of opinion on Dr. Anthony Fauci. Do you have anything you can add to that?
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:35.040]  No. I mean, I respect both of them. They're both a lot of important things and that's why we have
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:42.080]  them on. Because we believe, we don't give you a talking point. We just have interesting people
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:45.440]  on to have a discussion so you can see what they have to say and you can make a decision.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:51.920]  I get what Pacinic's doing. He knows it's a foreign weapon to bring down America.
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:57.360]  He can't help himself. He's going to tell everything's okay. And then you've got Boyle,
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:00.560]  who's saying it's a bioweapon and he can't help but he's going to tell you what he thinks. And I
[3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:05.680]  think in that dialectic, you're going to get, because you want both, you want all those perspectives.
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:10.480]  And I, because, you know, notice Google feeds you results that you want. It's like one thing. No,
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:15.200]  no, no. We want outside the boxes. We want to look at all the points. That's why there's all
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:20.400]  these articles going, well, Jones is selling fraudulent silver that cures Corona ever said that.
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:25.040]  But he didn't says don't worry about Corona. Why is he doing that? Because we're not doing that.
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:30.000]  Whether it's quarantines or not, you're going to get this virus and it is man made. And it looks
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.680]  like HIV and it comes back again and again. So let's have a discussion while the iron's hot about
[3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:40.160]  where it came from, who stands to gain from it. Because you start having that discussion.
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:46.160]  These viruses mutate quickly. They're releasing them. They're spraying them. This is a global
[3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:51.280]  stop rate. They don't release a bioweapon that has legs. They release a very quick acting one
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:58.560]  that mutates and is gone. A bunch of dickheads are running around, releasing all this right now.
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:05.760]  It's totally a biotech. America and the world's under biotech. And so let's not be afraid of it.
[3:14:05.760 --> 3:14:13.440]  And let's realize you expose the providence of it game over. Just one button I push. You expose
[3:14:13.440 --> 3:14:19.920]  who did this. You expose this man made. That's the weak spot. It's all over. Anything else for us?
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:28.000]  Last question, Alex. Do you think that the Democrats have been immunized against this
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:36.560]  virus? Why do they not feel or seem afraid of it? Because they know it's overall a hoax. They want
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:41.200]  to use it as a power takeover. All right. I'm out of time. Thank you, Bruce. All right. Dr. Dick
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:46.320]  Beggis takes over. He's been one of the main trailblazers exposing all this. He'll give you his
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:51.040]  take. And I'll agree with some of it, not all of it, because we're not a cult. We're a college of
[3:14:51.040 --> 3:14:56.080]  ideas having real discussions. And I'm going to go take about a 30 minute nap because I'm not
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:15:02.560]  complaining, but I have been through the ringer lately. And there's nothing like the Odin sleep
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:08.480]  to make everything a little nice little 30 minute nap. And I'm going to be okay. And I'm good. But
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:15.360]  I need sleepy time right now. I need sleepy time right now. That nice place I go to when I'm asleep.
[3:15:15.360 --> 3:15:21.280]  Nice 30 minute nap on my couch, my office. And I'll be back today with other stuff and back this
[3:15:21.280 --> 3:15:26.400]  weekend, everything else. But I was sure it was coming up 45 minutes after Dr. Nick Beggis. And
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:30.400]  yeah, we got great products or demonize everywhere. They're trying to shut down. They're making false
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:36.880]  claims in my name about stuff. None of the products we sell your coronavirus. That's a damn lie for
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:42.560]  the media. We've read Homeland Security reports about nano silver killing viruses at point like
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:48.240]  range. But sounds like a good thing. No, you got to get them right up next to it. That's not a good
[3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:55.600]  thing. They don't work in your lungs. Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent

[3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:58.640]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here, and I love Trump all day long, but man,
[3:18:58.640 --> 3:19:02.400]  I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over him,
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:07.760]  everybody, I mean, I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said,
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:12.800]  about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have a warehouse full of
[3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:17.440]  hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats,
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:22.320]  save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowars.com, and it looks like duct tape,
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:25.440]  but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally,
[3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:28.240]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting attention. People say,
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:31.520]  why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're being censored,
[3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:35.680]  you know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennik, let me just ask you what you think,
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:41.440]  because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:47.200]  repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all
[3:19:47.200 --> 3:19:51.280]  silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[3:19:56.400 --> 3:19:59.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:59.120 --> 3:20:21.840]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich.
[3:20:21.840 --> 3:20:31.120]  And welcome back. And it's Friday the 13th. Wow. What a day. What a week.
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:37.920]  You know, last week I was talking about this virus and sort of what's happening and a different
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:45.120]  sort of take on it and a lot of positive response. And I remember last week listening to Alex and
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:51.040]  Mike Adams and listening again, going into this hour. And I want to comment a little bit,
[3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:58.080]  because sometimes, as Alex said, we do disagree. And it's regarding the issue of fear that Mike
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:05.200]  Adams brought up. And I agree that it's an important emotion in terms of the declaration of
[3:21:05.200 --> 3:21:12.480]  human emergency is fear, right? I mean, we jump into that. And we also jump in to the reptilian
[3:21:12.480 --> 3:21:16.240]  brain, the one that does the flight or fight response, which is initial response. You know,
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:21.520]  that's the appropriate one. But in a modern world, it isn't the lion jumping out at us.
[3:21:21.520 --> 3:21:28.400]  It requires a calmness. And the reason it does isn't, you know, philosophical. It's
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:34.240]  actually biological. Because what happens when you're in fear, your immune system gets depressed
[3:21:34.240 --> 3:21:40.240]  number one. So if you stay in a state of fear for a long period of time, you'll depress your immune
[3:21:40.240 --> 3:21:45.920]  system. Long anxiety depresses your immune system makes you more susceptible to illness.
[3:21:45.920 --> 3:21:52.640]  So laying aside the reality or non reality or how the virus started, because we could fight that to
[3:21:52.640 --> 3:21:58.160]  the cows come home. Because last week, I was talking about supply chain interruption and
[3:21:58.160 --> 3:22:03.520]  the impact of that, which is really important, because one of the callers just a few moments
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:09.040]  ago touched on the point of what about all those people that live paycheck paycheck and
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:15.840]  something I've commented on in past programs and recent days is the fact that 58% of Americans
[3:22:15.840 --> 3:22:23.120]  only have 1000 in savings or less than $1000 in savings, which isn't enough to last very long,
[3:22:23.120 --> 3:22:30.160]  you know, as things go. So, you know, talking about about that reality and the fact that so
[3:22:30.160 --> 3:22:34.800]  many live so close to the edge and so many are already over the edge and something Mike said
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:41.280]  that I totally agree with is what happens after? Are we going to have a bigger homelessness issue
[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:47.520]  because of all of the problems? Probably so, you know, look at, you know, what's happening.
[3:22:48.640 --> 3:22:53.440]  If you're watching the video clips right now, you know, it's the storming of the grocery store,
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:59.040]  you know, this kind of thing. This program talked about this long ago, you know,
[3:22:59.040 --> 3:23:05.120]  info wars has provided accurate information, not in a state of panic, but in a state of
[3:23:05.120 --> 3:23:13.280]  awareness that hey, ladies and gentlemen, pay attention. That's what we need to do right now.
[3:23:13.280 --> 3:23:19.440]  And that's initial shock, response, fear, you got to be real, you know, that's real. And then
[3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:24.880]  we got to look at things a little differently. We got to calm ourselves and approach things
[3:23:25.520 --> 3:23:32.480]  a little bit differently. And remember our humanity is quite frankly. And I think it's
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:36.640]  appropriate to say that, you know, today is a lot of happy talk, you know, in terms of what's
[3:23:36.640 --> 3:23:43.920]  going on in the mainstream. And yet the reality of it is settling in in every quarter this weekend,
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:49.760]  it will settle in more because here's what Mike said a couple weeks ago and it's accurate is the
[3:23:49.760 --> 3:23:56.320]  projection on this, you know, we ran our numbers to and go, wow, the short term isn't too scary,
[3:23:56.320 --> 3:24:00.960]  but the long term is pretty devastating. And it doesn't have to be that long,
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:06.240]  something else pointed out this can go a quarter or two, and then flip back around.
[3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:11.760]  What I was looking at at the end of last year wasn't a virus. I was looking at just the economic
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:17.680]  fundamentals, which were bad. They were really, really bad. And I said this last week, you know,
[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:25.520]  I even speculated on that horror show that I saw coming. And this virus gives international
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:31.600]  bankers a lot of cover as they throw another trillion and a half dollars into liquidity to fuel
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:37.280]  an already on fire market. But today you see the big rise in the market happening at the moment.
[3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:41.440]  This is not a long term going to be around, you know,
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:48.320]  it's up 900 points right now as you go into the last hour of the day, half hour of the day.
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:52.160]  And it'll end on a high note and then the news will roll in through the weekend and the
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:56.160]  accounts will come up and Monday will hit and everyone will go, oh my gosh, what do we do?
[3:24:56.720 --> 3:25:01.040]  And here's some things I want to talk about in terms of what's been hit really hard. Oil has
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:06.160]  been hit hard for a lot of reasons. Outside of this, beyond the dampening of demand, the supply
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:12.320]  side was increased dramatically by OPEC failing to reach agreement a few days ago. And they're
[3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:16.560]  scheduled for a meeting on the 18th, an interim meeting where Russia and OPEC and everybody
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:21.600]  meets again. Maybe they'll settle this on the 18th, keep an eye out. That'll be a lot of happy
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:26.720]  talk around that. There'll be a need to have a lot of happy talk because I think this thing still
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:36.240]  has a long way to go as we begin to factor in what I call the emotional X factor. And everyone
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:43.760]  thinks they understand emotion and thinks they understand how it works. And we all can rationalize
[3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:48.000]  all that and intellectualize all that. See, the part of the brain that's doing all that work,
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:53.200]  intellectualize all that is the opposite side of the brain where the action is when the emotion
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:58.720]  starts to crank up. So you can't assess one from the point of view of the other and be very accurate
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:04.240]  about it on either side. So here's what happens in my predictions of the next steps. And they're not,
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:10.640]  they're predictions to ask people to remain calm and start to do some things just proactively,
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:17.200]  just because we should and it returns some power to ourselves. So do some things proactively,
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:22.000]  think about what's going on around you calmly and then make sure you're as prepared as you can be
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:28.320]  and then buckle up for what happens because we're already in motion. Forget about fighting over
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:35.200]  the cause or the situation or who took advantage. They all have a playbook on the shelf. One of
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:40.080]  my friends from, I think it was the Arlington Institute, but the guy I had met years and years
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:45.600]  ago did some work for the Pentagon and he did a book called Out of the Blue. And one of the
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:50.640]  scenarios was the one we're looking at right now. And the government, the Pentagon, the government
[3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:55.040]  has a playbook on the shelf for exactly these scenarios. The playbook is off the shelf and
[3:26:55.040 --> 3:27:02.640]  now it's being engaged. So when people talk about a conspiracy, you can look at it that way. Others
[3:27:02.640 --> 3:27:09.840]  who did planning thought it was just planning, but it's implementation time. And so no one misses
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:16.560]  the opportunities when these opportunities are so big and global. When the bad guy sees opportunity,
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:21.120]  he pounces, you know, and that's one of the things that we are totally aware of and
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:27.120]  Imple Wars has been aware of. So think about what's going on right now. Oil is way down.
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:35.680]  Transportation sector is in the toilet. Mining sector, gold and silver drop precipitously today.
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:43.520]  Why? Because ETFs, exchange-rated funds, margin calls, what's happening right now is
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:50.080]  a whole bunch of implosions by these big funds. And the big implosions are yet to come because
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:56.160]  those are derivatives. And they may be unwinding. We just haven't seen it yet. But keep this in
[3:27:56.160 --> 3:28:03.040]  mind. Derivatives were controlling $200 trillion with a T, trillion dollars in global assets.
[3:28:03.040 --> 3:28:08.640]  And they're all these weird gambling events, you know, that big guys have put together where they
[3:28:08.640 --> 3:28:14.800]  bet one part of the economy against the other. But when they all come falling down and someone
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:23.040]  calls the bet, the game is in bad state and then falls faster. So you might get some happy talk
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:28.720]  and some big infusions of cash because the big guy has a lot to lose. And remember,
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:33.840]  when you're poor and you fall, you only have a little ways to go and you don't go splat. But when
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:38.800]  you're high and mighty, as they say, and you're standing on the Empire State Building and you fall,
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:45.760]  you go splat. And so Americans, we're not going splat, hang in there, don't succumb to fear.
[3:28:45.760 --> 3:28:48.000]  We'll be right back after these three messages.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:59.040]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[3:29:58.720 --> 3:30:04.320]  first time caller. Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital
[3:30:04.320 --> 3:30:08.880]  out here in Boise and I was in there until June. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys
[3:30:08.880 --> 3:30:13.760]  talking about living defense. Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive
[3:30:13.760 --> 3:30:18.880]  problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years. And the doctors, they tried every test.
[3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:23.360]  Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:27.040]  those commercials, I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[3:30:27.040 --> 3:30:30.160]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have this stuff.
[3:30:30.160 --> 3:30:35.760]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man.
[3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:40.640]  That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you
[3:30:40.640 --> 3:30:46.560]  travel though. Anybody who's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles
[3:30:46.560 --> 3:30:51.680]  of that living defense. It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[3:30:51.680 --> 3:30:55.920]  And living defense is over the top good. Hannah Meneve, I'm pronouncing that right.
[3:30:55.920 --> 3:30:59.520]  What do you think is really going on? And thanks for calling. So yes, I was in Costco a couple
[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:03.600]  weeks ago. I was getting ready. I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds
[3:31:03.600 --> 3:31:08.560]  really hit. And I had my phone, I had Michelle going on, sticking on my pocket so I could
[3:31:08.560 --> 3:31:12.480]  hear it. I wasn't even headphones. This lady starts, she says, who are you listening to?
[3:31:12.480 --> 3:31:16.960]  Who is that talking? I said, this is Alex Jones. And she just got her eyes wide open.
[3:31:16.960 --> 3:31:22.320]  And she says, really? I thought he was off the air. And I said, no. And I told her, I explained,
[3:31:22.320 --> 3:31:25.520]  you know, the whole situation and told her where to go. She wrote down, you know,
[3:31:25.520 --> 3:31:31.280]  band.video and also infowords.com and just said she's still on. I run into people at the grocery
[3:31:31.280 --> 3:31:35.360]  store at the mall on the hiking bike trail. And they go, Oh, Alex, I used to love you. I wish
[3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:38.400]  you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air? And I'm like, we're on hundreds of
[3:31:38.400 --> 3:31:42.400]  radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations. We have our own streams at infowords.com
[3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:46.080]  and band.video. And they go, really? They said you were off the air because they took the
[3:31:46.080 --> 3:31:52.880]  deplatforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform info wars, info wars, info wars.
[3:31:54.480 --> 3:31:58.800]  Rich in Alabama. Rich, thanks for calling. Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it. First thing,
[3:31:58.800 --> 3:32:05.520]  I love the turbo force. I drive truck for a living and it's amazing. Coffee kind of gives you a
[3:32:05.520 --> 3:32:10.400]  little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing. How is turbo force different than
[3:32:10.400 --> 3:32:17.920]  coffee? I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours. I don't feel the jitters
[3:32:17.920 --> 3:32:23.200]  like I do drinking coffee. And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to
[3:32:23.200 --> 3:32:29.280]  go to bed. I'll, you know, knock out and I'm out cold. Well, that's what we went out to a top
[3:32:29.280 --> 3:32:34.320]  developer who did want his name on it. And I said, what would the ultimate long, say 10 hour energy
[3:32:34.320 --> 3:32:39.200]  be? Is that possible? That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of
[3:32:39.200 --> 3:32:44.080]  energy that are healthy and natural that are time released. And there's more money in it than anybody
[3:32:44.080 --> 3:32:49.120]  else puts in their product. So that's why turbo force has such a great effect. And so I really
[3:32:49.120 --> 3:32:53.920]  appreciate you. And I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:32:59.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:09.520 --> 3:33:18.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. And now your host,
[3:33:18.720 --> 3:33:27.280]  Nick Baggage. Several decisive new actions we're taking in our very vigilant effort to combat
[3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:36.160]  and ultimately defeat the Corona virus. We've been working very hard on this. We've made
[3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:43.840]  tremendous progress. When you compare what we've done to other areas of the world, it's pretty
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:51.040]  incredible. A lot of that had to do with the early designation and the closing of the borders.
[3:33:52.800 --> 3:34:00.480]  Then as you know, Europe was just designated as the hotspot right now. And we closed that border
[3:34:01.280 --> 3:34:06.960]  a while ago. So that was lucky or through talent or through luck, call it whatever you want.
[3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:12.960]  But through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination,
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:19.440]  we will overcome the threat of the virus. I also announced Wednesday night following the
[3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:25.600]  advice of our medical professionals who are doing a tremendous job. We appreciate it very much that
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:31.920]  we're suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last 14 days
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:37.600]  from entering the United States. Citizens, permanent residents and our families,
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:44.480]  any of the families returning from Europe will be subject to extra screening as well as self
[3:34:44.480 --> 3:34:50.480]  isolation for a period of 14 days. As the World Health Organization confirmed today,
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:58.560]  many of the things that what we said were 100% correct, including our designation
[3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:06.640]  before them of Europe. Like our earlier very aggressive actions with China, this measure
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:14.000]  will save countless lives. I appreciate a number of the folks behind me. A number of the people
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:21.120]  behind me said that that saved a lot of lives at early designation. But it is only the beginning
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:27.280]  of what we're really doing. And now we're in a different phase. We had some very old and obsolete
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:33.040]  rules that we had to live with. It worked under certain circumstances, but not under mass
[3:35:33.040 --> 3:35:37.520]  circumstances. They were there for a long time. They were in place for a long time and we're
[3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:43.280]  breaking them down now. And they're very usable for certain instances, but not for this. To
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:47.760]  unleash the full power of the federal government that this effort today, I am officially declaring
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:56.800]  a national emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to
[3:35:56.800 --> 3:36:06.160]  $50 billion of very importantly, very important and a large amount of money for states and
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:12.720]  territories or localities in our shared fight against this disease. In furtherance of the order
[3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:17.440]  emerging every state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You're going to
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:24.160]  be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:30.160]  world. They're standing right behind me and the side of me. I'm also asking every hospital in this
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:35.920]  country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans
[3:36:35.920 --> 3:36:42.080]  everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:48.400]  very engaged. I just spoke with Governor Cuomo. We had a very good conversation and we're working
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:55.920]  very strongly with many states, including New York. The emergency orders I'm issuing today
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:37:00.400]  will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:07.840]  The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately waive provisions of applicable laws and regulations
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:14.960]  to give doctors, hospital, all hospitals and healthcare providers maximum flexibility to
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:22.480]  respond to the virus and care for patients. This includes the following critical authorities,
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:33.360]  the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that's happened
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:40.560]  in the not so distant past. I tell you what they've done with telehealth is incredible.
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:49.200]  It gives remote doctors visits and hospital check-ins the power to waive certain federal
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:54.240]  license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services in states with the
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:38:00.960]  greatest need. Number two, the ability to waive requirements that critical access hospitals
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:09.120]  limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours. The ability to waive the
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:14.400]  requirements of a three-day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home, big thing.
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:21.440]  The authority to waive rules to hinder hospitals ability to bring additional physicians on board
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:26.800]  or obtain needed office space they can do as they want, they can do what they have to do,
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:34.400]  they know what they have to do, now they don't have any problem getting it done. The authority
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:40.400]  to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:47.600]  itself ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established will remove or eliminate
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:54.560]  every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they're entitled to.
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:39:02.880]  No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever. Ten days ago I brought together CEOs of commercial
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:07.760]  labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on a solution to
[3:39:07.760 --> 3:39:16.640]  dramatically increase the availability of tests. Other countries have called us and worked with us
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:22.880]  and they're doing similar things or will be doing similar things. As a result of that action today
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:28.960]  we're announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:35.920]  capacity to test for the coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test
[3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:43.040]  very safely quickly and conveniently but we don't want people to take a test if we feel
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:49.120]  that they shouldn't be doing it and we don't want everyone running out and taking only if you have
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:56.320]  certain symptoms. Using federal emergency authorities the FDA approved a new test
[3:39:56.320 --> 3:40:01.360]  for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche,
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:08.240]  a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:14.720]  tests will be available early next week. We'll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night.
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:20.720]  I want to thank Roche, great company for their incredible work. I'd also like to thank Thermo
[3:40:20.720 --> 3:40:27.360]  Fisher. The FDA's goal is to hopefully authorize the air application within 24 hours. It'll go
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:35.280]  very quickly. It's going very quickly which will bring additionally 1.4 million tests on board next
[3:40:35.280 --> 3:40:41.840]  week and 5 million within a month. I doubt we'll need anywhere near that. At the same time we've
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:48.800]  been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in the
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:55.040]  critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to
[3:40:55.680 --> 3:41:02.800]  be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car. I want to thank Google.
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:09.040]  Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done
[3:41:10.880 --> 3:41:16.880]  unlike websites of the past to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing
[3:41:16.880 --> 3:41:23.120]  at a nearby convenient location. We have many many locations behind us by the way. We cover the
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:26.640]  this country in large parts of the world by the way. We're not going to be talking about the world
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:34.880]  right now but we cover very very strongly our country stores in virtually every location.
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:42.560]  Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They've made tremendous progress.
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:47.600]  Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:53.520]  have been impacted by this. Again we don't want everybody taking this test. It's totally unnecessary
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:42:04.480]  and this is what it is. And here we are going into the weekend. President Trump's message
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:10.720]  finally we're hearing sort of where this is going under a national emergency.
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:19.360]  I want to say remember as this thing sort of unfolds the emotional experience of being in it
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:26.320]  is going to be much different than thinking about it as we are right now watching. The news unfold
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:32.640]  on this Friday afternoon across the country and across the world. You're listening to

[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:04.800]  Sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy
[3:43:04.800 --> 3:43:09.120]  week. I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the

[3:43:22.720 --> 3:43:26.640]  You know what I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:30.320]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[3:43:30.320 --> 3:43:33.600]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:37.360]  Tate you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:41.520]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought you know what okay I want

[3:43:52.960 --> 3:43:58.160]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish. They think the west is dead. They think if

[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:10.160]  i had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at
[3:46:10.160 --> 3:46:14.480]  different levels of this right now the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have but they
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:19.600]  want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed but understand the last food
[3:46:19.600 --> 3:46:25.120]  company the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having
[3:46:25.120 --> 3:46:29.760]  discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:34.000]  saying we're done because people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:38.080]  your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under

[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:33.520]  jones show and welcome back and you know again on this pretty crazy weekend coming up you know
[3:47:33.520 --> 3:47:39.760]  there's going to be a lot going on declaration of emergency is just taking place by president trump
[3:47:41.760 --> 3:47:45.920]  people seem to be reacting well to that that's good but again i want to remind people the
[3:47:45.920 --> 3:47:52.560]  emotional impact is still not completely here it'll hit us when things start really happening
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:57.440]  that you can't miss that are visually in your in your face and you'll start to see more of that
[3:47:58.640 --> 3:48:03.760]  again you know talking about fear we talked a little bit about that before i talk about it a lot
[3:48:03.760 --> 3:48:11.600]  on this program and my view of that is is stay calm yeah recognize fear is what wakes us up
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:16.160]  so we pay attention but now that we're paying attention let's be deliberate about it what
[3:48:16.160 --> 3:48:22.160]  happens to the brain in fear is you show incoherent brain patterns not those associated with higher
[3:48:22.160 --> 3:48:28.640]  order thinking or those things that are associated with the gifts of the spirit you know actually
[3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:35.360]  your brain activity and fear and god don't mix you know in the same way that's why when the angel
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:41.200]  arrives he always announces fear not you know that's the first words out of the mouth because they
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:46.480]  want your brain in neutral where you can hear still before you jump into the flight or fight
[3:48:46.480 --> 3:48:53.920]  response to vigorously so go there because now we're awake now that we're awake pay attention
[3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:59.920]  to everything that's happening around you and try to stay calm and and do is do what you can you
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:06.800]  know be as prepared as you can this is a great country the united states only by virtue of the
[3:49:06.800 --> 3:49:12.480]  people that here live here and that are here which are in fact i want to remind everyone
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:17.840]  we are the government you know by the people for the people of the people if we remember that and
[3:49:17.840 --> 3:49:25.440]  remember our humanity and all of this americans tend to rise to our best i'm at the worst times in
[3:49:25.440 --> 3:49:31.680]  the world's history we always do this won't be any exception i i don't believe that i think that
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:37.840]  that's just who we are what we are and i hope we rise to that again i hope we demonstrate to
[3:49:37.840 --> 3:49:45.600]  ourselves and the world that we are that people that that light in the world of darkness when we
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:51.200]  can be because i believe that is the answer for that to be that light is the answer and that
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:58.080]  requires us to be courageous and strong at times when others are quaking in fear we don't need to
[3:49:58.080 --> 3:50:05.040]  be those recognize these are scary times for sure we're going to oscillate in and out of that depending
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:11.040]  on where we are and what we're individually experiencing but we are not alone in any of it
[3:50:11.040 --> 3:50:17.760]  and this is a short stop between interviews you know with the maker you know it's like hey
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:23.440]  we're not we're all in this together no one's getting out alive that's the nature of living
[3:50:23.440 --> 3:50:30.160]  and uh humanity in general nothing's changed really in that regard um you know the emergency
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:36.960]  is at our door this time if we lived in Mumbai or Beijing or a lot of third world places in the world
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:41.600]  you know it kind of happened a long time ago and you've been experiencing it every day but it's
[3:50:41.600 --> 3:50:48.160]  happening here and now and so it's in our face and i still say remain calm there's other things
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:53.520]  going on that you want to pay attention to you know there's um things going on in the middle east uh
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:58.560]  things going on in the currency world that people haven't talked much about the brazilian currency
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:05.680]  is down almost 20 percent already ratcheting down before this really got in full gear uh the russian
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:12.240]  ruble dropped eight percent at one point and then bounced back a couple percent in in the same day
[3:51:12.240 --> 3:51:19.760]  you know these are big moves that normally don't happen so i would say there's big powers at play
[3:51:20.400 --> 3:51:26.880]  and there's a lot of things being unhinged right now the australian dollar just tanked you know if
[3:51:26.880 --> 3:51:32.880]  you look at what's going on there and they just fuel their markets with lubrication and cash and
[3:51:32.880 --> 3:51:37.520]  japan just fueled their market lubrication and cash and everybody's running around going oh no
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:43.120]  what do we hold do we hold dollars do we hold yen do we hold gold gold crash silver crashed horribly
[3:51:43.120 --> 3:51:48.640]  this week silver down you know like a big chunk 30 percent totally counterintuitive right when
[3:51:48.640 --> 3:51:54.320]  markets crash metals go up not if they're paper metals which is most of the markets lately if
[3:51:54.320 --> 3:52:01.040]  anybody was paying attention you know it was exchange traded funds ETFs um these are being
[3:52:01.040 --> 3:52:05.840]  unhinged by margin calls people have to cough up money you know they're choking on their debt
[3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:16.480]  and uh here we are folks we are on a really rough ride at the moment this is what's going on that's
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:21.440]  the reality of it and it's going to be bumpy for a while and i agree with mike adams in the last
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:27.680]  hour on the other end of this this will escalate right back out of this because there's a lot of
[3:52:27.680 --> 3:52:33.200]  money parked at the sidelines now let's just see how far it goes i'm not optimistic in the short
[3:52:33.200 --> 3:52:37.520]  run i think we got a couple rough quarters and then we see how it all shakes down and what
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:43.840]  happens to derivatives and hedge funds and the big ones that when they start coming into whatever's
[3:52:43.840 --> 3:52:48.880]  going on right now we'll see the big effect and maybe we haven't seen that completely yet but
[3:52:48.880 --> 3:52:56.320]  don't lose heart because these things pass um yeah things were already there was a giant bubble
[3:52:56.320 --> 3:53:02.400]  everybody knew it everybody was aware of it in the economic circles this gives cover to those
[3:53:02.400 --> 3:53:07.200]  guys don't let them off the hook you know know what know what's behind the economic side of the
[3:53:07.200 --> 3:53:13.520]  equation but let's talk about the future also you know people are working at home people are going
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:19.200]  to school at home people are going to college at home and they're setting up a system to do this on
[3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:25.920]  the internet which in one sense is like hey maybe this changes the economy economies of scale on
[3:53:25.920 --> 3:53:30.480]  and how people function in the future i think it'll have lasting effect i think some companies
[3:53:30.480 --> 3:53:37.840]  will say hey it's cost effective to reduce office space and keep people at home it saves money to
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:42.960]  do it this way uh companies that were unwilling to try it or trying it out of necessity now may
[3:53:42.960 --> 3:53:48.240]  find it works and in the long run this changes the way maybe education gets delivered so more
[3:53:48.240 --> 3:53:54.160]  people can access it for less money less cost because way less costly and the same for employment
[3:53:54.160 --> 3:53:58.640]  maybe they can push more into payroll and less into building if people working out of their homes
[3:53:58.640 --> 3:54:05.040]  and shuffle the deck around this could have huge and will have huge structural changes
[3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:10.400]  in what comes after this after the supply chain interruptions and people sort of reassess what
[3:54:10.400 --> 3:54:16.640]  globalism really looks like because right now everyone's getting a bad taste if you're the
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:23.920]  average guy because globalism is working against you and now if you haven't seen it you certainly
[3:54:23.920 --> 3:54:30.080]  can feel it now as supply chains get interrupted and the sovereignty of food supplies and food
[3:54:30.080 --> 3:54:36.000]  sovereignty for lots of parts of the world are in jeopardy the foundations of independence which is
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:40.480]  about food production and the things that are necessary for a modern society in a modern culture
[3:54:41.120 --> 3:54:45.200]  these are the things that we should all be reassessing right now as we move
[3:54:45.920 --> 3:54:51.760]  into this thing but also knowing that we're going to come out of it so if you're not panicked and you
[3:54:51.760 --> 3:54:58.640]  look around think back to 208 and what happened think back to 1987 if you were around long enough
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:03.360]  to what happened and then what happened on the other side of these things as we come out of it
[3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:08.640]  it may be in this one may dangle for years it could dangle because of what has happened in
[3:55:08.640 --> 3:55:13.680]  an eruption and who survives because people are going to get hurt people already hurt and there
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:19.600]  and that's the side of this that needs to be addressed because ultimately most Americans
[3:55:19.600 --> 3:55:25.840]  and most people in the world are one edge away from you know a paycheck away from being on the
[3:55:25.840 --> 3:55:33.920]  street you know I initiated here in Alaska with a friend of mine David David Cutty an initiative
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:43.600]  intervention2020.com check it out intervention2020.com and it's related to the homelessness issue which
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:48.400]  I've covered on this broadcast and I agree with Mike Adams after this is over we may see a huge
[3:55:48.400 --> 3:55:55.440]  surge in that here in Alaska a lot of it is petty criminality and that's what we're kind of addressing
[3:55:55.440 --> 3:56:01.520]  with this initiative that we started a while back but you know the the issue of homelessness on the
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:08.480]  west coast and you want to talk about this virus in the context of homelessness and this when these
[3:56:08.480 --> 3:56:16.480]  two meet you're going to see an explosion that is very difficult to contain of people that whose
[3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:22.640]  immune systems are already compromised by drug addiction alcoholism and some of the problems
[3:56:22.640 --> 3:56:30.320]  that face homeless populations as it is and so when you see all of this now in motion it's going to
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:38.640]  be a lot more extreme what happens so intervention.com intervention2020.com we set up to begin to talk
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:44.320]  about at least a local solution because this is something that isn't going away we're going to see
[3:56:44.320 --> 3:56:52.400]  more of this we have a lot of suffering in the country already we have more coming unfortunately
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:57:00.000]  and despite the happy talk the emotional component of this will set in stay as calm as you can yes
[3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:07.280]  accept the the fear that comes along the way and let it move us to action but not don't let us take
[3:57:07.280 --> 3:57:15.120]  us anywhere let us take ourselves let us be that tip of the spear let us be the light at the end
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:21.760]  of the tunnel and let the tunnel be a bright one because this is America after all we're not beaten
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:28.320]  down yet we're humanity we are the human race we are created in the image and likeness of God to do
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:36.080]  something on this planet now in this dark hour rise into what you are as a human being be that person

[4:00:27.120 --> 4:00:34.000]  edition i tried to take off about a month ago for the first vacation in a year and i'm not
[4:00:34.000 --> 4:00:39.920]  complaining i just i need a vacation to reset and i was gonna try to take off next week but i don't
[4:00:39.920 --> 4:00:44.560]  really think i can do it because it'll just like park trucks in here and like turn their horns on
[4:00:44.560 --> 4:00:50.000]  the whole time so i'm staying that's it the latest incident with the horns honking for like five
[4:00:50.000 --> 4:00:55.760]  minutes i've obviously got to be here there won't be a broadcast but i'm being sarcastic um i want
[4:00:55.760 --> 4:01:02.560]  to take your phone calls now and i sit here and look at this news i told you i was gonna get into
[4:01:02.560 --> 4:01:10.960]  trump last segment but couldn't do that because hell of them cats here are the mice play uh but
[4:01:12.400 --> 4:01:18.800]  i'm gonna try my best here to take your phone calls and i've said this because 20 years ago i
[4:01:18.800 --> 4:01:23.280]  could do it i used to like be so good at just going to callers and the callers got habituated
[4:01:23.280 --> 4:01:28.400]  to just saying one minute content and then moving on and it was so much more interesting
[4:01:28.400 --> 4:01:33.360]  but we have so many great callers here i'll just go to a caller and then they'll talk two minutes
[4:01:33.360 --> 4:01:38.560]  and i'll talk five minutes and they'll talk a minute and then they'll talk i'm going to talk
[4:01:40.640 --> 4:01:44.880]  to brian josh
[4:01:44.880 --> 4:01:57.200]  rokey in afghanistan and joe next second no i'm gonna josh and matt and cecilia and cindy and
[4:01:57.200 --> 4:02:00.720]  everybody else after that but i'm going to who called in first and i'm just gonna come out of
[4:02:00.720 --> 4:02:06.480]  break i'm gonna talk 30 seconds and i'm gonna go to your phone calls but
[4:02:10.160 --> 4:02:13.520]  i got distracted with the truck that just happened to be parked right up against the studio wall
[4:02:13.520 --> 4:02:17.440]  honking during the break i'm not complaining i didn't really get the point somewhere to make
[4:02:17.440 --> 4:02:27.360]  earlier it's just so crazy man to watch the democratic party just say hey the republicans
[4:02:27.360 --> 4:02:32.240]  are beating us because they're more corrupt than us we have to get rid of our morals to defeat them
[4:02:32.240 --> 4:02:37.200]  and that's how they got seduced the last 10 years of course the blue blood republicans were horrible
[4:02:38.240 --> 4:02:43.200]  and democrats used to oppose them and i supported some democrats because they were doing good
[4:02:43.200 --> 4:02:48.960]  things like being anti-war and anti-torture and things but once they went oh we've got to be more
[4:02:48.960 --> 4:02:53.520]  evil than the bad guy the end justifies the means they have just turned into
[4:02:59.680 --> 4:03:05.680]  total criminals i mean they will accuse you of something they will sue you they will indict
[4:03:05.680 --> 4:03:10.240]  you they will lie about you and they just do it like it doesn't matter and they say hey
[4:03:10.240 --> 4:03:16.400]  hey you're bad we're doing this to you look because you're a nazi you're like actually
[4:03:16.400 --> 4:03:24.240]  you're funded by a nazi collaborator and they're like shut up raise this and at a certain point
[4:03:24.240 --> 4:03:35.840]  you just go man you're you're crazy you are crazy and i just can't let you run my life
[4:03:35.840 --> 4:03:42.080]  and so whatever you do to me go ahead because i'm not submitting to you and then they come
[4:03:42.080 --> 4:03:48.720]  start a fight and the left i've seen it they will hit you this is so archetypal this is so
[4:03:48.720 --> 4:03:55.280]  emblematic it's so illustrative they will hit you and if you hit them back they call the police
[4:03:55.280 --> 4:03:59.040]  i'll never forget the first time i ran into antifa maybe the second time i ran into boss before
[4:03:59.040 --> 4:04:05.440]  that was a 2008 dnc denver colorada and man antifa walked over beside me and hit me with her
[4:04:05.440 --> 4:04:13.360]  elbow and i just elbowed him right back and they went officer he just hit me and i looked at this guy
[4:04:16.080 --> 4:04:21.520]  and what i saw was dishonor well that guy was honorable compared to him now they'll attack
[4:04:21.520 --> 4:04:25.360]  women and children first you watch these videos they see a little kid or old woman or gone a
[4:04:25.360 --> 4:04:32.880]  wheelchair if you're not a guy on a wheelchair antifa is like flies on s h dash t i mean they come
[4:04:32.880 --> 4:04:38.720]  in to attack like the normal person would like never attack a woman or somebody in a wheelchair
[4:04:38.720 --> 4:04:44.720]  that's who they are man and you just got to come to grips with it they are the scum of the earth

[4:08:20.080 --> 4:08:27.360]  items but what i'm thinking now um i've been um observing the san francisco situation um you
[4:08:27.360 --> 4:08:34.320]  know i started posting um my beliefs that we were going to be the first beta city for quarantine
[4:08:34.320 --> 4:08:39.760]  and people were laughing and everything and um stands up as it's going on the laughing people
[4:08:39.760 --> 4:08:45.360]  are finding out it's going on in their cities now as well but what i believe um seeing they're
[4:08:45.360 --> 4:08:52.160]  releasing all the kids out of the schools they're gonna want them don't come up with we don't want
[4:08:52.160 --> 4:08:56.880]  them to get sick so i'm looking at curfew next up in san francisco that is
[4:08:56.880 --> 4:09:03.200]  well what do you think's coming next curfews
[4:09:05.680 --> 4:09:15.280]  um what what um i believe you know we got criminal lines out there too so i um i went down to
[4:09:15.280 --> 4:09:20.000]  meet my son picking up his girlfriend yesterday it ends up he didn't show up so i'm there
[4:09:20.960 --> 4:09:25.920]  and there's time to let her know i could come in because she lives i live downtown san francisco
[4:09:25.920 --> 4:09:32.000]  so she's tripping on it i says why don't you pick you up for the next two weeks and she doesn't
[4:09:32.000 --> 4:09:37.680]  no one seems to understand that the human reaction is a bigger problem to me than the
[4:09:37.680 --> 4:09:42.080]  violence you know understand what i'm saying no you're right you're right thank you so much sir
[4:09:42.080 --> 4:09:46.800]  the panic is the real issue and it clearly the system is trying to create as much panic as they

[4:33:49.280 --> 4:33:54.240]  hour before billionaire gary haven and philanthropist patriot he met with him and he sat on air the
[4:33:54.240 --> 4:33:58.640]  governor's going to declare an emergency next week well it happened earlier than that uh
[4:33:58.640 --> 4:34:03.360]  trumps about to declare an emergency uh the democrats said you didn't do enough now they're
[4:34:03.360 --> 4:34:09.680]  saying oh don't block flights from europe they are openly trying to use this as a as a political
[4:34:09.680 --> 4:34:15.360]  weapon it should extinct their party forever and we need a new second party or third party in america
[4:34:16.000 --> 4:34:20.720]  this is we're gonna go to him but but here's the governor still speaking we backed the dvr
[4:34:20.720 --> 4:34:25.840]  up here he is like five minutes ago here's here's the governor declaring marshall the texas governor
[4:34:25.840 --> 4:34:30.080]  announces martial law powers for the state of emergency and of course we brought you live
[4:34:30.080 --> 4:34:36.240]  the massachusetts governor governor abbott of texas let's watch last week dshs announced that
[4:34:36.240 --> 4:34:43.840]  that ten public health labs in texas are now equipped to perform covet 19 testing throughout
[4:34:43.840 --> 4:34:52.000]  the state dshs has established a website for covet 19 to share up-to-date information it'd be
[4:34:52.000 --> 4:35:07.280]  helpful if you get that out it is dshs dot texas dot gov backslash coronavirus backslash again it
[4:35:07.280 --> 4:35:21.920]  is dshs dot texas dot gov backslash coronavirus backslash now the state is also as health insurers
[4:35:21.920 --> 4:35:29.680]  and hmo's operating in texas to aid costs associated with the testing and telemedicine visits
[4:35:29.680 --> 4:35:40.400]  concerning coronavirus we have a long list of health insurers that have agreed to comply with
[4:35:40.400 --> 4:35:52.000]  that request very importantly for the uninsured if an uninsured person needs testing for coronavirus
[4:35:52.000 --> 4:36:00.320]  there are two options one is a public health public health testing or private laboratory
[4:36:00.320 --> 4:36:07.200]  testing for public health testing it requires consultation with local health departments
[4:36:07.920 --> 4:36:13.440]  if the person meets public health criteria then the person is eligible for testing through
[4:36:13.440 --> 4:36:19.200]  public health testing with no cost to the person private testing can also and again i have the
[4:36:19.200 --> 4:36:24.240]  transcript of what he said he declared state of disaster over coronavirus says drives through
[4:36:24.240 --> 4:36:28.320]  testing to start in san antonio i believe this virus is already all over the place i think it's
[4:36:28.320 --> 4:36:34.880]  going to create a giant panic again let's go ahead and go to dr francis boil here taking time off
[4:36:34.880 --> 4:36:39.520]  there in his office to speak to us today i can ask a lot of questions but what's what's front and
[4:36:39.520 --> 4:36:44.800]  center for you is that as one of the leading experts on this who has predicted exactly what's
[4:36:44.800 --> 4:36:54.480]  now unfolding well alex uh let me say that uh i fully applaud president trump for cutting
[4:36:54.480 --> 4:37:01.760]  off travel from europe i think he should have done a sooner but at least he did uh and i support him
[4:37:02.400 --> 4:37:12.080]  those european leaders are absolute idiots uh they have this ideological commitment uh
[4:37:12.080 --> 4:37:20.080]  to the eu and their little bitty shengen agreement so they kept open borders out over there uh and
[4:37:20.080 --> 4:37:29.840]  allowed this uh to travel all over europe indeed now uh tedros of the who has said that now europe
[4:37:29.840 --> 4:37:38.400]  instead of china is the epicenter of the corona virus so of course uh trump should have uh
[4:37:38.400 --> 4:37:45.600]  uh shut it off and uh i have no criticisms at all and i do not believe those who criticize
[4:37:45.600 --> 4:37:52.960]  president trump for this are acting a good faith i do believe however that uh president trump should
[4:37:52.960 --> 4:38:00.640]  add uh britain to the list there i know he's uh got good relations with uh prime minister johnson
[4:38:00.640 --> 4:38:08.160]  but i'm very sorry uh we need to protect the american people they have a very dangerous situation
[4:38:08.160 --> 4:38:13.280]  there in britain indeed yesterday prime minister johnson said a lot of british people are going to
[4:38:13.280 --> 4:38:23.040]  die so i regret to say i i think that should be cut off and i'm not anti european uh i uh have
[4:38:23.040 --> 4:38:30.480]  citizenship in the eu uh member state along with my native born american citizenship and i travel
[4:38:30.480 --> 4:38:36.640]  with both an eu um and an irish past sure but the fact is europe is like thousands dead in idly alone
[4:38:36.640 --> 4:38:41.040]  why is idly so hard-headed i don't mean to change the subject here but why is idly so hard-headed
[4:38:43.200 --> 4:38:49.360]  i guess they did not act immediately and effectively to shut it all down as soon as possible
[4:38:50.240 --> 4:38:58.000]  south korea which is you know also a democracy seems to be doing a very good job now and getting
[4:38:58.000 --> 4:39:06.800]  this thing uh under control they have massive testing 10 000 day quarantines and everything
[4:39:06.800 --> 4:39:16.080]  like that so maybe south korea is uh turning a page here i i can't say but in idly uh germany
[4:39:17.680 --> 4:39:22.960]  france now britain i i think it's completely i know you don't like to cover old ground but to me
[4:39:22.960 --> 4:39:28.160]  it's seminal that six weeks ago you were here saying it's man-made major university saying it
[4:39:28.160 --> 4:39:32.720]  now you know if that's big news now saying it's man-made you know the fact that it's mutated
[4:39:32.720 --> 4:39:39.040]  the fact that there's reinfections that's now confirmed uh i mean the providence of this what's
[4:39:39.040 --> 4:39:50.240]  behind it to me that's pivotal well as i said Alex right and you see the uh cdc hhs uh nye
[4:39:50.240 --> 4:39:56.880]  tony fouchi are all covering this up that as we went through this before in great detail
[4:39:56.880 --> 4:40:01.040]  you were right when you said three weeks ago they're screwing up covering this up for fouchi
[4:40:01.040 --> 4:40:06.240]  we're not making it clearly trump early on had advisors covering it up his instincts kicked in
[4:40:06.240 --> 4:40:14.000]  he's not doing that now it appears he's not trusting the advisors he has now but i think
[4:40:14.000 --> 4:40:21.520]  he's got to fire all of them because uh uh azar fouchi cdc redfield they're more interested
[4:40:21.520 --> 4:40:29.120]  in covering their own behinds here because they were funding this uh uh death science research
[4:40:29.120 --> 4:40:34.000]  there at the university of north carolina i just got to say this i want to i don't want to inject
[4:40:34.000 --> 4:40:39.520]  myself in there but i confirm through lawyers that just having you and others on piss them off
[4:40:39.520 --> 4:40:44.000]  so somebody inside the cdc put the word out to try to shut us down i'm sure you've seen the news
[4:40:44.000 --> 4:40:47.600]  they're everywhere they're calling for swat team raids on us right now doctor
[4:40:49.440 --> 4:40:56.240]  that would not surprise me uh uh elix as you know uh i'm totally censored out of the mainstream
[4:40:56.240 --> 4:41:02.640]  news media not only here but but in europe for obvious reasons uh ever since i blew the whistle
[4:41:02.640 --> 4:41:11.680]  on the amerithrax coming out of a us biological warfare uh program so it's it's power uh for the
[4:41:11.680 --> 4:41:16.560]  course i think trump just has to fire all these people i agree what does the president do that
[4:41:16.560 --> 4:41:22.480]  he's definitely listening what does he do well it looks like he's going to proclaim a national
[4:41:22.480 --> 4:41:31.200]  emergency uh later today and inject billions of dollars into uh helping uh frontline people
[4:41:31.200 --> 4:41:37.760]  combat this that's good uh an applaud that i you know we all do respect to the markets
[4:41:38.240 --> 4:41:43.680]  we have to take care of the people first and foremost the american people and the markets
[4:41:43.680 --> 4:41:50.400]  i think will take care of themselves so uh uh you know i know the president's a businessman but
[4:41:51.280 --> 4:41:58.640]  right now the priority has to be the american people get everyone uh tested and free of charge
[4:41:58.640 --> 4:42:06.880]  and and mass uh testing and then uh if if necessary telling them to you know quarantine
[4:42:06.880 --> 4:42:14.880]  at home shutting down all schools churches public events and try to shut this down uh
[4:42:14.880 --> 4:42:23.520]  as best as can be done i also think giving the given the deliberate uh stalling and delaying
[4:42:23.520 --> 4:42:32.320]  covering up uh from these uh so-called advisors in washington dc state and local governments
[4:42:32.320 --> 4:42:37.120]  i've said this before in our our last interview they're just gonna have to charge out there on
[4:42:37.120 --> 4:42:43.760]  their own just like well you said that just last wednesday and that's now happening stay there dr
[4:42:43.760 --> 4:42:48.480]  ranches boil is really knocking out of the park stay with us we'll we'll cover all this right
[4:42:48.480 --> 4:42:54.240]  ahead another hour of your calls straight ahead we always promote being prepared having firearms
[4:42:54.240 --> 4:42:58.960]  knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden
[4:42:58.960 --> 4:43:02.960]  i mean it's just it's what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we do so high-quality
[4:43:02.960 --> 4:43:07.440]  swarble food i told my patriot a month ago i said what can you handle i said i think this is gonna
[4:43:07.440 --> 4:43:10.240]  be really big and they said well we can handle probably this we're not sure we're investing
[4:43:10.240 --> 4:43:13.600]  everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund it i said no i think this is gonna
[4:43:13.600 --> 4:43:16.880]  be huge so that you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food even though the
[4:43:16.880 --> 4:43:19.760]  prices are going up for you so those are the types of discussions we have now i'm just giving the
[4:43:19.760 --> 4:43:25.120]  insight of baseball of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred times a
[4:43:25.120 --> 4:43:30.000]  few days ago now it's about 200 times okay an info war store dot com you go right in the queue
[4:43:30.000 --> 4:43:34.960]  first come first serve but the fact that the orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying i mean
[4:43:34.960 --> 4:43:39.920]  this is just insane we're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it
[4:43:39.920 --> 4:43:44.640]  continues like this we're looking at having to suspend food sales but everybody gets their order
[4:43:44.640 --> 4:43:48.320]  in we'll get your food but that's how big this is so what you're getting is a hundred percent
[4:43:48.320 --> 4:43:53.680]  the straight deal of what's going on info war store dot com it's really smart to get high quality
[4:43:53.680 --> 4:43:59.440]  storeable food and info war store dot com it's also smart to drink filtered water with a lexapure

[4:45:57.120 --> 4:46:04.160]  i love the turbo force i drive truck for a living and it's amazing coffee kind of gives you a little
[4:46:04.160 --> 4:46:09.200]  crash there at the end but that turbo force is amazing how is turbo force different than coffee
[4:46:09.200 --> 4:46:17.040]  i'll tell you what it's sustainable anywhere from uh 18 hours i don't feel the jitters like i do
[4:46:17.040 --> 4:46:22.480]  drinking coffee and it's just you know at the end of the day i don't need anything to go to bed i'll
[4:46:22.480 --> 4:46:28.240]  you know i'll pop a knockout to my mouth cold well that's what we went out to a top developer who
[4:46:28.240 --> 4:46:34.400]  did want his name on it and i said what would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible
[4:46:34.400 --> 4:46:38.720]  that's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and
[4:46:38.720 --> 4:46:43.600]  natural that are time released and there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product
[4:46:43.600 --> 4:46:48.720]  so that's why turbo force has such a great effect and so i really appreciate you and i'm glad that
[4:46:48.720 --> 4:46:57.840]  you like turbo force you're listening to the alex jones show
[4:47:10.320 --> 4:47:15.600]  we're in the middle of history right now if you are receiving this transmission
[4:47:15.600 --> 4:47:19.840]  you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[4:47:22.400 --> 4:47:26.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle is going to leave us for about 10 minutes and then i'll go back to
[4:47:26.000 --> 4:47:30.960]  loaded phone lines but guess what they're now finding in newsweek and
[4:47:34.080 --> 4:47:43.200]  the Associated Press the coronavirus is eating men's testicles oh what a surprise
[4:47:43.200 --> 4:47:51.280]  it destroys fertility so dr. Boyle i've got a lot of questions for you we can talk for 10 days
[4:47:51.280 --> 4:47:54.880]  hopefully you'll join me on the sunday show or the monday show whatever you can do for a full hour
[4:47:55.440 --> 4:48:00.080]  or maybe you can host if you like sunday for an hour that's even better without me interrupting but
[4:48:00.640 --> 4:48:04.640]  the way it's a chimera the way it keeps mutating i've got articles right here that they're saying
[4:48:04.640 --> 4:48:10.000]  oh no people that are here to they survived the coronavirus then they tested positive again
[4:48:10.000 --> 4:48:16.480]  you and mike adams and then the reports were six weeks ago were saying this it has an hiv delivery
[4:48:16.480 --> 4:48:21.520]  system and then it just keeps coming back like hiv it's like you beat it and then it goes away
[4:48:22.640 --> 4:48:26.640]  there's so many points to cover so many angles to go with but the fact that it's man-made
[4:48:27.280 --> 4:48:31.520]  who would do this where did it come from and then now they're trying to blame trump and
[4:48:31.520 --> 4:48:35.840]  bring down the economy with it to me i think this is he just looks like the biggest salt to take
[4:48:35.840 --> 4:48:40.800]  down america i'm gonna stop talking for 10 minutes you've got the floor you just cover whatever you
[4:48:40.800 --> 4:48:49.280]  think is most important dr boil well again uh alex uh as we went through before and i
[4:48:49.840 --> 4:48:59.680]  in detail uh the hiv is in there and i already uh mentioned to you this scientific study uh
[4:48:59.680 --> 4:49:08.080]  where uh one of the wuhan uh bsl four people worked with the australian government to
[4:49:09.120 --> 4:49:18.960]  mate hiv with coronavirus and then i also think they took the uh um u n c uh gain of function
[4:49:18.960 --> 4:49:26.560]  coronavirus and uh back there and uh wuhan put them both together to create this turbo charge
[4:49:26.560 --> 4:49:34.560]  biological weapon that then leaked i believe accidentally right now i haven't seen i was about
[4:49:34.560 --> 4:49:38.480]  to say if it's man-made you can prove where it came from why the hell would you release it
[4:49:40.320 --> 4:49:47.360]  i think it was an accident at the problem is alex that all of these uh bsl three and bsl four is
[4:49:47.360 --> 4:49:52.160]  leaked uh we know it's proven that it's on record why doesn't trump just come out in the dress of
[4:49:52.160 --> 4:49:56.720]  the nation and admit it the stock market will go down 10 000 points like you said that doesn't
[4:49:56.720 --> 4:50:01.600]  matter truth matters he will politically win by that and will mobilize like when germany was
[4:50:01.600 --> 4:50:08.320]  bombing britain britain was against world war two until nazis attacked if trump like churchill just
[4:50:08.320 --> 4:50:14.080]  says we're in trouble it's horrible let's fight that's what we need not a bunch of coloring what do
[4:50:14.080 --> 4:50:20.800]  you say i agree with that i i'm happy to speak with president trump about this if he wants to talk
[4:50:20.800 --> 4:50:28.000]  with me and the amount and extent of this uh nazi biological warfare work that has grown
[4:50:28.000 --> 4:50:35.920]  going on here for quite some time uh and that was funded by the national institutes of health the
[4:50:35.920 --> 4:50:40.400]  center for disease control and he's you're right you said this a month ago and i'm like
[4:50:40.400 --> 4:50:45.600]  he needs to burn them all because they're going to set him up well i don't know if they're setting
[4:50:45.600 --> 4:50:50.320]  them up him up but they're certainly covering their own rare ends here they're all over the
[4:50:50.320 --> 4:50:54.560]  globalists in the process blame trump so i'm just saying it's the right thing to do plus
[4:50:54.560 --> 4:51:00.320]  they're going to blame him for it burn them it's clear he's being blamed for something
[4:51:00.320 --> 4:51:08.400]  that was in operation here long before uh president trump indeed uh it was the uh obama
[4:51:08.400 --> 4:51:16.640]  administration that put a pause on this uh dual use uh dna genetic research and then lifted the
[4:51:16.640 --> 4:51:24.240]  pause that's right there in that university of north carolina article i mentioned to you if you
[4:51:24.240 --> 4:51:31.440]  look at the uh at the footnotes in the small print it's all there so uh this preceded president
[4:51:31.440 --> 4:51:39.040]  trump but as i said before you know as as president truman said the buck stops here so he's no you're
[4:51:39.040 --> 4:51:47.760]  right and you were saying three weeks ago he doesn't take action now but he is starting to take action
[4:51:47.760 --> 4:51:57.280]  uh but again he's got advisors around him that are trying to restrain him from uh taking i think
[4:51:57.280 --> 4:52:01.840]  what is uh even more effective action that's going to be have to be taken at this time yeah
[4:52:03.840 --> 4:52:07.440]  well listen i could ask questions a thousand times we really appreciate you and i know you're
[4:52:07.440 --> 4:52:12.240]  busy man but i hope you come on sunday maybe in hosting hours there it is lab make coronavirus
[4:52:12.240 --> 4:52:17.360]  triggers debate that was five years ago scientists and said in major publications these scientists
[4:52:18.080 --> 4:52:24.000]  why is this going on and then now it's here and we know it does kill a large number of people
[4:52:24.000 --> 4:52:32.000]  what's scary is the hiv aspect where it reinfects as a top bio weapons lawyer that wrote the us law on
[4:52:32.000 --> 4:52:39.040]  it and then the you and adopted just in a minute or two dr bolton you explain a regular flu virus
[4:52:39.040 --> 4:52:47.120]  or something else you you you get sick you defeat it whatever they're in the news ap la time saying
[4:52:47.120 --> 4:52:54.400]  okay it is coming back what type of virus comes back is that not a autoimmune chimera like hiv
[4:52:54.400 --> 4:53:03.280]  or what's happening yes you know it it's total disinformation to say well uh the flu uh it kills
[4:53:03.280 --> 4:53:10.320]  more people than this that people are saying that are just trying to deceive you this is clearly a
[4:53:10.320 --> 4:53:18.080]  turbocharged offensive biological warfare weapon that has never been released before and if you're
[4:53:18.080 --> 4:53:23.840]  going to release it you do it on your own people to be the victims you don't get the blame well
[4:53:23.840 --> 4:53:29.520]  as i said i think well this was being stockpiled on both sides by both uh
[4:53:29.520 --> 4:53:36.480]  exactly so it's hard to know who did it well i think that u n c article makes it quite clear
[4:53:36.480 --> 4:53:44.000]  that this this goes back to the university of north carolina and you'll note uh there was a pause on
[4:53:44.000 --> 4:53:52.720]  it and then the obama administration lifted the pause so um it's all in that article that we uh
[4:53:52.720 --> 4:53:59.840]  discussed uh uh alex no and i know professor you teach classes so you like phase one phase two well
[4:53:59.840 --> 4:54:04.800]  you didn't miss the previous class but we have huge the audience is way bigger than a month ago
[4:54:04.800 --> 4:54:10.720]  so i get it professor you you teach in in phases and then that makes sense people should go back
[4:54:10.720 --> 4:54:15.680]  and watch the previous interviews or we should categorize them as that but this is just this is
[4:54:15.680 --> 4:54:23.920]  well maybe alex what you should do uh is put together the interviews we gave i think uh starting
[4:54:23.920 --> 4:54:29.280]  was at mr charon but you were out of town at that time so i gave him no you're right we should take
[4:54:29.280 --> 4:54:36.320]  the interviews from like six weeks ago and just say professor boyles class on coronavirus and just
[4:54:36.320 --> 4:54:42.400]  have it all right there i would not say class but you know i don't wish to sound professor whatever
[4:54:42.400 --> 4:54:48.720]  but whatever you call it uh professor boyles analysis but i think yeah analysis but i i think
[4:54:49.280 --> 4:54:56.080]  it would be helpful if if you went back to the first half hour interview i gave i i think was
[4:54:56.080 --> 4:55:03.280]  mr sure would or share it yeah and where right and then i gave you uh uh that was on a wednesday
[4:55:03.280 --> 4:55:08.000]  then i gave you an interview on friday no you understand i i've been interviewed for almost
[4:55:08.000 --> 4:55:14.000]  20 years you're a great guy i respect you you're really smarter by nose you're prestigious i hate
[4:55:14.000 --> 4:55:19.840]  myself doing this i i hate you being so accurate like i wanted you to be wrong i was telling crew
[4:55:19.840 --> 4:55:24.720]  like six weeks ago oh i think boyles i'll be honest i think boyles just worst case scenario that's
[4:55:24.720 --> 4:55:32.080]  what lawyers do and now i'm just like no boyles dead on i i i feel sick right now i this is this
[4:55:32.080 --> 4:55:38.960]  is we're living in 2020 under a bio weapon attack and we don't know who the hell launched it bikes
[4:55:38.960 --> 4:55:45.520]  that's why i've tried to appear on your show i i think it's important understand yeah it's like
[4:55:45.520 --> 4:55:52.400]  the pogo uh cartoon we yet we met the enemy and he is us and that's that's what's going on here it
[4:55:52.400 --> 4:55:58.240]  came out of that u n c lab uh with with the approval of all the exactly they think they're
[4:55:58.240 --> 4:56:05.040]  gonna cook this stuff up in labs it gets out everyone's to blame why did you do it why did
[4:56:05.040 --> 4:56:13.280]  you build it it goes back to the atomic bomb but now well it's i i publicly condemn this
[4:56:13.280 --> 4:56:20.400]  u n c research as far back as 2015 if you have a look no no i had you want the time that was what's
[4:56:20.400 --> 4:56:26.400]  i've got a good memory still i remember you freaking out about level four labs doing level
[4:56:26.400 --> 4:56:31.440]  you know all the we're here now so let me in the closing minute professor because you've
[4:56:31.440 --> 4:56:40.400]  got the crystal ball you live this what's coming next i regret to say it doesn't look good alex
[4:56:40.400 --> 4:56:49.360]  uh yeah i i i regret to say because of this uh criminally uh criminal malpractice advice that
[4:56:49.360 --> 4:56:57.120]  all these advisors have been uh giving to president trump it domestically it looks like it might be a
[4:56:57.120 --> 4:57:05.760]  little too little too late um i think dollar day or a day late dollar short what has to be done now
[4:57:06.880 --> 4:57:14.240]  is uh as you just saw uh governor abit uh do um hold on i know you gotta go do five more minutes

[4:59:58.720 --> 5:00:12.880]  we're on the march after frances boyle all right dr boyle where you see this going what president
[5:00:12.880 --> 5:00:18.000]  trump should do the other topics those last five minutes we really appreciate you as the author
[5:00:18.000 --> 5:00:23.760]  of the u.s. biological weapons law on what's happening you called it all the last six weeks
[5:00:23.760 --> 5:00:29.840]  you've been dead on i'm just scared to hear what you're gonna say next or again trying to be
[5:00:30.960 --> 5:00:39.280]  positive about this i i really think we're gonna need uh governors and mayors uh to to step up to
[5:00:39.280 --> 5:00:45.280]  the plate and just take their own action because it's obvious because of the people around president
[5:00:45.280 --> 5:00:52.160]  trump giving advice that it's not properly being done and so i commend uh i didn't hear the whole
[5:00:52.160 --> 5:00:56.640]  press conference there of governor abbott but that's what we're going to need all over the
[5:00:56.640 --> 5:01:02.400]  country that governors just he used to learn an emergency right that's what we're going to need
[5:01:02.400 --> 5:01:09.920]  sure and then act accordingly and also you know provide as much free testing free testing for
[5:01:09.920 --> 5:01:16.000]  everyone uh i don't think it should be limited by insurance plans or anything else they're doing
[5:01:16.000 --> 5:01:21.200]  this now in south korean you can just drive through a parking lot and get a test uh everyone
[5:01:21.200 --> 5:01:27.840]  should have a test to find out exactly what's going on here and then if it's positive a media
[5:01:27.840 --> 5:01:35.200]  quarantine for at least two days right i i think uh governor komo did the right thing there in
[5:01:35.200 --> 5:01:42.000]  calling out the national guard to surround new uh new rochelle i'm afraid we're gonna be seeing
[5:01:42.000 --> 5:01:47.440]  more of this happening yes what do you make of democrats i don't know if you've seen the clips
[5:01:47.440 --> 5:01:53.360]  with your academic life but cnn ms they're like oh bring down the economy it's all trumps fault
[5:01:53.360 --> 5:01:58.960]  rooting for the virus it's like they're cartoon characters to me i see that i go these are bad
[5:01:58.960 --> 5:02:06.160]  people like rooting for bad stuff to happen i just it's crazy well again i i'm a political
[5:02:06.160 --> 5:02:11.520]  independent i'm you know i'm not really here to criticize the democrats and the republicans
[5:02:11.520 --> 5:02:15.600]  no i understand but they're like frothing hoping for political the democrats are trying
[5:02:15.600 --> 5:02:20.640]  to make political hay out of this you are correct for everything i've seen you are
[5:02:20.640 --> 5:02:26.640]  correct about that in in watching the mainstream news me i i don't think that is the appropriate
[5:02:26.640 --> 5:02:35.600]  way to proceed here uh uh we need leadership and and both sides to you know put aside exactly why
[5:02:35.600 --> 5:02:40.240]  don't they get they could be their kids that die don't they get that they need to be like really
[5:02:40.240 --> 5:02:46.560]  trying to find the truth you're exactly right but but the same with uh republicans too for
[5:02:46.560 --> 5:02:52.160]  example i read in the new york times today this this new package the republicans are saying
[5:02:52.160 --> 5:02:57.520]  well there has to be uh an anti-abortion provision in the bill well that's already
[5:02:57.520 --> 5:03:02.640]  prohibited by the height amendment come on let's let's just focus on this particular
[5:03:02.640 --> 5:03:06.800]  problem i agree don't make it political because they've they've definitely been doing that
[5:03:06.800 --> 5:03:14.880]  no we you know we can't resolve all the problems in the world here uh uh racism in america poverty
[5:03:14.880 --> 5:03:23.920]  in america etc uh we need to focus on uh the corona virus and and trying to stop it and contain it
[5:03:24.480 --> 5:03:32.240]  and get proper uh medical treatment for all american people poor or rich because whatever
[5:03:32.240 --> 5:03:38.320]  the financial aristocracy believe they're in the same boat with the rest of us there's they
[5:03:38.320 --> 5:03:43.520]  will run to bunkers did you see literally most the billionaires have run to bunkers
[5:03:45.040 --> 5:03:52.640]  it's not going to help them unless it's completely sealed off like a a bsl four lab um that might
[5:03:52.640 --> 5:03:59.120]  help um i don't know how long they're going to be able to survive in their bunkers because if they're

[5:07:43.120 --> 5:07:48.480]  to get your opinion on and i want to put it in other people's brains what do you think about uh
[5:07:48.480 --> 5:07:57.360]  gavin newson's executive order that he passed where he can um commandeer private assets and also
[5:07:57.360 --> 5:08:04.800]  why are we not seeing any of these families of these people that died doing interviews if this was
[5:08:04.800 --> 5:08:11.280]  a shooting if this was i agree it's a giant power grab the whole thing synthetic before the body was
[5:08:11.280 --> 5:08:17.920]  dead before the body was cold well tell us what you think no i'm the whole thing synthetic i'm not
[5:08:17.920 --> 5:08:24.720]  saying the virus in fact i believe the virus is a bio weapon that is like aids it comes back later
[5:08:24.720 --> 5:08:30.160]  but this this is their big introduction this is the big globalist move everything we were worried
[5:08:30.160 --> 5:08:36.960]  about this is it what do you think janet oh i agree with you totally and yes people are dying i can't
[5:08:36.960 --> 5:08:43.920]  believe what i see coming out of iran and china and people are just not waking up i tell i am
[5:08:43.920 --> 5:08:49.600]  telling people all the time i had three kids the last one is in college i have to go get them today
[5:08:49.600 --> 5:08:58.240]  because they shut down college they were pretty much my oldest one was conservative libertarian
[5:08:58.240 --> 5:09:06.400]  the other two were pretty liberal um and you know what i talked to them i talked to people i know
[5:09:06.400 --> 5:09:13.200]  and i get this message out and i say you have to look at the stories that are not being told
[5:09:13.200 --> 5:09:19.680]  beautiful and you know what our governor is going to be the next one that puts this executive order
[5:09:19.680 --> 5:09:25.760]  out that he can commandeer private assets oh it's a total power grab it's total authoritarianism and
[5:09:25.760 --> 5:09:29.760]  i don't say this act tough because this will make them come after me but i'll say this right now
[5:09:33.280 --> 5:09:39.840]  this is a synthetic globalist operation and if the globalists knew that they were going to
[5:09:39.840 --> 5:09:44.560]  be held accountable for what they've done they wouldn't do it and so i've been really nice
[5:09:44.560 --> 5:09:49.040]  about this even two months ago before this happened i said i think they're gonna launch a bio weapon
[5:09:50.400 --> 5:09:58.960]  and if you hurt my family it holds you responsible and see it's not some big tough guy thing it's
[5:10:00.960 --> 5:10:07.040]  killing people is like taking a crap it's so easy i mean it really is folks like it's like
[5:10:07.040 --> 5:10:11.760]  eating food or having sex or taking a dump man it's like we're meant to do it like i'll
[5:10:11.760 --> 5:10:16.720]  you know how these people like i train guys to kill people how you want to train me to kill
[5:10:16.720 --> 5:10:24.000]  people i'll do it all day long it's so easy i don't know how to do it but the thing is you're
[5:10:24.000 --> 5:10:29.840]  absolutely right they think they're gonna carry this out and then we aren't gonna dig them out of
[5:10:29.840 --> 5:10:38.240]  their holes no anybody i know dies from this man made virus i hold the establishment responsible
[5:10:38.800 --> 5:10:48.800]  and and and kill me go ahead i've already won my people who are our people and i am their people
[5:10:48.800 --> 5:10:55.680]  we're going to kill you and so just let them know hey jerks we know you're behind all this
[5:10:55.680 --> 5:11:02.160]  and we know what you pulled and you're not gonna rest while you did this and that's all i mean i
[5:11:02.160 --> 5:11:06.400]  really actually completed my mission i'm not gonna commit suicide never do it but let me tell you
[5:11:06.400 --> 5:11:11.600]  something i've been working really hard man and i just i want everybody to know like i want to
[5:11:11.600 --> 5:11:16.640]  keep going forever but i'm not scared at all i'm ready to meet god and i want the globalist to
[5:11:16.640 --> 5:11:22.480]  know you're gonna die and you're gonna go to hell and we're gonna get you i appreciate your calls
[5:11:22.480 --> 5:11:30.480]  i appreciate your calls yeah we have another guest on right now don't we
[5:11:38.160 --> 5:11:43.680]  yeah my calves is coming on but i just think that's a good statement for people it's not
[5:11:43.680 --> 5:11:50.560]  like some tough statement like i'll kill you i'm just saying you kill me i kill you i mean
[5:11:50.560 --> 5:11:54.960]  that's what this comes down to like people didn't mess with folks people used to ask like why are
[5:11:54.960 --> 5:12:00.560]  people so polite in texas well because if you were impolite somebody would kill you
[5:12:03.680 --> 5:12:10.480]  and that's really what it comes down to is in the final equation it's like that iron maiden song
[5:12:10.480 --> 5:12:15.520]  the trooper that we can go out to break let's try to queue up the trooper in a minute if you
[5:12:15.520 --> 5:12:22.320]  guys can do it let's play a minute of the trooper because you'll fire musket but i'll run you through
[5:12:23.840 --> 5:12:29.520]  and when you're waiting for the next attack you better stand because there's no falling back
[5:12:30.240 --> 5:12:33.760]  i'm a soldier it's like a farmer
[5:12:36.720 --> 5:12:41.920]  i'm ready to die and they don't know how to deal with somebody like that like i'm so ready to die
[5:12:41.920 --> 5:12:48.960]  but i want to make sure on the way down i dig you with me and they're so scared of that they don't
[5:12:48.960 --> 5:12:55.200]  know what to do when somebody's ready to die they don't know what to do they sit there all night long
[5:12:55.200 --> 5:13:02.800]  and are scared and they sit there on their knees to their god the devil begging for power and begging
[5:13:02.800 --> 5:13:10.960]  for satan to empower them to defeat us they will not defeat us they will burn in hell it's like
[5:13:10.960 --> 5:13:17.680]  that twisted sister song you're gonna burn it out you're gonna burn it out you're gonna burn in
[5:13:17.680 --> 5:13:25.200]  hell you're gonna burn in hell you're not gonna get victory and all your money in power means
[5:13:25.200 --> 5:13:30.720]  nothing when you're a slave artists but hold the longest here let's go ahead and go to
[5:13:32.080 --> 5:13:39.280]  joe in new jersey joe thanks for holding go ahead hey alex how you doing um i'm on fire brother
[5:13:39.280 --> 5:13:47.600]  i'm very close to god right now man i saw deanna postpone the uh primaries and i wonder if that's
[5:13:47.600 --> 5:13:55.280]  going to be a precursor into maybe postponing the election along with their their their posting
[5:13:55.280 --> 5:14:01.200]  pictures of trump with these leaders who are positive or supposedly positive with coronavirus
[5:14:01.920 --> 5:14:05.440]  and are they made oh they're a hundred percent getting ready to say trump has coronavirus
[5:14:05.440 --> 5:14:12.080]  then kill him and say it killed him that's it or or or the 25th amendment which he's disabled
[5:14:12.080 --> 5:14:16.240]  and can't wrap the country and then bring pillory into on a broker convention
[5:14:18.800 --> 5:14:25.040]  the left is cheerleading coronavirus like it's their mascot like if the democrats were a football
[5:14:25.040 --> 5:14:34.240]  team coronaviruses are mascot yeah i think they're trying to uh you know because they're hyping up the
[5:14:34.240 --> 5:14:39.440]  whole trump thing sick or you know trump thick uh they're shutting everything down and and they
[5:14:39.440 --> 5:14:46.480]  don't want more than 250 or 200 people in one place one time so it shuts his uh his rallies down
[5:14:49.120 --> 5:14:52.640]  if you could take him out through the 25th amendment because he's disabled or they say he's
[5:14:52.640 --> 5:14:57.840]  disabled and they put and they put pens and no one can see the amount of people that's still back
[5:14:57.840 --> 5:15:04.320]  hence because you can't congregate with people no i totally agree with you this is their look they
[5:15:04.320 --> 5:15:12.160]  failed on every front so they launched a chi-com bio weapon attack trying to discredit the president
[5:15:12.160 --> 5:15:16.400]  i don't think it works what do you think no i don't think it'll work either i'm just you know
[5:15:16.400 --> 5:15:21.280]  they'll pull anything they can out to do whatever they can and nothing's worked except jet and there's
[5:15:21.280 --> 5:15:26.480]  too much of a backing in this country to let anything like that happen so what happens when the

[5:21:06.480 --> 5:21:12.160]  over and over again it happens only men and those that love liberty go forward
[5:21:14.160 --> 5:21:18.880]  all right let's get into it right now your phone calls almost live friday edition i am your
[5:21:18.880 --> 5:21:26.560]  host alex jones and i am exhausted but i'm here notice they said that brazil's bolacerno
[5:21:27.360 --> 5:21:33.600]  says he's tested negative but he's really got the virus and trump's got it so they
[5:21:33.600 --> 5:21:40.000]  could hit him with a bio weapon or whatever and say oh trump died from coronavirus who's
[5:21:40.000 --> 5:21:45.920]  been holding the longest year a lot of great callers i respect you all the longest holding
[5:21:45.920 --> 5:21:55.840]  car is julian in kentucky thanks for holding her on the air hey mr jones god bless you it's
[5:21:55.840 --> 5:22:03.040]  good to talk to you i've been listening to you about three years and i support you but you know
[5:22:03.040 --> 5:22:09.760]  i'm worried about the president and it just seems he's he's surrounded by a bunch of fools
[5:22:09.760 --> 5:22:16.320]  um they don't try to protect him at all and you know he's got to have this virus by now
[5:22:17.120 --> 5:22:22.960]  um and i and i've noticed i i don't see a lot of the democrats with the coronavirus but you
[5:22:22.960 --> 5:22:29.840]  see gates calling isn't that funny they exactly it's a cover for a bio weapon that's what i was
[5:22:29.840 --> 5:22:36.800]  thinking three days ago it's a cover for it to hit cpa it's a cover exactly they just keep yeah
[5:22:36.800 --> 5:22:45.440]  and most people that's uh trump's come in contact with has had this virus but i i just
[5:22:45.440 --> 5:22:50.800]  find it funny that none of the democrats have it and um at least if they do i've not seen it come
[5:22:50.800 --> 5:22:56.800]  out yet but i support the president i'm actually worried about him i know he's doing his best he's
[5:22:56.800 --> 5:23:04.640]  73 and um i i just don't know what's going to happen with him or this country but this is a
[5:23:04.640 --> 5:23:10.960]  spiritual battle and uh the battle lines have been drawn just better be on the side of good
[5:23:10.960 --> 5:23:18.560]  because um god will prevail over this it's scary but everyone needs to get the heart right with the
[5:23:18.560 --> 5:23:28.240]  lord but support your president and uh beautifully said julian god bless you thank you so much
[5:23:28.880 --> 5:23:34.480]  that's absolutely true that sums up the whole show today anthony in canada you're on the air
[5:23:34.480 --> 5:23:39.600]  go ahead hey alex how's it going thank you for taking my call it's a pleasure to take your call
[5:23:39.600 --> 5:23:45.200]  brother awesome awesome so i want to continue uh to agree with the last few callers about uh
[5:23:45.200 --> 5:23:50.320]  you know this whole thing with uh these leaders and celebrities you know they just happen to be
[5:23:50.320 --> 5:23:55.520]  the ones getting this uh coronavirus but the general public doesn't seem to be picking it up
[5:23:55.520 --> 5:24:00.560]  much like people that i know haven't picked it up around me it's just it's all these celebrities
[5:24:00.560 --> 5:24:05.120]  and the famous people right so i'm a little worried about trump like the other callers are
[5:24:05.120 --> 5:24:10.080]  saying i think that this is just what the whole office like a week ago and then i was like oh
[5:24:10.080 --> 5:24:15.360]  whatever then two days ago it was like everybody's like no it's an excuse to kill trump and say it's
[5:24:15.360 --> 5:24:19.280]  a bio weapon and that's where they're clicking because all the news is like he's got it he's
[5:24:19.280 --> 5:24:27.520]  got it take him out he didn't he created it he did it and trumps got it exactly and i think because
[5:24:27.520 --> 5:24:31.280]  of his age and they say that he's mcdonald's and all that they're just going to use it as an
[5:24:31.280 --> 5:24:37.280]  excuse to see that he was you know not healthy enough to fight it and well i know this is a group
[5:24:37.280 --> 5:24:42.640]  collective the oracle of the people is saying they're trying to poison trump and give him the
[5:24:42.640 --> 5:24:49.360]  coronavirus they're they're they're hyping it up massively so that that's what they're actually
[5:24:49.360 --> 5:24:54.080]  saying now yesterday i'm like well they blame him for corona and say he's got it now they're
[5:24:54.080 --> 5:24:59.520]  actually saying it well that's crazy and he's going to speak at three o'clock now so it's
[5:24:59.520 --> 5:25:03.600]  going to be interesting to see what he's going to say and that's right right as the war room
[5:25:03.600 --> 5:25:08.480]  starts we're going to cover that live god bless you anthony let's keep moving here to these amazing
[5:25:08.480 --> 5:25:17.840]  callers my couch is coming up let's go to uh celeste or celisa i can't i can't read anymore
[5:25:17.840 --> 5:25:24.800]  a beautiful name calling from uh cecilia i don't know cecilia they got a little hotel in austin
[5:25:24.800 --> 5:25:33.600]  called st cecilia cecilia from seattle you're on the air go ahead hi alex um i've been listening
[5:25:33.600 --> 5:25:40.160]  to the show and and i think i had this coronavirus already um they said it's been last week they were
[5:25:40.160 --> 5:25:46.400]  saying it's been in seattle already about six weeks and um kind of it was martin luther king
[5:25:46.400 --> 5:25:55.680]  weekend that i came down with the flu and it was a fast onset and you know i was fine that day before
[5:25:55.680 --> 5:26:01.520]  and then morning of i didn't feel so great and by the afternoon i was like i have to go to bed so um
[5:26:03.680 --> 5:26:09.440]  it was heavily involved with the lungs i used i didn't have any sign of stuff i really didn't
[5:26:09.440 --> 5:26:15.600]  have a sore throat but i was just this constant coughing so i had it about six seven days and
[5:26:15.600 --> 5:26:20.720]  then someone says oh this the flu that's been going around last three weeks so i was like
[5:26:20.720 --> 5:26:26.960]  hell with that and so i i called the clinic i went into the clinic and they tested and they said oh
[5:26:26.960 --> 5:26:33.360]  did you get vaccinated i said no and so they tested me and i said well is it the strain that you
[5:26:33.360 --> 5:26:39.280]  were vaccinating for and they said no so i said well what was it and they said oh well you know
[5:26:39.280 --> 5:26:43.120]  it's the strain i can't remember the exact conversation i think she said it's the strain
[5:26:43.120 --> 5:26:48.800]  well they're even saying take the flu shot or the measles shot now which only in studies i even have
[5:26:48.800 --> 5:26:53.200]  the articles here lowers your immunity so they go oh jack up your immunity because you can only
[5:26:53.200 --> 5:26:58.480]  have one virus at a time well that's not true well you die is getting a couple viruses at one time
[5:26:59.600 --> 5:27:04.960]  well i live alone and so i self quarantined and i canceled everything and i didn't go out and i
[5:27:04.960 --> 5:27:11.600]  called everybody and said you know don't come near me whatever i have you don't want it but um i'm
[5:27:11.600 --> 5:27:20.720]  64 and i would just kind of like to put out that that you know i survived it i did cough for about
[5:27:20.720 --> 5:27:25.600]  like after i recovered for it i did cough for about two more weeks so there was a lot of
[5:27:25.600 --> 5:27:32.800]  long involvement with this for sure and i think if you were older i did notice that when i laid flat
[5:27:32.800 --> 5:27:37.840]  i had to bolster myself with pillows because well i'm not trying to scare you but have you seen the
[5:27:37.840 --> 5:27:47.920]  reports that it comes back well i have not experienced that but um i you know i super cleaned up my

[5:33:33.440 --> 5:33:39.920]  immunity to corona that was in mainstream news but hillary who loves you who the hell advises her

[5:36:11.680 --> 5:36:17.840]  it's it's very it's quite catastrophic that but there's some good news in this so so one thing is
[5:36:17.840 --> 5:36:22.800]  you know how you look at the election map of of who elected trump you know so-called fly over america
[5:36:22.800 --> 5:36:29.840]  and rural america is going to be in great shape relative to the cities the liberal cities will
[5:36:29.840 --> 5:36:34.880]  be the death zones and you're already starting to see that like ten commandments the pharaoh's curse
[5:36:35.840 --> 5:36:39.680]  well i i suppose i mean i'm not a bible scholar i don't know that whole story but
[5:36:39.680 --> 5:36:45.600]  look the liberals have set up their cities to be filth ridden lawless you know feces in the streets
[5:36:45.600 --> 5:36:50.240]  homeless camps that aren't enforced with any kind of standards and let me tell you something alex
[5:36:50.240 --> 5:36:55.200]  there's going to be a wave of new homelessness after this thing is done and over with because
[5:36:55.200 --> 5:37:01.200]  we're going to have a lockdown it's coming we're going to have an economic disaster in the short
[5:37:01.200 --> 5:37:05.840]  term with a strong strong recovery on the other side of it by the way which is why we got to get
[5:37:05.840 --> 5:37:11.280]  through this quickly so we can have that recovery still this year that can happen but there's going
[5:37:11.280 --> 5:37:15.920]  to be a lot of new homelessness all over america i believe you're like the oracle here so i love that
[5:37:15.920 --> 5:37:20.160]  what tell me about the recovery on the other side i like to hear about that well it's it's very clear
[5:37:20.160 --> 5:37:25.120]  if you study the epidemiology the sooner trump starts the shutdown which has really already
[5:37:25.120 --> 5:37:31.040]  begun and you said he changed trajectory a couple days ago he did trump is now on track to save his
[5:37:31.040 --> 5:37:35.680]  presidency and save america and save millions of lives who would have otherwise died and we got to
[5:37:35.680 --> 5:37:40.400]  give the president credit he's starting to really take aggressive leadership action you got to give
[5:37:40.400 --> 5:37:45.840]  listeners credit for lighting a fire in recess absolutely yeah i mean he was on a trajectory that was
[5:37:45.840 --> 5:37:51.520]  looking very bad but he changed that uh... march 11th so so he's on a great trajectory now just
[5:37:51.520 --> 5:37:57.200]  48 hours later uh... he is taking charge he's going to declare a national emergency as you
[5:37:57.200 --> 5:38:01.760]  and i talked about i don't know 10 days ago he's going to shut down travel eventually to certain
[5:38:01.760 --> 5:38:05.840]  cities that are the hot spots and he's openly talking about that now which is exactly what we
[5:38:05.840 --> 5:38:12.240]  need to see but the bottom line alex is the only thing that stops this now is social distancing
[5:38:12.240 --> 5:38:19.120]  extreme shutdowns which are starting to begin and folks it's not a conspiracy to try to embarrass
[5:38:19.120 --> 5:38:24.080]  trump this is literally the only medical way to stop this and the sooner we start the shutdowns
[5:38:24.080 --> 5:38:29.600]  and just have the school shut and everybody stay home for a period of time uh... dr foushee says it
[5:38:29.600 --> 5:38:34.960]  might be seven to eight weeks okay this is why you should have preparedness for 60 days or 90
[5:38:34.960 --> 5:38:39.760]  days or get all that might be let's let's drill down because i respect you you're a smart guy i
[5:38:39.760 --> 5:38:45.840]  really respect you why is it so how deadly is it like why are we freaking out like this i'm not
[5:38:45.840 --> 5:38:51.680]  saying you're wrong just tell me sure no well because if you don't start the shutdowns early
[5:38:51.680 --> 5:38:56.400]  then your hospital systems get overrun about six to eight weeks totally brings down the economy i
[5:38:56.400 --> 5:39:02.240]  get it but how do we know it's that deadly well we we look around the world look at italy now italy
[5:39:02.240 --> 5:39:07.520]  the dollar was dead and a five percent plus mortality rate and their hospitals are in a
[5:39:07.520 --> 5:39:14.960]  state of collapse right now italy is italy is at risk of literally failing as a nation
[5:39:15.600 --> 5:39:20.480]  if they do not get a handle on this so i agree so so so looking at it now in hindsight you first
[5:39:20.480 --> 5:39:24.800]  it was a man made it's been confirmed yes how bad is it there's lots of different strains
[5:39:24.800 --> 5:39:29.200]  that's what i'm concerned about is the fact that it comes back like that's an la times an ap today
[5:39:29.200 --> 5:39:35.120]  that it comes back it's like hiv that is this is like airborne hiv it sounds like it's a zombie
[5:39:35.120 --> 5:39:38.720]  virus basically yeah it keeps coming back from the dead so that's why people are so scared that
[5:39:38.720 --> 5:39:44.080]  elites are going to bunkers well look if the death rate were only 0.1 percent like the seasonal
[5:39:44.080 --> 5:39:49.120]  flu then we could all ignore it we would just accept every year we're going to lose 40 50
[5:39:49.120 --> 5:39:53.440]  thousand people that's what happens with the flu we don't shut down the economy for that it's just
[5:39:53.440 --> 5:39:58.000]  an accepted risk of living so the panic by the establishment is is is it they're using it for
[5:39:58.000 --> 5:40:04.320]  their advantage but it's real well it is real yes they the left wants to destroy trump with this
[5:40:04.320 --> 5:40:09.760]  but i want trump to succeed i want america to succeed and i got to say alex those people out
[5:40:09.760 --> 5:40:15.040]  there that have been saying that fear is bad i strongly disagree you need to have sufficient
[5:40:15.040 --> 5:40:22.000]  fear early enough to well it's like you have fear for a reason well right if you've got a tiger
[5:40:22.000 --> 5:40:27.280]  that's that's about to eat your head off and it's 10 feet away oh you probably you should have some
[5:40:27.280 --> 5:40:32.880]  fear because something's bad is about to happen to you the question is can you use fear to drive
[5:40:32.880 --> 5:40:39.440]  you to action to stop the threat and save lives so fear itself is a survival mechanism we wouldn't
[5:40:39.440 --> 5:40:44.480]  be here without some level of fear no and by the way is our brain telling us what's bad it but yes
[5:40:44.480 --> 5:40:49.520]  they want us to give in to fear no we're supposed to take fear and become an energized by it and
[5:40:49.520 --> 5:40:54.000]  it's the lack of information from the mainstream media and the censorship of the tech giants
[5:40:54.000 --> 5:41:00.640]  that has led to nationwide complacency which will be followed by panic hoping this brings down america
[5:41:00.640 --> 5:41:05.680]  yes and they're so one-dimensional if they were successful trump won't be blamed now they're
[5:41:05.680 --> 5:41:10.960]  going to be blamed uh you know trump is in a real tight spot no matter what he does he's going to be
[5:41:10.960 --> 5:41:16.080]  condemned but he has made the right choice to block flights from europe he needs to deploy the
[5:41:16.080 --> 5:41:20.080]  military as i was going to say could you believe the left blocked the border said he wasn't doing
[5:41:20.080 --> 5:41:25.680]  enough and when he blocked the flights they got mad it's just it's classic this is what we expect
[5:41:25.680 --> 5:41:32.080]  but trump is in he's pulling himself out of the trap now the next thing that needs to happen he's
[5:41:32.080 --> 5:41:37.920]  got to deploy the military to the southern border block the border block all illegal traffic today
[5:41:37.920 --> 5:41:43.440]  right now exactly use the crisis to fix the real crisis well yeah and remember they're
[5:41:43.440 --> 5:41:47.760]  going to be infected people from central and south america coming through mexico it's a giant
[5:41:47.760 --> 5:41:52.880]  criminal inflow of drugs and stuff that's that's the country's energy so let's just up front it
[5:41:52.880 --> 5:41:57.840]  and they said i was just saying oh stop virus let's just say no we're shut the damn country down
[5:41:58.720 --> 5:42:02.800]  you're gonna have to you're gonna have to shut it down the question is do you do it now and take
[5:42:02.800 --> 5:42:07.840]  the hit early where it's smaller or do you wait and do nothing to where it becomes catastrophic
[5:42:07.840 --> 5:42:13.120]  and it ends the trump presidency you you do it early and it's much easier to deal with and that's
[5:42:13.120 --> 5:42:17.360]  that's what's about to come back one more segment but how obvious is it where democrats say
[5:42:17.360 --> 5:42:23.600]  you're not doing enough shut down the airplanes he does it and they say he's bad they are literally a
[5:42:23.600 --> 5:42:29.040]  joke democrats are demons they want america to fail we want america to survive and succeed and
[5:42:29.040 --> 5:42:34.720]  prosper and that can happen if we do this right but you're right mike this is a big assault this is it
[5:42:36.000 --> 5:42:40.640]  anyway you look at it this is a big assault and we're ready for it and we're still on air

[5:47:00.560 --> 5:47:11.120]  you are back live i'm alex jones your host mike adams is here
[5:47:12.400 --> 5:47:18.480]  i have the associated press reporting mexico preparing to close border with the us to stop
[5:47:19.120 --> 5:47:26.560]  coronavirus how dare they you know i'd have a border there's so much crazy stuff happening
[5:47:26.560 --> 5:47:33.440]  governor abbott declares martial law powers mike adams continuing
[5:47:34.800 --> 5:47:40.880]  let's go back to the beginning it's man-made it's being used to attack trump and america and the
[5:47:40.880 --> 5:47:48.800]  economy you should cover the martial law we can cover the big events we can cover the death rate
[5:47:48.800 --> 5:47:53.200]  but but what about the providence of this i think to attack the globalist just like trump's done
[5:47:53.200 --> 5:47:58.320]  you pointed it comes from china they're trying to say it comes from america well we know from
[5:47:58.320 --> 5:48:02.960]  frances boil who's been a frequent guest on your show that the origins of the engineering of the
[5:48:02.960 --> 5:48:09.120]  virus began in america and that thanks to barack obama it was allowed to be transferred to china now
[5:48:09.120 --> 5:48:15.200]  we also know by the way joe biden has been part of technology transfer to china involving the
[5:48:15.200 --> 5:48:21.840]  military f-35 jet technology for example and many other things you know look the the obamas and the
[5:48:21.840 --> 5:48:28.320]  bidens and the clintons are treasonous criminals and they have set into motion these weapon systems
[5:48:28.320 --> 5:48:34.160]  that are now devastating the entire planet was that by design it seems so when hillary's out
[5:48:34.160 --> 5:48:39.600]  there saying hey take the flu shot when we know the flu shot increases your mortality if you get
[5:48:39.600 --> 5:48:44.240]  the virus you know that this is a weapon system they want you to die they literally want you to
[5:48:44.240 --> 5:48:51.040]  die they this is the depopulation kill switch so what where did it start well you know it's it's a
[5:48:51.040 --> 5:48:56.000]  lot of bad decisions a chain reaction of bad decisions and corrupt officials and betrayal
[5:48:56.000 --> 5:49:01.840]  of our country which is why trump has got to beat this i've got three predictions for you here alex
[5:49:01.840 --> 5:49:05.760]  if it's okay to share these three predictions of where this is going trump's about to have a conference
[5:49:05.760 --> 5:49:12.000]  in what 10 10 20 minutes i think right uh just coming up there's a very good chance that trump
[5:49:12.000 --> 5:49:17.280]  will announce a state of emergency not a hundred percent but a very strong chance or at least
[5:49:17.280 --> 5:49:24.320]  prepare the country for that declaration to happen soon secondly amazon.com people are relying on amazon
[5:49:24.320 --> 5:49:27.360]  to get all their products right now to get to get things because they don't want to go out
[5:49:28.000 --> 5:49:34.640]  to grocery stores for example amazon.com all of its warehouses are run by human beings with the
[5:49:34.640 --> 5:49:40.880]  help of some automation the people are going to have to go home pretty soon the amazon.com
[5:49:40.880 --> 5:49:45.600]  fulfillment warehouses in many regions around the country will be shut down that's my prediction
[5:49:45.600 --> 5:49:52.080]  today third prediction members of our congress will be infected and killed by this virus and that's
[5:49:52.080 --> 5:49:57.440]  partly because they're they're extremely elderly in many cases some of them are like walking dinosaurs
[5:49:57.440 --> 5:50:03.280]  even on a good day but the other reason is because they're hooked on pharmaceuticals they're not
[5:50:03.280 --> 5:50:09.120]  healthy they don't just be the cover for other viruses the same family that are more deadly
[5:50:09.120 --> 5:50:16.080]  to release a bio weapon you know this could be the perfect assassination cover to even kill the president
[5:50:16.800 --> 5:50:20.960]  well you're absolutely right uh in fact there could be more lethal strains that were already in the
[5:50:20.960 --> 5:50:26.160]  freezers ready to be thawed out and deployed and you're exactly right this is this could be a cover
[5:50:26.160 --> 5:50:31.760]  story oh these all these uh conservatives just happen to die uh from the coronavirus when it
[5:50:31.760 --> 5:50:37.040]  was really something you know much more vicious absolutely uh fortunately we've we've got young
[5:50:37.040 --> 5:50:42.160]  healthy people like rand paul who i think even if rand paul were infected he could survive it his
[5:50:42.160 --> 5:50:46.640]  father is a doctor he's got good medical knowledge we need people like rand paul we need trump to
[5:50:46.640 --> 5:50:52.560]  survive if he's infected uh we we don't want anybody to die from this even if they're you know
[5:50:52.560 --> 5:50:57.600]  politically on the other side of the aisle let's say but the truth is we're going to lose members
[5:50:57.600 --> 5:51:03.920]  of congress you can count on that and the elections are already starting to be thrown into disarray
[5:51:03.920 --> 5:51:09.760]  it's unclear now how we can have elections until we get through this because of the quarantines
[5:51:09.760 --> 5:51:14.080]  who's going to go out and vote and then if you start having electronic voting systems to replace
[5:51:14.080 --> 5:51:19.440]  that of course the democrats will use that as an opportunity for more voting fraud so this is how
[5:51:19.440 --> 5:51:23.760]  they could steal the election is to say oh everybody has to stay home let's let people vote on their
[5:51:23.760 --> 5:51:28.400]  iPhones and then guess what all the votes are fraudulent and all the dead people vote even more
[5:51:28.400 --> 5:51:35.520]  than usual in democrat areas so trump has got to conquer this well before the election day
[5:51:35.520 --> 5:51:42.320]  in order to protect the integrity of the elections and not allow democrats to steal it alex mike
[5:51:42.320 --> 5:51:48.320]  there's no doubt now since weeks ago you predicted they would start locking down us cities let's talk
[5:51:48.320 --> 5:51:54.160]  about that they're canceling schools all over the united states what do you expect to happen
[5:51:54.160 --> 5:52:00.240]  next week the week after when does this peak uh we're nowhere close to peaking yet we're still
[5:52:00.240 --> 5:52:05.040]  in the early stages of this so we're the next six to eight weeks we're probably going to see
[5:52:05.040 --> 5:52:09.680]  numbers get a lot worse uh so that's that's one thing to keep in mind if you're not ready to
[5:52:09.680 --> 5:52:15.680]  survive 90 days in isolation or longer as we've talked about before then you need to take steps
[5:52:15.680 --> 5:52:19.600]  everybody to get prepared for that you might be isolated for an extended time the national guard
[5:52:19.600 --> 5:52:24.080]  will be deployed in every region that has these outbreaks it's already happening i think five more
[5:52:24.080 --> 5:52:29.600]  states today airports will be shut down in certain regions i expect that soon for seattle new york
[5:52:29.600 --> 5:52:35.520]  city boston atlanta denver and san francisco so those are the cities i'm predicting airports will
[5:52:35.520 --> 5:52:39.840]  be shut down which basically shuts down all the connection hubs for most of the major airlines
[5:52:39.840 --> 5:52:45.120]  across america i don't expect a shutdown of private aviation what's called general aviation
[5:52:45.120 --> 5:52:51.280]  you know private jets uh gary haven will still be flying around uh the country thank god but
[5:52:51.280 --> 5:52:57.120]  commercial aviation will not be allowed to proceed in many areas road travel will be allowed to
[5:52:57.120 --> 5:53:02.080]  proceed for quite a long time except in certain areas that get very very bad this is good news
[5:53:02.080 --> 5:53:08.480]  it means that ups and fedex and the usps can continue to deliver packages they're very important for
[5:53:08.480 --> 5:53:14.640]  even pharmaceutical supply for local pharmacies people who need insulin for example or you know
[5:53:14.640 --> 5:53:18.480]  nutraceuticals or food or or water filters all the things that people need it looks like
[5:53:18.480 --> 5:53:22.800]  those deliveries will continue however what about the importance of crime is suddenly exploded
[5:53:23.520 --> 5:53:26.560]  well it's going to explode in the liberal cities again that's where it's going to be the worst
[5:53:26.560 --> 5:53:30.560]  so this is again it's democrats yeah actually absolutely that's what it is like baltimore
[5:53:31.200 --> 5:53:36.560]  and uh chicago and allay it's all exploding yes and you know governor abbot today declared a state
[5:53:36.560 --> 5:53:41.920]  of disaster for the state of texas uh he probably implies this but i wish he would have added and
[5:53:41.920 --> 5:53:46.800]  all texans please shoot looters that's what he should have added to that declaration now i don't
[5:53:46.800 --> 5:53:50.320]  know if that attitude is going to be everywhere else in the country but it should be anybody who
[5:53:50.320 --> 5:53:56.320]  goes around looting other people's stuff deserves to be shot and and that will happen in texas so
[5:53:56.320 --> 5:54:01.200]  looters will not have a lot of success especially with the national guard on the streets so anybody
[5:54:01.200 --> 5:54:04.720]  who tries to go out and steal from other people you're going to get swept up by the guard or you're
[5:54:04.720 --> 5:54:09.600]  going to get shot by some texas rancher very very quickly so you know if you're in the country
[5:54:09.600 --> 5:54:14.160]  you're in much better shape right now if you're in the city you're in a death zone and that's a
[5:54:14.160 --> 5:54:18.800]  mistake you might want to get out while you can if you can't you better be prepared to
[5:54:18.800 --> 5:54:24.560]  hunker down and survive a zombie wave that's coming that's the truth uncensored let's talk
[5:54:24.560 --> 5:54:31.520]  about mike adams the providence of this virus i mean it's man made that's admitted it shows up
[5:54:31.520 --> 5:54:36.160]  right on time the media tries to blame trump for it what do we know where it came from and who's
[5:54:36.160 --> 5:54:41.920]  behind it well yeah again this was engineered this is a biological weapon system no question about
[5:54:41.920 --> 5:54:47.280]  it's got elements of mers and hiv and sars kov one and you know many many other elements in it
[5:54:47.280 --> 5:54:53.120]  so it was designed it was engineered as a weapon against humanity it was given to china it or
[5:54:53.120 --> 5:54:58.160]  china purchased it from us universities i think francis boil is absolutely correct and then china
[5:54:58.160 --> 5:55:04.160]  began tweaking it remember like six weeks ago i did an interview with you on this we thought maybe
[5:55:04.160 --> 5:55:09.840]  this virus was version 12 and they were working toward version 20 well what if they have already
[5:55:09.840 --> 5:55:16.560]  version 16 or 18 or 20 in the freezer version 12 got released but now they're saying well gosh
[5:55:16.560 --> 5:55:22.720]  they're going to deploy version 20 which is even more deadly as the bio weapon to kill certain areas
[5:55:22.720 --> 5:55:29.200]  like washington dc now that they've softened up america with this first wave and china allowing
[5:55:29.200 --> 5:55:34.480]  their people to have the infections first means that they have achieved immunity first and that's
[5:55:34.480 --> 5:55:40.800]  and then they create the narrative that it's a china's the victim they're not bad and then they
[5:55:40.800 --> 5:55:46.240]  have the perfect bio weapon launch point that's how you would do this well exactly and the fact
[5:55:46.240 --> 5:55:50.800]  that they're willing to sacrifice so many of their people and then achieve immunity quickly with a
[5:55:50.800 --> 5:55:56.400]  draconian lockdown means they will now have a mobile military force that is immune to the virus
[5:55:56.400 --> 5:56:01.920]  that can literally invade and survive california if they choose to do that because their troops
[5:56:01.920 --> 5:56:06.080]  won't be affected by the virus they're already immune so think about you know i'm encouraging
[5:56:06.080 --> 5:56:11.440]  everybody think about these issues and the traders we have with governor newson and sacramento county
[5:56:11.440 --> 5:56:16.240]  deliberately releasing high-risk patients in california seriously trump should arrest those
[5:56:16.240 --> 5:56:22.000]  people right now deploy the military to sacramento county shut that thing down in terms of allowing
[5:56:22.000 --> 5:56:26.880]  the high-risk patients to be released those people there are trying to sabotage america that cannot
[5:56:26.880 --> 5:56:31.440]  be allowed to happen it's it's hard enough to beat this virus when we're doing the right thing
[5:56:31.440 --> 5:56:35.760]  they're trying to do the wrong thing on purpose oh they openly wanted the democrats are on cnn
[5:56:35.760 --> 5:56:40.240]  saying let's use it to bring down america that's their plan the fact that they say it publicly
[5:56:40.240 --> 5:56:44.400]  shows the weird bubble they're in where they hate the country so much they think that's normal it's
[5:56:44.400 --> 5:56:49.840]  bizarre mike adams natural news dot com thank you sir thank you thank you god bless all right god

[5:57:55.120 --> 5:58:24.960]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these
[5:58:24.960 --> 5:58:38.160]  wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge

[6:00:34.720 --> 6:00:51.720]  um thank you for this emergency war council um on info wars we now have the left arm of the media and sports entertainment and the right arm of the scientific military industrial complex they have now formed a pincer attack
[6:00:51.720 --> 6:01:07.720]  on the west by order of the u head and the world health organization for the chinese world government model our flanks are now under siege which has not been seen since 911
[6:01:07.720 --> 6:01:25.720]  china has implemented a scorching burn tactic um to route all the internal and external threats against them and um this is world government bringing the west to our knees
[6:01:25.720 --> 6:01:43.720]  um on december 17 i called in and spoke about the apex of division being reached and you correctly said i'm after i brought up that point that there's going to be a foreign power we have reached the penultimate event at the apex
[6:01:43.720 --> 6:01:57.720]  so after the apex this was the swing and you called it and we called it together and i really appreciate you taking phone calls because this is how we remember the discussion what do we what do we talk about brainstorming together
[6:01:57.720 --> 6:02:09.720]  we talked about i called in and said um they have reached the apex of division in this country that they've reached the highest point i remember your call you said the race war didn't work now they're gonna know something
[6:02:09.720 --> 6:02:29.720]  yep and and they reached the apex so once you reach the apex you can only there's only one there's only one way down from the summit before you get another apex and this and this was their move and you you correctly said that be careful of a foreign entity i was saying it was
[6:02:29.720 --> 6:02:43.720]  going to be the left and i thought this was going to stay internal um you you correctly said be careful of a foreign power and now under the directive of the un world government they how to how does every arm
[6:02:43.720 --> 6:02:54.720]  win how does the left hand and the right hand the military industrial complex and the hollywood media how do they all win instead of making bombs they get to make masks
[6:02:54.720 --> 6:03:05.720]  instead of russia gate they get to pull this up and now every leftist has their shutdown and their event to then you know hype up the virus exactly
[6:03:05.720 --> 6:03:16.720]  and this this is and tom cruise getting ready with with oh trouble never be elected you know he'll be elected when space aliens land and he just he just all exactly
[6:03:16.720 --> 6:03:31.720]  um so yeah so they get to hit every every agenda gets to be everybody gets to have their every globalist agenda is is able to be hit through this virus instead of assassinating
[6:03:31.720 --> 6:03:43.720]  uh trump they could just say it was coronavirus once one celebrity or politician dies in this country people are going to go crazy um that's all it's going to take god bless you
[6:03:43.720 --> 6:03:54.720]  and james josh next segment i take jim and bruce's calls then dr niggas next summer but let's play this clip of the virus guy that wanted to overshot the president two nights ago
[6:03:54.720 --> 6:04:04.720]  tom hanks here he is but there's a american presidential potential candidate not even nominate yet he wants to make america great is that what donald trump's
[6:04:04.720 --> 6:04:13.720]  well here's the problem america's already great so i don't know what he is talking about he don't think if he's becomes the president here make make it great because the states is already
[6:04:13.720 --> 6:04:21.720]  i think that man will be president of the united states right about the time that space ships come down he's filled with dinosaurs and redcaps
[6:04:21.720 --> 6:04:41.720]  i'm at like tom but oh now it didn't go the way tom hanks said imagine tom hanks when he meets god god's gonna say hey son get out of my face get in my presence
[6:04:41.720 --> 6:04:47.720]  two more calls straight ahead of that nick baggage is ready
[6:04:47.720 --> 6:04:55.720]  you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush some skulls politically you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually
[6:04:55.720 --> 6:05:03.720]  there's nowhere you can spend money there's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's gonna have more hour per dollar
[6:05:03.720 --> 6:05:14.720]  your bang for your buck fear gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy
[6:05:14.720 --> 6:05:21.720]  and so it's very simple if you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which god wants to see
[6:05:21.720 --> 6:05:29.720]  we have to make the effort 110% god will finish the move and i know i need to stay in the fight in the attack attack attack
[6:05:29.720 --> 6:05:37.720]  i want to attack i want to go after the globalist and just believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together

[6:06:06.720 --> 6:06:17.720]  you know maybe maybe i'm wrong but i was followed my gut my intuition i don't feel weak right now i feel like i almost completed my mission
[6:06:17.720 --> 6:06:27.720]  i feel so exhausted the holy spirit is just pat on the head saying you did a good job son i think something really big and bad is about to happen
[6:06:27.720 --> 6:06:42.720]  i think i may be taken out at least off air very soon and i don't say that to be dramatic i want to tell you i love you and i appreciate you but there's a lot of big stuff going down
[6:06:42.720 --> 6:06:55.720]  maybe that's going to change but the trump is set any minute to declare an actual emergency it was already declared three weeks ago as soon as that's ready to go live as soon as the president walks up the podium
[6:06:55.720 --> 6:07:05.720]  let's just while i take calls put put trump up on screen just put the feet up on screen as soon as he comes out we'll go to the president
[6:07:05.720 --> 6:07:10.720]  jim and colorado you're on the air go ahead
[6:07:10.720 --> 6:07:16.720]  i got the answer you guys are looking for and i know probably kind of be hard for you to understand
[6:07:16.720 --> 6:07:20.720]  brother that's why we're taking the calls we take it nothing's better than the callers go ahead
[6:07:20.720 --> 6:07:34.720]  your government hates you they don't like any of us they they hate all of us they hate you they hate the fact that you exist they hate the fact that you're here they could do it better
[6:07:34.720 --> 6:07:48.720]  you lost your rights a long long time ago yeah it's been the type of folks that think they could run everything better than you agree that's the attitude of the globalist
[6:07:48.720 --> 6:07:53.720]  but not everybody in governments like that i mean i'm not kissing your but sass i used to always attack the government as i saw as the enemy
[6:07:53.720 --> 6:08:05.720]  it's evil people in control of it the average person in government actually is more awake than general public that's not for me an ass kissing ceremony i think that's what i really found
[6:08:05.720 --> 6:08:15.720]  your government is it's no one void it lost it's it's you lost sovereignty a long time ago back in the 1860s
[6:08:15.720 --> 6:08:24.720]  i understand that people can say at the end of the civil war and all that but it's about will it's about what's right that's what really runs contracts
[6:08:24.720 --> 6:08:36.720]  yeah well did you see what happened in virginia when you all you guys went there and you you stood around with your guns and nothing happened you know why the governor put a fence up against the the capital because he knows the rules of the game
[6:08:36.720 --> 6:08:46.720]  actually the governor back down i love you like you guys all showed up you guys all stood up they back down they're gonna grab what are you talking about man
[6:08:46.720 --> 6:08:55.720]  you didn't stand up for nothing the fact that that governor announced that he was gonna start killing babies when you start killing babies guys listening he's watching
[6:08:55.720 --> 6:09:10.720]  wait a minute wait a minute jim jim jim in colorado listen brother i'm not your enemy but when we go out and protest against abortion or we file lawsuits against her we go have a pro gun rally and we and you say we didn't do nothing
[6:09:10.720 --> 6:09:21.720]  you calling in sound pretty pathetic telling men and women that went and showed up and did something on their own time and money that were pieces that we didn't do nothing that sounds like a load of crap to me son
[6:09:21.720 --> 6:09:29.720]  it's not a little crap you sit there and you i'm done listening to you man you get up you fix it then son
[6:09:29.720 --> 6:09:40.720]  that's disgusting what the hell are you talking about hell i was sleepy and tired now i'm awake that was the most disgusting thing i've ever heard
[6:09:40.720 --> 6:09:54.720]  he's not pissed at the governor the abortionist he's not pissed at at the whole globalist operation we that went out there and protested we didn't do nothing
[6:09:54.720 --> 6:10:07.720]  people that do something or the problem i've never heard such a demonic voice gibbering in my ear go back to satan get behind me devil
[6:10:07.720 --> 6:10:15.720]  bruce in ohio you're on the air welcome hello alex can you hear me now yes sir thanks for calling
[6:10:15.720 --> 6:10:24.720]  thank you first time caller long time lister since about 2010 love your products have been using them for four or five years they're all great
[6:10:24.720 --> 6:10:34.720]  my question is in the past couple of years i think you've had some experts on predicting a global economic crisis
[6:10:34.720 --> 6:10:41.720]  at least one in the united states if not the entire world well i predicted they use a bio weapon as the cover for total takeover
[6:10:41.720 --> 6:10:49.720]  do you think this virus could have been designed to distract people's consciousness from the economic crash
[6:10:49.720 --> 6:10:58.720]  oh absolutely it's a global reset cover i don't think i know and i predicted it this is synthetic if the whole thing's a fraud and a hoax
[6:10:58.720 --> 6:11:05.720]  doesn't mean it doesn't kill people but the whole stampeding limbing over the edge of the club event this is it this is the new world
[6:11:05.720 --> 6:11:11.720]  we're striking back and i think we get that point out and the fact is man made they've got to back off we don't we're screwed
[6:11:11.720 --> 6:11:18.720]  trump comes out and says looks like man made wuhan and he brings up the files with a man made he checkmates them all
[6:11:18.720 --> 6:11:24.720]  but and the Fauci and all them i'm not even saying are the villains i'm not sure about i don't want to make claims people make
[6:11:24.720 --> 6:11:32.720]  up all the proof but let's just say this he's getting bad advice and trumps got to fire all barrels at this situation
[6:11:32.720 --> 6:11:41.720]  he points out as man made game over for them two more quick points alex most people in this country would you agree or not
[6:11:41.720 --> 6:11:49.720]  live pay to pay month to month on their on their income yes what is this going to do to people's credit
[6:11:49.720 --> 6:11:56.720]  uh don't you think that uh this morning five a.m. when i got up i wanted to come on here and talk about
[6:11:56.720 --> 6:12:04.720]  paycheck to paycheck half the public roughly is on that what happens when they can't go to work for a couple months it will create a

[6:12:28.720 --> 6:12:34.720]  have them on because we we we believe we don't give you a talking point we just have a
[6:12:34.720 --> 6:12:39.720]  interesting people on to have a discussion so you can see what they have to say and you can make a decision

[6:12:53.720 --> 6:12:59.720]  what he thinks and i think in that dialectic you're going to get because you want both you want all those perspectives
[6:12:59.720 --> 6:13:05.720]  and i because you know notice google feeds you results that you want it's like one thing no no no we want outside the
[6:13:05.720 --> 6:13:11.720]  boxes we want to look at all the points that's why there's all these articles going well jones is selling fraudulent
[6:13:11.720 --> 6:13:17.720]  silver that cures corona ever said that but he didn't says don't worry about corona why is he doing that because
[6:13:17.720 --> 6:13:25.720]  we're not doing that whether it's quarantines or not you're going to get this virus and it is man may and it looks like
[6:13:25.720 --> 6:13:31.720]  hiv and it comes back again and again so let's have a discussion while the irons hot about where it came from
[6:13:31.720 --> 6:13:37.720]  who scans to gain from it because you start having that discussion these viruses mutate quickly they're releasing
[6:13:37.720 --> 6:13:43.720]  them they're spraying them these this is a global stop right they don't release a bio weapon that has legs
[6:13:43.720 --> 6:13:51.720]  they release a very quick acting one that mutates and is gone a bunch of dickheads are running around
[6:13:51.720 --> 6:13:57.720]  releasing all this right now it's totally a bio attack america and the world's under bio attack
[6:13:57.720 --> 6:14:07.720]  and so let's not be afraid of it and let's realize you expose the providence of it game over just one button i push
[6:14:07.720 --> 6:14:17.720]  you expose who did this you expose this man made that's the weak spot it's all over anything else bruce
[6:14:17.720 --> 6:14:27.720]  last question alex do you think that the democrats have been immunized against this virus why do they not feel or seem afraid of it
[6:14:27.720 --> 6:14:33.720]  because they know it's overall a hoax they want to use it as a power takeover alright i'm out of time thank you bruce

[6:19:27.720 --> 6:19:44.820]  and then some things you see what you think because I'm not was this yet really you take and the very element that they try to represent you let that silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound the ball silence you know what's most disturbing the people
[6:19:44.820 --> 6:19:46.820]  silence
[6:19:50.140 --> 6:19:53.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[6:19:53.020 --> 6:20:15.780]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich
[6:20:15.780 --> 6:20:26.780]  and welcome back and it's Friday the 13th Wow what a day what a week you know
[6:20:26.780 --> 6:20:31.540]  last week I was talking about this virus and sort of what's happening at a
[6:20:31.540 --> 6:20:37.260]  different sort of take on it and a lot of positive response and I remember last
[6:20:37.260 --> 6:20:42.780]  week listening to Alex and Mike Adams and listening again going into this
[6:20:42.780 --> 6:20:47.180]  hour and I want to calm in a little bit because sometimes as Alex said we do
[6:20:47.180 --> 6:20:53.340]  disagree and it's regarding the issue of fear that Mike Adams brought up and I
[6:20:53.340 --> 6:20:59.700]  agree that it's a an important emotion in terms of the declaration of human
[6:20:59.700 --> 6:21:05.900]  emergency is fear right I mean we jump into that and we also jump in to the
[6:21:05.900 --> 6:21:09.260]  reptilian brain the one that does a flight or fight response which is an
[6:21:09.260 --> 6:21:13.660]  initial response you know that's the appropriate one but in a modern world
[6:21:13.660 --> 6:21:18.060]  that isn't the lion jumping out at us it requires a calmness and the reason it
[6:21:18.060 --> 6:21:24.460]  does isn't you know philosophical it's actually biological because what
[6:21:24.460 --> 6:21:29.140]  happens when you're in fear your immune system gets depressed number one so if
[6:21:29.140 --> 6:21:34.100]  you stay in a state of fear for a long period of time you'll depress your
[6:21:34.100 --> 6:21:37.980]  immune system long anxiety depresses your immune system makes you more
[6:21:37.980 --> 6:21:43.980]  susceptible to illness so laying aside the the reality or non-reality or how
[6:21:43.980 --> 6:21:47.940]  the virus started because you know we could fight that to the cows come home
[6:21:47.940 --> 6:21:52.820]  because last week I was talking about supply chain interruption and the impact
[6:21:52.820 --> 6:21:57.220]  of that which is really important because one of the callers just a few
[6:21:57.220 --> 6:22:01.860]  moments ago touched on the point of what about all those people that live
[6:22:01.860 --> 6:22:05.620]  paycheck paycheck and something I've commented on in past programs in
[6:22:05.620 --> 6:22:11.260]  recent days is the fact that 58% of Americans only have a thousand and
[6:22:11.260 --> 6:22:17.100]  savings or less than $1,000 in savings which isn't enough to last very long
[6:22:17.100 --> 6:22:23.620]  you know as things go so you know talking about about that reality and the
[6:22:23.620 --> 6:22:27.740]  fact that so many live so close to the edge and so many are already over the
[6:22:27.740 --> 6:22:31.860]  edge and something Mike said that I totally agree with is what happens
[6:22:31.860 --> 6:22:36.420]  at are we gonna have a bigger homelessness issue because of all of the
[6:22:36.420 --> 6:22:42.860]  problems of probably so you know look at you know what what's happening if
[6:22:42.860 --> 6:22:46.620]  you're watching the video clips right now you know it's the storming of the
[6:22:46.620 --> 6:22:51.340]  grocery store you know this kind of thing this program talked about this
[6:22:51.340 --> 6:22:58.060]  long ago you know info wars is provided accurate information not in a state of
[6:22:58.060 --> 6:23:04.420]  panic but in a state of awareness that hey ladies and gentlemen pay attention
[6:23:04.420 --> 6:23:10.820]  that's what we need to do right now and that's initial shock response fear you
[6:23:10.820 --> 6:23:16.420]  got to be real you know that's real and then we got to look at things a little
[6:23:16.420 --> 6:23:20.460]  differently we got to calm ourselves and approach things a little bit
[6:23:20.460 --> 6:23:26.500]  differently and remember our humanity is quite frankly and I think it's
[6:23:26.500 --> 6:23:30.380]  appropriate to say that you know today is a lot of happy talk you know in terms
[6:23:30.380 --> 6:23:35.980]  of what's going on in the mainstream and yet the reality of it is settling in in
[6:23:35.980 --> 6:23:40.820]  every quarter this weekend it will settle in more because here's what Mike said a
[6:23:40.820 --> 6:23:45.860]  couple weeks ago and it's accurate is the projection on this you know we ran
[6:23:45.860 --> 6:23:51.460]  our numbers to and go wow the short term isn't too scary but the long term is
[6:23:51.460 --> 6:23:56.180]  pretty devastating and it doesn't have to be that long something else pointed out
[6:23:56.180 --> 6:24:02.060]  this can go a quarter or two and then flip back around what I was looking at
[6:24:02.060 --> 6:24:05.900]  at the end of last year wasn't a virus I was looking at just the economic
[6:24:05.900 --> 6:24:10.940]  fundamentals which were bad they were really really bad and I said this last
[6:24:10.940 --> 6:24:17.660]  week you know I even speculated on that a horror show that I saw coming and this
[6:24:17.660 --> 6:24:22.420]  virus gives international bankers a lot of cover as they throw another trillion
[6:24:22.420 --> 6:24:27.580]  and a half dollars into liquidity to fuel and already on fire market but today
[6:24:27.580 --> 6:24:32.900]  you see the big rise in the market happening at the moment it this is not
[6:24:32.900 --> 6:24:39.260]  a long term going to be around you know it's up 900 points right now as you go
[6:24:39.260 --> 6:24:43.860]  into the last hour of the day half hour of the day and it'll end on a high note
[6:24:43.860 --> 6:24:47.260]  and then the news will roll in through the weekend and the council come up and
[6:24:47.260 --> 6:24:51.460]  Monday will hit and everyone will go oh my gosh what do we do and here's some
[6:24:51.460 --> 6:24:55.300]  things I want to talk about in terms of what's been hit really hard oil has been
[6:24:55.300 --> 6:24:59.460]  hit hard for a lot of reasons outside of this beyond the dampening of demand
[6:24:59.460 --> 6:25:04.460]  supply side was increased dramatically by OPEC failing to reach agreement a few
[6:25:04.460 --> 6:25:08.580]  days ago and they're scheduled for a meeting on the 18th an interim
[6:25:08.580 --> 6:25:12.100]  meeting where Russia and OPEC and everybody meets again maybe they'll
[6:25:12.100 --> 6:25:16.100]  settle this on the 18th keep an eye out that'll be a lot of happy talk around
[6:25:16.100 --> 6:25:19.980]  that there'll be a need to have a lot of happy talk because I think this thing
[6:25:19.980 --> 6:25:27.700]  still has a long long way to go as we begin to factor in what I call the
[6:25:27.700 --> 6:25:33.580]  emotional X factor and and everyone thinks they understand emotion and things
[6:25:33.580 --> 6:25:38.380]  they understand how it works and we all can rationalize all that and
[6:25:38.380 --> 6:25:41.820]  intellectualize all that see the part of the brain that's doing all that work
[6:25:41.820 --> 6:25:46.220]  intellectualize all that is the opposite side of the brain where the action is
[6:25:46.220 --> 6:25:50.980]  when the emotion starts to crank up so you can't assess one from the point of
[6:25:50.980 --> 6:25:55.580]  view of the other and be very accurate about it on either side so here's what
[6:25:55.580 --> 6:25:59.660]  happens in my predictions of the next steps and they're not the predictions to
[6:25:59.660 --> 6:26:04.820]  ask people to remain calm and start to do some things just proactively just
[6:26:04.820 --> 6:26:10.100]  because we should and it returns some power to ourselves you know so do some
[6:26:10.100 --> 6:26:13.660]  things proactively think about what's going on around you calmly and then
[6:26:13.660 --> 6:26:17.980]  make sure you're as prepared as you can be and then you know buckle up for what
[6:26:17.980 --> 6:26:23.060]  happens because we're already in motion forget about fighting over the cause or
[6:26:23.060 --> 6:26:28.780]  the situation or who took advantage they all have a playbook on the show one of
[6:26:28.780 --> 6:26:32.700]  my one of my friends from I think was the Arlington Institute but the guy I
[6:26:32.700 --> 6:26:37.300]  had met years and years ago did some work for the Pentagon and he did a book
[6:26:37.300 --> 6:26:41.100]  called out of the blue and and one of the scenarios was one we're looking at
[6:26:41.100 --> 6:26:45.660]  right now and the government the Pentagon the government has a playbook on
[6:26:45.660 --> 6:26:49.420]  the shelf for exactly these scenarios playbook is off the shelf and now it's
[6:26:49.420 --> 6:26:56.060]  being engaged so when people talk about a conspiracy you can look at it that way
[6:26:56.060 --> 6:27:00.820]  others who did planning thought it was just planning you know but but it's
[6:27:00.820 --> 6:27:05.220]  implementation time and so no one misses the opportunities when these
[6:27:05.220 --> 6:27:10.820]  opportunities are so big and global when the bad guy sees opportunity he
[6:27:10.820 --> 6:27:15.100]  pounces you know and that's one of the things that we are totally aware of and
[6:27:15.100 --> 6:27:19.740]  input wars has been aware of so think about what's going on right now oil is
[6:27:19.740 --> 6:27:27.700]  way down transportation sector is in the toilet mining sector gold and silver
[6:27:27.700 --> 6:27:32.580]  drop precipitously today why because ETFs
[6:27:32.580 --> 6:27:38.260]  exchange traded funds margin calls what's happening right now is a whole bunch
[6:27:38.260 --> 6:27:44.140]  of implosions by these big funds and the big implosions are yet to come because
[6:27:44.140 --> 6:27:48.980]  those are derivatives and they may be unwinding we just haven't seen it yet but
[6:27:48.980 --> 6:27:54.500]  but keep this in mind derivatives were controlling 200 trillion with a T
[6:27:54.500 --> 6:28:00.100]  trillion dollars in global assets and they're all these weird gambling events
[6:28:00.100 --> 6:28:03.660]  you know that big guys have put together where they bet one part of the
[6:28:03.660 --> 6:28:09.140]  economy against the other but when they all come falling down and someone calls
[6:28:09.140 --> 6:28:16.420]  the bet the game is is in bad state and then falls faster so you might get some
[6:28:16.420 --> 6:28:21.460]  happy talk and something big infusions of cash because the big guy has a lot to
[6:28:21.460 --> 6:28:25.620]  lose and remember when you're poor and you fall you only have a little ways to
[6:28:25.620 --> 6:28:30.740]  go and you don't go splat but when you're high and mighty as they say and
[6:28:30.740 --> 6:28:34.980]  you're standing on the Empire State Building and you fall you go splat and
[6:28:34.980 --> 6:28:40.180]  so Americans we're not going splat hang in there don't succumb to fear we'll be

[6:29:53.740 --> 6:29:58.700]  look in January 2016 I went in a hospital I went to VA hospital out here
[6:29:58.700 --> 6:30:02.460]  in Boyce and I was in there until June and I kept hearing doctor group and all
[6:30:02.460 --> 6:30:06.060]  you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man I had an
[6:30:06.060 --> 6:30:10.860]  internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years and
[6:30:10.860 --> 6:30:14.980]  the doctors they tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and then

[6:31:40.140 --> 6:31:45.500]  the platforming as off the air no we have our own platform info wars info
[6:31:45.500 --> 6:31:51.140]  wars info wars. Rich in Alabama Rich thanks for calling. Hey Mr. Jones
[6:31:51.140 --> 6:31:56.100]  appreciate it first thing I love the turbo force I drive truck for a living
[6:31:56.100 --> 6:32:01.260]  and it's amazing coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end but
[6:32:01.260 --> 6:32:06.060]  that turbo force is amazing. How is turbo force different than coffee? I'll tell
[6:32:06.060 --> 6:32:12.300]  you what it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours I don't feel the jitters like I
[6:32:12.300 --> 6:32:16.540]  do drink and coffee and it's just you know at the end of the day I don't need
[6:32:16.540 --> 6:32:22.140]  anything to go to bed I'll you know knock out them I'm out cold. Well that's
[6:32:22.140 --> 6:32:25.500]  what we went out to a top developer who did want his name on it and I said what
[6:32:25.500 --> 6:32:30.660]  would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible that's good
[6:32:30.660 --> 6:32:34.020]  and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are
[6:32:34.020 --> 6:32:37.660]  healthy and natural that are time-released and there's more money in it than
[6:32:37.660 --> 6:32:42.140]  anybody else puts in their product so that's why turbo force has such a great
[6:32:42.140 --> 6:32:47.260]  effect and so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[6:32:50.580 --> 6:32:56.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[6:33:02.820 --> 6:33:11.540]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your
[6:33:11.540 --> 6:33:20.100]  host Nick Baggage. Several decisive new actions were taken in our very vigilant
[6:33:20.100 --> 6:33:28.940]  effort to combat and ultimately defeat the corona virus. We've been working
[6:33:28.940 --> 6:33:33.980]  very hard on this we've made tremendous progress when you compare what we've done
[6:33:33.980 --> 6:33:40.180]  to other areas of the world it's it's pretty incredible a lot of that had to
[6:33:40.180 --> 6:33:47.580]  do with the early designation and the closing of the borders then as you know
[6:33:47.580 --> 6:33:54.140]  Europe was just designated as the hotspot right now and we closed that
[6:33:54.140 --> 6:34:00.300]  border a while ago so that was lucky or through talent or through luck call it
[6:34:00.300 --> 6:34:05.460]  whatever you want but through a very collective action and shared sacrifice
[6:34:05.460 --> 6:34:11.740]  national determination we will overcome the threat of the virus. I also announced
[6:34:11.740 --> 6:34:16.820]  Wednesday night following the advice of our medical professionals who are doing
[6:34:16.820 --> 6:34:21.300]  a tremendous job and we appreciate it very much that we're suspending the
[6:34:21.300 --> 6:34:26.980]  entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last 14 days from
[6:34:26.980 --> 6:34:33.180]  entering the United States. Citizens, permanent residents and our families any
[6:34:33.180 --> 6:34:37.460]  of the families returning from Europe will be subject to extra screening as
[6:34:37.460 --> 6:34:42.980]  well as self-isolation for a period of 14 days as the World Health Organization
[6:34:42.980 --> 6:34:51.740]  confirmed today many of the things at what we said were 100% correct including
[6:34:51.740 --> 6:34:59.340]  our designation before them of Europe like our earlier very aggressive actions
[6:34:59.340 --> 6:35:05.460]  with China this measure will save countless lives. I appreciate a number
[6:35:05.460 --> 6:35:10.300]  of the folks behind me a lot number of the people behind me said that that
[6:35:10.300 --> 6:35:15.460]  saved a lot of lives at early designation but it is only the beginning of what
[6:35:15.460 --> 6:35:20.820]  we're really doing and now we're in a different phase we had some very old and
[6:35:20.820 --> 6:35:26.100]  obsolete rules that we had to live with it worked under certain circumstances but
[6:35:26.100 --> 6:35:30.180]  not under mass circumstances they were there for a long time they were in
[6:35:30.180 --> 6:35:33.620]  place for a long time and we're breaking them down now and they're very
[6:35:33.620 --> 6:35:38.700]  usable for certain instances but not for this to unleash the full power of the
[6:35:38.700 --> 6:35:41.860]  federal government that this effort today I am officially declaring a
[6:35:41.860 --> 6:35:49.700]  national emergency two very big words the action I am taking will open up
[6:35:49.700 --> 6:35:57.260]  access to up to 50 billion dollars of very importantly very important and a
[6:35:57.260 --> 6:36:01.940]  large amount of money for states and territories and localities and our
[6:36:01.940 --> 6:36:07.500]  shared fight against this disease in furtherance of the order emerging every
[6:36:07.500 --> 6:36:11.300]  state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately you're
[6:36:11.300 --> 6:36:15.140]  going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest
[6:36:15.140 --> 6:36:20.900]  retailers and medical companies in the world they're standing right behind me
[6:36:20.900 --> 6:36:24.780]  and that side of me I'm also asking every hospital in this country to
[6:36:24.780 --> 6:36:29.300]  activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of
[6:36:29.300 --> 6:36:35.180]  Americans everywhere the hospitals are very engaged New York and various other
[6:36:35.180 --> 6:36:39.940]  places are also various engage I just spoke with Governor Cuomo we had a very
[6:36:39.940 --> 6:36:45.100]  good conversation and we're working very strongly with many states and
[6:36:45.100 --> 6:36:50.900]  including New York the emergency orders I'm issuing today will also confer
[6:36:50.900 --> 6:36:55.740]  broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the
[6:36:55.740 --> 6:36:59.660]  Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately waive provisions of
[6:36:59.660 --> 6:37:06.180]  applicable laws and regulations to give doctors hospital all hospitals and
[6:37:06.180 --> 6:37:12.580]  healthcare providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for
[6:37:12.580 --> 6:37:17.300]  patients this includes the following critical authorities the ability to
[6:37:17.300 --> 6:37:26.980]  waive laws to enable telehealth a fairly new and incredible thing that's
[6:37:26.980 --> 6:37:33.260]  happened in the in the not so distant past I tell you what they've done with
[6:37:33.260 --> 6:37:38.620]  telehealth is incredible it gives the remote doctors visits and hospital
[6:37:38.620 --> 6:37:44.860]  check-ins the power to waive certain federal license rate requirements so
[6:37:44.860 --> 6:37:48.300]  that doctors from other states can provide services in states with the
[6:37:48.300 --> 6:37:54.260]  greatest need number two the ability to waive requirements that critical access
[6:37:54.260 --> 6:38:02.300]  hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours the
[6:38:02.300 --> 6:38:06.300]  ability to waive the requirements of a three-day hospital stay prior to
[6:38:06.300 --> 6:38:12.060]  admission to a nursing home big thing the authority to waive rules to hinder
[6:38:12.060 --> 6:38:16.540]  hospitals ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed
[6:38:16.540 --> 6:38:21.940]  office space they can do as they want they can do what they have to do they
[6:38:21.940 --> 6:38:28.020]  know what they have to do now they don't have any problem getting it done the
[6:38:28.020 --> 6:38:33.020]  authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for
[6:38:33.020 --> 6:38:37.500]  patients within the hospital itself ensuring that the emergency capacity
[6:38:37.500 --> 6:38:43.260]  can be quickly established will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to
[6:38:43.260 --> 6:38:49.900]  deliver our people the care that they need and that they're entitled to no
[6:38:49.900 --> 6:38:54.860]  resource will be spared nothing whatsoever ten days ago I brought together
[6:38:54.860 --> 6:38:59.700]  the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to
[6:38:59.700 --> 6:39:03.900]  immediately begin working on a solution to dramatically increase the
[6:39:03.900 --> 6:39:10.900]  availability of tests other countries have called us and worked with us and
[6:39:10.900 --> 6:39:16.180]  they're doing similar things or will be doing similar things as a result of that
[6:39:16.180 --> 6:39:21.100]  action today we're announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly
[6:39:21.100 --> 6:39:26.980]  increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus we want to make
[6:39:26.980 --> 6:39:32.020]  sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely quickly and
[6:39:32.020 --> 6:39:38.380]  conveniently but we don't want people to take a test if if we feel that they
[6:39:38.380 --> 6:39:42.820]  shouldn't be doing it and we don't want everyone running out and taking only if
[6:39:42.820 --> 6:39:49.020]  you have certain symptoms using federal emergency authorities the FDA
[6:39:49.020 --> 6:39:54.020]  approved a new test for the virus we did this within hours after receiving the
[6:39:54.020 --> 6:39:59.900]  application from Roche a process that would normally take weeks we therefore
[6:39:59.900 --> 6:40:04.940]  expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next
[6:40:04.940 --> 6:40:10.580]  week we'll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night I want to thank
[6:40:10.580 --> 6:40:14.260]  Roche great company for their incredible work I'd also like to thank
[6:40:14.260 --> 6:40:19.340]  Thermo Fisher the FDA's goal is to hopefully authorize the application
[6:40:19.340 --> 6:40:25.100]  within 24 hours it'll go very quickly it's going very quickly which will bring
[6:40:25.100 --> 6:40:32.140]  additionally 1.4 million tests on board next week and five million within a
[6:40:32.140 --> 6:40:36.260]  month I doubt we'll need anywhere near that at the same time we've been in
[6:40:36.260 --> 6:40:41.500]  discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests
[6:40:41.500 --> 6:40:46.220]  available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals
[6:40:46.220 --> 6:40:54.140]  the goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having
[6:40:54.140 --> 6:40:59.660]  to leave your car I want to thank Google Google is helping to develop a website
[6:40:59.660 --> 6:41:07.460]  it's going to be very quickly done unlike websites of the past to determine
[6:41:07.460 --> 6:41:12.260]  whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient
[6:41:12.260 --> 6:41:17.380]  location we have many many locations behind us by the way we cover the this
[6:41:17.380 --> 6:41:20.180]  country in large parts of the world by the way we're not going to be talking
[6:41:20.180 --> 6:41:27.620]  about the world right now but we cover very very strongly our country stores in
[6:41:27.620 --> 6:41:34.820]  virtually every location Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now
[6:41:34.820 --> 6:41:39.660]  they've made tremendous progress our overriding goal is to stop the spread of
[6:41:39.660 --> 6:41:44.820]  the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this again we don't
[6:41:44.820 --> 6:41:49.780]  want everybody taking this test it's totally unnecessary and this is why
[6:41:49.780 --> 6:41:58.460]  house and here we are going into the weekend President's Trump's message
[6:41:58.460 --> 6:42:05.580]  finally we're hearing sort of where this is going under a national emergency I
[6:42:05.580 --> 6:42:12.460]  want to say remember as this thing sort of unfolds the emotional experience of
[6:42:12.460 --> 6:42:17.380]  being in it is going to be much different than thinking about it as we are
[6:42:17.380 --> 6:42:23.540]  right now watching the news unfold on this Friday afternoon across the country

[6:45:53.980 --> 6:45:58.580]  your checklist to have done but for me it just is a bummer to know that
[6:45:58.580 --> 6:46:02.260]  everybody needs food and I had long discussions this morning over an hour
[6:46:02.260 --> 6:46:05.020]  long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this
[6:46:05.020 --> 6:46:08.740]  right now the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want
[6:46:08.740 --> 6:46:12.020]  me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed but
[6:46:12.020 --> 6:46:16.540]  understand the last food company the biggest food company is now at hundreds
[6:46:16.540 --> 6:46:20.060]  of times their regular order and they were having discussions with me about
[6:46:20.060 --> 6:46:23.900]  stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just
[6:46:23.900 --> 6:46:27.260]  saying we're done because people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks we
[6:46:27.260 --> 6:46:30.500]  don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that
[6:46:30.500 --> 6:46:33.620]  comes with that because we're honest under promise over delivered but
[6:46:33.620 --> 6:46:36.580]  technically it's gonna be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal
[6:46:36.580 --> 6:46:40.220]  and feel like we took care of you so you come back again we want relationships

[6:46:47.020 --> 6:46:49.220]  together
[6:46:49.900 --> 6:46:55.460]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[6:46:55.460 --> 6:47:23.180]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show and welcome back and you know again on
[6:47:23.180 --> 6:47:28.900]  this pretty crazy weekend coming up you know there's gonna be a lot going on
[6:47:28.900 --> 6:47:36.460]  declaration of emergency is just taking place by President Trump people seem to
[6:47:36.460 --> 6:47:40.020]  be reacting well to that that's good but again I want to remind people the
[6:47:40.020 --> 6:47:45.020]  emotional impact is still not completely here it'll hit us when things start
[6:47:45.020 --> 6:47:49.940]  really happening that you can't miss that are visually in your in your face
[6:47:49.940 --> 6:47:54.700]  and you'll start to see more of that again you know talking about fear we
[6:47:54.700 --> 6:48:00.260]  talked a little bit about that before I talk about it a lot on this program and
[6:48:00.260 --> 6:48:06.020]  my view of that is is stay calm yeah recognize fear is what wakes us up so we
[6:48:06.020 --> 6:48:09.700]  pay attention but now that we're paying attention let's be deliberate about it
[6:48:09.700 --> 6:48:14.460]  what happens to the brain in fear is you show incoherent brand brain patterns
[6:48:14.460 --> 6:48:19.980]  not those associated with higher-ordered thinking or those things that are
[6:48:19.980 --> 6:48:23.780]  associated with the gifts of the spirit you know actually your brain activity
[6:48:23.780 --> 6:48:29.420]  and fear and God don't mix you know in the same way that's why when the angel
[6:48:29.420 --> 6:48:34.340]  arrives he always announces fear not you know that's the first words out of the
[6:48:34.340 --> 6:48:38.980]  mouth because they want your brain in neutral where you can hear still before
[6:48:38.980 --> 6:48:44.580]  you jump into the flight or fight response to vigorously so go there because
[6:48:44.580 --> 6:48:48.740]  now we're awake now that we're awake pay attention to everything that's
[6:48:48.740 --> 6:48:54.060]  happening around you and try and stay calm and and do is do what you can you
[6:48:54.060 --> 6:49:00.180]  know be as prepared as you can this is a great country the United States only by
[6:49:00.180 --> 6:49:05.380]  virtue of the people that here live here and that are here which are in fact I
[6:49:05.380 --> 6:49:09.620]  want to remind everyone we are the government you know by the people for
[6:49:09.620 --> 6:49:13.460]  the people of the people if we remember that and remember our humanity and all
[6:49:13.460 --> 6:49:19.620]  of this Americans tend to rise to our best I'm at the worst times in the
[6:49:19.620 --> 6:49:25.180]  world's history we always do this won't be any exception I don't believe that I
[6:49:25.180 --> 6:49:30.780]  think that that's just who we are what we are and I hope we rise to that again I
[6:49:30.780 --> 6:49:36.340]  hope we demonstrate to ourselves and the world that we are that people that that
[6:49:36.340 --> 6:49:42.100]  light in the world of darkness when we can be because I believe that is the
[6:49:42.100 --> 6:49:46.740]  answer for that to be that light is the answer and that requires us to be
[6:49:46.740 --> 6:49:52.020]  courageous and strong at times when others are quaking in fear we don't need
[6:49:52.020 --> 6:49:58.140]  to be those recognize these are scary times for sure we're gonna oscillate in
[6:49:58.140 --> 6:50:00.820]  and out of that depending on where we are and what we're individually
[6:50:00.820 --> 6:50:06.660]  experiencing but we are not alone in any of it and this is a short stop between
[6:50:06.660 --> 6:50:13.660]  interviews you know with the maker you know it's like hey we're not we're all
[6:50:13.660 --> 6:50:18.140]  in this together no one's getting out alive that's the nature of living and
[6:50:18.140 --> 6:50:23.580]  humanity in general nothing's changed really in that regard you know the
[6:50:23.580 --> 6:50:29.460]  emergency is at our door this time if we lived in Mumbai or Beijing or a lot of
[6:50:29.460 --> 6:50:33.180]  third-world places in the world you know it kind of happened a long time ago and
[6:50:33.180 --> 6:50:37.700]  you've been experiencing it every day but it's happening here and now and so it's
[6:50:37.700 --> 6:50:42.980]  in our face and I still say remain calm there's other things going on that you
[6:50:42.980 --> 6:50:46.820]  want to pay attention to you know there's things going on in the Middle East
[6:50:46.820 --> 6:50:50.980]  things going on in the currency world that people haven't talked much about
[6:50:50.980 --> 6:50:57.020]  the Brazilian currency is down almost 20% already ratcheting down before this
[6:50:57.020 --> 6:51:02.940]  really got in full here the Russian ruble dropped 8% at one point and then
[6:51:02.940 --> 6:51:08.780]  bounced back a couple percent in in the same day you know these are big moves
[6:51:08.780 --> 6:51:14.220]  that normally don't happen so I would say there's big powers at play and
[6:51:14.220 --> 6:51:20.100]  there's a lot of things being unhinged right now the Australian dollar just
[6:51:20.100 --> 6:51:23.820]  tanked you know if you look at what's going on there and they just fuel their
[6:51:23.820 --> 6:51:29.220]  markets with lubrication and cash in Japan just fuel their mark lubrication
[6:51:29.220 --> 6:51:32.740]  and cash and everybody's running around going oh no what do we hold do we hold
[6:51:32.740 --> 6:51:37.380]  dollars do we hold yen do we hold gold gold crash silver crashed horribly this
[6:51:37.380 --> 6:51:42.540]  week silver down you know like a big chunk 30% totally counterintuitive right
[6:51:42.540 --> 6:51:47.220]  when markets crash metals go up not if they're paper metals which is most of
[6:51:47.220 --> 6:51:51.820]  the markets lately if anybody was paying attention you know it was exchange
[6:51:51.820 --> 6:51:57.340]  traded funds ETFs these are being unhinged by margin calls people have to
[6:51:57.340 --> 6:52:05.260]  cough up money you know they're choking on their debt and here we are folks we
[6:52:05.260 --> 6:52:10.720]  are on a really rough ride at the moment this is what's going on that's the
[6:52:10.720 --> 6:52:15.020]  reality of it and it's gonna be bumpy for a while and I agree with Mike Adams in
[6:52:15.020 --> 6:52:19.660]  the last hour on the other end of this this will escalate right back out of
[6:52:19.660 --> 6:52:23.860]  this because there's a lot of money parked at the sidelines now let's just
[6:52:23.860 --> 6:52:28.340]  see how far it goes I'm not optimistic in the short run I think we got a couple
[6:52:28.340 --> 6:52:32.180]  rough quarters and then we see how it all shakes down and what happens to
[6:52:32.180 --> 6:52:37.460]  derivatives and hedge funds and the big ones that when they start coming into
[6:52:37.460 --> 6:52:41.780]  whatever's going on right now we'll see the big effect and maybe we haven't seen
[6:52:41.780 --> 6:52:47.780]  that completely yet but don't lose heart because these things pass yeah
[6:52:47.780 --> 6:52:52.060]  things were already there was a giant bubble everybody knew it everybody was
[6:52:52.060 --> 6:52:57.260]  aware of it in the economic circles this gives cover to those guys don't let
[6:52:57.260 --> 6:53:01.180]  them off the hook you know know what know what's behind the economic side of
[6:53:01.180 --> 6:53:05.420]  the equation but let's talk about the future also you know people are working
[6:53:05.420 --> 6:53:10.100]  at home people are going to school at home people are going to college at home
[6:53:10.100 --> 6:53:15.620]  and they're setting up systems to do this on the internet which in one sense is
[6:53:15.620 --> 6:53:20.740]  like hey maybe this changes the economy economies of scale on and how people
[6:53:20.740 --> 6:53:24.020]  function in the future I think it'll have lasting effect I think some
[6:53:24.020 --> 6:53:29.300]  companies will say hey it's cost effective to reduce office space and keep
[6:53:29.300 --> 6:53:34.620]  people at home it saves money to do it this way companies that were unwilling
[6:53:34.620 --> 6:53:38.940]  to try it or trying it out a necessity now may find it works and in the long
[6:53:38.940 --> 6:53:42.740]  run this changes the way maybe education gets delivered so more people can
[6:53:42.740 --> 6:53:47.780]  access it for less money less cost is way less costly and the same for
[6:53:47.780 --> 6:53:51.380]  employment maybe they can push more into payroll and less into building if
[6:53:51.380 --> 6:53:54.980]  people working out of their homes and shuffle the deck around this could have
[6:53:54.980 --> 6:54:01.020]  huge and will have huge structural changes and what comes after this after
[6:54:01.020 --> 6:54:05.340]  the supply chain interruptions of people sort of reassess what globalism really
[6:54:05.340 --> 6:54:11.060]  looks like because right now everyone's getting a bad taste if you're the average
[6:54:11.060 --> 6:54:17.460]  guy because globalism is working against you and now if you haven't seen it you
[6:54:17.460 --> 6:54:22.500]  certainly can feel it now as supply chains get interrupted and the sovereignty
[6:54:22.500 --> 6:54:26.380]  of food supplies and food sovereignty for a lot of parts of the world are in
[6:54:26.380 --> 6:54:31.500]  jeopardy the foundations of independence which is about food production and the
[6:54:31.500 --> 6:54:35.660]  things that are necessary for modern society in a modern culture these are
[6:54:35.660 --> 6:54:40.340]  the things that we should all be reassessing right now as we move into
[6:54:40.340 --> 6:54:44.820]  this thing but also knowing that we're going to come out of it so if you're not
[6:54:44.820 --> 6:54:50.180]  panicked and you look around think back to 208 what happened think back to
[6:54:50.180 --> 6:54:54.900]  1987 if you were around long enough to what happened and then what happened on
[6:54:54.900 --> 6:54:58.660]  the other side of these things as we come out of it it may be in this one may
[6:54:58.660 --> 6:55:02.740]  dangle for a you know years it could dangle because of what has happened in
[6:55:02.740 --> 6:55:06.540]  an eruption and who survives because people are going to get hurt people
[6:55:06.540 --> 6:55:10.700]  already hurt and there and that's the side of this that needs to be addressed
[6:55:10.700 --> 6:55:15.460]  because ultimately most Americans and most people in the world are one edge
[6:55:15.460 --> 6:55:21.500]  away from you know a paycheck away from being on the street you know I
[6:55:21.500 --> 6:55:27.940]  initiated here in Alaska with a friend of mine David David Cuddy an initiative
[6:55:27.940 --> 6:55:35.620]  intervention 2020.com check it out intervention 2020.com and it's related
[6:55:35.620 --> 6:55:39.740]  to the homelessness issue which I've covered on this broadcast and I agree
[6:55:39.740 --> 6:55:44.580]  with Mike Adams after this is over we may see a huge surge in that here in
[6:55:44.580 --> 6:55:48.500]  Alaska a lot of it is petty criminality and that's what we're kind of
[6:55:48.500 --> 6:55:54.100]  addressing with this initiative that we started a while back but you know the
[6:55:54.100 --> 6:55:59.500]  issue of homelessness on the west coast and you want to talk about this virus
[6:55:59.500 --> 6:56:04.820]  and the context of homelessness and this when these two meet you're going to see
[6:56:04.820 --> 6:56:10.860]  an explosion that is very difficult to contain of people that whose immune
[6:56:10.860 --> 6:56:15.820]  systems are already compromised by drug addiction alcoholism and some of the
[6:56:15.820 --> 6:56:22.140]  problems that face homeless populations as it is and so when you see all of this
[6:56:22.140 --> 6:56:29.100]  now in motion it's going to be a lot more extreme what happens so intervention.com
[6:56:29.100 --> 6:56:34.260]  intervention 2020.com we set up to begin to talk about at least a local solution
[6:56:34.260 --> 6:56:38.820]  because this is something that isn't going away we're going to see more of
[6:56:38.820 --> 6:56:45.180]  this we have a lot of suffering in the country already we have more coming
[6:56:45.180 --> 6:56:51.220]  unfortunately and despite the happy talk the emotional component of this will
[6:56:51.220 --> 6:56:57.300]  set in stay as calm as you can yes accept the fear that comes along the way
[6:56:57.300 --> 6:57:02.940]  and let it move us into action but not don't let us take us anywhere let us
[6:57:02.940 --> 6:57:09.340]  take ourselves let us be that tip of the spear let us be the light at the end of
[6:57:09.340 --> 6:57:14.340]  the tunnel and let the tunnel be a bright one because this is America after all
[6:57:14.340 --> 6:57:20.500]  we're not beaten down yet we're humanity we are the human race we are created in
[6:57:20.500 --> 6:57:25.420]  the image and likeness of God to do something on this planet now in this
[6:57:25.420 --> 6:57:30.660]  dark hour rise into what you are as a human being be that person that you were
[6:57:30.660 --> 6:57:34.740]  created to be make a change in your neighborhood your family and your world
[6:57:34.740 --> 6:57:39.700]  and do it now now is just here in the break I went and got a delicious cup a
[6:57:39.700 --> 6:57:43.500]  second cup of the day it's really strong I shouldn't do this because all work and
[6:57:43.500 --> 6:57:47.780]  no playmates Jack a really aggressive boy and the coffee has to wake up America
