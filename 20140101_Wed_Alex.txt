[00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:06.506]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.266]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.027]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:11.608]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:13.149]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:32.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:33.698]  Just like individual lives,
[00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.133]  Years have a life of their own.
[00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:48.799]  That's because the planet orbits around the Sun every 365 days, as you know, and generates the life on this planet.
[00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.322]  It's the main engine, the main energy source for life on this planet.
[00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:56.644]  And so one year has come and gone and died, literally died.
[00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:04.958]  And a new year has now begun in many time zones around the world 24 hours ago.
[00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.760]  And we are now into 2014.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.406]  Truly momentous year with all that is happening.
[00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:18.848]  It is the first day of January 2014.
[00:01:18.848 --> 00:01:27.535]  And we are hurtling into the battle, the fray, with the New World Order.
[00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:32.763]  And we're going to be here for, again, the next three hours.
[00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:41.508]  We have John Bowne, InfoWars Nightly News reporter, and also radio producer, joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:48.112]  Yesterday, he shot a report on 360 in Austin, and filed that report this morning.
[00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:50.794]  Shot on his iPhone 4, I believe.
[00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:58.676]  And it was a woman standing right beside her burning car on her cell phone, everyone driving by not even caring.
[00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:10.922]  And then even some people on YouTube, this went right to YouTube today, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are like, big deal, you know, the people didn't stop because the fire is no big deal.
[00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:18.946]  And of course, John didn't catch it right away because he's yelling at her before he even turns the camera on, get away from the car, because he had to park down the street and run towards her.
[00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:24.055]  And so he ran about 200 yards towards her, yelling, get away from the car.
[00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:26.598]  By the time he turns it on, you can see her about 10 feet away.
[00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:30.561]  And then she starts walking towards him about 50 feet as he meets her.
[00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:34.385]  And she's still on her phone, obviously calling the fire department.
[00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:40.832]  But the reason I mention this is not even our top story, it's just important, is it ties into this mindset.
[00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:53.337]  Where they're fracking with such corrupt practices across the United States that the well water is catching on fire.
[00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:56.019]  There's safe ways to frack, by the way.
[00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.444]  I've got family that have come and gone and passed that were petroleum geologists, you name it.
[00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:04.205]  People that work for refineries.
[00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:05.986]  There are very safe ways to do this.
[00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.729]  But when you have this modern age, an example is BP,
[00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:22.178]  And you have British Petroleum doing things like ordering three different engineering companies that were all on site at the Deepwater Horizon.
[00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:34.142]  Don't pour concrete and what they call mud, a mix, in as you drill so it doesn't back pressure and blow out and cause an undersea, you know, redditor type explosion.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.001]  Just dump water on top of it.
[00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:42.564]  That'll save us $15 million a day, I think was the number.
[00:03:42.564 --> 00:03:55.531]  And that was the head people in England calling the head people in Houston, and then they literally had to fire multiple heads of crews and send in other companies that were there as contractors to do it, because all the engineers said, this is going to explode.
[00:03:56.598 --> 00:03:59.359]  And the engineers knew the math, knew the science.
[00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.501]  It was one of the deepest wells ever drilled.
[00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.021]  30 plus thousand feet.
[00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:04.322]  They knew what was going to happen.
[00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:21.191]  But the delusional executives just knew they'd make more money if they didn't have to spend the money on the concrete and the mud that was being pre-mixed on the ground and then brought out to sea on big ships.
[00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.413]  And so they didn't want to have $15 million a day of that being dumped in the hole.
[00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.031]  Fifteen million dollars a day.
[00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:31.974]  All the transcripts of the radio chatter was recorded and logged.
[00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:33.255]  And they said, no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:34.195]  You're relieved.
[00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:34.595]  You do it.
[00:04:34.595 --> 00:04:36.056]  This is going to explode.
[00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:41.059]  They actually had fistfights that came out later in court on the drilling rig when people were ordered to do it.
[00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:42.240]  They're like, that's insane.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.823]  And people began to punch each other in the faces because they knew they were about to blow up the oil rig.
[00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:49.464]  And it killed a bunch of people, folks.
[00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:54.898]  Killed people on land, killed all those fish, all the rest of it.
[00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:57.648]  This is the mental illness out there, the insanity.
[00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:10.863]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:05:10.863 --> 00:05:12.924]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:05:12.924 --> 00:05:13.805]  Fluoride!
[00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:15.725]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:22.048]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:27.233]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:33.538]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:35.980]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.903]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:42.286]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:47.472]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:52.938]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:01.187]  The facts are in.
[00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:02.588]  The studies are legion.
[00:06:02.588 --> 00:06:10.113]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:06:10.113 --> 00:06:13.936]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:14.517]  Simple.
[00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:19.240]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.664]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:30.491]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:41.284]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.106]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:45.849]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.011]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:06.132]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:13.521]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.886]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:18.648]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:19.488]  We're good to go!
[00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:44.568]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:09.166]  2014.
[00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:18.433]  You can hear the sirens.
[00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:23.497]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:23.497 --> 00:08:25.419]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:33.085]  Globalists are gathering in their masses just like witches at black masses.
[00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:45.193]  They are sorcerers of death's construction.
[00:08:45.193 --> 00:08:47.294]  It's a good way to describe the New World Order.
[00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:48.014]  As the war machine keeps turning.
[00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:48.874]  Death and hatred to mankind.
[00:08:48.874 --> 00:08:49.054]  Poisoning.
[00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:13.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are transmitting worldwide.
[00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:16.597]  This is the first transmission that I've done in the new year.
[00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:19.659]  It is the first day of January 2014.
[00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:25.042]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.743]  Then, InfoWorks Nightly News tonight.
[00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:35.707]  Seven o'clock central, we have one of our reporters in here with breaking news on brain fog and zombiosis that we're seeing intensify across the public.
[00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:52.275]  People walking off the end of bridges into the ocean on their iPhones, people watching others be beaten until they're given concussions, teeth knocked out, broken ribs, no one helping them, police not helping them during racial attack, knockout games intensifying nationwide.
[00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:56.260]  Thanks to MSNBC Race War Promotion.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.965]  Just so many incredible stories that we're going to be breaking down.
[00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:08.217]  New, very important NSA developments where a new NSA document confirmed to be accurate leaked out in the Snowden cache.
[00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:19.435]  Shows the NSA with their training slides, their PowerPoint slides, calling the public zombies, making fun of everyone, and saying, really?
[00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:22.316]  Who didn't know that 1984 wouldn't come in 1984?
[00:10:22.316 --> 00:10:25.717]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:29.959]  NSA slides with images of the Apple computer ad.
[00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:33.341]  Making fun of everyone because we are the enemy.
[00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:43.127]  This is an open culture of naked tyranny in our faces, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:43.127 --> 00:10:50.691]  And again, I wanna thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide edition, the first day of the new year.
[00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.832]  John Bowne will be popping in at the bottom of the hour in studio.
[00:10:53.832 --> 00:10:55.473]  We're gonna hear his report.
[00:10:55.473 --> 00:11:03.557]  He shot on the streets yesterday where a woman's just standing literally one or two feet from a burning car on the side of the highway and no one is stopping to help her.
[00:11:03.557 --> 00:11:04.858]  No one is telling her get back.
[00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:12.082]  And by the time he got the camera out running up to her, she's about 10-15 feet away and walking towards him.
[00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:17.305]  But the point is, is that there are people on YouTube saying, hey, he shouldn't have stopped and helped her.
[00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:18.026]  She was fine.
[00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:26.391]  It's okay to stand by a burning car that later completely was engulfed in flames and that John Bowne has video of from about 200 yards away.
[00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:30.953]  And cars are driving right by the burning car before the fire department got there like they didn't care.
[00:11:30.953 --> 00:11:31.834]  And I know that stretch of 360.
[00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:38.145]  There's a fire department about a mile away from there.
[00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:39.686]  But it's rush hour traffic.
[00:11:39.686 --> 00:11:45.029]  People run about 30 miles an hour on a normally 65 mile an hour road, just driving right by a burning car.
[00:11:45.029 --> 00:11:47.470]  I mean, I see a burning car up ahead.
[00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.791]  I'm going to get on the shoulder.
[00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:53.953]  I'm gonna even drive across the shoulder, go the other way, especially I got my kids with me.
[00:11:53.953 --> 00:11:57.395]  Because you see one that's already got flame coming out of the bottom of it and smoke everywhere.
[00:11:57.395 --> 00:11:59.316]  It's going to blow up when those gas tanks boil.
[00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:05.802]  And again, this feeds into everything we're talking about, about this nation of spectators.
[00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:10.325]  And you see this in other authoritarian countries like China, where people will not render aid.
[00:12:10.325 --> 00:12:19.652]  I was a case, it must have been 10 years ago now, where an Austin cop got hit by a car at the corner of a four-way stop with his car sitting there.
[00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:21.573]  He'd gotten out, somebody had run into him.
[00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:25.456]  It was like 45 minutes until anyone even called the police, and he later died.
[00:12:26.442 --> 00:12:35.349]  I mean, if I see a cop, an old lady, a black guy, a white guy, I don't care who you are, you know, run over in the side of the road, I'm going to pull over and help you.
[00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:37.590]  And it's not because I'm some hero, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.411]  It's normal.
[00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:39.512]  I want you to help me.
[00:12:39.512 --> 00:12:43.835]  And this is the spirit of tyranny we're dealing with.
[00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:47.297]  Just absolutely apathetic, don't care, don't care if...
[00:12:50.185 --> 00:12:52.586]  Fukushima is belching out radiation.
[00:12:52.586 --> 00:12:55.407]  Don't care if 90 plus percent of the reactors in the U.S.
[00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:56.627]  are leaking.
[00:12:56.627 --> 00:13:11.952]  Don't care if fracking's being done so sloppily all over the country that water out of the local tap, out of the local water facility, but also out of the wells is catching on fire.
[00:13:13.607 --> 00:13:18.550]  It just goes on and on and on how people don't care anymore.
[00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.012]  That's what comes with evil.
[00:13:21.012 --> 00:13:21.912]  Ah, those aren't babies.
[00:13:21.912 --> 00:13:23.913]  Kill 52 million of them and abortion.
[00:13:23.913 --> 00:13:25.194]  Ah, those aren't humans in Iraq.
[00:13:25.194 --> 00:13:29.037]  Kill a million of them with a fake war and cutting off their food and medicine.
[00:13:29.037 --> 00:13:30.097]  Oh, you know, whatever.
[00:13:30.097 --> 00:13:31.278]  Assad's a piece of garbage.
[00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.219]  Let Al-Qaeda blow up all the churches.
[00:13:33.219 --> 00:13:33.679]  I don't care.
[00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.521]  I care about me.
[00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:39.443]  And these fools think that when you only care about yourself and, ah, let that lady's car burn.
[00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:40.664]  Let her stand right next to the car.
[00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:49.155]  Those people cared so little about her, they were delusional and were driving right by it, slowing down to like 5 miles an hour from 30 miles an hour.
[00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:52.197]  There's video of this, looking at the burning car.
[00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:53.799]  A foot from it.
[00:13:53.799 --> 00:14:03.667]  You're a foot from a car, in your car, and you drive up and oh look at the, with black smoke you're breathing, oh look at the, look at the black smoke, let me drive, let me drive right by that.
[00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:06.409]  And there's a woman standing
[00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:09.455]  A foot and a half, two feet from it.
[00:14:09.455 --> 00:14:11.676]  And the car later blows up and there's pieces everywhere.
[00:14:11.676 --> 00:14:13.857]  And then people on YouTube think we're weird!
[00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:18.160]  There's like a 20% negative vote on it.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.042]  That's... We usually have 97% support.
[00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:30.506]  Because the idea of having a brain is now illegal.
[00:14:30.506 --> 00:14:33.728]  You try to warn people about all this stuff.
[00:14:37.318 --> 00:14:45.024]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:14:45.024 --> 00:14:51.069]  Because they think, those of us that are warning everybody that the ship's already gone into an iceberg, that we made the ship hit the iceberg.
[00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:55.232]  So if they deny that we've hit an iceberg, we magically then will all be okay.
[00:14:55.232 --> 00:14:58.895]  But we've already hit the iceberg politically, socially, culturally.
[00:14:58.895 --> 00:14:59.956]  I'll tell you what's wrong with people.
[00:15:01.727 --> 00:15:24.313]  They are a nation of mega-spectators, a world of spectators, literally plugged in through their optic nerves and via audio as well, into the false reality proto-matrix system of television, movies, HD, 3D, all of it.
[00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:43.524]  And then the entire system is weaponized and layered with different systems of propaganda, programming, overt, covert, messages, subliminal, on record, hammering the general public's minds.
[00:15:43.524 --> 00:15:48.546]  And we are living in an incredible dystopic science fiction movie.
[00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:51.046]  That's what's going on.
[00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:52.887]  The culture's been weaponized.
[00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.788]  The media's been weaponized.
[00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.649]  The schools have been weaponized.
[00:15:56.649 --> 00:15:59.010]  The police have been militarized.
[00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.371]  The entire culture is turning in on itself.
[00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:04.832]  And the globalists know how evil nature works.
[00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:06.193]  They're evil themselves, but they are.
[00:16:06.713 --> 00:16:26.939]  Programming the types of decadent evil they want into people show that they will not stand up for themselves or anybody else as we are reclamated, as we are spiked, as we are removed, as we are decimated, as we are dumbed down, as we are literally turned into soylent green.
[00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:29.560]  You know they're passing laws in Europe and trying to pass them in
[00:16:30.976 --> 00:16:48.783]  States like Florida, where you cannot be cremated because of the carbon it puts out and you cannot be buried because that takes up land use, you have to be dissolved in acid that is then turned into fertilizer and put on crops to produce corn that is fed to cows.
[00:16:48.783 --> 00:16:52.525]  Now just so you know, that is Soylent Green.
[00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:54.746]  One hundred and ten percent.
[00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:04.778]  And the guys just found a CNBC article showing that.
[00:17:04.778 --> 00:17:07.120]  So, this is what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.703]  We are going into a silent green situation.
[00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:11.485]  And I get some areas are overpopulated.
[00:17:11.485 --> 00:17:13.306]  I get there's a lot of toxic industries.
[00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:13.567]  I get it.
[00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:16.129]  But the globalists are blocking all the new clean systems.
[00:17:16.129 --> 00:17:18.091]  And they decided not to build a better world.
[00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:19.192]  That's hard to do.
[00:17:19.192 --> 00:17:22.616]  It's easier just to help screw everything up so at least you're in control of it.
[00:17:23.905 --> 00:17:32.754]  They're directing all the sins and all the degeneracies and all the corruptions and all the mental illnesses into directed
[00:17:34.582 --> 00:17:47.173]  Human streams of evil, just like you fire fire hoses at mountainsides to then pan for gold or other extractions, other aggregates, other alluvials that you want.
[00:17:47.173 --> 00:18:01.105]  And that's where they're just using the harnessed evil of the worldwide beast system, all the corruption, all the wickedness, focused like a laser beam, like a particle beam against humanity.
[00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:17.441]  And that's right, they've now released new NSA documents admitting that of course Steve Jobs and Apple and Al Gore were with the NSA from the beginning.
[00:18:17.441 --> 00:18:19.382]  And of course they called their users zombies.
[00:18:19.382 --> 00:18:22.083]  I mean, what do you think the head of Facebook calls his users?
[00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:23.264]  Dumb F'ers.
[00:18:23.264 --> 00:18:31.947]  He goes, our users trust us in the meeting and he said they're all a bunch of dumb F'ers and then started laughing.
[00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:34.048]  And that's who these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:35.515 --> 00:18:45.288]  I got taken to a party by a rock star during a private party.
[00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:48.653]  They had the whole floor area of a hotel.
[00:18:51.081 --> 00:19:01.304]  And there were high-level executives there, and I'm not going to say anything about it because I was told, obviously, yeah, I know you're seeing this, it took you to see it, but, you know, don't say anything about specifically who they were.
[00:19:01.304 --> 00:19:02.985]  I'll just do it vague.
[00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:16.270]  And they all knew who I was, and they were all just animated, hopping around on power trips, literally just laughing at everyone.
[00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.790]  Even laughing at the people that were there.
[00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.291]  I mean, it is just, these people are horrible.
[00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:23.306]  But I'm going to tell you something, folks.
[00:19:23.306 --> 00:19:25.467]  You're the folks who will stand next to a burning car.
[00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:26.968]  I'm talking to mainstream people.
[00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:32.291]  You're the people who think I'm a weirdo because I'm upset and my listeners are upset.
[00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:32.592]  Now, it's 2014.
[00:19:32.592 --> 00:19:39.395]  We've got huge news on 40,000 new laws, pedophilia being promoted in the U.S.
[00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:39.736]  and Italy.
[00:19:40.802 --> 00:19:43.063]  Transgender kindergartners allowed to pick bathrooms.
[00:19:43.063 --> 00:19:45.063]  That's so they can sexualize the kids.
[00:19:45.063 --> 00:19:45.863]  That's coming up.
[00:19:45.863 --> 00:19:47.464]  That's on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:19:47.464 --> 00:19:52.245]  Also on DrudgeReport.com, the top story in the middle column, nuke fear.
[00:19:52.245 --> 00:19:57.127]  Feds order 14 million dosages of potassium iodide.
[00:19:57.127 --> 00:20:01.328]  And we're going to tell you what that's about coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:01.648 --> 00:20:03.050]  The studies are legion.
[00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:10.577]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:14.400]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:14.981]  Simple.
[00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:19.325]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:25.390]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:41.744]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.

[00:20:43.706 --> 00:20:46.307]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.

[00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:04.036]  They sure better cry.
[00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:07.678]  You're at least gonna pout and I'm telling you why.
[00:21:07.678 --> 00:21:10.119]  Privacy is leaving.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.422]  Is your cell phone being used to build a profile on you?

[00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:28.409]  They're gonna make up who's been naughty or nice.
[00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:31.151]  The problem is real and so is the solution.

[00:22:00.434 --> 00:22:01.736]  There's a reason why the U.S.
[00:22:01.736 --> 00:22:05.501]  government is conducting emergency drills simulating the collapse of the U.S.
[00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:06.442]  electrical grid.
[00:22:06.442 --> 00:22:07.744]  Northeast corridor offline.
[00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:09.747]  They're getting prepared.
[00:22:09.747 --> 00:22:12.250]  Will you be prepared when it shuts down?
[00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.092]  A massive power outage.
[00:22:14.092 --> 00:22:15.494]  The cyber Pearl Harbor.
[00:22:15.494 --> 00:22:18.097]  The evacuation procedures are working.

[00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:21.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:24:28.987 --> 00:24:32.949]  Wednesday, January 1st, 2014.
[00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:34.290]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:47.156]  Now, coming up for 40 minutes in the third hour, we're going to look at the state of nuclear reactors here in the U.S., but also in Europe, Japan, you name it, the latest developments on Fukushima.
[00:24:47.856 --> 00:24:51.999]  Where they are trying to clean up the site and it's actually generating more radiation.
[00:24:51.999 --> 00:24:57.463]  But there's an article up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:24:57.463 --> 00:25:08.132]  Right in the middle column, top story in the middle column, Nucfear feds order 14 million dosages of potassium iodide.
[00:25:08.905 --> 00:25:08.965]  Yes.
[00:25:26.748 --> 00:25:31.394]  And they're not saying why, but we're going to be talking about that in more detail.
[00:25:31.394 --> 00:25:35.158]  But Watson, in his article, goes over the history.
[00:25:35.158 --> 00:25:40.064]  The funny thing is, Gucciardi was already writing an article about this this morning without even talking to Watson.
[00:25:40.064 --> 00:25:44.609]  It shows how we're on the same page and how we follow the FedBiz site about FEMA camps.
[00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:55.273]  Where they're hiring guards for re-education centers, who know how to process social security numbers, and daycare centers in the FEMA camps where they keep your kids.
[00:25:55.273 --> 00:25:56.174]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:25:56.174 --> 00:26:01.436]  The billions of bullets, the drones, all the stuff that isn't even classified.
[00:26:01.436 --> 00:26:04.957]  Millions of dollars for paper targets of children where they train to shoot kids.
[00:26:04.957 --> 00:26:06.177]  We find it all right here.
[00:26:06.177 --> 00:26:08.238]  Can you imagine what's classified?
[00:26:08.953 --> 00:26:19.263]  And then they just have MSNBC come out and go, there's no FEMA camp, there's no internment camp, there's no army training manuals for re-education centers.
[00:26:19.263 --> 00:26:24.548]  Even though we can find it all at the fedbizops.gov.
[00:26:24.548 --> 00:26:26.811]  Because they're supposed to have free open bidding process.
[00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:33.017]  The truth is, most of it's totally rigged, but at least that part of the law makes it where you can see what the public bids are.
[00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:43.449]  Including on classified projects, they'll just have the declassified part, but just off that, we can then go ferret around and find stuff out.
[00:26:43.449 --> 00:26:59.715]  That's how we already surmised in the last year, while we couldn't buy AK-47 ammo, 7.62, what, 3.9, all of it, was they were buying up all the other calibers so that we couldn't get them.
[00:26:59.715 --> 00:27:01.375]  Tens of millions of AK-47s, the semi-autos,
[00:27:04.704 --> 00:27:13.487]  I mean, per order, just millions and millions of rounds of every caliber you can imagine, every strange caliber that no one even uses.
[00:27:13.487 --> 00:27:18.788]  They're just putting in huge warehouses to drive up prices and to make it unavailable.
[00:27:18.788 --> 00:27:21.009]  They've shut down all the lead smelters in the U.S.
[00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:23.770]  The last one shut down this week.
[00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:28.651]  It shuts down, I guess, today, but it closed last week, but officially is shut today under law.
[00:27:30.054 --> 00:27:31.716]  It's just total shutdown of America.
[00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:34.579]  Total shutdown of anything they don't want you to have access to.
[00:27:34.579 --> 00:27:39.845]  So we're going to be talking about that with Anthony Gucciardi, but the story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:47.414]  It's linked in red, and it's the second story there in the featured news area.
[00:27:47.414 --> 00:27:48.475]  Now the third story.
[00:27:49.611 --> 00:27:51.513]  There in the featured news story.
[00:27:51.513 --> 00:27:53.415]  Some of the other news we're going to be breaking down.
[00:27:53.415 --> 00:27:55.738]  How to address growing poverty.
[00:27:55.738 --> 00:27:57.800]  More confiscation by government.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.701]  Curt Nimmo's article.
[00:27:58.701 --> 00:27:59.502]  Video.
[00:27:59.502 --> 00:28:01.104]  Woman stands by burning car.
[00:28:01.104 --> 00:28:03.927]  Example of sheep-like zombie population.
[00:28:03.927 --> 00:28:04.347]  Another one.
[00:28:04.347 --> 00:28:05.288]  Duping the left.
[00:28:05.288 --> 00:28:09.252]  New York mayor is a total minion of the Clintons.
[00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:11.737]  And that's well known.
[00:28:11.737 --> 00:28:14.740]  But it's okay, because he's married to a black lady, so everything he must do is alright.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.301]  I mean, it just never ends.
[00:28:16.301 --> 00:28:33.277]  We've also got articles up there about the media trying to cover up racial attacks against whites that are really intensifying men and women in public, and the police will not respond, just like when they had groups of, quote, minority men raping women en masse over and over again the last 20 years in New York.
[00:28:33.937 --> 00:28:42.720]  And finally, on helicopter video of 100, 200 men just raping women, the police stand down because political correctness is king.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:51.962]  And as long as it's a white devil getting raped by a couple hundred men and getting their jaw broke while their husband gets beat to death, that's a good thing.
[00:28:51.962 --> 00:28:52.803]  You understand that?
[00:28:52.803 --> 00:28:57.364]  That has to be allowed because only whites could ever do anything racial and bad.
[00:28:57.364 --> 00:28:58.624]  You understand that?
[00:28:58.624 --> 00:29:00.445]  That's important for everybody to know, and I agree with that.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.761]  I think that if 200 Puerto Rican men want to rape a woman and kill her, that's alright.
[00:29:06.761 --> 00:29:07.942]  If she's white.
[00:29:07.942 --> 00:29:20.205]  I think if black people want to target white folks in a mall and nobody comes to their aid, and they break bones and break legs and break ribs and knock teeth out and the police stand down, I think that's what should happen.
[00:29:20.905 --> 00:29:24.606]  I think black people should go to the malls with ice picks.
[00:29:24.606 --> 00:29:25.627]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:29:25.627 --> 00:29:27.027]  I better not say that.
[00:29:27.027 --> 00:29:28.448]  Actually, it'll be Alex said do it.
[00:29:28.448 --> 00:29:30.508]  Now this is sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:30.508 --> 00:29:31.629]  This is sick.
[00:29:31.629 --> 00:29:35.530]  And it's just like the Klan going out and finding some black guy and dragging him to death.
[00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.771]  But you'll never hear a word about it.
[00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:39.332]  No, it's a sacrament.
[00:29:39.332 --> 00:29:41.992]  Good job MSNBC.
[00:29:41.992 --> 00:29:45.514]  You really are doing a great job destroying our culture.
[00:29:45.514 --> 00:29:46.094]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:53.701]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:56.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:09.659]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:18.068]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:30:18.068 --> 00:30:22.713]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:29.717]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:29.717 --> 00:30:36.881]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:43.925]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:48.268]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:51.770]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.670]  You will be supporting a free press.
[00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:58.072]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:30:58.072 --> 00:31:00.534]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:00.534 --> 00:31:02.434]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:31:02.434 --> 00:31:06.076]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:10.658]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:10.658 --> 00:31:12.739]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride
[00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:13.520]  I don't think so.
[00:31:30.583 --> 00:31:34.206]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:51.517]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:51.517 --> 00:31:56.841]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at InfoWareStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:32:00.223 --> 00:32:01.244]  The facts are in.
[00:32:01.244 --> 00:32:02.644]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:02.644 --> 00:32:10.168]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:10.168 --> 00:32:13.990]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.550]  Simple.
[00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:19.272]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:19.272 --> 00:32:24.715]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:24.995 --> 00:32:30.542]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:32:30.542 --> 00:32:41.335]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:32:41.335 --> 00:32:43.157]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:32:43.277 --> 00:32:45.901]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:32:45.901 --> 00:32:48.064]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:32:48.064 --> 00:32:53.611]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:32:53.611 --> 00:32:58.037]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:32:58.037 --> 00:32:59.319]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:15.630]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:24.392]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:24.392 --> 00:33:27.753]  Coming up in a moment, we're going to talk about zombiosis in the country.
[00:33:27.753 --> 00:33:30.233]  That's what the NSA actually calls it.
[00:33:30.233 --> 00:33:37.835]  We now learn from documents from two years ago that have been leaked out, that they're not denying, where Apple is the NSA.
[00:33:39.255 --> 00:33:45.979]  It is the tip of the spear, the most wide open, directly designed with back doors to track everything you do.
[00:33:45.979 --> 00:33:53.823]  That's why all the new appliances in the home are designed to tie into iPhones particularly, not just droids.
[00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.544]  And I'm not defending droids.
[00:33:55.544 --> 00:33:56.244]  I'm not a tech guy.
[00:33:56.244 --> 00:33:58.445]  I'm just reading what the experts are saying.
[00:33:58.445 --> 00:33:59.426]  They're wide open as well.
[00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:04.576]  But Apple has been heavily involved.
[00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:10.638]  Folks, Apple is the most vicious, evil company out there that I can think of, except for maybe like Microsoft.
[00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:14.860]  They're all part of the same globalist operation, but they have the liberal trendiness.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.221]  When Obama attacks the country, it's loving.
[00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:18.662]  He got a peace prize.
[00:34:18.662 --> 00:34:22.343]  It's all part of this, oh, we're NPR.
[00:34:22.343 --> 00:34:27.906]  We want to get rid of families and motherhood and fatherhood because the state loves you.
[00:34:27.906 --> 00:34:31.227]  They're really roaring demonic goblins.
[00:34:33.342 --> 00:34:38.063]  They are savage social engineers that see you as prey and want to feed on you.
[00:34:38.063 --> 00:34:39.503]  And you've got to understand that.
[00:34:39.503 --> 00:34:42.164]  These people know what they're doing.
[00:34:42.164 --> 00:34:42.864]  I'm a liberal.
[00:34:42.864 --> 00:34:44.024]  You're a liberal.
[00:34:44.024 --> 00:34:46.364]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[00:34:46.364 --> 00:34:47.985]  Libertarianism is liberal.
[00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.445]  Constitutionalism is liberal.
[00:34:49.445 --> 00:34:53.626]  It's the greatest expression of the Renaissance.
[00:34:53.626 --> 00:34:57.786]  Not what these people have set up.
[00:34:57.786 --> 00:34:59.567]  And again, they take the moral high ground.
[00:34:59.567 --> 00:35:00.827]  They're the good people.
[00:35:02.105 --> 00:35:05.508]  They just want to teach kindergartners how to masturbate.
[00:35:05.508 --> 00:35:09.370]  They just want to teach kindergartners and first graders they can use whatever bathroom they want.
[00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.972]  Or you don't have to be a boy or a girl, you can be both.
[00:35:11.972 --> 00:35:14.354]  We're just adults talking to you about sex.
[00:35:14.354 --> 00:35:16.616]  We're not creeps that pull up in a creeper van.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:19.258]  No, we're the government.
[00:35:19.258 --> 00:35:31.447]  Here it is, Italian court overturns pedophile conviction, says 60 year old man can grab an 11 year old out of the back of a yard if the 11 year old in court says they like what the old man did to him, buggering him.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.561]  That's out of AFP, you name it, Breitbart, Business Insider.
[00:35:38.561 --> 00:35:39.341]  They're all covering it.
[00:35:39.341 --> 00:35:40.081]  Here's another one.
[00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:41.502]  California, 2014.
[00:35:41.502 --> 00:35:50.564]  Law affects transgenders, smokers, drunk drivers, first graders are going to be taught that they could be a transgender.
[00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:52.344]  People go, don't be mean to transgenders.
[00:35:52.344 --> 00:35:55.285]  Man, that's not even on my radar screen.
[00:35:55.285 --> 00:35:57.145]  I don't have anything against anybody.
[00:35:57.145 --> 00:35:58.406]  I'm a freedom lover.
[00:35:58.406 --> 00:35:58.926]  But don't
[00:35:59.952 --> 00:36:05.282]  Teach first graders about it, when they're not even thinking about it, to confuse them on purpose!
[00:36:05.282 --> 00:36:08.388]  Especially while they're having their food jacked with estrogen mimickers!
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:17.728]  That's why in public schools for 30 years they tried to make boys, you know, not play Cowboys and Indians or not wrestle and do the little girl stuff.
[00:36:17.728 --> 00:36:20.629]  I don't care what culture it is, you get little girls and little boys out in the park.
[00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:29.991]  Little girls start trying to make dinner and break up sticks and twigs like it's dinner and invite you over for dinner and, you know, they set up a little tent, a little house and they'll say, come into our house to the boys.
[00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:31.192]  That's what humans do.
[00:36:31.192 --> 00:36:35.253]  And the boys are out running around hunting and, you know, going to war.
[00:36:35.253 --> 00:36:36.153]  They don't want that.
[00:36:37.677 --> 00:36:43.904]  That's why they teach little boys, you're cool, you're stylish, wear pink, and aren't men good looking.
[00:36:43.904 --> 00:36:45.526]  And that's pedophilia!
[00:36:45.526 --> 00:36:48.349]  I don't want you teaching little boys.
[00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:53.114]  It's like bringing Hustler in for third graders.
[00:36:53.114 --> 00:36:54.555]  You know, it's on record that people like...
[00:36:57.355 --> 00:37:01.476]  Joe Kennedy would give, you know, pornography to his teenage sons.
[00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:05.397]  And that's actually been something that's been done in a lot of cultures.
[00:37:05.397 --> 00:37:10.958]  You know, to make sure your boys get primed right and start getting a little, I mean, they're not already trying to go after the girls.
[00:37:10.958 --> 00:37:15.299]  If they're scared, I didn't have that problem.
[00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:19.180]  Oh man, I tell you, I was like a wolf by the time I was 11.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:24.361]  But the point is, is that, is that that's questionable right there.
[00:37:25.742 --> 00:37:35.668]  You know, where you go to the deer camp when you're 11 and, uh, oh, there's, you know, playboys laying around over by the domino sets and the card table.
[00:37:35.668 --> 00:37:46.094]  But that's when you're 11 or 12, folks, and you get taken around men on a hunting trip and there's playboys laying over there like, hey, they don't say go look at them, they're just there.
[00:37:46.094 --> 00:37:55.360]  That's the culture, though, and they're doing this with kindergartners on transsexual, gay, bestiality, you name it, folks, and that's pedophilia right there.
[00:37:56.499 --> 00:37:59.300]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.440]  Bottom line.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.562]  You're not getting introduced to sex by finding dad's Playboys, folks.
[00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:13.544]  You're getting introduced to it by kids being put on smartphones that's full of porn and seeing stuff that a grown man doesn't need to look at.
[00:38:13.544 --> 00:38:16.525]  And I didn't mean to digress off into this.
[00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:18.446]  We're going to get to John Bowne's report here in a moment.
[00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:26.277]  Briefly, the federal government has been buying tens of millions of dosages during the last Fukushima event.
[00:38:26.277 --> 00:38:27.538]  I think it was 8 million dosages.
[00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.179]  We can look that up.
[00:38:29.179 --> 00:38:29.819]  Or packets.
[00:38:29.819 --> 00:38:33.562]  This time they bought 14 million.
[00:38:33.562 --> 00:38:39.245]  14 million treatments of IO-SAT that we do sell on InfoWareStore.com and help support the broadcast.
[00:38:39.245 --> 00:38:40.646]  It's the bound type.
[00:38:40.646 --> 00:38:43.088]  It's very powerful.
[00:38:43.088 --> 00:38:44.409]  It doesn't break down as quickly.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.461]  But if I had to take this during a radiological event, I would.
[00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:49.822]  The problem is, it's not maintenance.
[00:38:49.822 --> 00:38:51.343]  You'd get sick taking this all the time.
[00:38:51.343 --> 00:38:58.066]  You take pure nascent iodine, I personally do every day, and I've built up to taking a lot more, and it just gets better and better.
[00:38:58.066 --> 00:39:00.247]  Consult your physician, take the directed amount.
[00:39:00.247 --> 00:39:02.868]  If you have any medical issues, again, do that.
[00:39:02.868 --> 00:39:11.052]  But our brand of this, Survival Shield Nascent Iodine Dietary Supplement, is patented proprietary.
[00:39:11.052 --> 00:39:12.352]  And let me tell you, let me give you an example.
[00:39:12.352 --> 00:39:13.673]  If I wanted to buy crud iodine,
[00:39:14.935 --> 00:39:18.197]  I could buy it for like a dollar a bottle.
[00:39:18.197 --> 00:39:21.039]  This stuff cost me $10 a bottle, okay?
[00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:23.360]  And I sold it for $29.95 and it funds our operation.
[00:39:24.775 --> 00:39:25.995]  That sounds like, ooh, that's a big profit.
[00:39:25.995 --> 00:39:27.076]  No, not in vitamins and supplements.
[00:39:27.076 --> 00:39:27.516]  That's not.
[00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:30.637]  We need that to fund the operation, but it's very competitively priced.
[00:39:30.637 --> 00:39:34.679]  Leading competitors with CrudEye at under $50, $60, and it's not even the good stuff.
[00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:36.379]  And I'm not attacking the competitors.
[00:39:36.379 --> 00:39:39.241]  I'm just telling you this is half the price, double the strength.
[00:39:39.241 --> 00:39:40.401]  It's amazing.
[00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:46.243]  And you can also get the Survival Shield in bulk and get discounts at Infowarslife.com.
[00:39:46.243 --> 00:39:48.044]  But you can also get the Fluoride Shield.
[00:39:49.497 --> 00:39:57.205]  That has five other key ingredients like shilajit and other things with the iodine in a two ounce bottle for only...
[00:39:58.715 --> 00:40:01.777]  You get it for $34.95 when you get two bottles at $39.95.
[00:40:01.777 --> 00:40:06.160]  That's double the amount, double the size, for only $10 more.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.461]  So it's a huge discount.
[00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:12.204]  The best value at Infowarslife.com is the fluoride shield.
[00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:13.745]  And we do have that in.
[00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:18.489]  We're about to sell out of this survival shield, but we'll get more in a couple weeks.
[00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:21.451]  So Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:46.650]  Now here's the deal, with the big radioactive wave that's taken two plus years to get here, arriving in the next month and taking three months to come in, that's mainstream news, Fox News, with radiation levels going up, with Fukushima continuing to melt down, with the extraction process, why do you think the federal government, for their people, this is for them, just bought 14 million dosages?
[00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.172]  The biggest one-time purchase we've ever seen.
[00:40:49.172 --> 00:40:53.995]  That's up on InfoWars.com, easiest place to find it, DrudgeReport.com, right in the middle, top column.
[00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.131]  I'm asking you.
[00:40:56.131 --> 00:40:59.296]  Because yes, I am supporting our operation here, promoting what I believe in.
[00:40:59.296 --> 00:41:01.159]  That's called a win-win-win.
[00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:03.322]  It gets the free speech out.
[00:41:03.322 --> 00:41:05.906]  It supports you and your family's health and preparedness.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.342]  And it supports our entire operation to expand, not just stay at the same level or contract.
[00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:14.904]  Because if we don't grow, we're going to implode here at InfoWars.
[00:41:14.904 --> 00:41:16.104]  That's a simple fact.
[00:41:16.104 --> 00:41:17.405]  So thank you so much for your support.
[00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:20.346]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:20.346 --> 00:41:20.806]  And again,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.691]  I take this daily, but you also have it in backup in storage for a radiological event.
[00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.595]  In fact, I already took some this morning, but I'm going to take more.
[00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:34.477]  I'm getting more.
[00:41:34.477 --> 00:41:37.784]  I personally take four dropper fulls a day, and it just gets better and better.
[00:41:39.676 --> 00:41:47.002]  I would not do this at first, as Dr. Group and others have said, because you will detox.
[00:41:47.002 --> 00:41:49.303]  I would personally take less than what the recommended dose is.
[00:41:49.303 --> 00:41:50.384]  Talk to your own doctor.
[00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:53.527]  That's what I would do when you first start for about a month or two.
[00:41:53.527 --> 00:41:57.970]  And then after you get used to it, it's just, man, I tell you.
[00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.931]  You've heard the reviews.
[00:41:58.931 --> 00:41:59.711]  It's no brag.
[00:41:59.711 --> 00:42:00.192]  It's just fact.
[00:42:01.038 --> 00:42:04.980]  Folks were like marveling when I said I was taking iodine on the air.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:10.162]  And Drudge even put a tweet out saying, you know, look, Jones is shooting raw iodine on air.
[00:42:10.162 --> 00:42:11.403]  I think that says it all.
[00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:16.445]  Because if you do take regular iodine, it is like a hundred times Jack Daniels.
[00:42:16.445 --> 00:42:19.327]  I mean, the way it burns and literally makes you see spots.
[00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:22.308]  I mean, when I've taken it as a test of other, because we've sold out of this.
[00:42:22.308 --> 00:42:25.930]  I was looking for other brands, other groups, and I just couldn't sell it.
[00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.734]  I'm not knocking it, it's just that this is perfect for children in my view.
[00:42:30.734 --> 00:42:33.156]  Again, talk to your physician.
[00:42:33.156 --> 00:42:37.681]  The toll free number is 888-253-3139.
[00:42:37.681 --> 00:42:43.647]  So coming up, Apple denies ever working with the NSA after zero hedge.
[00:42:45.250 --> 00:43:03.215]  Put out a report on the big hacking conference they had in Germany where, and the NSA's confirmed this, and of course they're hopping mad, new NSA slides, training manuals, online PowerPoints where they call the general public zombies and laugh at us and talk about how they're surveilling everything we do.
[00:43:03.215 --> 00:43:04.256]  I'm telling you, that's the attitude.
[00:43:04.256 --> 00:43:04.836]  I saw a bunch of...
[00:43:06.795 --> 00:43:17.538]  Law enforcement graduates, they were older, but they were talking about their degrees, and trying to go back and get another degree at Martin's, and how they were going to go work for the NSA, and all on power trips.
[00:43:17.538 --> 00:43:23.520]  And I got in their face about it a few months ago, you know, out at the local natural spring pool.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.420]  Because that's the imperious attitude.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.921]  What you see with the NSA is just a manifestation of government corruption.
[00:43:29.921 --> 00:43:36.103]  And they've got compartments of the NSA who are doing real work and really are tracking bad guys overseas, but they're compartmentalized.
[00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:43.252]  So iPhone users are zombies and Steve Jobs was big brother according to NSA report.
[00:43:43.252 --> 00:43:46.554]  And what's that been picked up by now?
[00:43:46.554 --> 00:43:51.256]  That's now come out of the Huffington Post.
[00:43:51.256 --> 00:43:54.418]  Yeah, I was telling the crew a few days ago when this broke, this is big.
[00:43:54.418 --> 00:43:56.339]  So I'm glad it's getting picked up out there.
[00:43:56.339 --> 00:43:58.340]  Print that off for me, thank you very much.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.842]  So Huffington Post, TechDirt, Infowars.com, it's all being reported.
[00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:04.614]  So this is the way they operate.
[00:44:04.614 --> 00:44:06.234]  They're calling you dumb zombies.
[00:44:06.234 --> 00:44:09.616]  And the reason they're calling you dumb zombies is because people act like it.
[00:44:09.616 --> 00:44:11.597]  I've told the story.
[00:44:11.597 --> 00:44:13.318]  My son was about a year and a half old.
[00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:15.638]  We're at a La Madeline restaurant in North Austin.
[00:44:15.638 --> 00:44:18.080]  My wife and I and my child.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.241]  And I go in to wash my hands in the bathroom.
[00:44:21.241 --> 00:44:24.942]  And I come out and there's people all gathered around saying, call 911.
[00:44:24.942 --> 00:44:26.763]  And a woman was choking.
[00:44:26.763 --> 00:44:28.184]  And this went on and on and on and on.
[00:44:29.953 --> 00:44:33.516]  Uh, and so, I said, listen, she'll be dead by then.
[00:44:33.516 --> 00:44:35.138]  She'll turn purple, keel over the table.
[00:44:35.138 --> 00:44:38.161]  Uh, it was a obese woman.
[00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:40.123]  And I said, you gotta do the Heimlich.
[00:44:40.123 --> 00:44:41.104]  You might not be able to do the Heimlich.
[00:44:41.104 --> 00:44:41.584]  And they were like, 9-1-1!
[00:44:41.584 --> 00:44:41.624]  9-1-1!
[00:44:43.792 --> 00:44:46.273]  And so I said, that's it, I'm going in.
[00:44:46.273 --> 00:44:54.597]  And I grabbed her and almost had to pick her up, probably weighed 250 pounds, just to get the big ball of bread out of her mouth.
[00:44:54.597 --> 00:44:56.718]  Coughed it up, vomited some.
[00:44:56.718 --> 00:44:57.879]  They were all looking at me weird.
[00:44:57.879 --> 00:44:58.799]  Thank you, you're a hero.
[00:44:58.799 --> 00:45:02.261]  But also I felt one of her ribs kind of move, probably cracked a rib.
[00:45:02.261 --> 00:45:03.141]  I knew I would get sued.
[00:45:03.141 --> 00:45:04.482]  So I just said, let's get out of here now.
[00:45:04.482 --> 00:45:05.802]  We hardly even finished our dinner.
[00:45:05.802 --> 00:45:06.783]  It had just been done.
[00:45:06.783 --> 00:45:07.103]  We left.
[00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:10.062]  That's a normal behavior.
[00:45:10.062 --> 00:45:20.310]  You see the famous case in Toronto a few years ago where a woman was raped in a nice part of town and watched out of a 10-story building by everybody enjoying the entertainment, and she later died at the hospital.
[00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.392]  No one called the police for hours.
[00:45:22.392 --> 00:45:25.374]  You see this more and more, and this is an example.
[00:45:25.374 --> 00:45:27.275]  They don't care if reactors are leaking.
[00:45:27.275 --> 00:45:29.697]  People don't care if DU kills the troops when they use it.
[00:45:29.697 --> 00:45:31.338]  Wouldn't let them use it until 20-something years ago.
[00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:36.261]  There's a culture of not caring and it's seeping into everything.
[00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:40.903]  Don't fix the railways so railroads are falling apart and trains are flying off the tracks.
[00:45:40.903 --> 00:45:42.643]  Don't upgrade the infrastructure.
[00:45:42.643 --> 00:45:48.346]  It's a nihilistic attitude of arrogance, not just in government but in the general population.
[00:45:49.417 --> 00:45:51.239]  And it'll lead to World War III.
[00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:52.740]  It'll lead to bio-plagues.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:57.185]  It will lead to hell being released because people lose their common sense.
[00:45:57.185 --> 00:46:03.571]  Now, John Bowne was driving yesterday and caught this car on fire and saw the woman standing a couple feet away from it.
[00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:06.294]  By the time he got there yelling at her, she was walking towards him.
[00:46:06.294 --> 00:46:12.760]  But she was standing feet from where it later blew up and blew pieces of the car up to 10 feet away.
[00:46:13.641 --> 00:46:17.562]  The video's up on InfoWars.com, but for radio listeners, here's the audio of it.
[00:46:17.562 --> 00:46:23.745]  Then we're going to go to break and come back and talk to John Bowne, but here is his report shot on the street.
[00:46:23.745 --> 00:46:26.166]  Hey, John Bowne here, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:30.847]  I just want to show you what my commute looked like this morning as I was heading to work.
[00:46:30.847 --> 00:46:35.089]  I saw a woman standing this close to the burning car.
[00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:39.290]  Now, you can see this is where the remnants of the fire are.
[00:46:41.787 --> 00:46:43.128]  Burned up car right here.
[00:46:43.128 --> 00:46:46.849]  It's all burnt right here.
[00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:53.832]  And of course, where most of the hose that caught fire and caught the rest of her engine on fire.
[00:46:53.832 --> 00:46:57.474]  It was completely engulfed in flames by the time I left.
[00:46:57.474 --> 00:47:03.537]  But she stood this close to a burning car, talking on her cell phone to the fire department.
[00:47:03.537 --> 00:47:07.819]  As I drove by, I realized that lady was in a lot of danger.
[00:47:08.897 --> 00:47:22.465]  So I stopped up there at that stoplight, turned around, came back down, and proceeded to tell that woman to move away from her car because she couldn't figure it out for herself.
[00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:23.386]  Ma'am!
[00:47:23.386 --> 00:47:24.987]  Ma'am!
[00:47:24.987 --> 00:47:26.708]  Young lady!
[00:47:26.708 --> 00:47:28.489]  Hey, you need to get away from that car!
[00:47:28.489 --> 00:47:32.311]  You need to get away from that car!
[00:47:32.311 --> 00:47:34.012]  Get very far away from that car!
[00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:37.756]  That car is on fire!
[00:47:37.756 --> 00:47:40.197]  There's fire underneath that car!
[00:47:40.197 --> 00:47:48.021]  So get away from the car!
[00:47:48.021 --> 00:47:49.662]  That's after he yells at her for a couple minutes.
[00:47:49.662 --> 00:47:50.723]  Yeah.
[00:47:50.723 --> 00:47:53.784]  The fire department needs to show up right now and start spraying that down.
[00:47:53.784 --> 00:47:55.345]  You need to get the hell away from that car.
[00:47:55.345 --> 00:47:58.467]  Alright, good.
[00:47:58.467 --> 00:48:00.968]  Please keep a safe distance.
[00:48:00.968 --> 00:48:04.790]  Meanwhile, traffic was coming this close to the burning car.
[00:48:05.874 --> 00:48:23.939]  No one was getting in the other lane, as you can see from the video, and no one seemed to care about the woman who was in mortal danger, standing next to a burning car, inhaling noxious fumes and smoke, and if she stood there long enough, she would have had to go to the hospital.
[00:48:23.939 --> 00:48:29.600]  Let me tell you, if there's ever a big disaster, it's always... It just goes to show that people really are asleep.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.441]  There's a mass paralysis.
[00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:34.682]  You see a car on fire, with a woman standing next to it,
[00:48:35.697 --> 00:48:39.040]  Why don't you stop and help?
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.684]  Because you're just as capable as a government official, believe it or not.
[00:48:43.684 --> 00:48:46.947]  Alright, now again, I've seen the studies, I've read the history books.
[00:48:46.947 --> 00:48:51.811]  I remember as a child, people would have instantly pulled off to the side of the road.
[00:48:51.811 --> 00:48:56.235]  People would have turned across the highway over to the other side of the highway because it's open grass there.
[00:48:56.235 --> 00:48:57.956]  I guarantee when I was a kid,
[00:48:58.965 --> 00:49:02.709]  My dad would have stopped his car 100 yards back and stopped the highway or something.
[00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:06.954]  I mean, when you've got a burning car, obviously about to blow up, that's what the police are going to do.
[00:49:06.954 --> 00:49:08.235]  It's common sense.
[00:49:08.235 --> 00:49:16.303]  But of course, my dad knows how to skin a buck, run a trot line, fix a combine, drive a tractor.
[00:49:16.303 --> 00:49:19.847]  You know, back when I was a kid, you know, my dad had a
[00:49:21.471 --> 00:49:22.931]  Steer, wrestle, the whole nine yards.
[00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:25.912]  I remember being a little kid and they'd be rounding the cows up and we'd go back and visit the farm.
[00:49:25.912 --> 00:49:30.914]  I remember my dad going in and grabbing the thousand pound cows by the horns and throwing them down to the ground.
[00:49:30.914 --> 00:49:32.434]  And my dad's a little guy.
[00:49:32.434 --> 00:49:38.516]  I think of the average person today, they don't know how to tie their shoelaces.
[00:49:38.516 --> 00:49:49.879]  And John Bowne, it's amazing to me that maybe 20% of the commenters on YouTube and the votes think you were wrong to park and go and tell her get away from it, literally standing two feet from it.
[00:49:51.182 --> 00:49:53.703]  And then she starts walking towards you and you start filming it.
[00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:57.664]  And then it later blows up as cars are driving right by it.
[00:49:57.664 --> 00:50:00.225]  I mean, something's happening and the statistics show it.
[00:50:00.225 --> 00:50:04.046]  You show articles where it shows IQs are dropping from all the smartphone and TV viewing.
[00:50:04.046 --> 00:50:06.927]  People think everything is like a television show.
[00:50:06.927 --> 00:50:07.747]  They don't get it.
[00:50:07.747 --> 00:50:12.568]  And remember in Austin, the cop that got run over during rush hour traffic at a four-way stop.
[00:50:12.568 --> 00:50:18.690]  What was it down at... It was down at... Oh, what's... William Cannon years ago.
[00:50:19.657 --> 00:50:23.860]  I mean, it was like 45 minutes, they drove by the cop bleeding to death in the road, just drove around him.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.802]  I mean, these people are literally idiots.
[00:50:26.802 --> 00:50:34.768]  And the globalists have helped do this with the television and the culture, and now want us dumbed down more, as if the public needed any help acting like cattle.
[00:50:34.768 --> 00:50:40.452]  And then these cattle are going to vote to take my guns, make me take all their deadly vaccines, drink their fluoride.
[00:50:40.452 --> 00:50:43.294]  They don't have a right to be so stupid, John Bowne.
[00:50:43.294 --> 00:50:45.456]  What is your take on this in the larger context?
[00:50:46.024 --> 00:50:47.606]  You're the bad guy, right?
[00:50:47.606 --> 00:50:49.027]  I'm the bad guy.
[00:50:49.027 --> 00:50:50.429]  We're the bad people.
[00:50:50.429 --> 00:50:54.814]  Now, maybe I was a little bit harsh to that lady, but I was in the moment.
[00:50:54.814 --> 00:50:56.435]  I was genuinely... Well, she wasn't listening!
[00:50:56.435 --> 00:50:58.538]  Genuinely concerned about... I mean, I saw the raw tape.
[00:50:58.538 --> 00:50:59.359]  It went on for two minutes.
[00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:00.199]  She's saying, get away.
[00:51:00.199 --> 00:51:02.602]  Well, I was talking to her like, maybe I talked to my daughter.
[00:51:02.602 --> 00:51:05.065]  It's like, get away from the burning car!
[00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:05.946]  That's your four-year-old daughter.
[00:51:06.246 --> 00:51:08.408]  Yeah, I mean, that's basically how I felt.
[00:51:08.408 --> 00:51:16.736]  I mean, and the other side of that is, if my wife or my daughter were in that situation, I hope to God somebody would help them, you know?
[00:51:16.736 --> 00:51:21.221]  If my daughter was standing next to a burning car, I would hope somebody would run.
[00:51:21.221 --> 00:51:24.083]  But as I turned around, as I drove by,
[00:51:24.964 --> 00:51:51.085]  I thought I saw her car was smoking okay you know well she's gonna have to get a tow truck and then as I drove by I saw fire dripping onto the ground underneath it and that's not good so I pulled up to the stoplight and I kept looking back and I noticed more fire pouring more fire pouring and as the fire poured I saw the smoke rising and then I turned around and as I came around there was a truck
[00:51:51.866 --> 00:52:07.926]  Parked across the road directly from her red truck parked directly across the road and the guy was just sitting in his truck He's just sitting in his truck staring at this woman who's uh, you know clearly making a poor decision
[00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.353]  Clearly making a poor decision in front of God.
[00:52:12.353 --> 00:52:16.497]  But the issue is just 10 years ago, I know Austinites.
[00:52:16.497 --> 00:52:17.237]  People would have stopped.
[00:52:17.237 --> 00:52:19.179]  They'd be helping or they'd see you back.
[00:52:19.179 --> 00:52:23.763]  I mean, I was in South Texas and saw a guy run a red light and run into two old ladies.
[00:52:23.763 --> 00:52:25.145]  And I was four cars back.
[00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:27.347]  All three cars ahead of me pulled over to help her.
[00:52:27.347 --> 00:52:29.529]  I still pulled over to help him as well.
[00:52:29.529 --> 00:52:31.310]  And to wait till the police got there as witnesses.
[00:52:32.592 --> 00:52:42.440]  A lot of those comments were, John, you know, you're up on your high horse, you arrogant whatever, you know, how dare you help them?
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.842]  Listen, I saw it when the woman was choking.
[00:52:44.842 --> 00:52:46.183]  No one was going to help her.
[00:52:46.183 --> 00:52:51.307]  I had to push men aside who were trying to stop me from doing it because I wasn't wearing a uniform.
[00:52:51.307 --> 00:52:54.270]  Well, sorry, I took first aid.
[00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.051]  I took how to resuscitate people.
[00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:59.975]  I took that three years in a row when I was in a swim team.
[00:53:01.121 --> 00:53:03.623]  I mean, I was a swim team before that when I was like 13, 14, 15.
[00:53:03.623 --> 00:53:05.846]  I mean, I took it from fire departments.
[00:53:05.846 --> 00:53:07.207]  I was certified in it.
[00:53:07.207 --> 00:53:08.028]  I know how to do it.
[00:53:08.028 --> 00:53:09.169]  I saved that woman's life.
[00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:09.909]  I'm not bad.
[00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:14.754]  When you talk about your dad, you talk about that that mentality that used to be here.
[00:53:14.754 --> 00:53:19.238]  And I hope it comes back because it is withering on the vine.
[00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:20.539]  But my grandparents.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:30.404]  Put people up during the depression who were down on their luck in our basement, took care of them until they got back on their feet back in Kentucky.
[00:53:30.404 --> 00:53:31.085]  That's what you do.
[00:53:31.085 --> 00:53:38.768]  You take the shirt off your back and you take care of, because when it really hits the fan, everybody's going to, it's going to be everybody for themselves.
[00:53:38.768 --> 00:53:46.272]  It's going to have this mentality where everyone's going to have this mentality where it's, I'm going to take my shotgun and I'm just going to go get what I want, what I need.
[00:53:46.832 --> 00:53:51.635]  Well, the people that are going to be able to band together are going to be the ones that are going to be able to take the lead.
[00:53:51.635 --> 00:53:57.360]  Exactly, and the sheep will think banding together, or seeing a woman standing by a burning car that later blew up.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:03.604]  If the footage blows up, fire shoots out like five feet from both sides and the top, and there's cars a foot away.
[00:54:03.604 --> 00:54:05.405]  They don't even get in the other lane.
[00:54:05.405 --> 00:54:06.286]  The other lane.
[00:54:06.286 --> 00:54:08.467]  And my instinct was exactly what you said.
[00:54:08.467 --> 00:54:14.392]  I wanted to just turn around, pull into the median, and get in the middle of the road and help the people.
[00:54:14.992 --> 00:54:18.835]  Not just this lady who's standing next to her car, but the people in their cars.
[00:54:18.835 --> 00:54:23.499]  Because, yeah, there is a possibility that that car may explode.
[00:54:23.499 --> 00:54:24.420]  It did explode.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:31.546]  Well, and could shoot debris maybe into a kid or into a woman, you know, going to her job that day or whatever.
[00:54:31.546 --> 00:54:35.509]  Well, the point is that happens all the time with these car fires and people start wrecking.
[00:54:35.509 --> 00:54:36.230]  Where's the instinct?
[00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.092]  Where's the instinct of people to do that?
[00:54:39.092 --> 00:54:42.695]  And then when they see somebody do that, they go after my character.
[00:54:43.493 --> 00:54:47.197]  They go after your... And again, we're not complaining that the sheeple attacked us.
[00:54:47.197 --> 00:54:47.738]  It shows.
[00:54:47.738 --> 00:54:51.342]  Have you ever gone to the ocean and done crab fishing?
[00:54:51.943 --> 00:54:52.603]  Yeah.
[00:54:52.603 --> 00:55:03.190]  I mean, all you do is you throw in a string with bacon on it, they're so greedy, you let them start eating it, you drag them in, stone crabs, I don't care what they are, regular crabs, and then you throw a bunch in a bucket.
[00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:08.233]  They could pile up together and help climb out, but what happens to the one crab that tries to get out?
[00:55:08.233 --> 00:55:13.477]  They don't attack each other until one crab tries to get out, then they all come over and grabbing and pulling back down.
[00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:14.457]  That's right.
[00:55:14.457 --> 00:55:15.118]  And that's what it is.
[00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:16.178]  That's what it is.
[00:55:16.178 --> 00:55:17.639]  That's the mentality.
[00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:28.125]  And it's born in fear, it's born in this disassociation with everybody else's, the empathy of this planet.
[00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:43.273]  If they can hold on to their disassociation from everything and clutch onto it to the bitter end, they can go play their video games, go into their own little world as long as they can and defend that, then they actually believe
[00:55:44.278 --> 00:55:48.482]  That they have some kind of truth weighing behind them.
[00:55:48.482 --> 00:55:53.027]  Well, exactly, and this has happened in history, but it's mass Stockholm syndrome.
[00:55:53.027 --> 00:55:58.633]  For those that don't know, I've coined that term mass Stockholm syndrome because over the years
[00:56:00.715 --> 00:56:21.834]  And of course, this has been seen in history before, but the last 40 years they've had the term Stockholm Syndrome, where people that are held by kidnappers, even abused, raped, you name it, they start defending the kidnappers because it's so scary to admit the bad person has you, they will delusionally, like a prostitute under a pimp, to put cigarettes out on her, will start defending him from even the family's
[00:56:22.535 --> 00:56:27.259]  of the prostitutes that come and try to get the women out of the bad situation they're in.
[00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:34.424]  This is how the mindset works and so those of us that don't want the NSA spying on us for political reasons, we're the bad guys because we're the ones exposing it.
[00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:47.415]  Those of us that are right about the preparations for war against the American people, we're the bad guys because we're pointing out it's happening and the public, they want to, in a cowardly way, subconsciously accept it and say it doesn't exist or embrace it.
[00:56:47.955 --> 00:56:54.880]  And so, it doesn't matter if the radiation levels are hundreds of times safe levels in and around Japan and coming across the water towards the U.S.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.201]  Just say it's fine.
[00:56:56.201 --> 00:56:59.243]  They told the MSNBC host, lie and say it's good for you.
[00:56:59.243 --> 00:57:00.784]  Lie and say it's not a problem.
[00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:01.825]  That's now come out.
[00:57:01.825 --> 00:57:03.446]  Sync's gone public about that.
[00:57:03.446 --> 00:57:04.407]  That's what it is.
[00:57:04.407 --> 00:57:07.970]  It's like, don't say it's bad to teach first graders how to have anal sex.
[00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.571]  In California, that's good.
[00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:11.832]  It's fathers that are bad.
[00:57:11.832 --> 00:57:12.733]  It's families that are bad.
[00:57:12.733 --> 00:57:14.374]  And you're like, wait, this is crazy.
[00:57:14.374 --> 00:57:15.395]  This is unhealthy.
[00:57:15.395 --> 00:57:16.155]  This is dangerous.
[00:57:16.155 --> 00:57:17.637]  No, no, you shut up.
[00:57:17.637 --> 00:57:18.257]  You shut up.
[00:57:18.257 --> 00:57:19.958]  You're the one saying there's a problem.
[00:57:19.958 --> 00:57:21.539]  You're the one causing the problem.
[00:57:21.539 --> 00:57:23.080]  We're going to kill the messenger.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:35.449]  And it shows the delusional behavior in the elite themselves now and the type of brinksmanship and arrogance and irrational exuberance and confidence that is going to lead towards war, famine, societal collapse.
[00:57:35.449 --> 00:57:36.490]  John Bowne, final comment.
[00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:43.313]  Yeah, I'm just amazed with the unyielding conditioning that we're all under, that we haven't even got to a huge war at this point.
[00:57:43.313 --> 00:57:54.739]  We've got China, and we have Russia, and we've got these Olympics coming up with the false flags that are going to ensue, and everyone's going to sit at home, and you're going to watch your big HD television.
[00:57:54.739 --> 00:58:01.882]  Meanwhile, there are false flags being planned by the Saudi Arabians, and we're all being conditioned to allow that to happen.
[00:58:02.082 --> 00:58:07.044]  And then they'll even take our rights away when the CIA is involved and the Russians are starting to threaten to nuke Europe.
[00:58:07.044 --> 00:58:10.024]  I mean, what are they going to do if they start nuking us and nuclear war starts?
[00:58:10.024 --> 00:58:12.005]  What's going to happen to your HD television then?
[00:58:12.005 --> 00:58:16.146]  And all we are is some guy by the side of the road saying, get away from that burning car.
[00:58:16.146 --> 00:58:17.127]  That's all we are.
[00:58:17.127 --> 00:58:18.687]  That's who we are here at InfoWars.
[00:58:18.687 --> 00:58:19.487]  That's it.
[00:58:19.487 --> 00:58:20.408]  That's it.
[00:58:20.408 --> 00:58:22.048]  We're just trying to help.
[00:58:22.048 --> 00:58:24.289]  And you can't come after us and our character.
[00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:26.270]  Because we're trying to help.
[00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.311]  You're in cuckoo fantasy land.
[00:58:28.311 --> 00:58:34.435]  But then they like to tattle on the cops that my neighbor has a gun that's even legal, or my neighbor spanked their kid, or my neighbor has a Nerf gun.
[00:58:34.435 --> 00:58:36.597]  Those are the very people that won't help that lady.
[00:58:36.597 --> 00:58:37.677]  They love to tattle.
[00:58:37.677 --> 00:58:41.220]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:03.949 --> 00:59:05.551]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:05.851 --> 00:59:07.492]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:07.492 --> 00:59:12.175]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:59:12.175 --> 00:59:16.378]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:59:16.378 --> 00:59:18.940]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.705]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:10.316]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.316 --> 01:00:11.918]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:13.459]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.459 --> 01:00:17.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:21.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.639 --> 01:00:39.344]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to open up this hour to phone calls, but I want to ask the listeners to do me the honor of actually calling in on the topic I want to discuss.
[01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:42.206]  Then you can add any other points you want.
[01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:45.767]  Long-time callers, first-time callers, I'm going to give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.989]  I think I'll just give it out now.
[01:00:48.989 --> 01:00:51.951]  I want to discuss the zombiosis that's happening in the public.
[01:00:52.719 --> 01:01:05.682]  And how people won't render aid, and that's in statistics, that's in FBI numbers, at record numbers, they won't help somebody that's in distress, a woman being raped, a woman being mugged, a man being mugged, police won't help people being racially attacked.
[01:01:05.682 --> 01:01:09.682]  There's articles about that today we're going to be getting into.
[01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:13.603]  These are the big issues that have to be discussed.
[01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:20.165]  And if you won't render somebody else aid, you're not going to get aid yourself.
[01:01:20.165 --> 01:01:21.765]  It's a horrible society and
[01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:25.972]  It's what kills civilizations.
[01:01:25.972 --> 01:01:28.935]  And the globalists have tried to breed this into us on record.
[01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.076]  They admit this.
[01:01:30.076 --> 01:01:34.441]  And that's really the ultimate sin in my world, in my worldview.
[01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:35.963]  I don't know if it is in your worldview.
[01:01:37.182 --> 01:01:51.047]  That taking people's individualism, taking their dynamic human spirit, their instincts away, and turning them into spectating biological androids that are trendies, there to just be programmed with the latest trend, the latest download.
[01:01:51.047 --> 01:01:53.588]  That is really the end of the soul.
[01:01:55.354 --> 01:01:59.636]  And that's the issue I want to discuss for some of this hour.
[01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:05.698]  Into the next hour, then Anthony Gucciardi is going to be joining us with his top story on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:05.698 --> 01:02:09.820]  It's also linked on TheMightyDrugsReport.com.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.581]  In the middle of the top column, U.S.
[01:02:11.581 --> 01:02:19.464]  government orders 14 million dosages of potassium iodide, huge purchase linked to ongoing Fukushima crisis.
[01:02:19.464 --> 01:02:21.725]  And we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:02:22.858 --> 01:02:24.940]  Drudge changed the headline to something even more powerful.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.341]  It's Nuke Fear.
[01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:29.624]  Feds order 14 million dosages of potassium iodide.
[01:02:29.624 --> 01:02:31.346]  So we're going to be discussing that.
[01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:37.452]  There's a bunch of other Obamacare news, government promoting pedophilia news, huge NSA news.
[01:02:37.452 --> 01:02:37.792]  Where are they?
[01:02:38.769 --> 01:02:49.711]  In new Snowden documents, new NSA documents, the PowerPoint, you know, those screens where they describe to their own minions how things work, they call the public dumb zombies that don't know they're in 1984.
[01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:54.152]  Just like Zuckerberg calls you dumb effers, and this is their attitude.
[01:02:54.152 --> 01:02:57.593]  And I mean, they'll tell you, oh, you're so smart, I love you.
[01:02:57.593 --> 01:02:58.753]  Aren't death panels good?
[01:02:58.753 --> 01:03:02.873]  And talk to you in an NPR voice like you're five years old.
[01:03:02.873 --> 01:03:04.374]  I will talk to you like adults.
[01:03:04.374 --> 01:03:05.414]  I'm talking to new listeners.
[01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:09.473]  And you tune in, man, that's wacky, that guy's far out.
[01:03:09.473 --> 01:03:12.935]  No, reality's far out.
[01:03:12.935 --> 01:03:22.704]  And I can unequivocally say this, this radio show, with human intelligence, because we all see through rose-colored glasses, as the Bible says, is as close to reality as you're gonna get.
[01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:25.665]  I can really say that.
[01:03:25.665 --> 01:03:27.287]  It's no brag, just fact.
[01:03:27.287 --> 01:03:36.899]  And that's a really scary thing, that when I have all these other constitutional lawyers on, and experts, and NSA people, and journalists, and I'm so immersed in this for 20 years, 18 years on air, since 1995.
[01:03:40.356 --> 01:03:49.201]  I'm so immersed in all the different angles of it that I almost always know more than my guest does about any subject they're on.
[01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:51.482]  They can usually augment, give me more.
[01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:55.464]  They know more than I do in some areas, but that's a scary thought.
[01:03:55.464 --> 01:04:04.409]  That a guy that went to community college for two years, and the reason I got out of it, I was about to go to UT, was I could tell it wasn't an education, it was an indoctrination.
[01:04:04.409 --> 01:04:06.910]  The RTF stuff I was learning was like 10-year-old garbage.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.806]  I could see where the media was going in the future and I didn't even think of myself in an arrogant way as super smart.
[01:04:14.806 --> 01:04:31.862]  I know there's super smart people out there that if they get into this knowledge and get into this information and outside the box studying how civilization really works from the globalist white papers, not how they say it works in the education level BS they put out, that there are people out there
[01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:41.466]  Literally, who are a lot smarter than I am on so many fronts, better orators, better looking, smarter, everything.
[01:04:41.466 --> 01:04:46.289]  You could save us with God's help, but you've got to believe in yourselves to be leaders.
[01:04:46.289 --> 01:04:58.696]  But I now realize, and it's not a power trip, it's very humbling that all my background, being a fighter, being aggressive, not liking undue authority, all of it, that I've got an incredible responsibility and I was born to fight tyranny.
[01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:11.273]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:11.273 --> 01:05:13.334]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:13.334 --> 01:05:14.214]  Fluoride!
[01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:16.135]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:22.457]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:22.697 --> 01:05:27.643]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:27.643 --> 01:05:33.949]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:05:33.949 --> 01:05:36.372]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:05:36.372 --> 01:05:39.315]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:05:39.315 --> 01:05:42.699]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:48.247]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:48.247 --> 01:05:53.354]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:02.383]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:06:02.383 --> 01:06:06.024]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[01:06:06.024 --> 01:06:10.546]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:16.688]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[01:06:16.688 --> 01:06:27.471]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:30.533]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates!

[01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:43.361]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine.
[01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:48.885]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands.
[01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:58.311]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:17.704]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:22.587]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:22.587 --> 01:07:29.372]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[01:07:36.536 --> 01:07:43.562]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:43.562 --> 01:07:48.066]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:07:57.754 --> 01:07:59.435]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:15.048]  I was just back in the kitchen here at the InfoWars.com studios and Dick Cheney was on Fox News
[01:08:36.181 --> 01:08:52.331]  And he said, out of his mouth, I believe it was live, said live, he just said minutes ago, I'm talking five minutes ago, three minutes ago, he just said, Mohammed Karzai was a guy that was there when we needed him, and I will not say that he's corrupt, and basically he's a good guy.
[01:08:53.615 --> 01:08:58.359]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mohammed Karzai is a known mega-narcotics trafficker.
[01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:01.581]  His brother, until he got killed, was the number one opium dealer in the world.
[01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:09.307]  Our government is there for 12 years to control the opium supply and to keep a war going for no-bid weapons contracts.
[01:09:09.307 --> 01:09:10.748]  We're not meant to win the war.
[01:09:10.748 --> 01:09:12.710]  That's why Obama swore we'd be gone in 2012, then 2014, now 2017.
[01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:13.550]  We're never leaving.
[01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:21.843]  And we did not go there to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:21.843 --> 01:09:27.609]  We went there to get control of the opium and to get control of the lithium that's worth trillions.
[01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:30.171]  Not for American companies, I want to add.
[01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:32.734]  That'd be bad enough if we didn't really try to help America.
[01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:40.241]  This isn't an empire that's based in a country, like the old British Empire, where actually stuff came back to the home country to build it up.
[01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:43.164]  And that's bad enough, but a lot more moral
[01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:49.834]  Then, literally, they're extracting America, they're extracting Afghanistan.
[01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:55.659]  Look at how they're funding Al-Qaeda in Libya, in Syria, in Egypt, you name it.
[01:09:55.659 --> 01:10:07.189]  Because Saudi Arabia is in the middle of this and they've been chosen by British intelligence since 1903 on record to take over that entire region and they've basically done it.
[01:10:09.426 --> 01:10:19.112]  And then we put our so-called enemies in charge once they get in control, because the government-controlled media thinks you're so dumb, because the general public are zombies.
[01:10:19.112 --> 01:10:27.138]  We showed statistics earlier from CNN, Fox News reporting on it, that failure to render aid is exploding all over the Western world.
[01:10:27.138 --> 01:10:29.820]  You see somebody hit by a car on their bicycle?
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.160]  A hundred cars will drive by.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.242]  A thousand cars will drive by.
[01:10:33.242 --> 01:10:35.924]  A cop gets out of his car, gets hit at a four-way stop.
[01:10:36.961 --> 01:10:39.073]  For 45 minutes in Austin, nobody helps them.
[01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:39.496]  They die.
[01:10:42.153 --> 01:10:46.474]  A woman seen being beat up in the head with a lead pipe and raped for hours.
[01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:47.554]  She's raped for 30 minutes.
[01:10:47.554 --> 01:10:48.774]  It's a famous case in Toronto.
[01:10:48.774 --> 01:10:49.815]  I covered it a few years ago.
[01:10:49.815 --> 01:10:50.895]  But it happens all the time.
[01:10:50.895 --> 01:10:59.577]  And then she sat there bleeding in her miniskirt and the guy at the telecom corporation on the third floor told all his employees don't call the police and go back to work and laughed at her.
[01:10:59.577 --> 01:11:00.517]  It came out.
[01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:02.738]  It was all and they all followed orders.
[01:11:02.738 --> 01:11:07.479]  I mean, if I had a boss at a telecom and he sat there laughing and I mean, number one, I see a guy raping a woman.
[01:11:07.479 --> 01:11:08.679]  I'm gonna go down there and beat his butt.
[01:11:09.991 --> 01:11:12.994]  And it's not because I'm a tough guy, I mean, that's normal instinct.
[01:11:12.994 --> 01:11:25.465]  If I was at some place and my boss said, don't call the police, hey, look at her, you know, look at her naked there in the freezing, you know, rain, the woman later died, I would have, and I'm sorry, I'd punch you in the nose.
[01:11:25.465 --> 01:11:29.589]  Because that's my daughter, that's my wife, that's my mother, that's my grandmother.
[01:11:30.694 --> 01:11:32.095]  You reap what you sow, folks.
[01:11:32.095 --> 01:11:33.535]  We've gotten rid of our common sense.
[01:11:33.535 --> 01:11:36.336]  And instead, though, the tattling's at record levels.
[01:11:36.336 --> 01:11:39.898]  Oh my goodness, the neighbors saw Jimmy and Bobby playing with Nerf guns.
[01:11:39.898 --> 01:11:41.339]  Call the police.
[01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.999]  The cop shoots one of them.
[01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:52.123]  Or, oh my gosh, you know, John was in the backyard with his friend David playing Nerf guns, and so the school suspended him.
[01:11:52.123 --> 01:11:54.164]  I see this every couple days in the news.
[01:11:54.164 --> 01:11:59.827]  All over the country, it's always an old man who thinks he's still in America, in a quasi-rural area where yuppies have moved in.
[01:12:00.507 --> 01:12:02.948]  And they see him cleaning a gun in their garage workshop.
[01:12:02.948 --> 01:12:05.330]  Every old man has a garage workshop.
[01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:08.632]  And they call the police and the cops walk around the corner and shoot him.
[01:12:08.632 --> 01:12:11.453]  That just happened up in Fort Worth a few weeks ago.
[01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:15.396]  Or, uh, they take him to jail and say, well, the neighbor's scared of the gun.
[01:12:15.396 --> 01:12:17.557]  We're gonna do a psychological evaluation.
[01:12:17.557 --> 01:12:18.558]  The guy's like, what?
[01:12:18.558 --> 01:12:20.379]  I'm cleaning my dear rifle.
[01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:22.320]  That's illegal on my property?
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.962]  Sorry, Mr. Johnson, or Mr. Chavez, or whatever your name is.
[01:12:25.962 --> 01:12:27.483]  We're gonna take you to jail now.
[01:12:27.483 --> 01:12:29.444]  This is the mass mental illness
[01:12:30.988 --> 01:12:39.753]  Where a woman is choking to death and no one helps her for a minute and a half till I walk out of the bathroom and then they try to stop me from saving her life.
[01:12:39.753 --> 01:12:43.456]  Or where you try to warn people on the street corner.
[01:12:43.456 --> 01:12:49.339]  I mean, I've been to national parks and gone, the UN's taking over this park to restrict access and a buffer zone to local farmers.
[01:12:49.339 --> 01:12:50.720]  Here's the executive order.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.702]  People are like, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.043]  That was on video.
[01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:56.924]  How long ago was that?
[01:12:58.353 --> 01:12:58.533]  I think?
[01:13:18.609 --> 01:13:25.678]  But people walk by and go, you're like that guy in that conspiracy theory movie that had just come out with Mel Gibson, and laughed at me.
[01:13:25.678 --> 01:13:36.111]  Or the last time I was at the Grand Canyon, and I got video of this, I'm around the corner at the visitor center, no one's around, I find the UN plaque that I had visited
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.642]  Fifteen years before, this was just last year, they built a new visitor center, a giant one, at the Grand Canyon.
[01:13:42.642 --> 01:13:43.983]  The place is deserted.
[01:13:43.983 --> 01:13:58.068]  I go around there, and I'm doing a quick video talking about UNESCO, and a guy with an American flag hat and veteran stuff, Navy stuff on, walks over with his wife and goes, I can't believe the crap this guy's talking about.
[01:13:58.068 --> 01:13:59.729]  I can't believe an American.
[01:13:59.729 --> 01:14:00.629]  And I said, excuse me, sir?
[01:14:00.629 --> 01:14:02.430]  And he goes, whatever!
[01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:06.832]  Because he didn't like me pointing out that UN designation put our country under foreign control.
[01:14:07.748 --> 01:14:10.649]  I was the traitor for pointing out UN takeover.
[01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:21.892]  These people want to live in their pod, they want to watch Fox News or CNN all day, liberal or conservative, they want to feel like everything's alright.
[01:14:21.892 --> 01:14:23.452]  Everything is not alright.
[01:14:23.452 --> 01:14:27.413]  I get so upset I forget to breathe.
[01:14:27.413 --> 01:14:29.874]  Everything is not alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:34.373]  Everything is not alright, and we have to admit there's a problem.
[01:14:34.373 --> 01:14:39.758]  So John Bowne sees a burning car with flames under it, and a woman standing literally two feet from it.
[01:14:39.758 --> 01:14:47.065]  He parks a couple hundred yards away on a major road, 360, runs up to her, one of our news producers and hosts.
[01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:47.766]  He runs over.
[01:14:50.478 --> 01:14:51.639]  Says, ma'am, get away, ma'am.
[01:14:51.639 --> 01:14:54.060]  It takes you several minutes to get away from the car.
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:54.980]  We put the video up.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.321]  The car blows up.
[01:14:56.321 --> 01:15:07.846]  Cars are driving right by the car as it later blows up and shoots flame out five feet in all directions before the police get there and the fire department who then block the road and cleaned it off.
[01:15:07.846 --> 01:15:09.927]  I mean, just incredible.
[01:15:09.927 --> 01:15:11.028]  And then people complain.
[01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:16.193]  On the YouTube video that we're being busybodies.
[01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:20.316]  No, I see my neighbor's kid throwing a fit and I see him spank him.
[01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:21.517]  That's illegal and lawful.
[01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.838]  I don't call the police.
[01:15:22.838 --> 01:15:25.660]  I see my neighbor putting guns in their car to go shooting.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.481]  I don't call the police.
[01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:29.423]  If I saw someone with a gun creeping around, I'd call the police.
[01:15:29.423 --> 01:15:31.684]  It's all body language.
[01:15:31.684 --> 01:15:36.388]  If I see somebody not paying their taxes, I'm not going to tattle on them.
[01:15:36.388 --> 01:15:39.850]  If I see somebody smoking pot, I'm not going to call the police on them.
[01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:40.431]  I can't tell you
[01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:44.704]  Well, we've covered it and had the family on.
[01:15:44.704 --> 01:15:55.709]  How many people have their little kid taken because they go in to get a medical test done and they find marijuana in daddy's system so they take the two-year-old and a month later the child's dead in the custody of the CPS?
[01:15:57.577 --> 01:16:07.245]  I can't tell you how many people I know or run into who go to have a baby and who the mama was just at a party and had a low-level THC in her because she got secondhand marijuana smoke.
[01:16:07.245 --> 01:16:09.107]  Or so what if she took a hit of it?
[01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:12.330]  Shows it doesn't do anything to a fetus, comparatively to other stuff in the environment.
[01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:13.511]  And then they come and take their baby.
[01:16:13.951 --> 01:16:15.031]  No one's warning you.
[01:16:15.031 --> 01:16:17.072]  No one's telling you about the real danger.
[01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:20.052]  I am a busybody here to tell you there's government kidnappers.
[01:16:20.052 --> 01:16:31.515]  I am a busybody telling you that almost everyone I know that owns 50, 60, 100 acres outside Austin, Hayes County, Travis County, Williamson County, Californian liberals have moved here.
[01:16:31.515 --> 01:16:33.015]  Everyone I know.
[01:16:33.015 --> 01:16:34.675]  Everyone, including myself.
[01:16:34.675 --> 01:16:36.996]  I just didn't go out to the gate and answer it.
[01:16:36.996 --> 01:16:42.977]  When you shoot guns on your own property, legally and lawfully, the neighbors begin screaming in fear and call the police on you.
[01:16:45.123 --> 01:16:58.819]  I was out in the woods with my kids shooting 410 shotgun last year and I looked over to not even the property next to me that a finger comes down of a 200 acre ranch yet there's only about an acre of it that comes down by the creek over that about
[01:16:59.798 --> 01:17:03.961]  Four or five acres away, I heard a woman screaming, they're shooting, they're shooting, run!
[01:17:03.961 --> 01:17:10.306]  Finished my shooting, went back in, later, about 30 minutes later, saw the sheriff's department driving down by the road, looking.
[01:17:10.306 --> 01:17:12.948]  I mean, this is the country we live in, folks.
[01:17:12.948 --> 01:17:17.051]  I live in the middle of the countryside, and if I fire a firearm,
[01:17:18.112 --> 01:17:20.733]  On my own property, they call the police on me.
[01:17:20.733 --> 01:17:25.975]  Now what I love is all of us and the neighbors have decided to shoot more, so they're shooting almost every day.
[01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.456]  There is every weekend, and so now the police don't come.
[01:17:28.456 --> 01:17:33.318]  We exercise our open carry, our open use of it, so the Californians learn.
[01:17:33.318 --> 01:17:35.059]  And I'm sorry, it's always Californians.
[01:17:35.879 --> 01:17:44.987]  Californians are colonizing Central Texas, and there's a lot of great Californians, you know, that have come here that are patriots, but the big wave that have ruined California are now coming here.
[01:17:44.987 --> 01:17:46.849]  So I want to talk about those zombies.
[01:17:46.849 --> 01:17:55.856]  The FaceTime, the screen time, the lowering of the IQ, all the studies, all the statistics, people losing touch with reality, people not rendering aid.
[01:17:55.856 --> 01:18:00.621]  How bad is it going to get in a narcissistic mass Stockholm syndrome collapse?
[01:18:01.201 --> 01:18:02.762]  Because I'm already seeing society collapse.
[01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:04.103]  They're not fixing vehicles.
[01:18:04.103 --> 01:18:05.425]  They're not fixing highways.
[01:18:05.425 --> 01:18:06.986]  They're not fixing railways.
[01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:09.288]  They're all falling apart worse than the world now.
[01:18:09.288 --> 01:18:10.349]  Education's imploding.
[01:18:10.349 --> 01:18:11.610]  IQ's imploding.
[01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:12.751]  Health's imploding.
[01:18:12.751 --> 01:18:14.912]  We are a cursed nation.
[01:18:14.912 --> 01:18:22.479]  How do you get someone out of the smartphones and out of the computers and out of watching 10 hours of television and video games a day?
[01:18:23.712 --> 01:18:34.158]  I use them, but literally only for communication, only to shoot videos and upload them on the spot, and then I turn it off and put it in a Faraday cage, a little bag, a little lead bag.
[01:18:34.158 --> 01:18:40.941]  And people laugh at that, just like they laughed ten years ago when they'd come to my house and I'd have a sticker over the camera, and I said, the FBI activates that.
[01:18:40.941 --> 01:18:41.942]  They use it in federal court.
[01:18:41.942 --> 01:18:45.284]  It was all admitted then, but the media wouldn't touch it.
[01:18:45.284 --> 01:18:49.386]  Now people don't laugh about me sticking phones in a Faraday cage when I'm not using them.
[01:18:50.205 --> 01:18:51.786]  Now people don't laugh when they come over.
[01:18:51.786 --> 01:18:55.149]  Everybody's sticking the stickers on there and deactivating the microphone.
[01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:56.450]  Problem is they turn it on anyways.
[01:18:56.450 --> 01:19:00.052]  I told you they use OnStar to listen to you.
[01:19:00.052 --> 01:19:00.973]  Of course they do.
[01:19:00.973 --> 01:19:01.614]  Without warrants.
[01:19:01.614 --> 01:19:03.235]  That's all been declassified or leaked.
[01:19:05.293 --> 01:19:08.354]  I know what I'm talking about is the point, and I'm not on a high horse here, folks.
[01:19:08.354 --> 01:19:11.596]  We've got to admit how bad it is and stand up against it.
[01:19:11.596 --> 01:19:15.558]  I want to hear from you on the zombiosis, what you're seeing in your area.
[01:19:15.558 --> 01:19:19.160]  People are either waking up more or they're getting more into the matrix.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.100]  How do we wake them up?
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.401]  What are you seeing in your area?
[01:19:21.401 --> 01:19:22.081]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:22.081 --> 01:19:22.741]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:22.741 --> 01:19:25.182]  But as Howard Beatles said in the great 1970s network,
[01:19:34.932 --> 01:19:37.954]  I don't know what all the answers are, but I know first you've got to get mad.
[01:19:37.954 --> 01:19:39.575]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:41.357]  My life has value!
[01:19:41.357 --> 01:19:42.958]  Now I want you to go to the window.
[01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:48.982]  I want you to stick your head out and say, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[01:19:48.982 --> 01:19:50.683]  My life has value!
[01:19:50.683 --> 01:19:52.085]  And that is where it begins.
[01:19:52.085 --> 01:19:54.106]  You've got to get out of your trance yourself.
[01:19:54.106 --> 01:19:55.447]  I've got to get out of my trance.
[01:19:55.447 --> 01:19:58.769]  We've got to take proactive measures to pull out of the matrix.
[01:19:58.769 --> 01:19:59.370]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:09.977]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:18.063]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:20:18.363 --> 01:20:23.248]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:24:25.249 --> 01:24:26.270]  Hey!
[01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:27.430]  Teacher!
[01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:31.812]  Leave them kids alone!
[01:24:31.812 --> 01:24:43.137]  That's part of the song right here.
[01:24:43.137 --> 01:24:43.758]  Hey!
[01:24:43.758 --> 01:24:45.258]  Brainwasher!
[01:24:45.258 --> 01:24:46.519]  Leave them kids alone!
[01:24:50.188 --> 01:24:55.272]  Well, you're gonna be in love with my fish bashing your brains out.
[01:24:55.272 --> 01:24:56.173]  How's that sound?
[01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:22.136]  Let's go ahead, and you touched my kids.
[01:25:22.136 --> 01:25:23.156]  You're dead.
[01:25:23.156 --> 01:25:24.637]  Period.
[01:25:24.637 --> 01:25:29.421]  Let's go to Artie in Tennessee, listening on WBCR 1470 AM.
[01:25:29.421 --> 01:25:32.523]  And what do you say about the zombie state?
[01:25:32.523 --> 01:25:34.844]  What are you seeing in your area?
[01:25:34.844 --> 01:25:37.406]  Sir, it's downright scary here.
[01:25:37.406 --> 01:25:40.208]  You never thought this would happen in the Bible Belt.
[01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:46.172]  And what's really got me is a lot of people are into this Obamacare website.
[01:25:47.088 --> 01:25:50.751]  It tells you right on the website that the information will be shared.
[01:25:50.751 --> 01:25:54.334]  But here's something, sir, you may have may have not thought about.
[01:25:54.334 --> 01:25:58.577]  You can get exempt through a Christian health care sharing ministry.
[01:25:58.577 --> 01:26:00.598]  You know, David Knight is part of that.
[01:26:00.598 --> 01:26:02.960]  He says it works great.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:10.386]  And that's the power of the religious exemption, because Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, privilege for exercise thereof.
[01:26:10.386 --> 01:26:13.468]  So that's the great, quote, waiver out of vaccines, everything.
[01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:16.030]  And yes, he did a special report on that a few months ago.
[01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.851]  But tell folks about it.
[01:26:17.551 --> 01:26:19.832]  Well, sir, but that's not really what's scaring me.
[01:26:19.832 --> 01:26:38.705]  What's scaring me is, yes, that's the great alternative, but the government's going to have record of all the Christians that have opted out of it, and I just wonder, are they not going to use that as a database that when it times to start coming for the guillotine... I totally agree with you, but we're way past that, brother.
[01:26:38.705 --> 01:26:40.086]  They have spot on everything.
[01:26:40.766 --> 01:26:43.649]  I mean, they know everybody's deepest, darkest secrets.
[01:26:43.649 --> 01:26:45.510]  They've got algorithms.
[01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:50.314]  They've got psychological databases.
[01:26:50.314 --> 01:26:54.177]  We're already all on the list, and we've got to go public.
[01:26:54.177 --> 01:26:55.638]  That's the answer.
[01:26:55.638 --> 01:26:57.700]  People always say, aren't you paranoid they're going to come get you?
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:58.881]  No, I'm the opposite of paranoid.
[01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:02.984]  I'm paranoid they're going to win, and that we're not going to warn as many people as we can.
[01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:05.527]  Because look, when this system finally goes into place,
[01:27:06.347 --> 01:27:07.768]  And that's a foregone conclusion.
[01:27:07.768 --> 01:27:09.649]  The beast system is going to happen.
[01:27:09.649 --> 01:27:11.890]  Imagine all the work we've done to wake people up.
[01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:13.311]  That's what the Bible says.
[01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:18.113]  They'll be the greatest awakening and coming to God that world's ever seen.
[01:27:18.113 --> 01:27:22.075]  Because when everybody remembers what we said, we're going to fall to evil.
[01:27:22.075 --> 01:27:24.497]  The beast will wage war against the saints and overcome them.
[01:27:24.497 --> 01:27:26.898]  But that's only round one, brother.
[01:27:26.898 --> 01:27:28.819]  And I'm in this for the long haul.
[01:27:28.819 --> 01:27:32.060]  I mean, I absolutely know that it's all being fulfilled.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.302]  And we don't know if it's this year or 20 years from now or 100.
[01:27:35.663 --> 01:27:38.465]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what's going to happen.
[01:27:38.465 --> 01:27:44.852]  But the point is, is that I'm fully committed to this because we're worried about people's souls.
[01:27:44.852 --> 01:27:46.694]  And look at what the New World Order does.
[01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.636]  It literally steals the intellect.
[01:27:48.636 --> 01:27:51.058]  It steals the spark of humanity.
[01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:52.840]  These people have dead eyes, these zombies.
[01:27:53.641 --> 01:27:56.603]  They have been literally sucked dry.
[01:27:56.603 --> 01:27:58.785]  We're fighting spiritual body snatchers.
[01:27:58.785 --> 01:28:00.606]  We're in a science fiction movie.
[01:28:00.606 --> 01:28:01.407]  It's all around us.
[01:28:01.407 --> 01:28:01.947]  God bless you.
[01:28:01.947 --> 01:28:03.188]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:03.188 --> 01:28:05.389]  Now let's talk to Corey in Tennessee.
[01:28:05.389 --> 01:28:06.430]  No, in Connecticut.
[01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:07.271]  Corey, you're on the air.
[01:28:07.271 --> 01:28:07.651]  Go ahead.
[01:28:07.651 --> 01:28:09.012]  Hey, Alex.
[01:28:09.012 --> 01:28:09.653]  How you doing, bud?
[01:28:09.653 --> 01:28:10.193]  Pretty good, brother.
[01:28:11.277 --> 01:28:25.881]  Hey, uh, just real quick, uh, real quick, Pointers, uh, dealing with that, uh, obviously, with your Apple iPhone crap and all this other stuff, you gotta deal with, uh, the stand-down or stare-down generation, so to speak, is what I call it, but it's more and more prevalent.
[01:28:25.881 --> 01:28:38.785]  Um, uh, something that sparked my interest the other day that, uh, that really got me into this is, like, this omnification is, uh, your, uh, your news article that you did just the other day, even if you could put that on screen for your viewers, about what just happened here in Connecticut.
[01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:48.403]  I work literally next to where that news report came from and it was interesting going down talking to viewers and also talking to the people standing in line.
[01:28:48.403 --> 01:29:01.186]  I actually got to do that on my lunch break and it's just very very intriguing because the number one question that came up that day about like even the zombification so to speak of the mindset is everyone in that line
[01:29:02.091 --> 01:29:10.901]  It's still questioning Sandy Hook, and now it's being talked about on all the local news affiliates here in the state.
[01:29:10.901 --> 01:29:13.163]  By the way, that would have been a megaviral video.
[01:29:13.163 --> 01:29:19.650]  As a citizen journalist, you just keep a camera with you, or your devil phone with you, but you can get some good out of the devil that way.
[01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:24.674]  Is that you'd have gone over and videotaped you talking to the folks lined up to turn their guns in?
[01:29:24.674 --> 01:29:29.157]  Just hundreds and hundreds of them lined up to register them to then have them basically taken?
[01:29:29.157 --> 01:29:31.298]  That would have been an incredibly important report.
[01:29:31.298 --> 01:29:35.581]  In fact, we almost tried to send a reporter there, but we don't know if those lines were continuing.
[01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:36.341]  Stay there.
[01:29:36.341 --> 01:29:42.205]  I want to come back and find out more from you on the other side than Frank, Karen, Chris, Jim, and others.
[01:29:42.205 --> 01:29:47.168]  It's the first show of the new year, January 1st, 2014.
[01:29:47.168 --> 01:29:48.990]  I'm Alex Jones in fullwars.com.
[01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:54.073]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.073 --> 01:30:00.997]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.997 --> 01:30:04.018]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:30:04.018 --> 01:30:09.021]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:30:09.021 --> 01:30:16.205]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:30:16.345 --> 01:30:21.972]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:30:21.972 --> 01:30:25.997]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:30:25.997 --> 01:30:30.723]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:30:30.723 --> 01:30:35.949]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.

[01:30:39.432 --> 01:30:41.935]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:30:41.935 --> 01:30:46.699]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:30:46.699 --> 01:30:49.582]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:30:49.582 --> 01:30:56.589]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:30:56.769 --> 01:30:58.050]  We're getting prepared.
[01:30:58.050 --> 01:30:58.711]  Are you?

[01:31:00.853 --> 01:31:11.562]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:31:11.562 --> 01:31:13.404]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:31:13.604 --> 01:31:14.484]  Fluoride.
[01:31:14.484 --> 01:31:16.405]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:16.405 --> 01:31:22.988]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:31:22.988 --> 01:31:25.930]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:27.911]  And the results are on record.
[01:31:27.911 --> 01:31:34.234]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:31:34.234 --> 01:31:36.655]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:31:36.655 --> 01:31:39.596]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:31:39.596 --> 01:31:42.958]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:31:43.078 --> 01:31:48.503]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:53.608]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:32:00.794 --> 01:32:05.538]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:32:05.538 --> 01:32:08.641]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:32:08.641 --> 01:32:14.206]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:32:14.206 --> 01:32:15.807]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:32:16.127 --> 01:32:17.768]  We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.768 --> 01:32:22.431]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:22.431 --> 01:32:26.673]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:32:26.673 --> 01:32:29.215]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:32:29.215 --> 01:32:35.458]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:11.007 --> 01:33:17.071]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:33:17.071 --> 01:33:22.074]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:33:22.074 --> 01:33:26.297]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:33:26.297 --> 01:33:28.238]  So that's why... It's not about food.
[01:33:28.238 --> 01:33:28.978]  We're gonna dumb them down.
[01:33:28.978 --> 01:33:31.540]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:33:38.168 --> 01:33:40.309]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.309 --> 01:33:43.270]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:56.118 --> 01:33:58.679]  All right, we're going right back to your phone calls here.
[01:33:58.679 --> 01:34:00.680]  Finishing up with Corey in Connecticut.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:14.144]  For those that don't know, we can probably pull up some of the video of the media approvingly, oh, look at folks in Connecticut, just like in England, just like in Australia, lining up to register their legally owned firearms.
[01:34:14.144 --> 01:34:16.085]  And then, of course, you know what the next step is.
[01:34:16.085 --> 01:34:17.965]  They always ban them.
[01:34:17.965 --> 01:34:25.508]  New York State is now using gun registration from years past, like New York did in the 50s, to now order the guns handed back in.
[01:34:27.225 --> 01:34:31.829]  And the goal of the Brady Center and all of them is victim disarmament.
[01:34:31.829 --> 01:34:37.533]  So people lined up like good slaves to register their firearms.
[01:34:37.533 --> 01:34:44.018]  And we were talking to the caller, which I wish he'd have shot video of this, and he said he was talking to the crowds and they were questioning Sandy Hook.
[01:34:44.018 --> 01:34:48.321]  Well, they bulldozed the building and they won't allow any of it released.
[01:34:48.321 --> 01:34:51.044]  Probably so they can produce fake video and audio, which is very easy to do.
[01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:59.958]  I think it's show Godzilla attacking any building they want, or show Kennedy saying things he never said, or John Wayne pitching products, you know, 20-something years after he's dead.
[01:34:59.958 --> 01:35:02.741]  Hardly John Wayne's been dead since like, what, 1980, 1981?
[01:35:02.741 --> 01:35:04.122]  I forget when he died.
[01:35:04.122 --> 01:35:05.663]  But that's longer than that.
[01:35:05.663 --> 01:35:06.384]  That's like 30 years.
[01:35:06.384 --> 01:35:07.124]  It's weird to get old.
[01:35:07.805 --> 01:35:14.450]  But we are taking your calls right now about the public in this zombie-like trance that they're getting deeper and deeper into.
[01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:16.792]  Corey, quantify what you were saying.
[01:35:16.792 --> 01:35:23.337]  You were talking to the folks at your lunch break, because you're at the building right next to where this was happening, and describe what you saw.
[01:35:25.185 --> 01:35:44.988]  Well, pretty much the line that the local news agency had shot was the many multiplicities of the gun owners coming in, and it's amazing because now, if you really think about it, all their faces are now on camera for the public to see that, oh, these are the people that are going to go turn their guns in, but that's just another side story.
[01:35:45.188 --> 01:35:50.012]  No, no, the Feds admit that's why they pay for voluntary DNA checkpoints.
[01:35:50.012 --> 01:35:52.834]  Now they're making them mandatory just to get the cops trained.
[01:35:52.834 --> 01:35:56.077]  Every people that we've done this before, that's how it always works.
[01:35:56.077 --> 01:36:02.262]  The gun buyback programs are to create the idea that guns are bad and the image of you turning them into police.
[01:36:02.262 --> 01:36:04.243]  It's total Pavlovian conditioning.
[01:36:04.243 --> 01:36:06.105]  Go ahead.
[01:36:06.105 --> 01:36:12.570]  No, but going along with that, of all the things that stemmed out of this, obviously the law was created because of a certain circumstance here.
[01:36:13.394 --> 01:36:33.051]  And that was Sandy Hook and I'm not one to be one of those people that want to go out and write blogs about the craziness that's going on with that school but I'm a man of following the money and at my position I'm able to do so because I speak with police officers not only in that area but even state police after they released that Sandy Hook report.
[01:36:33.051 --> 01:36:37.835]  But the number one thing on the airwaves up here in the past few days since that report has been released
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:39.721]  We're good to go.
[01:36:52.952 --> 01:37:03.537]  Following the money, the donations, I had been going through YouTube checking out news clips and stuff because it's affecting me personally, along with friends, and they want answers.
[01:37:03.537 --> 01:37:10.660]  People of Connecticut want answers because this was created on... Well, we know there were multiple people in camo and black pants, the same outfit.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:23.126]  Uh, that was seen, later caught in a helicopter, then the media denied those arrests had been made, then later said, well, it's restricted access, but it was anti-terror units from nearby counties.
[01:37:23.126 --> 01:37:31.009]  I mean, man, and then, I'm not saying people didn't really die, folks, but they definitely had actors rolling out with BS.
[01:37:31.009 --> 01:37:36.512]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, we don't know really what happened, but the official story is not true.
[01:37:37.881 --> 01:37:40.524]  Yes, and that's leading into my next point.
[01:37:40.524 --> 01:37:46.290]  I'm going to pay attention to the facts on that, but the thing that most people do not know...
[01:37:48.168 --> 01:37:54.091]  Two weeks after the incident, I had created a post regarding GE.
[01:37:54.091 --> 01:37:59.413]  If you guys remember the report on Adam Lanza with the DNA test of the evil gene.
[01:37:59.413 --> 01:38:02.434]  But I didn't really understand what GE was all about at the time.
[01:38:02.434 --> 01:38:06.595]  And then I started digging in more to the people within the town and the local communities.
[01:38:06.595 --> 01:38:10.417]  And a Danbury officer, who just recently retired in the past two weeks,
[01:38:11.472 --> 01:38:28.199]  A canine lobster brought me up on something dealing with the police report, dealing with jurisdiction that no one in the country is challenging as to why the Connecticut State Police wrote this report and it's now starting to become more massive in the public here.
[01:38:28.199 --> 01:38:34.342]  I'm going to quantify for those that don't know what the report is because people always call in thinking everyone knows what you're talking about.
[01:38:35.598 --> 01:38:36.519]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:38:36.519 --> 01:38:53.892]  The state police here in Connecticut released the Sandy Hook report a few days ago regarding the audio, visual pictures, and the some-odd thousands of pages of documents, which was obviously put there in place after reviewing them for about eight hours straight, and multiple people have done that.
[01:38:53.892 --> 01:38:56.054]  Hey, get to the meat!
[01:38:56.054 --> 01:38:57.515]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:38:57.515 --> 01:39:00.637]  Basically, they're leaving out evidence regarding
[01:39:02.165 --> 01:39:05.690]  A man named John Trentacosta, I believe is his name.
[01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:10.716]  Through all the video reports, they're not telling you that all this Sandy Hook money...
[01:39:11.886 --> 01:39:27.296]  Is being funneled through the Federal Reserve, because I just recently found out that the neighbor of Adam Lanza, to where all the police were actually being located that morning, nobody paid attention to the video reports from the helicopters, but all the police were at the next door neighbor's house, which is John Costa.
[01:39:41.886 --> 01:39:42.526]  Look it up.
[01:39:42.526 --> 01:39:47.389]  It was run by the Pentagon in a government mind control program.
[01:39:47.389 --> 01:39:53.412]  He was in a super advanced classified DARPA brain interface program with the Air Force.
[01:39:53.412 --> 01:39:59.596]  He was handled by a top Air Force psychiatrist who formerly commanded a major base in San Antonio.
[01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:02.658]  And was not taking patients previously.
[01:40:02.658 --> 01:40:05.459]  Who had all of the notebooks and things.
[01:40:05.459 --> 01:40:07.661]  He said I was under mind control.
[01:40:07.661 --> 01:40:09.002]  He told people in the jail that.
[01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:09.702]  They confirmed it.
[01:40:09.702 --> 01:40:12.184]  Later they tried to say he wasn't next to cells.
[01:40:12.184 --> 01:40:12.905]  Turned out he was.
[01:40:12.905 --> 01:40:14.446]  I mean, I'm not going to go into the whole deal.
[01:40:14.446 --> 01:40:15.927]  Multiple shooters.
[01:40:15.927 --> 01:40:17.908]  Smoked grenades before.
[01:40:17.908 --> 01:40:21.090]  You get somebody drugged up who isn't even doing the shooting.
[01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:22.051]  You do the shooting.
[01:40:22.051 --> 01:40:24.532]  Then you... The person on drugs doesn't remember.
[01:40:24.532 --> 01:40:26.574]  I mean, that's one way to do it.
[01:40:27.765 --> 01:40:29.266]  And that's what happened there.
[01:40:29.266 --> 01:40:33.449]  So if they would do that there, and we're able to prove that that was a staged event.
[01:40:33.449 --> 01:40:37.192]  Boston bombing, I don't want to take an hour doing this.
[01:40:37.192 --> 01:40:39.914]  It's the same deal there as well.
[01:40:39.914 --> 01:40:43.897]  If you're a new listener, just go look at our Boston bombing coverage from a year ago.
[01:40:43.897 --> 01:40:45.759]  Or less than a year ago.
[01:40:45.759 --> 01:40:50.462]  And you're going to see all sorts of stuff like this in the new year as well.
[01:40:50.462 --> 01:40:55.206]  There's one of the headlines, Colorado shooter was under psychiatric care of ex-US Air Force doctor.
[01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:57.492]  That's London Independent.
[01:40:57.492 --> 01:40:58.832]  And then it just goes through it all.
[01:40:58.832 --> 01:41:09.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, his dad was in high-level black ops, developing the top-level algorithms for so much of the stuff going on in the stock market.
[01:41:09.878 --> 01:41:17.102]  He was under a DARPA program in brain interface.
[01:41:17.102 --> 01:41:22.885]  That's just like Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was in the MKUltra program for 10 years.
[01:41:22.885 --> 01:41:24.086]  That was declassified.
[01:41:25.439 --> 01:41:29.981]  After he was arrested.
[01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:33.183]  But only the LA Times reported on it.
[01:41:33.183 --> 01:41:38.085]  The Alexis shooter, Patsy, from the Naval Yard, said he was under my control.
[01:41:38.085 --> 01:41:42.407]  And he had a top security clearance.
[01:41:42.407 --> 01:41:44.728]  He had a secret clearance, not a top secret clearance.
[01:41:44.728 --> 01:41:46.669]  He was in a top secret area.
[01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:49.050]  An area holding top secret compartments.
[01:41:49.753 --> 01:41:50.493]  I'll put it to you that way.
[01:41:50.493 --> 01:41:53.655]  And he kept calling the police saying, they're in my mind, they're mind controlling me.
[01:41:53.655 --> 01:41:57.437]  Folks, you do that repeatedly and call the police, and you're going to lose your security clearance.
[01:41:57.437 --> 01:41:59.177]  But he's able to go in and do all this.
[01:41:59.177 --> 01:42:00.458]  I mean, I could just go on for hours.
[01:42:00.458 --> 01:42:03.600]  They're running Patsy operations.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:11.143]  Turns out Tamerlan Czarnev told friends and family, it's coming out in court, he was in the CIA and under mind control.
[01:42:11.143 --> 01:42:13.284]  And it's not like he was some schizophrenic.
[01:42:13.284 --> 01:42:15.065]  The FBI lied and said they didn't know who he was.
[01:42:15.065 --> 01:42:16.946]  And for two days, who is this on the news?
[01:42:18.046 --> 01:42:20.146]  So they start desperately calling the FBI saying, what are you doing?
[01:42:20.146 --> 01:42:22.147]  We're part of an operation with you.
[01:42:22.147 --> 01:42:26.908]  And the older brother had been sent to Chechnya in operations with the CIA.
[01:42:26.908 --> 01:42:31.629]  And it had his cover blown two years before the Boston bombing by the Russian intelligence services.
[01:42:31.629 --> 01:42:33.149]  And that's mainstream news.
[01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:36.910]  It's not like he says he was under mind control and then there's no proof.
[01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:41.010]  This is literal born supremacy type stuff.
[01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:42.411]  Every stinking one of them.
[01:42:42.411 --> 01:42:43.511]  And yes, Sandy Hook,
[01:42:45.029 --> 01:42:53.712]  Was a real school with real kids, but you had to have actors there with cutout families who weren't assigned to the school who could then come out and put out the PR.
[01:42:53.712 --> 01:42:54.952]  Because man, you watch it.
[01:42:54.952 --> 01:42:57.753]  I've seen Anderson Cooper, who's CIA, on record again.
[01:42:57.753 --> 01:42:58.253]  You don't believe me?
[01:42:58.253 --> 01:42:59.214]  Just search it.
[01:42:59.214 --> 01:43:02.415]  His nose disappearing in green screen.
[01:43:02.415 --> 01:43:03.635]  I've seen it over and over again.
[01:43:03.635 --> 01:43:05.215]  Not video breakup, folks.
[01:43:05.215 --> 01:43:06.776]  Not, no, green screen.
[01:43:06.776 --> 01:43:08.256]  We have green screen too.
[01:43:08.256 --> 01:43:08.897]  I've worked with it for 18 years.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:14.021]  I used to do my Axis television show with a green screen behind me.
[01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:16.281]  I mean, I know what green screen looks like.
[01:43:16.281 --> 01:43:20.562]  They weren't in downtown, you know, that area of Sandy Hook.
[01:43:20.562 --> 01:43:21.282]  They weren't.
[01:43:21.282 --> 01:43:24.523]  They were doing fake stuff.
[01:43:24.523 --> 01:43:29.864]  I saw shots where there's green screen and it's looping, where the paper's blowing, and then it blows again the same way.
[01:43:29.864 --> 01:43:32.624]  It's like, oh my gosh, they think we're so dumb.
[01:43:32.624 --> 01:43:34.505]  I don't know what they did at Sandy Hook.
[01:43:34.505 --> 01:43:36.065]  I know what they did with Boston bombing.
[01:43:37.466 --> 01:43:41.567]  I know what they did, and this is freaking me out.
[01:43:41.567 --> 01:43:45.708]  I wish this wasn't real.
[01:43:45.708 --> 01:43:47.348]  I wish this wasn't true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:47.348 --> 01:43:54.729]  It makes me physically sick when a caller starts bringing this stuff up, and I almost don't want to know anymore.
[01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:56.370]  I mean, I know what people are talking about.
[01:43:56.370 --> 01:43:59.270]  It is so incredibly frustrating.
[01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:01.971]  By the way, I'm not just saying Anderson Cooper's CIA.
[01:44:01.971 --> 01:44:02.811]  He admits he is.
[01:44:04.192 --> 01:44:06.654]  And I mean the bad people at the CIA.
[01:44:06.654 --> 01:44:10.517]  And I don't know exactly what they pulled there, but it's bad.
[01:44:10.517 --> 01:44:19.044]  With all their Democratic Party operatives clearly out there reading scripts, clearly out there doing these pieces, some of them start breaking down laughing.
[01:44:19.044 --> 01:44:26.190]  What they did is they had a drill, they had some people involved, I believe they killed some real people, because they always enjoy that.
[01:44:27.315 --> 01:44:29.155]  But then there was some other setup stuff.
[01:44:29.155 --> 01:44:34.656]  Just like on 9-11, they had script readers suddenly all over the news within 15 minutes saying the same message.
[01:44:34.656 --> 01:44:49.519]  Former CIA Director Jim, and then on the ground, guys in ball caps, clearly reading lines, clearly professional, going, well, the plane's just slammed in and the jet fuel went in, causing a pancaking effect, and then the towers came down.
[01:44:49.519 --> 01:44:50.059]  Thank you.
[01:44:50.059 --> 01:44:51.639]  Then they'd cut to the next person.
[01:44:51.639 --> 01:44:53.039]  And they weren't interviewing a bunch of people.
[01:44:53.039 --> 01:44:56.000]  They would just cut to, we have one guy on the street who thinks he knows what happened.
[01:44:57.178 --> 01:45:06.726]  After they started collapsing, within 15 minutes of that, and I was sitting there watching it, and it's just, you know something when it's fake!
[01:45:06.726 --> 01:45:14.712]  I mean, it's simple, especially when you work in media, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:14.712 --> 01:45:20.456]  It is, it is, it is really, really, really, really interesting, and it needs to be investigated.
[01:45:20.456 --> 01:45:21.978]  Yeah, go ahead and show that video.
[01:45:22.964 --> 01:45:23.404]  Go ahead.
[01:45:23.404 --> 01:45:26.045]  I mean, this is a sad father who's sad here, though.
[01:45:26.045 --> 01:45:27.866]  I'm not saying it's staged.
[01:45:27.866 --> 01:45:31.827]  He's laughing, he's smiling, and then he walks up and then starts crying.
[01:45:31.827 --> 01:45:37.170]  And then we saw a whole bunch of other parents do the exact same thing.
[01:45:37.170 --> 01:45:39.130]  And of course, you know, I took acting classes.
[01:45:39.130 --> 01:45:40.151]  I've been in some big movies.
[01:45:42.295 --> 01:45:50.864]  You see people get into method acting and get into the zone, and you know exactly what... I've seen actors do exactly what this father did, where they start huffing and puffing to cry, but I think this was real, don't you?
[01:45:50.864 --> 01:45:54.988]  I think when Glenn Beck would cry on TV, it was real, too.
[01:45:54.988 --> 01:45:57.050]  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not talking about that guy.
[01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:59.652]  I'm not saying that's fake, like people said.
[01:45:59.652 --> 01:46:01.094]  Oh, no.
[01:46:01.094 --> 01:46:06.259]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your phone calls talking about the zombiosis of the general population.
[01:46:10.143 --> 01:46:30.599]  But I want to play this report from a year ago, the premiere of Rex Jones, he's now 11 years old, and when folks watch this video, Terrorism 101 by Rex Jones, he literally came up with this himself listening to the show, he's smarter than most adults I know, he speaks with a British accent in it, not because he's British, as the conspiracy now is, because
[01:46:31.505 --> 01:46:35.607]  His mother didn't want his face on TV yet, so he wore a Guy Fawkes mask.
[01:46:35.607 --> 01:46:41.209]  You know, like Guy Fawkes telling you about the terror being staged in that movie, V for Vendetta.
[01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:46.151]  And so that's why he's wearing the Guy Fawkes mask and speaks with a British accent.
[01:46:46.151 --> 01:46:48.112]  For the people that can't seem to figure that out out there.
[01:46:49.012 --> 01:47:11.367]  But here is his report now that we have the globalists activating staged terror attacks through the Saudi Arabians all over Southern Russia to destabilize the Olympics as promised as payment back to Putin for daring to not let them put al-qaeda in charge of Syria and murder all the Christians Now as payback they're doing this here is his report terrorism 101
[01:47:18.592 --> 01:47:18.674]  Yeah.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:31.921]  First off, our terrorist group needs a scary name.
[01:47:31.921 --> 01:47:34.061]  Can you say, L.C.I.A.A.D.A.?
[01:47:34.061 --> 01:47:35.782]  Let's try again.
[01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.382]  L.C.I.A.A.D.A.
[01:47:37.382 --> 01:47:39.483]  Ah, it does roll off the tongue.
[01:47:39.483 --> 01:47:40.583]  L.C.I.A.A.D.A.
[01:47:40.583 --> 01:47:41.763]  It's a perfect name.
[01:47:41.763 --> 01:47:46.984]  Now let's say the green piece here represents the terrorists.
[01:47:46.984 --> 01:47:53.726]  The terrorists then move into Pakistan or Afghanistan or whateverstan is not under banker control.
[01:47:55.424 --> 01:47:59.307]  The media then joins in to hype up the terror threat.
[01:47:59.307 --> 01:48:04.631]  Once the terror threat is established, the banksters, puppets, send in the troops to take out the terrorists they put in there in the first place.
[01:48:04.631 --> 01:48:09.294]  Then the bankers install their own dictator to take control of the resources and oppress the people.
[01:48:24.298 --> 01:48:48.141]  As a bonus, the banks, via the black ops and intelligence agencies, will then ship the drugs back into the host country so they can imprison their own citizens for using the drugs, make huge profits selling the drugs which finance other terror operations around the globe, and the cherry on the top is billions upon billions made on money laundering operations for all the bankers.
[01:48:48.641 --> 01:48:52.043]  In a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.
[01:48:52.043 --> 01:48:54.565]  I know it grinds at your gut.
[01:48:54.565 --> 01:48:55.626]  How do you deal with it?
[01:48:55.626 --> 01:48:57.047]  What are you doing about it?
[01:48:57.047 --> 01:48:59.048]  Well, frankly, this is a part of their culture.
[01:48:59.048 --> 01:49:01.990]  So, while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.
[01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:25.583]  Well, that just about wraps it up for Terrorism 101, How Terrorism Really Works.
[01:49:25.583 --> 01:49:28.044]  I'm your friendly neighborhood patriot.
[01:49:28.044 --> 01:49:32.346]  And now remember what Big Brother and other authoritarians say.
[01:49:32.346 --> 01:49:35.647]  Whatever you do, don't visit Infowolves.com.
[01:49:35.647 --> 01:49:38.448]  Oh no, the control freaks don't like it.
[01:49:38.448 --> 01:49:42.769]  Alright, good job my son.
[01:49:42.769 --> 01:49:44.270]  My apprentice.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:49.322]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we can laugh about it, but that's what's really going on.
[01:49:49.322 --> 01:49:50.862]  They staged the Boston bombing.
[01:49:50.862 --> 01:49:52.663]  They staged Aurora.
[01:49:52.663 --> 01:49:56.224]  Sandy Hook has every trapping of being staged.
[01:49:56.224 --> 01:49:59.886]  They bare minimum staged a bunch of stuff after, as the PR pushed to get our guns.
[01:49:59.886 --> 01:50:01.886]  We know that.
[01:50:01.886 --> 01:50:08.589]  And Bloomberg kind of jumped the gun, too, and put orders out the day before to prepare an offensive against guns with their social networks.
[01:50:10.578 --> 01:50:15.662]  I mean, people false start in swimming and running, and in the NFL, you know, you'll get a false start.
[01:50:15.662 --> 01:50:16.923]  I mean, it's understandable.
[01:50:16.923 --> 01:50:24.469]  You guys announced that the World Trade Center 7 had fallen an hour before it did and 25 minutes before it did, exactly as it did then completely collapse.
[01:50:24.469 --> 01:50:29.793]  And it turned out it was a Reuters talking point loaded by the CIA into the BBC databanks, as we predicted.
[01:50:29.793 --> 01:50:31.534]  We could look at it and tell where it came from.
[01:50:31.534 --> 01:50:39.280]  So, you know, jump in the guns, kind of like they published that Kennedy had been killed by Lee Harvey Oswald in the Eastern Press two hours before he was even, his name was released.
[01:50:40.865 --> 01:50:43.146]  You know, you guys kind of screw up a little bit sometimes.
[01:50:43.146 --> 01:50:47.988]  Anthony Gucciardi has a new key report up on InfoWars.com that just went live.
[01:50:47.988 --> 01:50:55.472]  Did the government just buy 14 million dosages of potassium iodide because they're worried about Fukushima blowing up again?
[01:50:55.472 --> 01:50:57.073]  He'll be joining us coming up.
[01:50:57.073 --> 01:50:58.233]  But first, your phone calls.
[01:50:58.233 --> 01:50:59.074]  Thanks for being patient.
[01:51:01.107 --> 01:51:02.128]  The facts are in.
[01:51:02.128 --> 01:51:03.528]  The studies are legion.
[01:51:03.528 --> 01:51:11.053]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:51:11.053 --> 01:51:14.875]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:51:14.875 --> 01:51:15.456]  Simple.
[01:51:15.456 --> 01:51:20.179]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:51:20.179 --> 01:51:25.622]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:51:25.882 --> 01:51:31.429]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.

[01:51:42.222 --> 01:51:44.064]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:51:44.184 --> 01:51:46.786]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[01:54:02.653 --> 01:54:08.799]  Alright, I promise I'm going to your calls, Frank and Pris.
[01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:15.655]  Shauna, Jim, Karen, we're going to get to all of you just briefly.
[01:54:15.655 --> 01:54:19.257]  Two weeks ago we reported on this and broke this at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:19.257 --> 01:54:21.739]  Now ABC News is rolling it out.
[01:54:21.739 --> 01:54:28.905]  The black boxes that by law are in all the cars are meant to track everywhere you go by wireless internet.
[01:54:28.905 --> 01:54:29.846]  It's being done globally.
[01:54:30.566 --> 01:54:34.729]  Just like all the new appliances have this to track, control, and tax you.
[01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:39.593]  And now they're going to try to make it mandatory that they be activated in the name of safety.
[01:54:39.593 --> 01:54:43.616]  Like the new Toyotas and others have where it beeps when you get close to another car.
[01:54:43.616 --> 01:54:46.058]  And then it's going to report back your bad driving.
[01:54:46.058 --> 01:54:48.160]  Then your insurance is going to go up.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.121]  And then they're going to make you go to robot cars.
[01:54:50.962 --> 01:54:53.743]  Where your insurance is more if the robot doesn't control things.
[01:54:53.743 --> 01:54:55.104]  This has all been announced.
[01:54:55.104 --> 01:54:56.685]  So they're coming for your cars.
[01:54:56.685 --> 01:54:58.465]  They're coming for your freedom.
[01:54:58.465 --> 01:55:00.246]  And everything else I've told you is coming true.
[01:55:00.246 --> 01:55:02.147]  Are you going to fight this is a question.
[01:55:02.147 --> 01:55:05.488]  Feds may require cars to track each other to avoid crashes.
[01:55:05.488 --> 01:55:06.549]  See it's all nanny state.
[01:55:08.454 --> 01:55:14.819]  Oh, they need GPS tracking of all cell phones in the 96 law for your safety so they can track and listen to you.
[01:55:14.819 --> 01:55:18.983]  They want to make it illegal now to put your phone in a lead-lined bag so they can't track you.
[01:55:18.983 --> 01:55:22.466]  They are out-of-control crooks and they don't care about your safety.
[01:55:22.466 --> 01:55:24.507]  They hate you!
[01:55:24.507 --> 01:55:29.712]  Get it through your heads and all the morons that work for the feds that are going along with this and the corporations.
[01:55:29.712 --> 01:55:32.214]  You're going to be destroyed as well by this system, you fools!
[01:55:33.424 --> 01:55:44.670]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, we've got Gutiarty coming up about the Feds buying 14 million packages of iodine for a radiation event, the biggest purchase ever, bigger than during Fukushima.
[01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:46.771]  That's in an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:48.272]  Gutiarty just wrote another one.
[01:55:48.272 --> 01:55:51.334]  Is the government stockpiling iodine in preparation for a Fukushima meltdown?
[01:55:52.765 --> 01:55:55.189]  We have the best nascent iodine available.
[01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:57.091]  That's why I ran into this and used it.
[01:55:57.091 --> 01:55:59.775]  It had such great health effects, personally, that I said, that's it.
[01:55:59.775 --> 01:56:01.358]  Nobody knows about this.
[01:56:01.358 --> 01:56:08.148]  Nobody manufactures in bulk true nascent iodine that turns blue-purple on paper, not black like the other so-called nascent iodine.
[01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:09.468]  This stuff is incredible.
[01:56:09.468 --> 01:56:12.109]  It's purely absorbed right into the cells.
[01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:13.190]  It's amazing.
[01:56:13.190 --> 01:56:15.050]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.911]  Survival Shield.
[01:56:15.911 --> 01:56:22.933]  Now, you get it in a two-ounce bottle, and they're the fluoride shield with five other key ingredients that's supercharged, taking out the fluoride.
[01:56:22.933 --> 01:56:23.433]  You name it.
[01:56:23.433 --> 01:56:25.274]  Not just the radioactive isotopes.
[01:56:25.274 --> 01:56:26.975]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:26.975 --> 01:56:28.975]  And your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[01:56:28.975 --> 01:56:32.257]  But I would make the New Year's resolution.
[01:56:32.257 --> 01:56:33.277]  You know, just try it.
[01:56:33.277 --> 01:56:35.858]  And I've had no one say it was hype.
[01:56:37.895 --> 01:56:41.017]  But if you try it and don't like it, you supported the broadcast.
[01:56:41.017 --> 01:56:44.100]  I mean, and supported the free speech.
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:45.741]  So what do you got to lose?
[01:56:45.741 --> 01:56:48.463]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:48.463 --> 01:56:55.128]  We got the great Chiapas-grown coffee with all the trace minerals and stuff, volcanic soil.
[01:56:55.128 --> 01:56:55.888]  Best coffee out there.
[01:56:55.888 --> 01:56:56.989]  You've heard the right reviews.
[01:56:56.989 --> 01:56:58.310]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:59.471]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:56:59.471 --> 01:57:00.412]  We'll get to one call now.
[01:57:00.412 --> 01:57:02.593]  The rest coming up before Gucciardi joins us.
[01:57:02.593 --> 01:57:04.915]  Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina.
[01:57:04.915 --> 01:57:05.675]  Thanks for holding, brother.
[01:57:05.675 --> 01:57:06.116]  You're on the air.
[01:57:07.748 --> 01:57:12.712]  Yes, I called in specifically to talk about the zombie syndrome that I'm seeing around here.
[01:57:12.712 --> 01:57:23.001]  But first off, sir, I really resent what Jim Dunn said when you said that criminal elements inside the U.S.
[01:57:23.001 --> 01:57:30.827]  government would attack American people to stage an event to pose as a savior, sir.
[01:57:30.827 --> 01:57:32.809]  That's just outrageous.
[01:57:32.809 --> 01:57:35.271]  They'd never do that even though they've been caught over and over again.
[01:57:36.138 --> 01:57:39.201]  Well, if they ever did it, it was back in history, sir.
[01:57:39.201 --> 01:57:41.023]  And that kind of thing don't happen.
[01:57:41.023 --> 01:57:43.585]  It don't happen in the USA, sir.
[01:57:43.585 --> 01:57:44.045]  That's right.
[01:57:44.045 --> 01:57:45.527]  Everything's good around here.
[01:57:45.527 --> 01:57:47.889]  America!
[01:57:47.889 --> 01:57:49.731]  I actually had a guy do that at the Grand Canyon.
[01:57:49.731 --> 01:57:56.497]  I was like privately videotaping something talking about you and Takeover and he walked over like he wanted to attack me.
[01:57:56.497 --> 01:57:56.898]  Traitor!
[01:57:56.898 --> 01:57:57.618]  Go ahead.
[01:57:57.618 --> 01:57:58.019]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:58.803 --> 01:58:09.635]  Well, one thing I've noticed here, I'm a North Carolina native, but I only live about 10 minutes from the South Carolina border, and I'd like to spend more time there.
[01:58:09.635 --> 01:58:13.119]  In fact, I think I'd like to move there sometime soon.
[01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:16.083]  Start getting to that point, and then we'll finish up the next segment, but tell us about it.
[01:58:16.817 --> 01:58:25.963]  Well, there's no spirit of any patriotism, not really, not a spirit of liberty or anything, where I live in North Carolina.
[01:58:25.963 --> 01:58:32.348]  That could just be my area of North Carolina, but once you cross the border into South Carolina, you start seeing gads and blacks everywhere.
[01:58:32.348 --> 01:58:39.453]  And I'm just... That's because it's the southerner culture that's now readopted liberty and the gads that stay there.
[01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:47.504]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.078 --> 01:58:52.098]  The facts are in.
[01:58:52.098 --> 01:58:53.519]  The studies are legion.
[01:58:53.519 --> 01:59:01.021]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:01.021 --> 01:59:04.842]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:04.842 --> 01:59:05.422]  Simple.
[01:59:05.422 --> 01:59:10.143]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:10.143 --> 01:59:15.585]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:15.865 --> 01:59:21.391]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:59:21.391 --> 01:59:32.182]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:59:32.182 --> 01:59:34.024]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:59:34.144 --> 01:59:36.765]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:59:36.765 --> 01:59:38.925]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:59:38.925 --> 01:59:44.467]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:59:44.467 --> 01:59:48.868]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:59:48.868 --> 01:59:53.869]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:53.869 --> 01:59:56.250]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:59.031]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.714 --> 02:00:10.538]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.538 --> 02:00:12.139]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.139 --> 02:00:13.680]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.863 --> 02:00:21.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.365 --> 02:00:30.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into hour number three of the first live broadcast of 2014.
[02:00:30.808 --> 02:00:33.310]  Man, that's going to take some getting used to.
[02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:36.191]  Before I know it, it'll be 2015, 2020, 2030.
[02:00:36.191 --> 02:00:39.593]  The cybernetic merger, if they have their way.
[02:00:39.593 --> 02:00:40.434]  The singularity.
[02:00:41.738 --> 02:01:00.994]  Frank, in North Carolina, you know it's funny, the Army War College did reports two years ago now on how they'd have to crush a Tea Party rebellion in South and North Carolina and how their main mission, this is even mainstream news now, will be crushing American gun owners in the South in the Bible Belt.
[02:01:00.994 --> 02:01:03.235]  You hear Obama speeches about better clingers and
[02:01:04.036 --> 02:01:05.557]  Everybody, I mean, that's it.
[02:01:05.557 --> 02:01:17.221]  As bad off as the South is, and you know, unhealthy and obese and a lot of bad statistics in the South, I don't care if you're black, white, what it is in the South, people are more hospitable, they're nice, they say hi to you.
[02:01:17.221 --> 02:01:22.823]  I guarantee if you were in a rural area and a car was burning on the side of the road, you'd have a hundred people stop to help you.
[02:01:22.823 --> 02:01:24.544]  And they'd know what to do, too.
[02:01:24.544 --> 02:01:28.225]  And it's just, they're just more old-fashioned people.
[02:01:28.225 --> 02:01:30.086]  And that's why the globalists see it as the enemy.
[02:01:30.086 --> 02:01:32.647]  But go ahead and make your point about the zombiosis we're seeing.
[02:01:33.891 --> 02:01:36.332]  Well, you know, it's like everybody keeps saying.
[02:01:36.332 --> 02:01:39.794]  It's the obsession.
[02:01:39.794 --> 02:01:44.836]  I mean, literally, like an addiction obsession with spectator sports.
[02:01:44.836 --> 02:01:52.460]  It's almost like people... And, you know, of all sports, football is probably the one that I could probably myself become addicted to if I had thought of that.
[02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:55.421]  But I'm too strong because I know it's a trap.
[02:01:55.421 --> 02:01:56.402]  I know all... Well, that's it.
[02:01:56.402 --> 02:02:01.024]  I mean, and it's got the chief and the characters and the warrior leaders, the quarterback and the...
[02:02:03.362 --> 02:02:08.068]  The head coach is the head chief, and they have the battle, and it's all the rules.
[02:02:08.068 --> 02:02:13.515]  So it's primitive, and so that's their manhood, and it's designed to rob you of your future.
[02:02:13.515 --> 02:02:14.376]  That's why it's so sick.
[02:02:14.376 --> 02:02:14.637]  Go ahead.
[02:02:15.612 --> 02:02:16.493]  Yeah.
[02:02:16.493 --> 02:02:18.656]  And I mean, I see it as a Judas Code.
[02:02:18.656 --> 02:02:19.457]  I know what it is.
[02:02:19.457 --> 02:02:20.117]  It's a trap.
[02:02:20.117 --> 02:02:23.581]  Otherwise, the establishment wouldn't be pushing it like they do.
[02:02:23.581 --> 02:02:29.789]  The politicians, you know, GovCo, you know, big government, little government, government at all levels.
[02:02:29.789 --> 02:02:31.811]  I mean, it's all pushing it.
[02:02:34.055 --> 02:02:35.556]  I don't know what's going to happen, man.
[02:02:35.556 --> 02:02:36.776]  It's very depressing.
[02:02:36.776 --> 02:02:41.097]  I'm encouraged that the guy that called from Connecticut, that people are asking questions about Sandy Hook.
[02:02:41.097 --> 02:02:49.340]  I mean, you know, I say encouraging, you know, stories every now and then like that, but I mean, around here, people are just, they couldn't care less.
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:55.702]  And if you do, if you do care and you question things, they don't think you're crazy for, you know, believing what you believe.
[02:02:55.702 --> 02:02:58.623]  They just think you're crazy for giving a damn.
[02:02:58.623 --> 02:03:01.064]  That's what I've noticed, is it's like a shield.
[02:03:01.064 --> 02:03:01.484]  They wear
[02:03:02.506 --> 02:03:07.449]  They're dishonor as honor, and they think it's weird that you care.
[02:03:07.449 --> 02:03:09.371]  And what kind of world is that?
[02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:11.512]  A bunch of dishonorable cowards.
[02:03:11.512 --> 02:03:19.118]  That's why for all its problems and all its corruption, more and more, the only people I find that I even want to be around
[02:03:20.034 --> 02:03:22.955]  Other than patriots that are already awake, it's military people.
[02:03:22.955 --> 02:03:24.655]  Because at least they've been in combat.
[02:03:24.655 --> 02:03:27.316]  They know what it is to have to tie their shoelaces.
[02:03:27.316 --> 02:03:28.677]  They're not cowards.
[02:03:28.677 --> 02:03:32.638]  They care about something, even if they've been misdirected and been fooled before.
[02:03:32.638 --> 02:03:38.880]  I mean, even as bad as police are, a lot of bullies, thugs, out of control folks, that's what the feds are looking for.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:44.082]  But I find statistically more police that are awake and give a damn than the general public.
[02:03:44.082 --> 02:03:44.682]  I mean, it's just...
[02:03:45.422 --> 02:03:49.727]  It's scary to see the globalists loving how dumbed down the public is.
[02:03:49.727 --> 02:03:51.229]  I mean, they just love it.
[02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:52.911]  And this is my society.
[02:03:52.911 --> 02:03:53.993]  This is your society.
[02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:55.475]  This is our culture.
[02:03:55.475 --> 02:03:57.637]  And you can see it's getting worse.
[02:03:57.637 --> 02:03:59.600]  I mean, how far do you think this can go?
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.083]  Because historically, when stuff gets like this, everything collapses.
[02:04:03.083 --> 02:04:14.791]  Well, it's like they taught us in the Marine Corps, when you're going into a building, you don't want to maneuver yourself where your opponent is going to be backed into a corner.
[02:04:14.791 --> 02:04:24.817]  Typically, you like to come in and get on the rooftop so they have a way to get out because you don't want to back somebody into a corner and leave them with no option but to fight to the death.
[02:04:28.019 --> 02:04:45.732]  I think as long as the establishment and the scientific bureaucracy and whatnot give them a place to go where they don't actually have to fight, I think 95% of the American people are going to go right where the Judas Code tells them to go.
[02:04:46.849 --> 02:04:51.112]  It's sad, and you're right, the Globalists don't want to push us into a corner.
[02:04:51.112 --> 02:04:54.394]  They want to flesh us out, flush us out, then shoot us, take us out.
[02:04:54.394 --> 02:04:59.418]  That's why we've got to pick the battles and go on the offense politically, not let them always be on the offense.
[02:05:01.167 --> 02:05:10.256]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:10.256 --> 02:05:18.665]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:18.665 --> 02:05:23.310]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:30.314]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:30.314 --> 02:05:37.518]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:37.518 --> 02:05:44.522]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:44.522 --> 02:05:48.865]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:48.985 --> 02:05:52.368]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:05:52.368 --> 02:05:58.673]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:05:58.673 --> 02:06:01.195]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:01.195 --> 02:06:08.100]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:11.883]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:06:11.883 --> 02:06:13.745]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:06:13.945 --> 02:06:14.825]  Fluoride.
[02:06:14.825 --> 02:06:16.726]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:16.726 --> 02:06:23.308]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:06:23.308 --> 02:06:26.248]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:06:26.248 --> 02:06:28.229]  And the results are on record.
[02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:34.551]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:06:34.551 --> 02:06:36.971]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:06:36.971 --> 02:06:39.912]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:06:39.912 --> 02:06:43.293]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:06:43.413 --> 02:06:48.840]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:53.947]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:06:53.947 --> 02:06:55.148]  I take it every day.
[02:06:55.148 --> 02:06:56.911]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:07:00.695 --> 02:07:03.098]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:07:03.098 --> 02:07:06.742]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:07:06.742 --> 02:07:11.267]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:07:11.267 --> 02:07:14.511]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to nine
[02:07:15.472 --> 02:07:28.386]  95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:07:28.386 --> 02:07:31.069]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:34.850]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:52.173]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:08:07.299 --> 02:08:11.003]  What's his name?
[02:08:11.003 --> 02:08:21.173]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:08:23.251 --> 02:08:26.992]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:08:26.992 --> 02:08:30.592]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[02:08:30.592 --> 02:08:32.793]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:08:32.793 --> 02:08:33.453]  Louis.
[02:08:33.453 --> 02:08:40.654]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:08:40.654 --> 02:08:45.455]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:08:45.455 --> 02:08:46.356]  Guns will be taken.
[02:08:46.356 --> 02:08:47.816]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:08:47.816 --> 02:08:48.836]  We will take all weapons.
[02:08:49.036 --> 02:08:51.418]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:08:51.418 --> 02:08:55.981]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:08:55.981 --> 02:08:56.842]  Enough.
[02:08:56.842 --> 02:08:57.642]  Enough.
[02:08:57.642 --> 02:08:58.703]  Enough.
[02:08:58.703 --> 02:08:59.083]  Enough.
[02:08:59.083 --> 02:09:03.647]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:09:03.647 --> 02:09:07.590]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:09.712 --> 02:09:23.087]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:09:23.087 --> 02:09:25.710]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:09:26.793 --> 02:09:29.234]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:09:29.234 --> 02:09:35.515]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:09:35.515 --> 02:09:40.477]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:09:40.477 --> 02:09:45.158]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:09:52.893 --> 02:09:58.356]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:09:58.356 --> 02:09:59.577]  In your apartment!
[02:09:59.577 --> 02:10:00.697]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:10:00.697 --> 02:10:01.898]  The mic is on right now!
[02:10:01.898 --> 02:10:02.958]  I am inside.
[02:10:02.958 --> 02:10:05.019]  I have two words for you.
[02:10:05.019 --> 02:10:06.080]  Predator groans.
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:07.661]  You will never see it coming.
[02:10:11.727 --> 02:10:14.589]  The dramatic scene laid out in front of our cameras.
[02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:23.835]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:10:23.835 --> 02:10:29.278]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[02:10:29.278 --> 02:10:34.341]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[02:10:34.341 --> 02:10:36.423]  If you want them, come and take them!
[02:10:38.015 --> 02:10:39.859]  We are on the march.
[02:10:39.859 --> 02:10:42.726]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:10:42.726 --> 02:10:47.457]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:07.799]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:11:07.799 --> 02:11:10.282]  This is the heart of 1776!
[02:11:13.362 --> 02:11:17.905]  And it is the first worldwide transmission of the Infowar in 2014.
[02:11:17.905 --> 02:11:22.868]  It is the first day of January 2014.
[02:11:22.868 --> 02:11:27.551]  Welcome and thank you all for joining us here on the Worldwide Radio Transmission.
[02:11:27.551 --> 02:11:33.035]  I want to thank all of our sponsors, all of our listeners, all of our AM and FM affiliates, everyone out there.
[02:11:33.035 --> 02:11:36.958]  I wish you a wonderful New Year and God bless you all.
[02:11:36.958 --> 02:11:42.722]  We are certainly brothers and sisters together in the animating contest and the quest for liberty and freedom.
[02:11:43.463 --> 02:11:45.118]  In the fight against evil.
[02:11:46.038 --> 02:11:47.558]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:11:47.558 --> 02:11:53.799]  And the failure to recognize good from evil, tyranny from liberty, is what will bring down civilizations.
[02:11:53.799 --> 02:11:56.780]  Folks are waking up, but not to the full magnitude.
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.780]  I don't blame them.
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:08.422]  Because let me tell you, I study this stuff constantly, and I'm still blown away by just the new evil systems I discover, and how far along this is, and how sophisticated it is.
[02:12:08.422 --> 02:12:11.222]  And yesterday we talked a lot about this with Steve Quayle.
[02:12:11.222 --> 02:12:13.863]  You really come face to face with the fact that you're dealing with a spirit.
[02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:18.552]  This is, this is above humans, the devil, whatever you want to call it.
[02:12:18.552 --> 02:12:25.796]  I mean, if you really get deep into this and study it, it is an animating spirit of evil that we're fighting with the spirit of God.
[02:12:25.796 --> 02:12:27.697]  Where there is a spirit of God, there is liberty.
[02:12:27.697 --> 02:12:29.177]  I forget which Bible verse there is.
[02:12:29.177 --> 02:12:40.323]  Well, where there is the devil, there is tyranny and bondage and poverty and fraud and just sicko gibbering mentally ill control freaks that love running people's lives and hate their fellow man.
[02:12:42.363 --> 02:12:49.227]  I'm just looking at an image of that Perry lady that was making fun of white people adopting black kids and she'd rather them be aborted.
[02:12:49.227 --> 02:12:53.029]  It just makes me think of what a slimy enemy she is.
[02:12:53.029 --> 02:12:55.230]  It's not even an instinct of hating her.
[02:12:55.230 --> 02:12:58.832]  It's an instinct of just knowing that she is coming for us.
[02:12:58.832 --> 02:13:01.634]  Just knowing they just keep winning against innocent people.
[02:13:01.634 --> 02:13:04.215]  It makes me sick!
[02:13:04.215 --> 02:13:07.317]  I'm going to fight hard and I'm going to figure out how to beat these people with your help.
[02:13:08.459 --> 02:13:15.563]  All I know is we just gotta resist them every day, speak out against them, be hardcore, not back down, and never stop.
[02:13:15.563 --> 02:13:18.044]  And let me tell you, folks, it's not exhausting.
[02:13:18.044 --> 02:13:21.546]  Sometimes I get tired, but I'd be a lot more tired if I wasn't doing this.
[02:13:21.546 --> 02:13:32.192]  Because I've got such, you know, on average so much more energy, even being 40 years old, compared to when I was 20, because I understand the mission, and it is animating.
[02:13:32.192 --> 02:13:33.912]  So it's good to fight tyranny, folks.
[02:13:33.912 --> 02:13:36.034]  You were born for this.
[02:13:36.034 --> 02:13:36.214]  But
[02:13:37.233 --> 02:13:42.076]  We are fighting a spirit, we're fighting a sick culture, and we've got to fight it with that.
[02:13:42.076 --> 02:14:03.091]  It doesn't mean any of us are perfect or any of us run a high horse, but we know when it's self-assured, premeditated evil and fraud and manipulation and corruption, the people that would manipulate their fellow humans towards evil, trying to cheat their fellow humans, trying to have a corrupt system, they are cancer.
[02:14:03.091 --> 02:14:05.053]  And they need to be routed out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:06.237 --> 02:14:09.320]  They need to be cut out, like a cancer.
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.242]  And they're attacking us with the fluoride, the GMOs, all of it.
[02:14:12.242 --> 02:14:15.825]  They are wantonly evil.
[02:14:15.825 --> 02:14:24.392]  It's on record, the Communist Chinese, the German government, the British government, this broke four years ago, all have special vaccines produced secretly for them that are not what the general public are given.
[02:14:24.392 --> 02:14:26.454]  No kidding.
[02:14:26.454 --> 02:14:31.678]  Because they're adding everything you can imagine on purpose to hurt you and your family, those vaccines.
[02:14:31.678 --> 02:14:33.980]  You know why folks that take all the vaccines hardly can talk?
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:35.201]  They are brain damaged, on record.
[02:14:36.496 --> 02:14:38.398]  You go, well look at the flu, it's killing people.
[02:14:38.398 --> 02:14:40.840]  The flu shot is what gives people the flu on record.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.061]  Look it up.
[02:14:42.061 --> 02:14:43.442]  Again, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:14:43.442 --> 02:14:44.263]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:14:44.263 --> 02:14:45.184]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:14:45.184 --> 02:14:46.605]  I'll try to move quick now.
[02:14:46.605 --> 02:14:49.127]  So I'll just try to get your comment and I'll have a quick comment back to you.
[02:14:49.127 --> 02:14:50.768]  We're talking about the zombie culture.
[02:14:50.768 --> 02:14:53.291]  How do we turn the tide of people turning into zombies?
[02:14:53.291 --> 02:15:00.117]  As the NSA, we're going to cover this, come up with Gucciardi, as the NSA in their own new documents leaked calls
[02:15:01.514 --> 02:15:05.042]  Apple users, dumb zombies that have no idea they're already living in 1984.
[02:15:05.042 --> 02:15:07.707]  See, they call you that.
[02:15:07.707 --> 02:15:08.930]  They're like, good zombie!
[02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:10.974]  You see a person choking, you don't help him, you call 911.
[02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:13.779]  Even if you know the Heimlich Maneuver.
[02:15:13.779 --> 02:15:15.400]  Good zombie.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:16.820]  Good zombie.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:17.480]  Good zombie.
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:22.561]  You see the Italian court ruling 60-year-olds can grab your kid out of the backyard and rape them because it's love.
[02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:23.882]  That's the headline.
[02:15:23.882 --> 02:15:24.582]  Good zombie.
[02:15:24.582 --> 02:15:25.502]  You don't get upset.
[02:15:25.502 --> 02:15:31.403]  They're going to teach 5-year-olds how to be transgender in California and go in bathrooms with adults.
[02:15:31.403 --> 02:15:32.243]  Good zombie.
[02:15:32.243 --> 02:15:33.124]  You don't get upset.
[02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:34.124]  You're passing the test.
[02:15:34.784 --> 02:15:36.025]  Good zombie!
[02:15:36.025 --> 02:15:41.006]  Obamacare meant to totally rape you financially, take everything you've got, and lower the standard of care.
[02:15:41.006 --> 02:15:43.847]  But it's a black guy that pushed it, so good zombies!
[02:15:43.847 --> 02:15:45.048]  Good zombies!
[02:15:45.048 --> 02:15:46.688]  Good zombies!
[02:15:46.688 --> 02:15:48.089]  No!
[02:15:48.089 --> 02:15:49.329]  Break the spell!
[02:15:49.329 --> 02:15:50.670]  Become conscious again!
[02:15:50.670 --> 02:16:00.073]  No matter how hard they've hit you, no matter how much suspended disbelief you live under, in your Stockholm world, watching TV all day, you can break out of it!
[02:16:00.073 --> 02:16:01.054]  You can live again!
[02:16:01.054 --> 02:16:02.694]  You don't have to serve this!
[02:16:02.694 --> 02:16:03.895]  You don't have to go under it!
[02:16:06.192 --> 02:16:09.774]  Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[02:16:09.774 --> 02:16:11.135]  That's out of Corinthians 3.17.
[02:16:11.135 --> 02:16:15.077]  All right, let's go ahead.
[02:16:15.077 --> 02:16:19.699]  Where there's the Spirit of the world, there's slavery and ignorance and pain.
[02:16:19.699 --> 02:16:20.460]  That's my quote.
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:22.061]  Let's talk to Chris in Indiana.
[02:16:22.061 --> 02:16:26.123]  Thanks for holding her on the air on the New Year.
[02:16:26.123 --> 02:16:28.064]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[02:16:28.064 --> 02:16:28.484]  Thank you, brother.
[02:16:30.796 --> 02:16:40.121]  Kudos first on It's a Wonderful Life video and the new InfoWars magazine with Obama being displayed as a dictator with a huge communist uniform on the front.
[02:16:40.121 --> 02:16:43.223]  I think that's pretty symbolic of what's going on.
[02:16:43.223 --> 02:16:55.309]  This Stockholm Syndrome, Mass Stockholm Syndrome, as you have pointed out, it is symbolized very well in a movie with Al Pacino entitled Dog Day Afternoon.
[02:16:57.455 --> 02:16:58.195]  That's a good movie.
[02:17:28.905 --> 02:17:37.050]  That's exactly how it works, because they're such zombies, they worship the guy, even though he's bad, who is still a man and active.
[02:17:37.050 --> 02:17:38.971]  That's what it is.
[02:17:38.971 --> 02:17:39.511]  Hey, you know what?
[02:17:39.511 --> 02:17:49.297]  And I'm also with this whole Patriot thing coming in 2014 with the big 2014 elections.
[02:17:49.297 --> 02:17:51.599]  I was engaging in some thought crime today.
[02:17:51.599 --> 02:17:57.322]  Currently, I'm actually reading George Washington in my World Book Encyclopedia.
[02:17:57.322 --> 02:17:58.103]  Oh, that's terse.
[02:17:59.262 --> 02:18:00.383]  Oh, I know, man.
[02:18:00.383 --> 02:18:02.244]  I got a problem, right?
[02:18:02.244 --> 02:18:09.569]  And there is a very interesting paragraph, couple paragraphs here that I would like to read if you would let me.
[02:18:09.569 --> 02:18:12.131]  Absolutely, read it.
[02:18:12.131 --> 02:18:24.139]  Now, this is really symbolizing people like Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, all of the Tea Party patriots that I really hope gain seats in these upcoming elections.
[02:18:24.139 --> 02:18:28.042]  And symbol of independence, which is in bold letters,
[02:18:29.033 --> 02:18:29.353]  I agree.
[02:18:29.353 --> 02:18:29.773]  Read the quote.
[02:18:29.773 --> 02:18:31.755]  We've got a minute and a half.
[02:18:31.755 --> 02:18:37.118]  To most Americans of this time, Washington became the chief symbol of what they were fighting for.
[02:18:37.118 --> 02:18:41.060]  The colonists had been brought up to respect the British king.
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:43.862]  They did not easily accept the idea of independence.
[02:18:43.862 --> 02:18:53.207]  The Congress that approved the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 1776 was not elected by the people, but by the legislators of the states.
[02:18:54.028 --> 02:18:57.991]  And the legislatures were elected only by property owners.
[02:18:57.991 --> 02:19:04.715]  And as a result, some people who did not own property, and had no vote, viewed independence with suspicion.
[02:19:04.715 --> 02:19:11.739]  Thousands of loyalists, as British sympathizers were called, refused to help the fight for independence in any way.
[02:19:11.739 --> 02:19:13.821]  And that's what really symbolizes the people nowadays.
[02:19:13.821 --> 02:19:15.622]  They're afraid of independence.
[02:19:17.728 --> 02:19:21.529]  They want the status quo, which is a rotting culture.
[02:19:21.529 --> 02:19:22.849]  We're going in the wrong direction.
[02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:25.510]  We've got to go back to liberty.
[02:19:25.510 --> 02:19:26.110]  Yeah, right.
[02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:28.251]  I mean, I absolutely agree with you, Alex.
[02:19:28.251 --> 02:19:29.931]  And hey, have a good New Year.
[02:19:29.931 --> 02:19:33.092]  And I hope, I hope just independence thrives throughout the New Year.
[02:19:33.092 --> 02:19:46.095]  I hope we don't see any horrible false flags and just people just wake up, start reading books like 1984, Animal Farm, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and read what these people like and
[02:19:46.835 --> 02:19:50.600]  The grand chessboard knucklehead who's debating the Rzezinski office.
[02:20:01.198 --> 02:20:10.285]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:20:10.285 --> 02:20:18.692]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:20:18.692 --> 02:20:23.576]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:20:37.523 --> 02:20:44.545]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:20:44.545 --> 02:20:49.026]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:23:01.508 --> 02:23:06.010]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:11.714]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:11.714 --> 02:23:15.296]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:15.296 --> 02:23:18.077]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:18.077 --> 02:23:22.940]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:23:29.824 --> 02:23:32.545]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[02:23:36.846 --> 02:23:38.247]  Silverlungs.com.

[02:23:40.908 --> 02:23:43.909]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[02:24:01.383 --> 02:24:04.084]  I'm going back to your calls.
[02:24:04.084 --> 02:24:06.284]  But it's very irritating to me.
[02:24:06.284 --> 02:24:09.085]  It is a minority of them.
[02:24:09.085 --> 02:24:11.485]  There's 189 up votes, 33 down votes.
[02:24:26.568 --> 02:24:32.092]  On the video that's up on InfoWars.com, car on fire, cell phone user oblivious.
[02:24:32.092 --> 02:24:39.297]  We said in the description, we said in the article, John Bowne's driving down 360 yesterday morning.
[02:24:39.297 --> 02:24:44.501]  There is a car with fire under it and a woman standing a foot and a half, two feet, literally in the smoke.
[02:24:44.501 --> 02:24:47.183]  He pulls over to render aid, which is the law, by the way.
[02:24:48.430 --> 02:24:51.853]  No one and just literally thousands of cars.
[02:24:51.853 --> 02:24:53.795]  I mean it's just hundreds going by every few minutes.
[02:24:53.795 --> 02:24:55.476]  Just jam-packed traffic.
[02:24:55.476 --> 02:24:56.237]  Pull over to help her.
[02:24:56.237 --> 02:24:56.977]  You're supposed to do that.
[02:24:56.977 --> 02:24:58.779]  Especially if you see it, pull over and catch on fire.
[02:25:00.396 --> 02:25:02.958]  And it's a big problem in society, people aren't rendering aid.
[02:25:02.958 --> 02:25:05.400]  He's not shooting iPhone video at first.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:08.402]  He's standing back 150 yards saying, get away from the car.
[02:25:08.402 --> 02:25:12.044]  Finally, when she starts walking up, he starts videotaping and talking to her.
[02:25:12.044 --> 02:25:16.267]  And the idiots are on here going, hey, she was like, you know, 30 feet away or whatever.
[02:25:16.267 --> 02:25:17.348]  She's a safe distance.
[02:25:17.348 --> 02:25:19.869]  We told you morons.
[02:25:19.869 --> 02:25:21.290]  She was standing next to the car.
[02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:23.372]  That's why he pulled over to go tell her to get away from it.
[02:25:24.895 --> 02:25:30.159]  I mean, it's just, no one denies that Good Samaritan activity is way down.
[02:25:30.159 --> 02:25:31.660]  That's on record.
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:32.121]  Okay?
[02:25:32.121 --> 02:25:33.822]  That's what this is all about.
[02:25:33.822 --> 02:25:36.364]  It's like the woman choking that nobody would help.
[02:25:36.364 --> 02:25:38.165]  I guess I should have just let her die.
[02:25:38.165 --> 02:25:40.087]  I mean, you people are nuts!
[02:25:40.087 --> 02:25:41.888]  You're nuts!
[02:25:41.888 --> 02:25:44.310]  And I'm talking to that minority of people.
[02:25:44.310 --> 02:25:51.896]  But it's still a nice slice, maybe 10% are completely out of their mind and would argue with anything we say or anything we do.
[02:25:54.099 --> 02:25:56.821]  It's just, it's just total mindlessness.
[02:25:56.821 --> 02:25:58.883]  Absolutely outrageous.
[02:25:58.883 --> 02:26:00.444]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:26:00.444 --> 02:26:02.685]  Jim in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:26:02.685 --> 02:26:08.630]  Okay.
[02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:09.771]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:26:09.771 --> 02:26:11.492]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:26:11.492 --> 02:26:13.413]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:26:13.413 --> 02:26:14.334]  Good brother.
[02:26:14.334 --> 02:26:15.075]  Happy New Year to you.
[02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:44.663]  An example of what a zombie the American culture is, is they have been convinced my whole lifetime that a third-party candidate cannot get elected president, yet they celebrate one of the most famous presidents, the 16th president, and if they knew their history, they'd know that our 16th president was elected in 1864 on a third-party candidate.
[02:26:45.503 --> 02:26:47.205]  It's history.
[02:26:47.205 --> 02:26:51.310]  But yet we're convinced today that Ron Paul can't make it.
[02:26:51.310 --> 02:26:53.333]  We're convinced.
[02:26:53.333 --> 02:26:55.776]  Because we are all zombies.
[02:26:55.776 --> 02:26:56.557]  It's pathetic.
[02:26:58.009 --> 02:26:58.390]  Absolutely.
[02:26:58.390 --> 02:27:01.551]  It's the mind control and brains from birth.
[02:27:01.551 --> 02:27:04.833]  We're now 65 years into TV, sat in front of the television.
[02:27:04.833 --> 02:27:11.377]  We've been programmed to do what it says, and that's a false reality, where they can present whatever they want.
[02:27:11.377 --> 02:27:12.057]  Very well said.
[02:27:12.057 --> 02:27:13.158]  Appreciate your call.
[02:27:13.158 --> 02:27:14.798]  Karen in Arizona, thanks for calling.
[02:27:14.798 --> 02:27:15.339]  Happy New Year.
[02:27:15.339 --> 02:27:15.599]  Go ahead.
[02:27:16.391 --> 02:27:18.452]  Two zombies.
[02:27:18.452 --> 02:27:26.774]  About a couple of months ago, I was driving down the road and I saw this guy in a wheelchair, electric wheelchair, motorized.
[02:27:26.774 --> 02:27:30.155]  And he was struggling because he got stuck in some mud.
[02:27:30.155 --> 02:27:31.116]  Cars were going by.
[02:27:31.116 --> 02:27:33.776]  I turned around to help him.
[02:27:33.776 --> 02:27:35.137]  And he also had a little dog.
[02:27:35.137 --> 02:27:38.518]  And we were trying to get his wheelchair unstuck.
[02:27:39.318 --> 02:27:40.599]  Cars were going by.
[02:27:40.599 --> 02:27:44.761]  So one guy finally did turn around, come by and help us.
[02:27:44.761 --> 02:27:49.663]  And I noticed all the cars driving by and I thought, boy, are we in trouble.
[02:27:49.663 --> 02:27:55.366]  Another thing, as I mentioned to this woman, I said, stop voting straight party.
[02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:58.247]  And she got into this, oh, then the other guy will win.
[02:27:58.247 --> 02:27:59.548]  I said, that's the problem.
[02:27:59.548 --> 02:28:01.709]  I said, this is all a brainwashing job.
[02:28:02.449 --> 02:28:04.551]  You know, because I thought of Ron Paul.
[02:28:04.551 --> 02:28:09.877]  I said, this is all a brainwashing job to convince you that the other guy is going to win.
[02:28:09.877 --> 02:28:14.062]  And so I said, no, but this is a zombie state.
[02:28:14.062 --> 02:28:15.083]  Well, no, that's it.
[02:28:15.083 --> 02:28:21.230]  And again, when I was a kid, if your tire was flat and you were a woman, you were having a problem, people would stop and help you.
[02:28:24.514 --> 02:28:26.555]  You know, the list just goes on and on.
[02:28:26.555 --> 02:28:30.417]  It's just scary to see somebody dying in the street and no one helps them.
[02:28:30.417 --> 02:28:32.678]  I mean, they won't even call 911.
[02:28:32.678 --> 02:28:41.282]  It's like that guy on the train a few months ago, who for several minutes on the video is just aiming guns at people's heads, and they're all on smartphones and walking over.
[02:28:41.282 --> 02:28:44.383]  People even see the gun, but they're so conditioned they can't believe it's actually happening.
[02:28:44.383 --> 02:28:47.925]  Then he starts shooting people, and then they freak out.
[02:28:47.925 --> 02:28:53.528]  I mean, if I saw some guy pull a gun out, I would immediately act like I didn't see it until he walked by, and I'd grab the gun away.
[02:28:54.752 --> 02:28:56.833]  And by the way, folks, I have taken a gun away from somebody.
[02:28:56.833 --> 02:28:58.954]  I have taken a knife away from somebody.
[02:28:58.954 --> 02:29:03.397]  The culture was much more rough when I was even growing up outside Dallas, Texas and in Dallas.
[02:29:03.397 --> 02:29:07.178]  And I'm not even going to tell those stories because, you know, the average yuppie doesn't even know what that stuff's like.
[02:29:07.178 --> 02:29:10.340]  But I guess the average person gets a knife or a gun pulled on them and they grovel.
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:10.740]  Not me.
[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:11.741]  I go completely crazy.
[02:29:13.201 --> 02:29:18.164]  I mean, it's almost like enjoyable that you've now done something so I can beat the hell out of you.
[02:29:18.164 --> 02:29:21.145]  And it's not like sadistic, like I like to hurt people.
[02:29:21.145 --> 02:29:25.487]  I don't like to hurt a little mouse or I don't like to hurt a cat or a dog or a child.
[02:29:25.487 --> 02:29:27.148]  I like to hurt scum.
[02:29:27.148 --> 02:29:29.849]  And it's not like I even like to hurt them.
[02:29:29.849 --> 02:29:33.071]  It's like, it's just like if you're gonna fight, might as well enjoy it.
[02:29:33.071 --> 02:29:36.893]  It's like, it's not, it's just you're ready to beat the hell out of somebody.
[02:29:37.862 --> 02:29:43.207]  And I don't know where people don't have that instinct anymore, that if somebody attacks you, you hit them back.
[02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:48.051]  That's people in school, you don't fight back against a bully, and you get in more trouble if you fight back.
[02:29:48.051 --> 02:29:50.394]  I mean, that's pure slavery.
[02:29:50.394 --> 02:29:51.795]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.795 --> 02:29:53.396]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.396 --> 02:29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.184 --> 02:30:04.206]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:30:04.206 --> 02:30:09.210]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:30:09.210 --> 02:30:16.396]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:30:16.516 --> 02:30:22.162]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:30:22.162 --> 02:30:26.186]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:30:26.186 --> 02:30:30.911]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:30:30.911 --> 02:30:36.137]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:30:36.377 --> 02:30:39.601]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:30:39.601 --> 02:30:42.124]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:30:42.124 --> 02:30:46.889]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:30:46.889 --> 02:30:49.772]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:30:49.772 --> 02:30:56.760]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[02:30:56.960 --> 02:30:58.221]  We're getting prepared.
[02:30:58.221 --> 02:30:58.902]  Are you?
[02:30:58.902 --> 02:31:01.946]  Infowarsshop.com The facts are in.
[02:31:01.946 --> 02:31:03.347]  The studies are legion.
[02:31:03.347 --> 02:31:10.876]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:31:10.876 --> 02:31:14.320]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:15.240]  Simple.
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:19.964]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:31:19.964 --> 02:31:25.707]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:31:25.707 --> 02:31:31.231]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[02:31:31.231 --> 02:31:42.038]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:31:42.038 --> 02:31:43.859]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:31:43.979 --> 02:31:44.599]  We're good to go.
[02:32:06.732 --> 02:32:08.613]  The highest cancer rates on the planet.
[02:32:08.613 --> 02:32:14.176]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:32:14.176 --> 02:32:16.117]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:32:16.117 --> 02:32:17.758]  We are what we eat.
[02:32:17.758 --> 02:32:22.421]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:32:22.421 --> 02:32:26.644]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:32:26.644 --> 02:32:28.905]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:32:29.185 --> 02:32:35.430]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:33:27.705 --> 02:33:31.068]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.068 --> 02:33:34.771]  Come and hear ya from the Old Republic of Texas.
[02:33:34.771 --> 02:33:38.895]  Broadcasting worldwide from globalist-occupied Austin.
[02:33:40.598 --> 02:33:41.619]  Anthony Guicciardi is with us.
[02:33:41.619 --> 02:33:51.045]  We'll continue with your calls with Shawna and Jerry and others that are patiently holding before we end the transmission.
[02:33:51.045 --> 02:34:00.231]  I also want to get into this big NSA news where the new NSA documents, they're laughing at the public in the PowerPoints and calling us dumb zombies.
[02:34:00.231 --> 02:34:03.754]  And I mean, how would you do that about your fellow Americans?
[02:34:03.754 --> 02:34:06.876]  It's just, we're here saying, don't be a zombie, be aware.
[02:34:06.876 --> 02:34:07.977]  They want to keep you.
[02:34:07.977 --> 02:34:09.278]  Oh, we're not doing that zombies.
[02:34:10.185 --> 02:34:15.268]  That's like keeping a kid in a cage their whole life and then making fun of them because they're uninformed and stupid.
[02:34:15.268 --> 02:34:19.431]  Oh, look, he can't read or write and talks like a, you know, talks like a caveman.
[02:34:19.431 --> 02:34:19.771]  Ah!
[02:34:19.771 --> 02:34:23.073]  When you help do it, you scum!
[02:34:23.073 --> 02:34:26.395]  There's nothing worse than trying to lower people.
[02:34:26.395 --> 02:34:32.939]  Now, if somebody's trying to bring you down and then you lower them, fair and square, that's the way it is.
[02:34:32.939 --> 02:34:37.322]  In business or a lawsuit or they physically attack you, you break their neck, whatever you got to do.
[02:34:37.322 --> 02:34:38.903]  That's different, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:39.967 --> 02:34:41.868]  And that's when your instinct should be to dominate.
[02:34:41.868 --> 02:34:45.569]  The problem is good people have given up on their instinct to dominate evil.
[02:34:45.569 --> 02:34:50.291]  And so we've let evil dominate us, and there's no end to the level of evil.
[02:34:50.291 --> 02:35:01.354]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you go to DrudgeReport.com, you can see there in the middle column, top story, Nuke Fear.
[02:35:01.354 --> 02:35:06.196]  Feds order 14 million dosages of potassium iodine.
[02:35:07.045 --> 02:35:11.249]  The way I read the FedBiz site, it's actually 14 million packages of it.
[02:35:11.249 --> 02:35:13.631]  But the point is, is this is the biggest order ever.
[02:35:13.631 --> 02:35:16.914]  It was like 8 million they ordered back during the last Fukushima.
[02:35:16.914 --> 02:35:18.515]  This is huge.
[02:35:18.515 --> 02:35:24.961]  And we've been telling you, it's the extraction of the rods, the cleanup, which the Japanese news admits has been carried out by the Mafia over there.
[02:35:24.961 --> 02:35:29.145]  They're using homeless people, basically, below minimum wage.
[02:35:29.145 --> 02:35:32.147]  It's like death commandos to go in.
[02:35:32.147 --> 02:35:33.608]  That was in Reuters a few days ago.
[02:35:34.969 --> 02:35:37.366]  This is incredible that this is happening and...
[02:35:38.476 --> 02:35:39.497]  We're here to break it down.
[02:35:39.497 --> 02:35:48.024]  Now, Gucciardi's also put not just Watson's report up, but he has also done another report that just went up in the last hour.
[02:35:48.024 --> 02:35:49.185]  Infowars.com.
[02:35:49.185 --> 02:35:53.328]  Is the government stockpiling iodine and prevention for Fukushima meltdown?
[02:35:53.328 --> 02:35:55.791]  Do flies follow Obama everywhere?
[02:35:55.791 --> 02:35:57.272]  Like he's Satan incarnate?
[02:35:57.272 --> 02:36:00.334]  Or, conversely, a pile of pig crap?
[02:36:00.334 --> 02:36:01.535]  Yes, we know the answer.
[02:36:01.535 --> 02:36:02.716]  Excuse me, I just gotta say it.
[02:36:02.716 --> 02:36:04.178]  I mean, he may not be the devil,
[02:36:04.798 --> 02:36:07.059]  He may just smell like what flies like.
[02:36:07.059 --> 02:36:08.779]  Flies never land on me!
[02:36:08.779 --> 02:36:12.221]  Hardly ever, unless there's a horsefly trying to bite me in the woods or something.
[02:36:12.221 --> 02:36:18.163]  I mean, that's just constantly coming out of his mouth, spontaneously generating out of his...
[02:36:19.437 --> 02:36:21.358]  A toot or whatever's happening.
[02:36:21.358 --> 02:36:21.958]  But U.S.
[02:36:21.958 --> 02:36:25.800]  government orders 14 million dosages of potassium iodide.
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:27.240]  There's the headline.
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:32.162]  And so I wanted to get Anthony Gucciardi's take on this because he was the one talking about it yesterday.
[02:36:32.162 --> 02:36:38.725]  And I noticed Watson also must have found it in the FedBiz site from one of our tipsters listening to us in an email.
[02:36:38.725 --> 02:36:40.986]  So we're breaking that at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:36:40.986 --> 02:36:45.908]  But Anthony, this is what we've been concerned about, that radioactive wave coming in, all of it.
[02:36:46.368 --> 02:36:53.792]  And of course, you've got the head of the Young Turks saying when he was at MSNBC, the last straw was, they said, look, don't have reporters there, run away from it.
[02:36:53.792 --> 02:36:57.535]  It's really horrible, super high radiation, but we're not going to tell the public that.
[02:36:57.535 --> 02:37:01.137]  And of course, the prevailing winds of the ocean all comes our way.
[02:37:01.137 --> 02:37:01.297]  So.
[02:37:02.631 --> 02:37:06.056]  Again, I personally am concerned about this, and I'm not on the West Coast.
[02:37:06.056 --> 02:37:07.539]  Radiation's gone up some here.
[02:37:07.539 --> 02:37:10.704]  Now, I think Ann Coulter should move to live in Fukushima.
[02:37:10.704 --> 02:37:12.326]  She says it's a good deal.
[02:37:12.326 --> 02:37:12.807]  Literally.
[02:37:12.807 --> 02:37:14.670]  And that's her First Amendment.
[02:37:14.670 --> 02:37:15.391]  I don't agree with that.
[02:37:18.204 --> 02:37:22.207]  What is your breakdown of this serious development?
[02:37:22.207 --> 02:37:23.648]  What do you think they're doing it for?
[02:37:23.648 --> 02:37:27.010]  All the reactors that are 40 years old here that are rotting, they're going to keep going?
[02:37:27.010 --> 02:37:28.771]  Violating federal law?
[02:37:28.771 --> 02:37:33.234]  The other reactors or the missing nuclear weapons?
[02:37:33.234 --> 02:37:35.275]  What do you think's going on here, Anthony Gucciardi?
[02:37:35.495 --> 02:37:53.462]  This is the same government, we have to remember, that raised the allowable radiation limits on our food, turned off the radiation counters on the West Coast, and silently have been preparing for Fukushima for a while, because their experts tell them, yeah, Fukushima, the key thing is the extraction of these rods, even the conservative conservative.
[02:37:54.282 --> 02:38:02.106]  Professors from Yale University and others are saying, yeah the extraction of these rods could lead to quote-unquote Fukushima forever.
[02:38:02.106 --> 02:38:05.087]  Changing the world, completely devastating Japan.
[02:38:05.087 --> 02:38:12.251]  But we can go back now and look at this reality that it was at this around the same time they've started to take the rods out now.
[02:38:12.611 --> 02:38:13.732]  The government knows this.
[02:38:13.732 --> 02:38:17.136]  The federal analysts who look at this say, yeah, this is the key thing.
[02:38:17.136 --> 02:38:18.437]  This is the number one issue.
[02:38:18.437 --> 02:38:22.121]  Because if they touch... Because if they touch, basically the whole plant will blow up.
[02:38:22.121 --> 02:38:22.902]  There will be a meltdown.
[02:38:22.902 --> 02:38:24.063]  And there's tons of these things.
[02:38:24.063 --> 02:38:25.945]  Yeah, there's... And they have homeless people.
[02:38:25.945 --> 02:38:29.189]  Can you guys pull up the image of the homeless guy they've got doing the work?
[02:38:29.189 --> 02:38:33.013]  I mean, I'm not putting the homeless guy down, but he looks like, you know, he has a couple cups of sake a day.
[02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:34.511]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:38:34.511 --> 02:38:36.593]  Human error is just to begin with.
[02:38:36.593 --> 02:38:37.054]  But look at this.
[02:38:37.054 --> 02:38:40.778]  I think it was Business Insider had the photo, but go ahead.
[02:38:40.778 --> 02:38:43.041]  1,535 rods that they have to extract.
[02:38:43.041 --> 02:38:52.211]  That's 1,535 instances of potential catastrophe that could melt down Fukushima, evacuate Japan, completely obliterate the West Coast with fallout.
[02:38:52.211 --> 02:38:54.534]  And that's the conservative Yale professor on Huffington Post.
[02:38:55.234 --> 02:38:57.716]  David Suzuki who, you know, has read about some things wrong.
[02:38:57.716 --> 02:38:59.338]  Civilization ending in Japan.
[02:38:59.338 --> 02:39:02.621]  Yeah, I mean he's saying basically Japan will be wiped out.
[02:39:02.621 --> 02:39:03.682]  Bye-bye Japan.
[02:39:03.682 --> 02:39:05.484]  West Coast would have to immediately evacuate.
[02:39:05.484 --> 02:39:06.144]  That's the quote.
[02:39:06.144 --> 02:39:06.865]  Bye-bye Japan.
[02:39:06.865 --> 02:39:07.746]  Yeah, exact quote.
[02:39:07.746 --> 02:39:08.486]  Bye-bye Japan.
[02:39:08.486 --> 02:39:15.533]  It would be completely obliterated and then we'd have to evacuate here in the United States in many areas and the food supply would be completely tarnished.
[02:39:15.533 --> 02:39:16.393]  But the thing is here...
[02:39:17.188 --> 02:39:22.930]  They're ordering, it is 14 million tablets, so you could say packages or doses or whatever.
[02:39:22.930 --> 02:39:27.691]  14 million tablets of this potassium iodide, which I believe, and the experts... So it's tablets, not packages.
[02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:31.352]  That's the low-quality garbage iodine that, you know... Well, it's better than nothing.
[02:39:31.352 --> 02:39:33.653]  Yeah, it's better than nothing, but you take it in an emergency.
[02:39:33.653 --> 02:39:42.616]  But anyway, the key thing here is the iodine manufacturers, they all know that Fukushima is probably going to melt down because they have homeless people going in, working on these rods,
[02:39:42.816 --> 02:39:50.499]  That's right, that's why we've had everybody in the world trying to buy our raw crystals that we have stockpiled.
[02:39:50.499 --> 02:39:51.539]  In the form of elemental.
[02:39:51.539 --> 02:39:53.700]  You can't even hardly get that anymore.
[02:39:53.700 --> 02:40:00.323]  And I was talking to some manufacturers, they've increased it like 2,000% over the last several years and it's going up more and more with Fukushima and everything like that.
[02:40:00.563 --> 02:40:00.643]  Yeah.
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:20.983]  And by the way, that on screen is the small explosion.
[02:40:20.983 --> 02:40:26.470]  Show the MOX-3 reactor, where it's a big 3,000-foot-tall mushroom cloud.
[02:40:26.470 --> 02:40:29.634]  Or just look at Mushroom Cloud Fukushima, and that'll give it to you guys.
[02:40:29.634 --> 02:40:30.114]  You'll see it.
[02:40:30.114 --> 02:40:31.576]  It's three times the size of that.
[02:40:31.576 --> 02:40:33.138]  Yeah, that was all downplayed anyway.
[02:40:33.138 --> 02:40:34.840]  It was over two times the amount of radiation.
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:35.781]  No, it's good for you.
[02:40:35.781 --> 02:40:36.302]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:40:36.302 --> 02:40:36.963]  That's good for you.
[02:40:37.483 --> 02:40:43.508]  We should actually make Ann Coulter radiation pills just bottled at the source from Fukushima like spring water except for radiation.
[02:40:43.508 --> 02:40:44.429]  We should do a joke video.
[02:40:44.429 --> 02:40:45.810]  I've said a parody on that.
[02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:46.831]  Now available!
[02:40:46.831 --> 02:40:48.352]  Ann Coulter Fukushima pills.
[02:40:50.444 --> 02:40:54.545]  Yeah, and then show a clip of her saying, it's good for you.
[02:40:54.545 --> 02:40:55.686]  No, that's right.
[02:40:55.686 --> 02:41:00.047]  Now you can enjoy brain damage, kidney failure, cancers and infertility.
[02:41:00.047 --> 02:41:00.487]  Bottled it.
[02:41:00.487 --> 02:41:04.409]  There's nothing like your teeth falling out and your fast-growing cells all dying.
[02:41:04.409 --> 02:41:07.350]  Do you like your guts liquefying and blood pouring out of your body?
[02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:09.230]  Well, then, Ann Coulter Radiation Pills are for you.
[02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:16.773]  Well, you know, it's good news for her because they did dump, I think, 73% of all the radiation, the cesium, into the Pacific Ocean when they couldn't handle it anymore.
[02:41:17.193 --> 02:41:23.879]  So thankfully we do have radiation constantly attacking us through the food supply and through the ocean on a consistent 24-7 basis.
[02:41:23.879 --> 02:41:27.923]  That's the other point too here, is that silently they're preparing.
[02:41:27.923 --> 02:41:32.767]  A real government would tell its people, tell its citizens what's going on in order to prepare them
[02:41:32.847 --> 02:41:41.611]  So Russians did, when Chernobyl blew up, they said take iodine and also Prussian blue, which we can't get here, that also takes it out.
[02:41:41.611 --> 02:41:45.653]  People know that as the color, but it's a mineral, I guess, that's really good.
[02:41:45.653 --> 02:41:47.174]  We've been looking into that.
[02:41:47.174 --> 02:41:49.095]  But the whole point is, is that
[02:41:50.535 --> 02:41:52.756]  My wife lived in Europe.
[02:41:52.756 --> 02:41:55.776]  Her dad was a diplomat with the Agriculture Department.
[02:41:55.776 --> 02:42:00.117]  During that, and for about six months, they had to have frozen food flown in from the U.S.
[02:42:00.117 --> 02:42:00.998]  and Asia.
[02:42:00.998 --> 02:42:06.519]  They had to have powdered milk, no more milk, because that bioaccumulates in the cow's milk, because it was hitting the crops.
[02:42:06.519 --> 02:42:10.840]  Italy, Germany, France, Russia, they wouldn't eat their food for at least six months.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:11.640]  And the U.N.
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:15.461]  says over a million deaths in the aggregate since 86 from Fukushima.
[02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:17.602]  In the last 20-something years.
[02:42:17.602 --> 02:42:19.404]  But meanwhile, they will not even tell us.
[02:42:19.404 --> 02:42:23.948]  We're literally still importing fish from Japan and eating them right here in Texas.
[02:42:23.948 --> 02:42:25.289]  And it sold us delicacy.
[02:42:25.289 --> 02:42:26.690]  Why are you racist against Japanese?
[02:42:26.690 --> 02:42:29.252]  I'm obviously very racist because I don't like radiation.
[02:42:29.252 --> 02:42:30.513]  I'm not going to look at what you just said.
[02:42:30.513 --> 02:42:31.434]  I'm just going to call you racist.
[02:42:31.434 --> 02:42:32.215]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:42:32.215 --> 02:42:36.698]  You shouldn't look at these quotes where he says, much more serious is the danger of the spent fuel rod pulled.
[02:42:36.698 --> 02:42:38.480]  This is a Yale University professor where he says,
[02:42:39.261 --> 02:42:54.814]  1535 rods safely transport them to the common storage pool then you have 50 meters to go and then it's 6,375 other rods if they blow up then it will be he said they would fission and all of humanity will be threatened for thousands of years that's okay though he's obviously racist
[02:42:55.575 --> 02:43:04.838]  And he says they're completely uncontrollable, you know, and we have homeless people doing it, who are paid like $3 a year, and the Unit 4 pool is completely destroyed.
[02:43:04.838 --> 02:43:07.299]  Everything about this is red alert level.
[02:43:07.299 --> 02:43:14.541]  And the whole place, what's that hydrology term, where it's all turning into a swamp and sponging because they're having to keep dumping water on it?
[02:43:14.761 --> 02:43:15.882]  Yeah, we've talked about that before.
[02:43:15.882 --> 02:43:16.482]  I forget the term.
[02:43:16.482 --> 02:43:19.244]  We always try and bring it up, but it is actually key.
[02:43:19.244 --> 02:43:21.926]  This whole thing is just riddled with error.
[02:43:21.926 --> 02:43:26.509]  I mean, I'm actually looking at Southern Hemisphere over the radiation, because you can't fight that.
[02:43:26.509 --> 02:43:28.591]  I mean, if it gets high enough, I will leave.
[02:43:28.591 --> 02:43:30.392]  And I guess I'll take some of the crew with me or something.
[02:43:30.392 --> 02:43:31.593]  I mean, this is that serious.
[02:43:31.653 --> 02:43:33.714]  That is actually the only answer to that point.
[02:43:33.714 --> 02:43:43.260]  I mean, you can protect yourself with some iodine and things like that, but if it actually completely blows sky high, even the experts say... Well, that's why we know radiation at this level lowers immunity.
[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:46.442]  That's why they're having huge flu and cold deaths in Japan.
[02:43:46.442 --> 02:43:51.005]  Tens of thousands, kids dropping dead on playgrounds because they'll have cardiac arrest from it.
[02:43:51.005 --> 02:43:54.147]  This is all admitted to cover up, and we've been getting hit with radiation.
[02:43:54.147 --> 02:43:58.050]  We're eating it, and you're seeing record deaths from bacteria and stuff.
[02:43:58.050 --> 02:43:59.391]  I mean, this is already hammering.
[02:44:00.151 --> 02:44:03.374]  It was one reactor that blew up, not five that all partially blew.
[02:44:22.614 --> 02:44:23.796]  That are continuing to blow.
[02:44:23.796 --> 02:44:27.040]  You know, they're still picking up weird isotopes that show stuff's going on.
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:31.366]  And then we trust Tepco, which has been unveiled to be like run by the mafia.
[02:44:31.366 --> 02:44:34.431]  And they're telling us how great everything is hiring homeless people.
[02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:35.312]  That doesn't sound very good.
[02:44:35.312 --> 02:44:36.774]  They're taping up things.
[02:44:36.774 --> 02:44:38.496]  Nuclear fission technology.
[02:44:38.496 --> 02:44:39.538]  They're just using duct tape.
[02:44:42.765 --> 02:44:49.069]  You know, I'm not for like global government type stuff, but this should be like the U.S., of course we're leading the evil instead, or the U.N.
[02:44:49.069 --> 02:45:06.720]  or NATO or whoever, it should be, they already had Navy ships there, they're all getting cancer, suing over that, but I mean, this should be a hundred thousand people there, volunteering, you know, every month, top scientists, people in lead-lined suits, coming up with the best plans, it should be a Manhattan-level project to clean this up.
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:07.661]  Instead, they just don't care.
[02:45:07.921 --> 02:45:10.844]  The Nuclear Commission did raise it to the highest level recently.
[02:45:10.844 --> 02:45:12.686]  I think they created a new level.
[02:45:12.686 --> 02:45:16.250]  Yes, and the issue is that no one is doing anything about it.
[02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:18.192]  The governments are just sitting back in the United States.
[02:45:18.192 --> 02:45:20.874]  This is the highest level nuclear emergency.
[02:45:20.874 --> 02:45:24.919]  And now they were saying, last time I saw a few weeks ago, they may create a new level.
[02:45:25.523 --> 02:45:26.344]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:26.344 --> 02:45:27.565]  This is beyond anything else.
[02:45:27.565 --> 02:45:30.429]  And we're just sitting here, bread and circus level, doing nothing about it.
[02:45:30.429 --> 02:45:31.731]  The government's not telling us anything.
[02:45:31.731 --> 02:45:33.453]  Meanwhile... It's like a T6 tornado.
[02:45:33.453 --> 02:45:35.976]  Yeah, this is the collapse of the Roman Empire, basically.
[02:45:35.976 --> 02:45:37.518]  And we're just sitting here doing nothing.
[02:45:37.518 --> 02:45:44.946]  And they're buying 14 million... Well, you know, the Romans in 410, when Alaric was like 50 miles away, the Visigoth chieftain out of Germany...
[02:45:45.507 --> 02:45:49.272]  And was burning and pillaging and slaughtering everyone and only taking the women.
[02:45:49.272 --> 02:45:56.261]  They were still having sex with their horses and partying and just laughing and drugged out of their mind as the hordes.
[02:45:56.261 --> 02:45:57.984]  I mean, it's the same deal.
[02:45:57.984 --> 02:45:58.644]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:45:58.644 --> 02:46:00.106]  It's zombiosis.
[02:46:00.106 --> 02:46:00.907]  It's the decadence.
[02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:02.872]  That's what we're talking about off the air.
[02:46:02.872 --> 02:46:10.161]  The Roman Empire is the most closely related, in my opinion, to the United States because Obama actually doesn't want fervent supporters as much as he has them.
[02:46:10.161 --> 02:46:13.545]  He wants a population that is docile and doesn't care one way or another.
[02:46:13.545 --> 02:46:17.390]  Well, that's why they modeled the last hundred years, brought in the fascist symbols of the Senate.
[02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:18.331]  They modeled themselves.
[02:46:18.331 --> 02:46:19.192]  Look at the architecture.
[02:46:19.873 --> 02:46:21.714]  They say they're the new Rome.
[02:46:21.714 --> 02:46:23.395]  The absolute key is apathy.
[02:46:23.395 --> 02:46:27.398]  Because the enemy of all of this, the establishment, is to care about Fukushima.
[02:46:27.398 --> 02:46:29.739]  Care about the fact that it's blowing up consistently.
[02:46:29.739 --> 02:46:32.461]  That the experts say it'll threaten humanity for thousands of years.
[02:46:32.461 --> 02:46:34.702]  That's the antithesis of the establishment.
[02:46:34.702 --> 02:46:37.884]  To not care, to have apathy, is to allow them to win.
[02:46:37.884 --> 02:46:39.885]  And to allow them to completely destroy our families.
[02:46:39.885 --> 02:46:41.746]  And that's what John Bowne's report's about.
[02:46:41.746 --> 02:46:44.147]  The woman's a foot and a half away from the car.
[02:46:44.147 --> 02:46:46.249]  He finally gets, it later blows up.
[02:46:46.249 --> 02:46:47.990]  Yeah, I guess he should have just let her blow up.
[02:46:48.717 --> 02:46:53.679]  I mean, that's what it could have come down to, because some of the comments were like, how dare he annoy her like that?
[02:46:53.679 --> 02:46:56.441]  And how dare he go in and barge and be so aggressive?
[02:46:56.441 --> 02:47:02.884]  Just even having emotions now is bad, because passion is the ultimate enemy of the establishment.
[02:47:02.884 --> 02:47:04.945]  Passion for anything, as we're doing right now, this passion.
[02:47:04.945 --> 02:47:09.227]  People think it's weird that you care that Fukushima is blowing up and killing thousands of millions of people.
[02:47:09.887 --> 02:47:11.808]  Gee, that's a good thing to have passion.
[02:47:11.808 --> 02:47:19.312]  That's what all these motivational people have always said, you know, the ones that are real is have passion for what you're doing and that's how you have success in business or anything.
[02:47:19.312 --> 02:47:22.954]  This is just a new level bringing the media to the next level about passion.
[02:47:22.954 --> 02:47:24.555]  The mainstream media has no passion.
[02:47:24.555 --> 02:47:28.157]  The mainstream media reports and says, today Fukushima, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:28.157 --> 02:47:28.878]  They don't care.
[02:47:28.878 --> 02:47:30.058]  They don't even report on the real news.
[02:47:30.058 --> 02:47:30.999]  This is called passion.
[02:47:31.459 --> 02:47:42.004]  Yeah, how could they all sit around MSNBC and Fox and CNN, it's all coming out, and go, oh yeah, don't, some reporters, and oh, it is increasing here, and then they don't even, they just go home and have sex and party.
[02:47:42.004 --> 02:47:42.944]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:42.944 --> 02:47:44.545]  I mean, it's just, they're nuts!
[02:47:44.545 --> 02:47:45.445]  They're nuts!
[02:47:45.445 --> 02:47:46.126]  They're nuts!
[02:47:46.906 --> 02:47:53.188]  It is complete insanity, and when people are actually realizing this though, and that's why 2014 is going to be an absolutely winning year.
[02:47:53.188 --> 02:47:53.448]  I agree.
[02:47:53.448 --> 02:47:55.128]  Now listen, we're all honest about this.
[02:47:55.128 --> 02:47:56.148]  We're concerned about this.
[02:47:56.148 --> 02:47:56.929]  This is serious.
[02:47:56.929 --> 02:47:59.709]  The report's nationwide at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:47:59.709 --> 02:47:59.789]  U.S.
[02:47:59.789 --> 02:48:02.370]  government orders 14 million dosages of potassium iodine.
[02:48:02.370 --> 02:48:05.171]  What I do is fund our operation with stuff I really believe in.
[02:48:06.131 --> 02:48:11.177]  And we stockpiled this particular proprietary patented nascent iodine.
[02:48:11.177 --> 02:48:19.567]  It's the purple, blue, true crystal form N-gas injected in the non-GMO
[02:48:21.596 --> 02:48:22.056]  I think?
[02:48:42.674 --> 02:48:44.775]  Fluoride Shield has iodine in it as well.
[02:48:44.775 --> 02:48:50.659]  It's in a two ounce bottle, and that we haven't sold out of yet, but we're getting close as well, but more is coming in as well.
[02:48:50.659 --> 02:49:04.326]  So again, Fluoride Shield, the two ounce bottle, and then we have for $39.95, very low price for what this cost us, and we have the one ounce nascent iodine, that's the pure iodine, for $29.95, and that helps fund our operation as well.
[02:49:04.326 --> 02:49:07.969]  So I go out and go, nobody knows about this, this is the best form, it does all this, I'm
[02:49:08.829 --> 02:49:10.210]  Buy it out and sell it.
[02:49:10.210 --> 02:49:11.031]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:49:11.031 --> 02:49:12.472]  And then we fund our operation.
[02:49:12.472 --> 02:49:13.552]  I sell quality stuff.
[02:49:13.552 --> 02:49:14.893]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:49:14.893 --> 02:49:18.916]  Anthony comments on people taking action and stockpiling this.
[02:49:18.916 --> 02:49:21.998]  I mean, I've got like a hundred bottles at home.
[02:49:21.998 --> 02:49:22.719]  Yeah, I have a lot too.
[02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:23.759]  I'm taking some right now.
[02:49:23.759 --> 02:49:28.283]  I have some actually just sitting there fermenting in my basement as well as some other products as well.
[02:49:28.283 --> 02:49:33.086]  Preparedness is key because, as I mentioned before, potassium iodide, which the government is buying,
[02:49:33.186 --> 02:49:40.612]  Just as they gave out Doritos and Mountain Dew during Hurricane Sandy, they're going to give out, if anything, this might actually just be for government, by the way.
[02:49:40.612 --> 02:49:41.512]  Oh no, this is for the government.
[02:49:41.512 --> 02:49:48.077]  Yeah, but if they were to give it out, they would give out the potassium iodide, which is the poor, low-quality, synthetic, inorganic form.
[02:49:48.077 --> 02:49:49.939]  And I'll be honest, we sell that if people want it.
[02:49:49.939 --> 02:49:54.542]  Yeah, you do sell it because in an emergency scenario, if you have nothing else, obviously you want to take that.
[02:49:54.542 --> 02:49:55.283]  Obviously.
[02:49:55.283 --> 02:49:58.025]  My thing about the survival shield, the nascent iodine, is you can take it every day.
[02:49:58.365 --> 02:50:04.770]  You can take it every day to prepare yourself and help, you know, support your thyroid and everything like that before disaster strikes.
[02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:07.151]  It's already struck and the radiation levels are up!
[02:50:07.151 --> 02:50:12.315]  Exactly, but you know, a meltdown or anything like this, but this potassium iodide, you don't want to take that every day.
[02:50:12.315 --> 02:50:12.995]  Absolutely not.
[02:50:14.110 --> 02:50:17.394]  My thing is, nascent iodine, 100% all the way.
[02:50:17.394 --> 02:50:18.355]  I stockpile it.
[02:50:18.355 --> 02:50:21.638]  I purchased it even before we started selling it, you know, from the manufacturer directly.
[02:50:21.638 --> 02:50:24.241]  I was stockpiling it for my family, giving it out to others.
[02:50:24.241 --> 02:50:25.082]  It tastes great.
[02:50:25.082 --> 02:50:26.223]  That's my thing.
[02:50:26.223 --> 02:50:30.388]  And we can't even really get the elemental form of iodine anymore anyway.
[02:50:30.388 --> 02:50:33.391]  So I would encourage everyone, if they're going to stockpile it, to do it now.
[02:50:34.468 --> 02:50:39.049]  Well that is a worry because they only have a certain supply of the raw crystals.
[02:50:39.049 --> 02:50:41.330]  That's the all DEA approved and all locked.
[02:50:41.330 --> 02:50:44.371]  If Fukushima goes down, good luck getting iodine.
[02:50:44.371 --> 02:50:45.171]  That's the truth.
[02:50:45.171 --> 02:50:45.812]  Any of it?
[02:50:45.812 --> 02:50:46.612]  Yeah, any of it.
[02:50:46.612 --> 02:50:48.512]  Even the potassium stuff.
[02:50:48.512 --> 02:50:49.793]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:50:49.793 --> 02:50:51.153]  888-253-3139 if you want to call and order it.
[02:50:51.153 --> 02:50:54.874]  We're going to come back, take a few phone calls and make some other comments on 2013-2014.
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:04.963]  You better watch out, you sure better cry.
[02:51:04.963 --> 02:51:08.446]  You're at least gonna pout, and I'm telling you why.
[02:51:08.446 --> 02:51:10.909]  Privacy is leaving.
[02:51:12.748 --> 02:51:16.189]  Is your cell phone being used to build a profile on you?

[02:51:26.073 --> 02:51:29.174]  They're gonna make up who's been naughty or nice.
[02:51:29.174 --> 02:51:31.915]  The problem is real and so is the solution.
[02:51:31.915 --> 02:51:37.937]  Go to PrivacyCase.com because... They see you when you're sleeping.

[02:52:01.042 --> 02:52:04.684]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:52:04.684 --> 02:52:08.505]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:52:08.505 --> 02:52:14.688]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:52:14.688 --> 02:52:24.912]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[02:53:06.265 --> 02:53:10.848]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:53:10.848 --> 02:53:12.209]  You have a system that cuts out the
[02:53:12.329 --> 02:53:16.913]  Sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:53:16.913 --> 02:53:27.923]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:53:27.923 --> 02:53:30.605]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!

[02:54:05.871 --> 02:54:06.673]  Yeah.
[02:54:16.776 --> 02:54:19.638]  I would stand in line for this.
[02:54:19.638 --> 02:54:23.041]  There's always time in life for this.
[02:54:23.041 --> 02:54:26.143]  Oh, baby, then it fell apart.
[02:54:26.143 --> 02:54:28.645]  And that's what's happening with all this tyranny.
[02:54:28.645 --> 02:54:35.890]  Repeat what you said to me, because we were getting off the whole Fukushima-Iodine subject, but you said some hardcore stuff that's absolutely true.
[02:54:35.890 --> 02:54:41.213]  During the break, repeat, Anthony, what you were just saying about what's happening with iodine, because it's true.
[02:54:42.054 --> 02:54:42.514]  Tell folks.
[02:54:42.514 --> 02:54:44.915]  We were just having a conversation about the manufacturing stuff.
[02:54:44.915 --> 02:54:49.357]  You're saying, could we actually get more elemental iodine if Fukushima does blow up?
[02:54:49.357 --> 02:54:56.900]  In 2011, some of the numbers I was getting was, per unit, instead of $200, the manufacturers were jacking up to $2,000 a unit.
[02:54:56.900 --> 02:54:58.321]  No one could get iodine.
[02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:04.563]  And then in addition to all of that, they weren't even selling it because they're just stockpiling it in warehouses like diamonds sitting on it.
[02:55:04.563 --> 02:55:07.724]  And for those that don't know, elemental iodine is like alien blood.
[02:55:07.724 --> 02:55:11.126]  It eats through five levels of steel.
[02:55:11.866 --> 02:55:13.067]  If you were to drop it on the ground?
[02:55:13.067 --> 02:55:21.493]  Well, you know, Dr. Group was telling me a story about this one manufacturer who, yeah, they did drip some on the ground on the carpet and went through multiple stories of the building.
[02:55:21.493 --> 02:55:23.895]  I mean, that's how raw and serious this is.
[02:55:23.895 --> 02:55:26.297]  The handling of it is totally insane.
[02:55:26.297 --> 02:55:28.479]  The DEA regulations alone are insane.
[02:55:28.479 --> 02:55:30.760]  You have to handle this with extreme precision.
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:36.625]  And people have warehouses of this just sitting waiting because they know that they can jack up the price.
[02:55:36.625 --> 02:55:38.767]  But the thing is, people are willing to pay for that.
[02:55:38.767 --> 02:55:40.688]  The government is taking a preemptive strike right now.
[02:55:40.708 --> 02:55:41.048]  I don't think so.
[02:56:01.525 --> 02:56:10.770]  Because if Fukushima does go, the iodine alone, the elemental pure iodine, will be the number one commodity in the United States, and probably around the world.
[02:56:10.770 --> 02:56:15.233]  For sure, Japan, if they can even have a functioning commerce system over there.
[02:56:15.233 --> 02:56:18.915]  But iodine will be the number one commodity.
[02:56:18.915 --> 02:56:24.678]  Because even, you know, food's great and everything, but it can't protect you from certain forms of radioactive iodine.
[02:56:24.678 --> 02:56:26.620]  So, that will be the commodity.
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:27.420]  Well said.
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:28.080]  Well said.
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:30.402]  And, I mean, it's already melting down.
[02:56:31.817 --> 02:56:34.620]  But I just, why are they using homeless people?
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:38.123]  Because we pulled up a photo earlier, wasn't the one I saw, they have the group of homeless.
[02:56:38.123 --> 02:56:42.166]  I mean, they look like our homeless, like they had about 100 gallons of sake that day.
[02:56:42.166 --> 02:56:42.787]  No, I'm sure they did.
[02:56:42.787 --> 02:56:45.089]  They got drunk homeless people with their hair sticking up.
[02:56:45.089 --> 02:56:46.470]  This is insane.
[02:56:46.470 --> 02:56:47.692]  I mean, you couldn't come up.
[02:56:47.692 --> 02:56:50.834]  I started almost laughing earlier when you were talking because I was thinking about it.
[02:56:50.834 --> 02:56:51.075]  Yeah.
[02:56:51.075 --> 02:56:54.218]  Like a Monty Python skit where you have the drunk homeless Japanese people.
[02:56:55.078 --> 02:56:56.278]  Yeah, I mean this is not funny.
[02:56:56.278 --> 02:56:57.219]  It's like doing surgery.
[02:56:57.219 --> 02:56:58.339]  But it is funny.
[02:56:58.339 --> 02:57:09.101]  The doctor calls in like the local 7-Eleven owner or something to do the brain surgery and he's like, here you go, just use these tools, it's real simple, you know, we'll pay you two, three dollars a year, just go ahead and do that.
[02:57:09.101 --> 02:57:11.202]  Well, it said less than minimum wage an hour, to be serious.
[02:57:11.202 --> 02:57:18.123]  Well, they're cleaning up the area and everything like that, but knowing those guys, since apparently it is run by completely insane liars, which is true and valid.
[02:57:18.123 --> 02:57:19.323]  Yeah, Tebco's mafia, let's admit it.
[02:57:19.323 --> 02:57:20.003]  Yeah, complete mafia.
[02:57:20.003 --> 02:57:22.784]  They're just busy with tattoos, five women an hour, just...
[02:57:23.044 --> 02:57:23.684]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:23.684 --> 02:57:30.466]  Telling everyone that it's actually fine and there's no radiation concern to live in the Fukushima area and that it's fine and people still live there.
[02:57:30.466 --> 02:57:32.967]  While all the rich Japanese have moved further south, even out of Tokyo.
[02:57:32.967 --> 02:57:33.767]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:33.767 --> 02:57:36.008]  They tell the poor, oh, safe going!
[02:57:36.008 --> 02:57:39.949]  Getting out of Japan entirely too, many of them, when there's hot particles as far as Boston.
[02:57:40.589 --> 02:57:42.751]  But that is the sad joke.
[02:57:42.751 --> 02:57:52.237]  That is the completely sad nightmare that we're living in right now where they say it's perfectly fine and they're on their jets getting out of there as fast as they possibly can and talking about the reality.
[02:57:52.237 --> 02:57:54.819]  Why do you think almost all the rich Israelis are leaving Israel right now?
[02:57:55.441 --> 02:58:01.567]  Well, you know, it comes down to a lot of different things, but I mean, you look at the fact that... It comes down to if they keep attacking Syria, Russia might nuke Israel.
[02:58:01.567 --> 02:58:02.828]  No, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[02:58:02.828 --> 02:58:11.596]  The timeline of events basically comes down to Russia attacking Israel, and ultimately, some analysts say they could fail, but Russia... By the way, there's one of the TEPCO workers.
[02:58:11.596 --> 02:58:16.481]  Yeah, he looks like a hardened veteran for nuclear fission, for sure.
[02:58:16.481 --> 02:58:20.524]  Cleaning up... I'm going to do some overdrive, go to Shauna, I appreciate you holding, and Hunter...
[02:58:21.708 --> 02:58:22.468]  Oh no, wait.
[02:58:22.468 --> 02:58:23.969]  Sean is first, then Jerry, then Hunter.
[02:58:23.969 --> 02:58:25.069]  That's all we're going to have time for.
[02:58:25.069 --> 02:58:26.270]  I apologize.
[02:58:26.270 --> 02:58:32.652]  To Mike in Tennessee, listening on 16... 1600 AM.
[02:58:32.652 --> 02:58:32.712]  1600.
[02:58:32.712 --> 02:58:36.514]  How do you even say an AM station right?
[02:58:36.514 --> 02:58:38.394]  I'm not even saying it right.
[02:58:38.394 --> 02:58:43.536]  It's, uh, 11... Man, I'm thinking about this, this whole Fukushima thing.
[02:58:43.536 --> 02:58:45.177]  My brain can't even work right now.
[02:58:45.177 --> 02:58:45.897]  It's so big.
[02:58:45.897 --> 02:58:48.018]  I'm literally dumbfounded right now.
[02:58:48.018 --> 02:58:49.939]  I'm literally... We'll just do 20 minutes overdrive.
[02:58:49.939 --> 02:58:50.219]  Why not?
[02:58:51.147 --> 02:58:53.048]  Introducing Pro-1.

[03:00:10.842 --> 03:00:12.443]  You want answers?

[03:00:13.983 --> 03:00:18.184]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.184 --> 03:00:22.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.752 --> 03:00:32.315]  Well, most people are doing rebroadcasts, including Fox and folks, not us.
[03:00:32.315 --> 03:00:34.817]  We're here live on New Year's Day 2014.
[03:00:34.817 --> 03:00:38.199]  Anthony Guggiardi with us, another 20 minutes at least.
[03:00:38.199 --> 03:00:41.141]  Let's get to Shawna in Kentucky.
[03:00:41.141 --> 03:00:44.504]  You want to talk about the zombie state and getting people out of the zombie state.
[03:00:44.504 --> 03:00:47.026]  Thanks for calling in today.
[03:00:47.026 --> 03:00:48.907]  Alex and Anthony, you guys are amazing.
[03:00:48.907 --> 03:00:51.830]  I have my daughter here and we're calling her Petunia.
[03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:54.732]  She wants to say hi to Alex, so do you want her to say hi real quick?
[03:00:54.732 --> 03:00:55.172]  Sure!
[03:00:55.172 --> 03:00:56.133]  Hi!
[03:00:56.133 --> 03:00:57.154]  Are you having a good New Year?
[03:00:58.527 --> 03:00:59.908]  Hi Alex Jones.
[03:00:59.908 --> 03:01:00.729]  Hey, how are you doing?
[03:01:00.729 --> 03:01:01.309]  How old are you?
[03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:04.092]  I am seven years old.
[03:01:04.092 --> 03:01:06.234]  Wow.
[03:01:06.234 --> 03:01:09.416]  So, uh, what do you think about what's going on in the world?
[03:01:09.416 --> 03:01:19.365]  Well, basically I think that, um, well, I, I, uh, say something five days before Christmas that was really scary.
[03:01:19.365 --> 03:01:19.645]  Really?
[03:01:19.645 --> 03:01:20.106]  What was that?
[03:01:22.237 --> 03:01:30.999]  What happened was that these two social workers showed up at our house and they wanted to see, come into our house.
[03:01:30.999 --> 03:01:37.340]  And I think we already had a court order that no one else should come into our house after the inspection.
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:47.562]  And the social workers, well they, I don't know what basically happened with the corn oil, but they broke a lot of laws.
[03:01:47.562 --> 03:01:49.962]  They came in your house without a court order?
[03:01:51.485 --> 03:01:53.687]  Yeah, they came into our house.
[03:01:53.687 --> 03:01:54.548]  What did they look like?
[03:01:54.548 --> 03:02:01.974]  Did they look like hippopotamuses?
[03:02:01.974 --> 03:02:03.795]  No, Alex Jones.
[03:02:03.795 --> 03:02:13.483]  What they said to my mom is that you care about more than your constitutional rights and your daughter.
[03:02:13.483 --> 03:02:14.243]  Oh, really?
[03:02:14.243 --> 03:02:15.664]  Really?
[03:02:15.664 --> 03:02:18.327]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[03:02:18.327 --> 03:02:19.928]  Then I'd like to talk to your mom about what happened.
[03:02:21.624 --> 03:02:21.895]  Well...
[03:02:23.436 --> 03:02:34.383]  She wanted to interview me privately and my mom said, OK, you can interview my daughter, me, but I'll be standing right there in the kitchen door with the sheriff.
[03:02:34.383 --> 03:02:37.985]  Yeah, they do that so they can make stuff up later.
[03:02:37.985 --> 03:02:39.686]  They've got a quota of children to grab.
[03:02:39.686 --> 03:02:41.487]  I'm going to go back to you in a moment.
[03:02:41.487 --> 03:02:43.028]  This is an incredible phone call.
[03:02:43.028 --> 03:02:43.989]  Hand the phone to your mommy.
[03:02:43.989 --> 03:02:45.550]  Ma'am, what happened to you?
[03:02:45.550 --> 03:02:47.331]  Did neighbors see your child playing in the backyard?
[03:02:47.331 --> 03:02:49.972]  Because most neighbors think it's wrong.
[03:02:49.972 --> 03:02:51.934]  They call them usually when your kid plays in the backyard.
[03:02:51.934 --> 03:02:52.314]  That's evil.
[03:02:52.814 --> 03:02:55.519]  But tell me, why did the child kidnappers come?
[03:02:56.351 --> 03:02:59.673]  Okay, I'm going to tell you very quick because, of course, it's a long story.
[03:02:59.673 --> 03:03:04.817]  For 2014, this is the most important year for the American Patriots.
[03:03:04.817 --> 03:03:09.700]  I'm in litigation with a company, okay, who sold us a house that's not good.
[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:15.624]  We are, my daughter's a witness and I'm a witness, and we brought in a home inspector to look at the home.
[03:03:15.624 --> 03:03:20.067]  We presented that before the court that they wanted their home inspector to come in.
[03:03:20.067 --> 03:03:24.050]  He came in, falsified a home inspection, sent that to CPS.
[03:03:24.050 --> 03:03:26.271]  They were at our door with allegations against
[03:03:27.152 --> 03:03:30.294]  Yeah, that's what the spy network in Nazi Germany was like.
[03:03:30.294 --> 03:03:33.277]  If the neighbor was mad at you or a group, they would send CPS.
[03:03:33.277 --> 03:03:36.580]  Well, you need to sue him for a false report.
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:41.184]  They'll try to claim it's secret, but you need to go after him.
[03:03:41.184 --> 03:03:42.425]  So what did the CPS claim?
[03:03:43.362 --> 03:03:49.164]  Okay, so she came to my house and she said that there were false reports at the houses.
[03:03:49.164 --> 03:03:51.185]  Well, they said I didn't have a fridge, which of course I did.
[03:03:51.185 --> 03:03:51.885]  There was a picture.
[03:03:51.885 --> 03:03:53.106]  I didn't, my range didn't work.
[03:03:53.106 --> 03:03:53.766]  It did.
[03:03:53.766 --> 03:03:56.007]  I didn't have a heater in my bathroom, which I did.
[03:03:56.007 --> 03:03:57.988]  But if they were all false, I have the documents.
[03:03:57.988 --> 03:03:58.948]  I can show you.
[03:03:58.948 --> 03:03:59.929]  She came to my house.
[03:03:59.929 --> 03:04:02.110]  I said, you need a court order to come into my home.
[03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:06.211]  And Alex, I've been taking these night eyes, so I chilled.
[03:04:06.211 --> 03:04:10.653]  And I'm going to tell you, I love you because if I would have been listening to your show, they would have thrown me over.
[03:04:10.653 --> 03:04:11.914]  I would not have known what to do.
[03:04:11.914 --> 03:04:13.114]  I would not have known how to fight back.
[03:04:13.174 --> 03:04:14.415]  I'm going to come back to you after the break.
[03:04:14.415 --> 03:04:16.196]  This is a short segment here.
[03:04:16.196 --> 03:04:21.540]  But specifically, did the sheriff's deputy force his way into the house?
[03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:28.945]  They told, yeah, they, the sheriff came back with him and they basically said, if you do not let us in, we are going to take your daughter away.
[03:04:28.945 --> 03:04:33.147]  If you really want this to happen five days before Christmas, we are going to go get a warrant for her.
[03:04:33.147 --> 03:04:36.930]  Okay, okay, so, so, well, yeah, I mean, these people all need to be sued.
[03:04:37.470 --> 03:04:41.113]  On the word of some company that made something up, here they come.
[03:04:41.113 --> 03:04:44.896]  But meanwhile, you can't go to that sheriff's deputy's house randomly, you know, somebody claims something.
[03:04:44.896 --> 03:04:50.941]  But I'm telling you, you let cable people, home inspectors, anybody in, don't have your family there when you're there.
[03:04:50.941 --> 03:05:00.709]  Because most of these companies, air conditioner, repair people, you name it, make more money off 25% bounties on kids and stuff to stay there than they make on the job.
[03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:04.801]  Who says things can't go down before they go up?
[03:05:04.801 --> 03:05:06.562]  The freeze-dry guy, that's who.
[03:05:06.562 --> 03:05:12.804]  The freeze-dry guy has just learned of a 2014 manufacturer's price increase on Mountain House freeze-dried foods.
[03:05:12.804 --> 03:05:16.265]  So what is he doing about Mountain House food prices going up?
[03:05:16.265 --> 03:05:18.486]  The freeze-dry guy is bringing down prices.
[03:05:18.486 --> 03:05:19.766]  20% down for the rest of 2013.

[03:05:52.818 --> 03:05:55.902]  Who says ending a year on a down note isn't a good thing?
[03:05:55.902 --> 03:05:58.465]  Get Mountain House food down 20% only at freeze-dryguy.com.
[03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:04.392]  Hi folks, Ronnie McMullin here for LifeChangeT.
[03:06:04.392 --> 03:06:08.596]  Healthcare is a problem, whether you're for or against Obamacare.
[03:06:08.596 --> 03:06:09.556]  It's a mess.
[03:06:09.556 --> 03:06:11.798]  My question is, who do you trust?
[03:06:11.798 --> 03:06:15.341]  Do you want to be told what to do, or do you want to make your own decision?
[03:06:15.341 --> 03:06:16.102]  My opinion?
[03:06:16.102 --> 03:06:17.163]  Preventative maintenance.
[03:06:17.563 --> 03:06:24.268]  Keeping your colon clean is preventative maintenance, a little exercise, a balanced diet, and drinking life-change tea.
[03:06:24.268 --> 03:06:30.853]  It tastes great, and it helps with constipation, high cholesterol, liver problems, acid reflux, and much, much more.
[03:06:30.853 --> 03:06:35.617]  And with the holiday season upon us, you can get some extra tea for free!
[03:06:35.617 --> 03:06:37.018]  Don't wait for Obama.
[03:06:37.018 --> 03:06:38.039]  Make your own decision.
[03:06:38.499 --> 03:06:39.260]  Order now!
[03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:40.942]  Call us at 928-308-0408.

[03:06:53.514 --> 03:06:57.838]  Ridding yourself of harmful toxins is truly preventative maintenance.

[03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:09.326]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:07:09.326 --> 03:07:17.731]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:07:17.731 --> 03:07:22.634]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:07:22.634 --> 03:07:28.998]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:29.398 --> 03:07:36.584]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:07:36.584 --> 03:07:43.610]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:48.094]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:07:48.094 --> 03:07:51.297]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:07:51.477 --> 03:07:57.762]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:07:57.762 --> 03:08:02.786]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:08:02.786 --> 03:08:09.431]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.431 --> 03:08:12.413]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.542 --> 03:08:26.245]  If you just joined us, under zoning laws, they're going to take your children, they're going to put you in a 250 square foot box.
[03:08:26.245 --> 03:08:29.026]  Communist China is already starting this.
[03:08:29.026 --> 03:08:32.788]  They are going to track you with the cell phones, the cars.
[03:08:32.788 --> 03:08:35.009]  If you speed, they're going to take your kids.
[03:08:35.009 --> 03:08:38.671]  The surveillance grid is meant to destroy the average person.
[03:08:38.671 --> 03:08:41.372]  And a lady called in, Shawna in Kentucky,
[03:08:42.930 --> 03:09:00.819]  To tell the story about how they got in a fight over inspections with the house, dealing with companies, and then the other company wanted to send their inspector, so they did, and then she was saying they called CPS on her, I guess saying that they'd have a refrigerator and stuff that wasn't true.
[03:09:00.819 --> 03:09:10.324]  I know wealthy people that have had their kids taken because their kid broke their finger at school, and you're at the hospital and you go, they broke it at school.
[03:09:11.064 --> 03:09:12.925]  And they go, we'll see about that.
[03:09:12.925 --> 03:09:14.145]  CPS comes in.
[03:09:14.145 --> 03:09:19.186]  It doesn't matter that a week later it comes out in court it happened at school.
[03:09:19.186 --> 03:09:23.047]  Because they've already started an investigation and they go, just sign these forms.
[03:09:23.047 --> 03:09:26.388]  Admit, you know, that you'll do what we say and then you can keep your kid.
[03:09:26.388 --> 03:09:28.569]  You sign them, they leave.
[03:09:28.569 --> 03:09:35.450]  Just like the Marines said earlier when they would clear houses, they would try to come in from the roof or whatever to flush you out so they wouldn't have to confront you cornered.
[03:09:35.450 --> 03:09:37.071]  So they let you go home for two days.
[03:09:38.069 --> 03:09:42.654]  Now you think you're going to keep your kid, now the sheriff's deputy shows up.
[03:09:42.654 --> 03:09:44.496]  And they're usually part of special pedo units.
[03:09:44.496 --> 03:09:45.236]  I'm serious, folks.
[03:09:45.236 --> 03:09:45.657]  I've seen it.
[03:09:45.657 --> 03:09:46.257]  It's unbelievable.
[03:09:46.257 --> 03:09:50.562]  I mean, you cannot understand statistically the evil of these people.
[03:09:50.562 --> 03:09:53.585]  The special units they have in the CPS, all of it.
[03:09:53.585 --> 03:09:58.130]  And then they come in and go, we're just taking your daughter for a few days for an evaluation.
[03:09:58.590 --> 03:10:09.562]  They get them there, they give them cokes, all, you know, pastries, they get them all jacked up, throw them into a thing with like 10 other kids, and your kid gets raped, you know, or they beat your kid's brains out.
[03:10:09.562 --> 03:10:18.011]  I mean, you see this all the time, that seven times more likely, it was five, now seven times more likely to die or be hurt in CPS clutches than anywhere else.
[03:10:18.011 --> 03:10:19.293]  You're safer in a crack house.
[03:10:19.733 --> 03:10:20.674]  Statistically.
[03:10:20.674 --> 03:10:22.595]  I mean, it is the hell pit of earth.
[03:10:22.595 --> 03:10:30.901]  Who would want that job even if you were, every once in a while, you weren't a bad CPS person and you were actually trying to help kids that are being hurt or whatever because they're bad parents out there?
[03:10:30.901 --> 03:10:32.762]  Well, usually they're not allowed to take those kids.
[03:10:32.762 --> 03:10:35.964]  The court doesn't want some kid, you know, that's all totally screwed up.
[03:10:35.964 --> 03:10:37.725]  They want your healthy little kid.
[03:10:37.725 --> 03:10:39.907]  They're going to get top dollar.
[03:10:39.907 --> 03:10:41.188]  And that's what they do.
[03:10:41.188 --> 03:10:43.650]  If this woman's child had been two, gone.
[03:10:43.650 --> 03:10:44.370]  One year old, gone.
[03:10:44.370 --> 03:10:45.391]  The fact that she's seven.
[03:10:46.776 --> 03:10:54.762]  She could speak out when they got their clutches on her, and it's not as easy to physically hurt and have your way with a seven-year-old.
[03:10:54.762 --> 03:11:01.006]  That's why they really love Down Syndrome kids, to get them when they're young, because no one's going to believe them.
[03:11:01.006 --> 03:11:04.289]  That's these units' favorite thing, to torture.
[03:11:04.289 --> 03:11:08.392]  And I'm sorry to have to talk like this, you need to know the government is total scum-evil at the top.
[03:11:08.392 --> 03:11:12.976]  Its tentacles go down, the CPS is the mouth of Satan, basically, to eat your children.
[03:11:13.736 --> 03:11:21.581]  And this woman saying, thank God, started crying that she'd heard the show to know how to handle them when all this goes on or she wouldn't have her daughter.
[03:11:21.581 --> 03:11:24.642]  But it's time for us to stand up to the CPS.
[03:11:24.642 --> 03:11:27.864]  They are the most evil organization in the world.
[03:11:27.864 --> 03:11:29.025]  They do the same thing in Europe.
[03:11:29.025 --> 03:11:30.666]  I've had members of parliament on.
[03:11:30.666 --> 03:11:32.587]  They constantly kill these children.
[03:11:32.587 --> 03:11:34.248]  They constantly beat their brains out.
[03:11:34.248 --> 03:11:35.869]  They constantly rape them.
[03:11:35.869 --> 03:11:37.490]  I mean, it is just hell force level.
[03:11:37.970 --> 03:11:50.376]  And it's something that really gets to my guts because I covered this a lot when I was first on air, local news, and I would go and see them lie in court, not even put the right names on the paperwork.
[03:11:50.376 --> 03:11:54.378]  And the judges in Travis County over family court, literally,
[03:11:55.339 --> 03:12:02.182]  Judge Jeanne Meiner and others that they build buildings after are literal Janet Reno goblins.
[03:12:02.182 --> 03:12:12.568]  I mean, literally, like Emperor Palpatine gets off on people being in pain, when the families cry and all this bad stuff happens, the judge literally is feeding on it psychically.
[03:12:12.568 --> 03:12:14.789]  Okay, I mean, I'm telling you, I cannot be in the room.
[03:12:14.789 --> 03:12:16.630]  I mean, I literally
[03:12:18.075 --> 03:12:23.278]  Literally, literally, it's like being stabbed by a ring-raised sword, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12:23.278 --> 03:12:37.125]  When you see them preying on the kids, and you know you can't stop them, and you know, and then they've got little pot-bellied cops that are special units, and you know what they are, I mean, when you realize you're dealing with literal, literal scum.
[03:12:37.125 --> 03:12:44.949]  Now, ma'am, just tell your story in a nutshell so everybody can understand what happened, because they may, not trying to scare you, may be lurking back, but, because,
[03:12:45.851 --> 03:12:47.192]  But expand on what happened.
[03:12:47.192 --> 03:12:50.335]  So now, how did the sheriff's deputy force their way in?
[03:12:50.335 --> 03:12:55.059]  I guess they said, well, we're going to come back, take your kid, which is a terroristic threat, because the court order was a fraud.
[03:12:55.059 --> 03:12:56.060]  Maybe they wouldn't get it.
[03:12:56.060 --> 03:12:58.141]  Maybe they didn't tell you could go to court and challenge it.
[03:12:58.141 --> 03:13:00.864]  They just said, we're going to take your kid if you don't let us in now.
[03:13:00.864 --> 03:13:02.285]  They'll use a plate in the sink.
[03:13:02.285 --> 03:13:04.126]  They'll use dog hair.
[03:13:04.126 --> 03:13:07.429]  Doesn't matter if their facility's got kids with herpes being gang raped.
[03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:08.810]  That doesn't matter.
[03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:11.032]  They're going to find a dog hair and take your kid.
[03:13:11.032 --> 03:13:12.193]  So what happened?
[03:13:14.289 --> 03:13:15.110]  Okay.
[03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:17.192]  So she said that she's going to get court order.
[03:13:17.192 --> 03:13:20.215]  I said, okay, I'm going to go before the judge and I'm going to argue this.
[03:13:20.215 --> 03:13:21.156]  Then she escalated.
[03:13:21.156 --> 03:13:24.419]  She goes, oh no, no, no, I'm going to go tonight and I'm going to get a court order.
[03:13:24.419 --> 03:13:26.161]  And I said, well, what's the legal way to do this?
[03:13:26.161 --> 03:13:29.164]  And she said, I got to get a court order and I got to do something else.
[03:13:29.164 --> 03:13:30.786]  She said, I said, let's do it legal.
[03:13:30.786 --> 03:13:33.729]  Get out of my, because what happened, it started to rain and they were in one room.
[03:13:33.729 --> 03:13:35.211]  I said, get out of the home.
[03:13:35.871 --> 03:13:41.219]  And then she said, if I come back, I'm going to bring a whole bunch of police officers with me.
[03:13:41.219 --> 03:13:44.083]  We are going to take your daughter five days before Christmas.
[03:13:44.083 --> 03:13:46.145]  Do you really want to do this to your daughter?
[03:13:46.145 --> 03:13:47.708]  And then this is what happened.
[03:13:47.708 --> 03:13:48.048]  She said,
[03:13:49.165 --> 03:13:57.868]  Oh, and then she said, real quick, I'll tell you, she said, I said to her, if you were in my place and you know that somebody put false accusations against you, what would you do?
[03:13:57.868 --> 03:13:59.088]  And she said, I would say search.
[03:13:59.088 --> 03:14:00.188]  I have nothing to hide.
[03:14:00.188 --> 03:14:00.948]  Okay?
[03:14:00.948 --> 03:14:16.573]  And Alex, I'll just jump to here, at the end of this, she searched, she found nothing, she falsified documents, and because I have two, a bachelor's, a master's in educational psychology, and I'm in my doctoral program in education sciences, I looked at each one on there and said, this is not true.
[03:14:17.273 --> 03:14:19.976]  And so she went, okay, fine, you'll continue to do this for your daughter.
[03:14:19.976 --> 03:14:21.517]  And I said, this one's not true.
[03:14:21.517 --> 03:14:22.839]  She wrote continue on all of them.
[03:14:22.839 --> 03:14:27.924]  The only problem she had was she said I had my dogs and she wanted me to put some of my dogs in another room.
[03:14:27.924 --> 03:14:29.285]  Let's just stop right there.
[03:14:29.285 --> 03:14:30.787]  They always say you're guilty.
[03:14:30.787 --> 03:14:31.948]  They're never wrong.
[03:14:31.948 --> 03:14:34.170]  You might not have gotten a hardcore criminal one.
[03:14:34.170 --> 03:14:35.511]  They will make up anything.
[03:14:35.511 --> 03:14:39.695]  And once they get your daughter alone, they say you will see mommy again when you say
[03:14:40.376 --> 03:14:50.349]  When you show me the doll, and that they put things in the dolls behind, and they bring in the doll, bring in the cop, and you go, now show us and you'll see mommy.
[03:14:50.349 --> 03:14:56.998]  Then they start the video, and then you never see mommy again, and then they actually take you to the death pit.
[03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:01.541]  Medical science, you name it, or they might sell you.
[03:15:01.541 --> 03:15:04.082]  I mean, you may be on a plane, and I'm not trying to scare you, man.
[03:15:04.082 --> 03:15:07.544]  People have to realize the total Satan force we're dealing with.
[03:15:07.544 --> 03:15:12.986]  Now, you may not have been dealing with a pure demon, but one of the useful idiot trendies that, you know, sits around on this all day.
[03:15:12.986 --> 03:15:19.549]  But exactly, since you are so smart, you were able to deal with this goblin creature that was here doing this.
[03:15:19.549 --> 03:15:23.851]  But this is an example, and you notice she lied on you anyways, because you're the enemy.
[03:15:23.851 --> 03:15:27.292]  In Ohio, they're going to take all the children of homeschoolers.
[03:15:27.552 --> 03:15:28.933]  They got the bill.
[03:15:28.933 --> 03:15:30.434]  They're on TV saying it's illegal.
[03:15:30.434 --> 03:15:36.459]  In Germany, from top scientists that are worth $10 million, they take their children who don't want to go to government school.
[03:15:36.459 --> 03:15:40.442]  Those kids look like something out of a postcard from the 50s.
[03:15:40.442 --> 03:15:43.485]  And they flee here to America, they're sent back.
[03:15:43.485 --> 03:15:45.846]  They are coming for our children.
[03:15:45.846 --> 03:15:46.567]  It's announced.
[03:15:46.567 --> 03:15:49.369]  They are the demons of hell.
[03:15:49.369 --> 03:15:49.749]  Okay?
[03:15:49.749 --> 03:15:51.451]  They are the demons of hell.
[03:15:51.451 --> 03:15:52.572]  So how did it end, ma'am?
[03:15:53.644 --> 03:15:54.104]  I went through.
[03:15:54.104 --> 03:15:55.685]  I said, tell me the allegations.
[03:15:55.685 --> 03:15:56.085]  I want to know.
[03:15:56.085 --> 03:15:57.485]  She said, I can't tell you they're anonymous.
[03:15:57.485 --> 03:15:58.385]  I said, I know who did them.
[03:15:58.385 --> 03:16:00.046]  There were only two people in my home.
[03:16:00.046 --> 03:16:00.886]  She wrote them down.
[03:16:00.886 --> 03:16:02.726]  And I cornered her.
[03:16:02.726 --> 03:16:03.786]  And I said, did I do this?
[03:16:03.786 --> 03:16:04.367]  She said, no.
[03:16:04.367 --> 03:16:05.747]  I went through the whole list.
[03:16:05.747 --> 03:16:08.388]  And then I told her, I want your name on here.
[03:16:08.388 --> 03:16:09.428]  She said, I'm not going to do it.
[03:16:09.428 --> 03:16:10.068]  I'll get in trouble.
[03:16:10.068 --> 03:16:12.208]  I'm not supposed to give you the allegations.
[03:16:12.208 --> 03:16:13.589]  And then I said... Well, you know what?
[03:16:13.589 --> 03:16:17.270]  Listen, you use law enforcement techniques, the old-fashioned ones they've gotten rid of.
[03:16:17.270 --> 03:16:17.690]  You say...
[03:16:18.570 --> 03:16:31.537]  You know, the guy's name, and you say the name of the inspector or the name of the inspector if it's a female, and you say, oh, he said, because they're lying, so you've got to use psych warfare back on them, only in emergencies, just to prove they're lying.
[03:16:31.537 --> 03:16:33.819]  You go, well, he said he would do that, how dare him?
[03:16:33.819 --> 03:16:38.241]  And then you'll trick them and they'll say it, and now you've got them with the false report.
[03:16:38.241 --> 03:16:38.962]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:16:39.893 --> 03:16:40.614]  Absolutely.
[03:16:40.614 --> 03:16:44.336]  I got her, and I got it in my hands.
[03:16:44.336 --> 03:16:46.257]  She tore off a piece of paper, I was going to put her name on that.
[03:16:46.257 --> 03:16:48.039]  She goes, no, I'll write it on another piece of paper.
[03:16:48.039 --> 03:16:49.580]  And Alex, this is what she said to me.
[03:16:49.580 --> 03:16:52.001]  It's got to be my witness in front of three witnesses.
[03:16:52.001 --> 03:16:56.424]  She said, OK, you've got the handwriting, but nobody will ever know who handwrote it.
[03:16:56.424 --> 03:16:57.525]  No one will ever know.
[03:16:57.525 --> 03:17:00.167]  And you and I both know I could bring in a handwriting analysis.
[03:17:00.167 --> 03:17:00.907]  Here's the deal.
[03:17:00.907 --> 03:17:05.771]  When you show them you're strong and know what you're doing, they got a whole list of kids they can go kidnap.
[03:17:06.511 --> 03:17:11.174]  So they move on because, you know, if wolves see a sheep that's not a sheep, they're going to back off.
[03:17:11.174 --> 03:17:13.936]  We're going to skip this network break, go to the bottom of the hour.
[03:17:13.936 --> 03:17:17.038]  But this is the evil we're dealing with now.
[03:17:17.038 --> 03:17:19.039]  So this happened a week ago.
[03:17:19.039 --> 03:17:21.100]  This happened five days before Christmas.
[03:17:21.100 --> 03:17:22.021]  I've been freaked out.
[03:17:22.021 --> 03:17:23.121]  I've been preparing a question.
[03:17:23.121 --> 03:17:24.422]  Have the demons come back.
[03:17:24.422 --> 03:17:25.463]  Have the demons come back.
[03:17:26.098 --> 03:17:32.583]  No, I went to the county attorney to get protection for me and my daughter.
[03:17:32.583 --> 03:17:48.675]  That's right, and now you go before the city council, you go before the county commissioner, and you go every week forever and talk about the CPS, and then other people will come to you because you'll now be a leader, and you can form a coalition with lawsuits and to drive these demons back.
[03:17:48.675 --> 03:17:51.798]  But that's what we need to do, is organize with the love of children
[03:17:52.338 --> 03:18:01.391]  To battle these enemies, and then you'll find cases where there's literal crackhead babies that weigh half of what they should weigh and flee infested facilities that they won't take.
[03:18:01.391 --> 03:18:03.294]  Because they're a eugenics board.
[03:18:03.294 --> 03:18:05.357]  What county, what city are you in, ma'am?
[03:18:06.979 --> 03:18:08.840]  I can give that information to you.
[03:18:08.840 --> 03:18:12.363]  I can see the document, but I'm not comfortable giving it over the phone.
[03:18:12.363 --> 03:18:14.505]  No, I totally agree, but listen, that's fine.
[03:18:14.505 --> 03:18:18.508]  I mean, just in general, flame scares away wolves, okay?
[03:18:18.508 --> 03:18:19.508]  Light scares them away.
[03:18:19.508 --> 03:18:27.655]  We don't need to say your name or anything, but the whole point is we'll get in contact with you, and then if you want to go public, they try to persecute you, I'll fly up there.
[03:18:27.655 --> 03:18:33.019]  And the whole thing is I can't do this for every case, because I get these calls by the hundreds a week, people crying, and then a lot of times
[03:18:33.439 --> 03:18:34.219]  The kids are dead later.
[03:18:34.219 --> 03:18:34.980]  They killed their children.
[03:18:34.980 --> 03:18:43.482]  Well, I was going to say, grown men, I've listened to the show for a while, grown men consistently call in crying, talking about how the CPS took away their kids and did horrible things to them.
[03:18:43.482 --> 03:18:46.223]  And every single time... There have been people I couldn't help or they killed them.
[03:18:46.223 --> 03:18:51.725]  It's because they sign the documents they give them and they try and roll over and they think appeasing them will work.
[03:18:51.725 --> 03:18:58.187]  No, these are child kidnappers that want to convince you that they're doing a good job when they are the most dangerous group, period, for children.
[03:18:58.187 --> 03:18:58.787]  Fact!
[03:18:58.787 --> 03:19:00.088]  Criminal organizations.
[03:19:00.848 --> 03:19:01.348]  Exactly.
[03:19:01.348 --> 03:19:04.089]  Police, when you aid them, it's all coming down on you and your family.
[03:19:04.089 --> 03:19:05.690]  God is going to smite you.
[03:19:05.690 --> 03:19:07.690]  I want the police to know that they're part of this.
[03:19:07.690 --> 03:19:10.531]  You wonder why your lives are so hellish or why your five-year-old just got cancer?
[03:19:10.531 --> 03:19:11.932]  It's because you did this.
[03:19:11.932 --> 03:19:14.273]  God is going to cut you down.
[03:19:14.273 --> 03:19:16.373]  Anybody that's part of this is going to hell.
[03:19:16.373 --> 03:19:17.434]  Go ahead.
[03:19:17.434 --> 03:19:17.934]  Exactly.
[03:19:17.934 --> 03:19:22.816]  And the only way to fight back with this is to use intellectual tactics against them.
[03:19:22.816 --> 03:19:23.076]  That's right.
[03:19:23.076 --> 03:19:27.257]  You've got to maintain... I know it's hard to be calm, even hearing what you did handling them.
[03:19:27.257 --> 03:19:28.478]  Now, what did the witch say?
[03:19:28.478 --> 03:19:29.538]  Did she say she was going to come back?
[03:19:31.064 --> 03:19:33.046]  Um, she said I'll be back in a week and a half.
[03:19:33.046 --> 03:19:34.608]  The week and a half was today.
[03:19:34.608 --> 03:19:39.173]  I went to the county attorney and this woman said, you won't believe what she said to me.
[03:19:39.173 --> 03:19:40.935]  I went to her for protection under the law.
[03:19:40.935 --> 03:19:42.256]  I wrote it all out.
[03:19:42.256 --> 03:19:44.459]  And I said, we deserve to be protected.
[03:19:44.459 --> 03:19:46.020]  We are witnesses in a trial.
[03:19:46.020 --> 03:19:47.962]  She's not going to protect you in her demon force?
[03:19:47.962 --> 03:19:48.303]  Go ahead.
[03:19:49.107 --> 03:19:49.827]  That's what she said.
[03:19:49.827 --> 03:19:51.328]  She said, I knew these people.
[03:19:51.328 --> 03:19:53.448]  I showed her the falsified documents.
[03:19:53.448 --> 03:19:55.929]  They will never admit any of their people are bad.
[03:19:55.929 --> 03:19:56.829]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[03:19:56.829 --> 03:19:58.010]  So I freaked out.
[03:19:58.010 --> 03:19:58.590]  Exactly.
[03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:59.330]  I freaked out.
[03:19:59.330 --> 03:20:01.070]  I called the state police.
[03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:04.351]  And I said, these people have been in litigation with the attorney.
[03:20:04.351 --> 03:20:08.352]  Well, listen, now that you've gotten on record, they know it's a dirty trick they play.
[03:20:08.352 --> 03:20:09.693]  They're all going to cover each other.
[03:20:10.322 --> 03:20:13.243]  That's why they catch an officer that's a pedo, they let them do it.
[03:20:13.243 --> 03:20:15.724]  That's why they do this, because it's their thing.
[03:20:15.724 --> 03:20:18.485]  And they may not go after her now that she has dirt.
[03:20:18.485 --> 03:20:25.568]  She may be safe, but she should get a real shark smart lawyer that knows how they work, not some... You need to get a hold of the Homeschool Legal Defense.
[03:20:25.568 --> 03:20:27.849]  Guys, put up the InfoWars article, it has a link to them.
[03:20:27.849 --> 03:20:30.030]  I want to get that group back on next week at least.
[03:20:30.030 --> 03:20:36.333]  Put up the InfoWars article about Ohio to come take the children of homeschoolers, to send CPS to all homes of it.
[03:20:37.193 --> 03:20:39.294]  It's Democrats persecute homeschooling parents.
[03:20:39.294 --> 03:20:41.255]  And then go click on the link to the Homeschooling Defense League.
[03:20:41.255 --> 03:20:42.116]  They have the lawyers.
[03:20:42.116 --> 03:20:47.038]  They also dose up these kids with ADHD and ADD drugs without any actual screening.
[03:20:47.038 --> 03:20:52.741]  And then they give them more of the different types of drugs that are prescribed to treat the same thing.
[03:20:52.741 --> 03:20:53.222]  Absolutely.
[03:20:53.222 --> 03:20:59.385]  Ma'am, we're going to get your name and number, but send all your documents and stuff to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[03:20:59.385 --> 03:21:02.847]  But they're really persecuting people in the South and Kentucky and everywhere else.
[03:21:03.887 --> 03:21:06.330]  Uh, now some counties aren't run by demons.
[03:21:06.330 --> 03:21:07.771]  You'll be in one county and it isn't done.
[03:21:07.771 --> 03:21:12.276]  Uh, because you've got a Christian, you know, judges and sheriffs and people that aren't demons.
[03:21:13.373 --> 03:21:19.436]  I mean, they're trying to take people's kids in Texas for spanking them when they're not even hurt, and the state police and others are going, no, that's not illegal.
[03:21:19.436 --> 03:21:23.038]  So, I mean, I'm not saying they're all bad, but they have special units.
[03:21:23.038 --> 03:21:26.560]  We had a state senator on from Georgia who called me and said, I've got them.
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:30.762]  I've got the documents where they're shopping for the types of kids they want federally.
[03:21:30.762 --> 03:21:33.924]  And then her and her husband committed suicide and burned themselves up two days later.
[03:21:34.718 --> 03:21:35.479]  I mean, they murdered her.
[03:21:35.479 --> 03:21:42.847]  It was found in Philadelphia, the same thing, that they were purposefully sending these children to jail to have their way with them and to make money off of it for years and years.
[03:21:42.847 --> 03:21:45.549]  Well, Janet Reno would go check kids out of CPS.
[03:21:45.549 --> 03:21:52.336]  She was caught by the police with an 11-year-old girl, but Reno ran off the road and was in the back seat vomiting on her.
[03:21:52.336 --> 03:21:54.879]  She was on so many barbiturates and alcohol.
[03:21:54.879 --> 03:21:56.020]  They took Reno in.
[03:21:56.020 --> 03:21:57.442]  That's when she was the district attorney.
[03:21:57.682 --> 03:22:01.464]  And then we can't even get past the most simple things in the news cycle right now.
[03:22:01.464 --> 03:22:06.006]  We're still debating the smallest things like Obamacare, and these are the literal demons running everything.
[03:22:06.006 --> 03:22:08.127]  I mean, it's what it is.
[03:22:08.127 --> 03:22:10.949]  Who usually rules it are these women.
[03:22:10.949 --> 03:22:14.611]  And then they want to be able to go get the little kids for themselves, and then they have pedos under them.
[03:22:15.191 --> 03:22:23.579]  Then they've got like weird liberal socialists that hate, you know, the mainline textbooks that I've read on air say the families of bygone age, we've got to eradicate it.
[03:22:23.579 --> 03:22:24.440]  And now they're doing it.
[03:22:24.440 --> 03:22:26.462]  So these people really believe families are bad.
[03:22:26.462 --> 03:22:28.704]  And a lot of them were abused if they're not pedos.
[03:22:28.704 --> 03:22:30.206]  They were abused and mentally ill.
[03:22:31.904 --> 03:22:36.285]  And it's like a crazy person says, you look like my cousin, I don't like, I'm going to kick your butt.
[03:22:36.285 --> 03:22:37.685]  And it's the same thing.
[03:22:37.685 --> 03:22:41.326]  Everything looks like a nail because they got a hammer.
[03:22:41.326 --> 03:22:47.887]  That's why they have over 50% turnover in CPS, the highest rate in government, because a lot of people get into it for the right reasons.
[03:22:47.887 --> 03:22:51.407]  And they really want to help people because there are some good social workers out there.
[03:22:51.407 --> 03:22:55.528]  I've run into them for like old people and stuff like that.
[03:22:55.528 --> 03:22:58.849]  But when it gets into child services, folks, it's, I mean, I'd say 50% demon.
[03:23:00.765 --> 03:23:03.066]  And the other 50% mentally ill morons.
[03:23:03.066 --> 03:23:05.187]  Or, that's the percent that stays in.
[03:23:05.187 --> 03:23:08.809]  Half, over half, I think it's up to 60% in some areas, cannot be around it.
[03:23:08.809 --> 03:23:09.489]  God bless you, ma'am.
[03:23:09.489 --> 03:23:10.630]  We're going to put you on hold.
[03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:11.570]  Get your name and info.
[03:23:11.570 --> 03:23:13.611]  John Harmon, send that to us on IM.
[03:23:13.611 --> 03:23:16.053]  We'll give it due and try to keep track on this.
[03:23:16.053 --> 03:23:20.615]  And I'm glad you got through, and I'm sorry you're there scared of the sicko filth government.
[03:23:21.295 --> 03:23:25.158]  Uh, but, uh, you know, you just stand your ground, let them know you're aware of them.
[03:23:25.158 --> 03:23:30.202]  Uh, and, uh, you know, she's claiming you can't have dogs in the house.
[03:23:30.202 --> 03:23:32.283]  I mean, look, that's what I'm telling you.
[03:23:32.283 --> 03:23:34.384]  Nobody is good in their system.
[03:23:34.384 --> 03:23:35.025]  You understand that?
[03:23:35.025 --> 03:23:35.846]  Except them.
[03:23:35.846 --> 03:23:37.186]  Who are the worst people in America?
[03:23:37.186 --> 03:23:37.587]  You understand?
[03:23:39.690 --> 03:23:40.391]  God bless you.
[03:23:40.391 --> 03:23:44.176]  And by the way, what's happened to her, it's the same system in Germany, Australia.
[03:23:44.176 --> 03:23:44.877]  Russia did this.
[03:23:44.877 --> 03:23:46.179]  They've gotten rid of this.
[03:23:46.179 --> 03:23:47.500]  Russia's apologized.
[03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:48.562]  They had the biggest orphanages.
[03:23:48.562 --> 03:23:50.625]  They took the kids for state training.
[03:23:50.625 --> 03:23:52.227]  Russia has almost gotten rid of that.
[03:23:52.227 --> 03:23:54.530]  Now they encourage you to have children and pay you to do it, actually.
[03:23:54.955 --> 03:23:57.216]  And tell you to spank them and everything.
[03:23:57.216 --> 03:23:58.317]  I mean, that's what I've got to tell you.
[03:23:58.317 --> 03:24:03.799]  I mean, that's because that's a government, though, that realizes they're going to fully collapse if they don't get away from the eugenics.
[03:24:03.799 --> 03:24:06.360]  Well, I was going to say, it's not that Russia's even good.
[03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:13.083]  It's just they've come to this realization that maybe we should return to things that actually work to build ourselves up to have ultimate power.
[03:24:13.083 --> 03:24:17.245]  If they want to become a major world power, they're going to have to do what we did through the... Exactly.
[03:24:17.245 --> 03:24:21.227]  The social engineers that run us are so deviant.
[03:24:21.227 --> 03:24:22.688]  It's about screwing us up.
[03:24:23.590 --> 03:24:29.932]  It's about, in Italy and in California, letting 60-year-old men grab 11-year-olds out of your backyard and rape them, and then it's called love.
[03:24:29.932 --> 03:24:32.213]  I can't go into the girls' locker rooms for 8-year-olds.
[03:24:32.213 --> 03:24:34.574]  Let's show the article in case people don't believe us.
[03:24:34.574 --> 03:24:40.656]  Yeah, yeah, and teach 5-year-olds how to put lipstick on in California, and if you're against it, you're racist.
[03:24:41.897 --> 03:24:42.837]  People ask these questions.
[03:24:42.837 --> 03:24:45.339]  They say, well, why would they want to destroy this nation?
[03:24:45.339 --> 03:24:52.583]  Why wouldn't we be like Russia and be going to the gold standard, be paying for children because the family is actually good and more population is better and has better jobs?
[03:24:52.583 --> 03:24:54.505]  Why wouldn't we want to do all those things?
[03:24:54.505 --> 03:24:57.166]  The people in control are so warped and insane.
[03:24:57.166 --> 03:24:58.487]  All they want is to destroy.
[03:24:58.487 --> 03:24:59.528]  Let's just say it.
[03:24:59.528 --> 03:25:02.630]  The Russian thugs that run that country like Russians.
[03:25:02.630 --> 03:25:02.990]  That's right.
[03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.991]  They like Russian women.
[03:25:03.991 --> 03:25:04.971]  They like Russian children.
[03:25:04.971 --> 03:25:05.772]  They like being men.
[03:25:07.787 --> 03:25:13.174]  And it's like you look at thug, gangster, strong men, they're like angels compared to what we have.
[03:25:13.174 --> 03:25:15.818]  Pot-bellied, pedophile trash.
[03:25:15.818 --> 03:25:17.560]  Drinking our children's souls up.
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:20.765]  And we used to have boss hogs, you know, around the 40s, 50s, maybe even into the late 80s.
[03:25:20.765 --> 03:25:21.846]  That's what the Russians are!
[03:25:21.926 --> 03:25:22.206]  Yeah.
[03:25:22.206 --> 03:25:23.007]  They're boss hogs.
[03:25:23.007 --> 03:25:27.129]  The Russian system right now is 1950s America.
[03:25:27.129 --> 03:25:29.830]  And they're going to succeed, and they're going to have a better economy.
[03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:30.571]  They're going to dominate.
[03:25:30.571 --> 03:25:37.575]  They're going to completely dominate, and China's going to see them after we've built- They're already doing- China's already getting away from one child and trying to not destroy man now.
[03:25:37.955 --> 03:26:00.074]  But our pedophile system built up China, so we expect China to ally with these elite in the United States, but China's going to betray the United States elite and join up with Russia because it's going to be the dominant power, and then Russia and China are going to be dominating, and we're going to be still here getting arrested for having children with dogs in the home and freaking out over Obamacare as we're completely obliterated economically and policy-wise.
[03:26:00.094 --> 03:26:07.236]  By absolute psycho enemies that say our children belong to us, Melissa Harris Perry licking her lips with demonic glint in her eye.
[03:26:07.236 --> 03:26:11.097]  I mean, that woman is an enemy witch, saying our kids belong to her.
[03:26:11.097 --> 03:26:13.118]  What a filthy piece of crap!
[03:26:13.118 --> 03:26:14.478]  What an enemy!
[03:26:14.478 --> 03:26:15.539]  What an enemy!
[03:26:15.539 --> 03:26:18.960]  I mean, she is a declared absolute witch!
[03:26:20.222 --> 03:26:23.426]  She really is, and just look at her.
[03:26:23.426 --> 03:26:29.374]  We live in a world where you can't say, just look at that person, look how evil they are, because that's rude or whatever or politically incorrect.
[03:26:29.374 --> 03:26:30.516]  You can just look at that woman.
[03:26:30.516 --> 03:26:32.358]  She looks like a scaled lizard.
[03:26:32.358 --> 03:26:33.319]  When I think about her, I just...
[03:26:35.447 --> 03:26:35.907]  All of them.
[03:26:35.907 --> 03:26:41.089]  You can look at someone like Janet N- It's all about her being in power and all these other narcissist trash.
[03:26:41.089 --> 03:26:47.072]  Look, because they're all weak, they want to destroy what's powerful in America because they hate us, because they know we're better than them!
[03:26:47.072 --> 03:26:48.272]  That's what it's about!
[03:26:48.272 --> 03:26:51.814]  It's about packs of weak people, dumbasses ruling us!
[03:26:51.814 --> 03:26:54.555]  It's just like the guy we- I see you, Perry!
[03:26:54.555 --> 03:26:57.116]  God, I pray you be brought to justice!
[03:26:57.116 --> 03:26:57.856]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:26:57.856 --> 03:26:59.417]  They'll get what they want, though.
[03:26:59.417 --> 03:27:04.299]  When the United States has completely collapsed, they'll revel in it and then realize they have completely failed themselves.
[03:27:04.878 --> 03:27:23.994]  It's just like yesterday, we talked to an individual from a foreign nation, a third world country, and he was talking about how great the United States is, and how, you know, capitalism is amazing, and all of his friends and family from that foreign country, they hate America, and they don't get it, and they like socialism, and he was saying how amazing this was, you know, back in the 70s and 80s.
[03:27:23.994 --> 03:27:26.876]  He was an Iranian who came to Austin and made a hundred million dollars.
[03:27:27.162 --> 03:27:28.543]  Yeah, probably more than that.
[03:27:28.543 --> 03:27:32.284]  And he was talking about how great it all was and how he gives back to the community and everything like that.
[03:27:32.284 --> 03:27:34.185]  And it's the real American dream.
[03:27:34.185 --> 03:27:37.767]  Meanwhile, his family probably was jealous or something and hated it.
[03:27:37.767 --> 03:27:39.967]  And hated the fact that you... No, that's what it is!
[03:27:39.967 --> 03:27:42.909]  It's just like people that hate you if you're successful or you're beautiful.
[03:27:42.909 --> 03:27:46.710]  Like back when I was young and didn't, you know, wasn't out of shape, I was really good looking.
[03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:47.691]  A movie star good looking.
[03:27:48.331 --> 03:27:53.113]  And it was like other beautiful women would like me, but the average person would be real mean to me.
[03:27:53.113 --> 03:27:55.434]  I didn't figure out until later because I was good looking.
[03:27:55.434 --> 03:28:02.417]  And successful people, instead of these losers, instead of the losers attaching themselves to successful people and saying, hey, you know, teach me about this stuff.
[03:28:02.417 --> 03:28:03.697]  Let's work on this together.
[03:28:03.697 --> 03:28:04.978]  They just envy them and hate them.
[03:28:05.498 --> 03:28:07.179]  And want to destroy them.
[03:28:07.179 --> 03:28:10.042]  That's the ideology here.
[03:28:10.042 --> 03:28:12.224]  For example, that's why Russia is a little bit different.
[03:28:12.224 --> 03:28:18.209]  All the boss hogs and mafia, they have like a kingpin and they all want to rally and get into the mafia and get in on it and make all the money.
[03:28:18.209 --> 03:28:22.212]  In the United States, it's like lemmings just like killing each other over a dollar.
[03:28:22.212 --> 03:28:23.553]  They don't want to split it up.
[03:28:23.553 --> 03:28:25.094]  It's like a hundred million dollars.
[03:28:25.094 --> 03:28:27.376]  They don't want to say, hey, let's all go make more money.
[03:28:27.376 --> 03:28:29.418]  They just want it all for themselves by doing nothing.
[03:28:29.798 --> 03:28:32.981]  And they just want to get rid of anybody that's successful because they hate it.
[03:28:32.981 --> 03:28:36.644]  It's like a self-destruct virus has been put into the West.
[03:28:36.644 --> 03:28:38.825]  Yeah, seriously, it's literal mental illness.
[03:28:38.825 --> 03:28:40.507]  There's no such thing anymore.
[03:28:40.507 --> 03:28:44.210]  That's what Michael Savage says, Dr. Savage, is that they are mentally ill.
[03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:45.131]  And I realize that now.
[03:28:45.131 --> 03:28:46.612]  They really are mental patients.
[03:28:46.812 --> 03:28:50.255]  No, and when I was on his show, he kept asking me, you know, why would they be transferring the snook?
[03:28:50.255 --> 03:28:50.955]  It doesn't make any sense.
[03:28:50.955 --> 03:28:51.796]  Are these people crazy?
[03:28:51.796 --> 03:28:52.717]  The only answer is yes.
[03:28:52.717 --> 03:28:55.959]  I mean, there's literal mental illness from the top to the bottom.
[03:28:55.959 --> 03:28:59.161]  It's because the elite are so insane that the general public is now so insane.
[03:28:59.161 --> 03:28:59.762]  No, exactly!
[03:28:59.762 --> 03:29:00.963]  That's how historically it works!
[03:29:01.598 --> 03:29:04.339]  And that's why the countries, they're not as insane in the public.
[03:29:04.339 --> 03:29:11.422]  And you know, speaking to people from, you know, other areas in the Ukraine, everything like that, they all say, you know, the United States is so strange.
[03:29:11.422 --> 03:29:13.022]  No one has social ability.
[03:29:13.022 --> 03:29:13.903]  No one can go up and talk.
[03:29:13.903 --> 03:29:15.063]  No one can even talk now.
[03:29:15.063 --> 03:29:16.824]  Yeah, no one can even talk.
[03:29:16.824 --> 03:29:20.805]  They go and hang out and they say, listen, I apologize to Jerry and Mike and others.
[03:29:20.805 --> 03:29:23.226]  If you give us your number, we will call you tomorrow.
[03:29:23.226 --> 03:29:23.686]  I promise.
[03:29:23.686 --> 03:29:25.847]  Get John Harmon, give it to him and we'll do it.
[03:29:25.847 --> 03:29:26.407]  I'm out of here.
[03:29:26.407 --> 03:29:27.188]  I'm out of time.
[03:29:27.188 --> 03:29:27.808]  I'm exhausted.
[03:29:29.074 --> 03:29:33.999]  Uh, and, uh, great job Giussiardi, great job Watson, great job Crew, great job everybody.
[03:29:33.999 --> 03:29:35.081]  This is total Veritas.
[03:29:35.081 --> 03:29:40.626]  I mean, I think we should call this last 20 minutes, like, you know, total Veritas.
[03:29:40.626 --> 03:29:42.028]  I mean, powerful.
[03:29:42.028 --> 03:29:43.329]  We laid it out here.
[03:29:43.329 --> 03:29:43.610]  Yeah.
[03:29:43.610 --> 03:29:45.111]  They're a bunch of scum.
[03:29:45.111 --> 03:29:49.236]  The battle plan for the- That hate men, hate families, and they gotta be dealt with.
[03:29:49.236 --> 03:29:49.856]  Choose, folks.
[03:29:49.856 --> 03:29:50.557]  Choose what side you're on.
