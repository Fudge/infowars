[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:31.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.440 --> 00:39.920]  just like individual lives years have a life of their own that's because the
[00:39.920 --> 00:45.860]  planet orbits around the Sun every 365 days as you know and generates the life
[00:45.860 --> 00:52.360]  on this planet is the main engine the main energy source for life on this
[00:52.360 --> 00:58.800]  planet and so one year has come and gone and died literally died and a new
[00:58.800 --> 01:06.880]  year has now begun in many time zones around the world 24 hours ago we are
[01:06.880 --> 01:17.080]  now into 2014 truly momentous year with all that is happening it is the first
[01:17.080 --> 01:26.640]  day of January 2014 and we are hurtling into the battle the fray with the new
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.000]  world order and we're going to be here for again the next three hours we have
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.960]  John Bown infowars nightly news reporter and also radio producer joining us at
[01:38.960 --> 01:45.920]  the bottom of the hour yesterday he shot a report on 360 in Austin and filed that
[01:45.920 --> 01:54.240]  report this morning shot on his iPhone 4 I believe and it was a woman standing
[01:54.240 --> 01:57.560]  right beside her burning car on her cell phone everyone driving by not even
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.120]  caring and then even some people on YouTube this went right to YouTube today
[02:02.120 --> 02:08.000]  it's up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com are like big deal you
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.400]  know people didn't stop because the fire is no big deal and of course John
[02:12.400 --> 02:15.160]  didn't catch it right away because he's yelling at her before he even turns the
[02:15.160 --> 02:18.440]  camera on get away from the car because he had to park down the street and run
[02:18.440 --> 02:22.960]  towards her and so he ran about 200 yards you know towards her yelling get
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.480]  away from the car by the time he turns it on you could share about 10 feet away
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.760]  and then she starts walking towards him about 50 feet as he meets her and she's
[02:30.760 --> 02:35.480]  still on her phone obviously calling the fire department but the reason I
[02:35.480 --> 02:40.040]  mentioned this is not even our top story it's just important is it ties into this
[02:40.040 --> 02:46.400]  mindset where they're fracking with with such corrupt practices across the
[02:46.400 --> 02:54.120]  United States that the the well water is is catching on fire they're safe ways
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.200]  to frack by the way I've got family that have come and gone and passed that
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.320]  were petroleum geologists you name it people that work for refineries there
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.360]  are very safe ways to do this but when you have this modern age an example is
[03:08.360 --> 03:18.080]  BP and you have British petroleum doing things like ordering three different
[03:18.080 --> 03:22.360]  engineering companies that were all on site at the deep water horizon don't
[03:22.360 --> 03:27.880]  pour concrete and what they call mud a mix in as you drill so it doesn't back
[03:27.880 --> 03:33.480]  pressure and blow out and cause an undersea you know red-a-dare type
[03:33.480 --> 03:39.720]  explosion just dump water on top of it that'll save us you know 15 million
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.800]  dollars a day I think was the number and that was this that was the head people
[03:44.800 --> 03:47.840]  in England calling the head people in Houston and then they literally had to
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.000]  fire multiple heads of crews and send in other companies that were there as
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.440]  contractors to do it because all the engineers said this is going to explode
[03:55.440 --> 04:00.200]  and the engineers knew the math knew the science is one of the deepest wells
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.560]  ever drilled 30 plus thousand feet they knew what was going to happen but the
[04:04.560 --> 04:11.120]  delusional executives just knew they'd make more money if they didn't have to
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.600]  spend the money on the concrete and the mud that was being premixed on the
[04:15.600 --> 04:22.000]  ground and then brought out to sea on big ships and so they didn't want to have
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.280]  15 million dollars a day of that being dumped in the hole 15 million dollars a
[04:26.280 --> 04:32.160]  day all the transcripts of the radio chatter was recorded and logged and they
[04:32.160 --> 04:35.440]  said no I'm not gonna do it you're relieved you do it this is gonna explode
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.800]  they actually had fist fights it came out later in court on the drilling rig
[04:39.800 --> 04:43.280]  when people were ordered to do it they're like that's insane and people began to
[04:43.280 --> 04:47.320]  punch each other in the faces because they knew they were about to blow up the
[04:47.320 --> 04:52.440]  oil raid and it killed a bunch of people folks killed people on land killed
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.680]  killed kill all his fish all the rest of it this is the mental illness out there
[04:56.680 --> 05:04.080]  the insanity in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple
[05:04.080 --> 05:09.520]  foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations
[05:09.520 --> 05:14.120]  around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[05:14.120 --> 05:18.760]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[05:18.760 --> 05:24.200]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[05:24.200 --> 05:29.880]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[05:29.880 --> 05:34.160]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[09:59.240 --> 10:04.360]  down new very important NSA developments were a new NSA document
[10:04.360 --> 10:10.840]  confirmed to be accurate leaked out in the Snowden cache shows that the NSA
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.000]  with their training slides their PowerPoint slides calling the public
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.560]  zombies making fun of everyone and saying really who didn't know that 1984
[10:21.560 --> 10:28.400]  wouldn't come in 1984 I mean it's amazing NSA slides with images of the
[10:28.400 --> 10:36.520]  Apple computer at making fun of everyone because we are the enemy this is an
[10:36.520 --> 10:43.480]  open culture of naked tyranny in our faces ladies and gentlemen and again I
[10:43.480 --> 10:49.000]  want to thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide edition the first day
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.200]  of the new year John Baum will be popping in at the bottom of the hour in
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.360]  studio we're gonna air his report he shot on the streets yesterday where a woman
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.320]  is just standing literally one or two feet from a burning car on the side of
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.800]  the highway and no one is stopping to help her no one is telling her get back
[11:04.800 --> 11:09.560]  and but by the time he got the camera out running up to her she's about 1015
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.040]  feet away and walking towards him but the point is is that there are people on
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.120]  YouTube saying hey he shouldn't have stopped and helped her she was fine it's
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.360]  okay to stand by a burning car that later completely was engulfed in flames and
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.480]  that John bound has video of from about 200 yards away and cars are driving right
[11:27.480 --> 11:30.920]  by the burning car before the fire department got there like I didn't care
[11:30.920 --> 11:37.080]  and I know that stretch of 360 there's a fire department about a mile away from
[11:37.080 --> 11:42.000]  there but it's rush hour traffic people run about 30 miles an hour on a normally
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.880]  65 mile an hour road just driving right by a burning car I mean I see a burning
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.800]  car up ahead I'm going to get on the shoulder I'm gonna even drive across the
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.640]  shoulder go the other way especially I got my kids with me because you see one
[11:54.640 --> 11:57.480]  was already got flame coming out of the bottom of it and smoke everywhere it's
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.960]  going to blow up when those gas tanks boil and again this feeds into everything
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.880]  we're talking about about this nation of spectators and you see this in other
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.040]  authoritarian countries like China where people will not render a I was a case I
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.280]  must have been 10 years ago now where an Austin cop got hit by a car at the
[12:16.280 --> 12:20.320]  corner of a four-way stop with his car sitting there he'd gotten out somebody
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.280]  run into him it was like 45 minutes leave want anyone even call the police
[12:24.280 --> 12:29.200]  and he later died I mean I mean I see a cop an old lady a black guy a white guy
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.520]  I don't care who you are you know run over in the side of the road I'm gonna
[12:33.520 --> 12:37.640]  pull over and help you and it's not cuz I'm some hero ladies and gentlemen it's
[12:37.640 --> 12:43.000]  a normal I want you to help me and and this is the spirit of tyranny we're
[12:43.000 --> 12:51.120]  dealing with just absolutely apathetic don't care don't care if Fukushima is
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.320]  belching out radiation don't care if 90 plus percent of the reactors in the US
[12:55.320 --> 12:59.120]  are leaking don't care if fracking is being done so sloppily all over the
[12:59.120 --> 13:07.840]  country that water out of the local tap out of the local water facility but also
[13:07.840 --> 13:16.760]  out of the wells is catching on fire it just goes on and on and on and how
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.520]  people don't care anymore that that's what comes with evil ah those aren't
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.120]  babies kill 52 million of them in abortion ah those aren't humans in Iraq
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.000]  kill a million of them with a fake war and cutting off their food in medicine
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.440]  oh you know whatever assads a piece of garbage let all kind of blow up all the
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.880]  churches I don't care I care about me and these fools think that when you only
[13:36.880 --> 13:40.320]  care about yourself and I let that ladies car burn let her stand right next
[13:40.320 --> 13:44.720]  to the car those people cared so little about her they were delusional and we're
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.640]  driving right by it slowing down to like five miles an hour from 30 miles an
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.920]  hour there's video of this looking at the burning car a foot from it you're a
[13:53.920 --> 13:58.200]  foot from a car in your car and you drive up and look at the black smoke
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.680]  you're breathing oh look at the look at the black smoke let me drive let me
[14:02.680 --> 14:08.600]  drive right by that and there's a woman standing a foot and a half two feet
[14:08.600 --> 14:11.880]  from it and the car later blows up and there's pieces everywhere and then
[14:11.880 --> 14:18.160]  people on YouTube think we're weird there's like a 20% negative vote on it
[14:18.160 --> 14:24.680]  that's we really have 97% support because the idea of having a brain is now
[14:24.680 --> 14:39.480]  illegal try to warn people about all this stuff and it just gets worse and
[14:39.480 --> 14:46.840]  worse and worse and worse because they think those of us that are warning
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.240]  everybody that the ships already gone into an iceberg that we made the ship at
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.560]  the iceberg so if they deny that we've had an iceberg we magically then will
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.640]  all be okay but we've already hit the iceberg politically socially culturally
[14:58.640 --> 15:04.240]  I'll tell you what's wrong with people they are a nation of mega spectators a
[15:04.240 --> 15:11.960]  world of spectators literally plugged into their optic nerves and via audio as
[15:11.960 --> 15:24.160]  well into the false reality proto matrix system of television movies HD 3d all of
[15:24.160 --> 15:30.880]  it and then the entire system is weaponized and and and layered with
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.800]  different systems of propaganda programming overt covert messages
[15:35.800 --> 15:44.480]  subliminal on record hammering the general public's minds and we are living
[15:44.480 --> 15:51.120]  in an incredible dystopic science fiction movie that's what's going on the
[15:51.120 --> 15:55.560]  culture's been weaponized the media has been weaponized the schools have been
[15:55.560 --> 16:00.480]  weaponized the police have been militarized the entire culture is
[16:00.480 --> 16:05.240]  turning in on itself and the globalist know how evil nature works their evil
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.800]  themselves but they are programming the types of Deccan and evil they want into
[16:09.800 --> 16:14.880]  people show that they will not stand up for themselves or anybody else as we are
[16:14.880 --> 16:20.880]  reclamated as we are spiked as we are removed as we are decimated as we are
[16:20.880 --> 16:27.320]  dumbed down as we are literally turned into soylent green you know they're
[16:27.320 --> 16:32.280]  passing laws in Europe and trying to pass them in states like Florida where
[16:32.280 --> 16:35.880]  you cannot be cremated because of the carbon that puts out and you cannot be
[16:35.880 --> 16:41.000]  buried because that takes up land use you have to be dissolved in acid that is
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.840]  then turned into fertilizer and put on crops to produce corn that is fed to
[16:46.840 --> 16:59.560]  cows now just so you know that is soylent green 110 percent and the guys
[16:59.560 --> 17:06.680]  just found in CNBC article showing that so this is what's going on ladies and
[17:06.680 --> 17:10.680]  gentlemen we are going into a soylent green situation and I get some areas of
[17:10.680 --> 17:13.720]  overpopulated I get there's a lot of toxic industries I get it but the
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.200]  globals are blocking all the new clean systems and they decided not to build a
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.360]  better world that's hard to do it's easier just to help screw everything up
[17:21.360 --> 17:26.880]  so at least you're in control of it they're directing all the sins and all
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.960]  the degeneracies and all the corruptions and all the mental illnesses into
[17:31.960 --> 17:39.720]  directed human streams of evil just like you fire fire hoses at mountain
[17:39.720 --> 17:45.280]  sides to then pan for gold or other other extractions other aggregates other
[17:45.280 --> 17:51.560]  alluvials that you want and that's where they're just using the harness evil of
[17:51.560 --> 17:56.960]  the worldwide beast system all the corruption all the wickedness focus like
[17:56.960 --> 18:07.080]  a laser beam like a particle beam against humanity and that's right they've
[18:07.080 --> 18:14.080]  now released new NSA documents admitting that of course Steve Jobs and

[24:33.240 --> 24:39.680]  host Alex Jones now coming up for 40 minutes in the third hour we're gonna
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.160]  look at the state of nuclear reactors here in the U.S. but also in Europe
[24:44.160 --> 24:48.400]  Japan you name it the latest developments on Fukushima where they are
[24:48.400 --> 24:52.120]  trying to clean up the site and it's actually generating more radiation but
[24:52.120 --> 25:00.280]  there's an article up on drudgereport.com right in the middle column top
[25:00.280 --> 25:07.520]  story in the middle column nuclear feds order 14 million dosages of potassium
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.520]  iodide and if you actually read it they ordered 14 million packages of it of the
[25:13.520 --> 25:19.240]  iosat we we sell it in for store.com and in emergencies you know it's it's
[25:19.240 --> 25:23.160]  better than nothing naysan iodide from all my experts is the way to go but
[25:23.160 --> 25:28.400]  they've ordered 14 million of these and they're not saying why but we're gonna
[25:28.400 --> 25:34.560]  be talking about that in more detail but Watson in his article goes over the
[25:34.560 --> 25:37.640]  history the funny thing is Gucciardi was already writing an article about this
[25:37.640 --> 25:40.800]  this morning without even talking to Watson it shows how we're on the same
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.920]  page you know we follow the fed biz site about FEMA camps you know where they're
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.200]  hiring guards for reeducation centers who do not a process social security
[25:51.200 --> 25:55.480]  numbers and daycare centers in the FEMA camps where they keep your kids I mean
[25:55.480 --> 25:59.960]  it's all there the the billions of bullets the drones the all the stuff
[25:59.960 --> 26:03.600]  that didn't even classified millions of dollars for paper targets of children
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.640]  were they trying to shoot kids we find it all right here do you imagine what's
[26:07.640 --> 26:11.960]  classified and then they just have MSNBC come out and go there's no FEMA camp
[26:11.960 --> 26:17.360]  there's no internment camp there's no army training manuals free education
[26:17.360 --> 26:24.720]  centers even though we can find it all at the fed biz ops dot gov because
[26:24.720 --> 26:27.920]  they're supposed to have free open bidding process the truth is most of
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.880]  it's totally rigged but at least that part of the law makes it where you can
[26:30.880 --> 26:36.200]  see what the public bids are including on classified projects they'll just have
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.160]  the declassified part but just off that we can then go ferret around and find
[26:41.160 --> 26:47.120]  stuff out that's how we already survived in the last year while we couldn't buy
[26:47.120 --> 26:54.960]  AK-47 ammo 7.62 what 3 9 all of it was they were buying up all the other
[26:54.960 --> 27:02.400]  calibers so that we couldn't get them tens of millions of AK-47s and semi
[27:02.400 --> 27:10.120]  autos I mean per order just millions and millions of rounds of every caliber
[27:10.120 --> 27:13.760]  you could imagine every strange caliber that no one even uses they're just
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.880]  putting in huge warehouses to drive up prices and to make it unavailable they've
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.000]  shut down all the lead smelters in the US the last one shut down this week shuts
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.840]  down I guess today but closed last week but officially is shut today under law
[27:28.840 --> 27:33.600]  it's just total shutdown of America total shutdown of anything they don't want
[27:33.600 --> 27:36.760]  you to have access to so we're gonna be talking about that with incident good
[27:36.760 --> 27:43.240]  charity but the story is up on info wars.com it's a linked in red and it's
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.880]  the second story there in the featured news area now the third story there in
[27:49.880 --> 27:53.520]  the featured news story some of the other news we're gonna be breaking down how
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.240]  to address growing poverty more confiscation by government Kurt Nemo's
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.440]  article video woman stands by burning car example of sheep like zombie
[28:02.440 --> 28:08.800]  population another one duping the left New York mayor is a total minion of the
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.160]  Clintons and that's well known but it's okay because he's married to a black
[28:13.160 --> 28:16.360]  lady so everything he must do is all right I mean it just never ends we've
[28:16.360 --> 28:20.240]  also got articles up there about the media trying to cover up racial attacks
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.120]  against whites that are really intensifying men and women in public
[28:24.120 --> 28:29.560]  and the police will not respond just like when they had groups of quote minority
[28:29.560 --> 28:34.000]  men raping women in mass over and over again the last 20 years in New York and
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.480]  finally on helicopter video of 100 200 men just raping women the police stand
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.480]  down because political correctness is king and as long as it's a white devil
[28:44.480 --> 28:48.440]  getting raped by a couple hundred men and getting their job broke while their
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.400]  husband gets beat to death that's a good thing you understand that that has to be
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.800]  allowed because only whites could ever do anything racial and bad you understand
[28:57.800 --> 29:02.920]  that's important very by no and I agree with that I think that you have 200
[29:02.920 --> 29:06.960]  Puerto Rican men want to rape a woman and kill her that's all right if she's
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.000]  white I think if black people want to target white folks in a mall and nobody
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.320]  comes to their aid and they you know break bones and break legs and break
[29:16.320 --> 29:19.920]  ribs and knock teeth out and the police to stand down I think that's what should
[29:19.920 --> 29:24.880]  happen I think the black people should go to the malls with ice picks I mean
[29:24.880 --> 29:28.240]  sarcastic I better not say that they'll fit me it actually will be Alex said do
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.200]  it now this is sick ladies and gentlemen this is sick and it's just like the
[29:32.200 --> 29:35.800]  Klan going out and finding some black guy dragging him to death but you'll
[29:35.800 --> 29:42.640]  never hear a word about it now it's a sacrament good job MSNBC you really are

[33:25.920 --> 33:30.640]  zombiosis in the country that's what the NSA actually calls it we now learn
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.360]  from documents from two years ago that have been leaked out that they're not
[33:34.360 --> 33:42.360]  denying where Apple is the NSA it is the tip of the spear the most wide open
[33:42.360 --> 33:46.600]  directly designed with backdoors to track everything you do that's why all
[33:46.600 --> 33:52.360]  the new appliances in the home are designed to tie into iPhones particularly
[33:52.360 --> 33:56.640]  not just droids and I'm not defending droids I'm not a tech guy I was reading
[33:56.640 --> 34:03.480]  what the experts are saying they're wide open as well and but but but Apple has
[34:03.480 --> 34:07.720]  been heavily involved folks Apple is the most vicious evil company out there
[34:07.720 --> 34:11.200]  that I can think of except for maybe like Microsoft they're all part of the

[34:47.760 --> 34:52.560]  constitutionalism is liberal it's the greatest expression of the Renaissance

[35:40.680 --> 35:47.440]  2014 law affects transgenders smokers drunk drivers since first graders are
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.480]  going to be taught that they could be a transgender people go don't be mean to
[35:51.480 --> 35:56.120]  transgenders man that's not even on my radar screen I don't have anything
[35:56.120 --> 36:02.040]  against anybody I'm a freedom lover but don't teach first graders about it when
[36:02.040 --> 36:05.760]  they're not even thinking about it to confuse them on purpose especially while
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.280]  they're having their food jacked with estrogen mimicers that's why in public
[36:11.280 --> 36:15.000]  school for 30 years they tried to make boys you know not play cowboys and
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.200]  Indians are not wrestle and do the little girl stuff I don't care what
[36:18.200 --> 36:20.840]  culture is you get little girls and little boys out in the park little
[36:20.840 --> 36:23.400]  girls start trying to make dinner and break up sticks and twigs like it's
[36:23.400 --> 36:26.960]  dinner and invite you over for dinner and you know they set up a little tent a
[36:26.960 --> 36:30.320]  little house and they'll say come into our house to the boys that's what
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.360]  humans do and the boys are out running around hunting and going to war they
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.480]  don't want that that's why they teach little boys you're cool your stylish
[36:40.480 --> 36:46.280]  wear pink and aren't men good-looking and that's pedophilia I don't want you
[36:46.280 --> 36:53.200]  teaching little boys it's like bringing hustler in for for third graders you
[36:53.200 --> 36:58.880]  know it's on record that people like Joe Kennedy would give you know
[36:58.880 --> 37:02.640]  pornography to his teenage sons and that's actually been something that's
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.280]  been done in a lot of cultures you know to make sure your boys get primed right
[37:07.280 --> 37:10.160]  and start getting a little I mean they're not already trying to go after the
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.880]  girls if they're scared I didn't have that problem oh man I tell you I was like
[37:16.880 --> 37:23.120]  a wolf by the time I was 11 but the point is is that is that that's
[37:23.120 --> 37:27.280]  questionable right there you know where you go to the deer camp when you're
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.400]  11 and and others you know playboys laying around over by the domino sets
[37:32.400 --> 37:39.360]  in the card table but that's when you're 11 or 12 folks and you get taken
[37:39.360 --> 37:42.640]  around men on a hunting trip and there's playboys laying over there like hey
[37:43.440 --> 37:47.280]  they don't say go look at them they're just there that's the culture though and
[37:47.280 --> 37:53.280]  they're doing this with kindergartners on transsexual gay bcality you name it
[37:53.280 --> 37:59.600]  folks and that's pedophilia right there bottom line ladies and gentlemen bottom
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.560]  line you're not getting introduced to sex by finding dad's playboys folks you're
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.560]  getting introduced to it by kids being put on smartphones it's full of porn
[38:08.560 --> 38:15.440]  and seeing stuff that a grown man doesn't need to look at and I didn't mean to
[38:15.440 --> 38:18.480]  digress off into this we're gonna get to John Bounds report here in a moment
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.800]  briefly the federal government has been buying tens of millions of dosages
[38:24.800 --> 38:27.760]  during the last Fukushima event I think it was eight million dosages we can look
[38:27.760 --> 38:35.280]  that up or packets this time they bought 14 million 14 million treatments of
[38:35.280 --> 38:38.800]  iosat that we do sell an info or store.com and help support the broadcast
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.320]  and it's the bound type it's very powerful it doesn't break down as quickly
[38:45.600 --> 38:48.800]  but if I had to take this during a radiological event I would the problem is
[38:48.800 --> 38:52.480]  it's not maintenance you get sick taking this all the time you take pure nation
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.800]  iodine I personally do every day and I've built up to taking a lot more and it just
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.480]  gets better and better consult your physician take the direct in amount
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.480]  you have any medical issues again do that but our brand of this
[39:04.480 --> 39:08.800]  survival shield nascent iodine dietary supplement is patented proprietary
[39:10.800 --> 39:13.600]  and let me tell you let me give you an example if I wanted to buy crud iodine
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.160]  I could buy it for like a dollar a bottle this stuff cost me ten dollars a bottle
[39:20.160 --> 39:25.360]  okay and I saw for 29.95 and it funds our operation that sounds like oh that's a
[39:25.360 --> 39:28.000]  big profit no not in vitamins and supplements that's not we need that to
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.080]  fund the operation but it's very competitively priced leading competitors with crud iodine
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.360]  are fifty sixty dollars and it's not even the good stuff I'm not attacking the
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.040]  competitors I'm just telling you this is half the price double the strength
[39:39.040 --> 39:44.320]  it's amazing and you can also get the survival shield in bulk and get discounts
[39:44.320 --> 39:51.120]  at infohorselife.com but you can also get the fluoride shield that has five other

[40:10.240 --> 40:16.160]  is the fluoride shield and we do have that in we're about to sell out of this survival shield
[40:16.160 --> 40:23.040]  but we'll get more in a couple weeks so infohorselife.com or call toll three eight eight eight two five
[40:23.040 --> 40:28.320]  three three one three nine now here's the deal with the big radioactive wave that's taken two
[40:28.320 --> 40:32.640]  plus years to get here arriving in the next month and taking three months to come in that's
[40:32.640 --> 40:38.000]  mainstream news fox news with radiation levels going up with Fukushima continuing to melt down
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.360]  with the extraction process why do you think the federal government for their people this is for them
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.520]  them just bought 14 million dosages the biggest one-time purchase we've ever seen that's up on
[40:49.520 --> 40:55.920]  info wars.com easiest place to find it drudgereport.com right in the middle top column i'm asking you
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.000]  because yes i am supporting our operation here promoting what i believe in that's called a win win
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.840]  win it gets the free speech out it supports you and your family's health and preparedness
[41:07.360 --> 41:12.240]  and it supports our entire operation to expand not just uh stay at the same level or contract
[41:12.240 --> 41:16.320]  because if we don't grow we're going to implode here in info wars that's a simple fact so thank
[41:16.320 --> 41:23.520]  you so much for your support infohorselife.com or eight eight eight two five three three one three
[41:23.520 --> 41:31.280]  nine and again um you i take this daily but you also have it in backup in storage for a radiological
[41:31.280 --> 41:34.480]  event in fact i already took some this morning but i'm going to take more i'm getting nowhere i
[41:34.480 --> 41:41.360]  personally take four dropperfuls a day and it just gets better and better i would not do this at first
[41:41.360 --> 41:48.080]  as a doctor group and others have said because you will detox i i would personally take less than
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.080]  what the recommended dose is talk to your own doctor it's what i would do when you first start
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.240]  for about a month or two and then after you get used to it it's just man i tell you you've heard
[41:58.240 --> 42:03.360]  the reviews it's no brag it's just fact folks were like marveling when i said i was you taking
[42:03.360 --> 42:09.360]  iodine on the air and drudging put a tweet out saying you know look jones is shooting raw iodine
[42:09.360 --> 42:15.280]  on air i think that says it all because if you do take regular iodine it is it is like a hundred
[42:15.280 --> 42:19.680]  times jack daniels i mean the way it burns and it literally makes you see spots i mean when i've
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.080]  taken it as a test of other because we sold out of this i was looking for other brands other groups
[42:24.080 --> 42:29.760]  and i just i just couldn't sell it and i'm not knocking it it's just that this is perfect for
[42:29.760 --> 42:35.840]  children in my view again talk to your physician uh the toll free number does eight eight eight two
[42:35.840 --> 42:43.600]  five three three one three nine so coming up apple denies ever working with the nsa after zero hedge
[42:45.120 --> 42:52.400]  put out a report on the big hacking conference they had in germany where the nsa's confirmed this
[42:52.400 --> 42:58.320]  and of course they're hopping mad new nsa slides training manuals uh online power points where they
[42:58.320 --> 43:02.080]  call the general public zombies and laugh at us and talk about how they're surveilling everything
[43:02.080 --> 43:08.000]  we did i'm telling you that's the attitude i saw a bunch of law enforcement graduates
[43:08.640 --> 43:12.640]  they were they were older but they were there were some other degrees and trying to go back
[43:12.640 --> 43:16.880]  and get another degree at martins and how they were going to go work for the nsa and all on
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.480]  power trips and i got in their face about it a few months ago you know out at the local natural
[43:22.480 --> 43:28.960]  spring pool because that's the imperious attitude you see with the nsa is just a manifestation of
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.520]  government corruption and they've got compartments of the nsa who are doing real work and really
[43:33.520 --> 43:38.800]  are tracking bad guys overseas but they're compartmentalized so iphone users are zombies
[43:38.800 --> 43:44.400]  and steve jobs was big brother according to nsa uh report and what's that been picked up by now
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.880]  that's now uh come out uh out of the hovington post i was telling the crew a few days ago and
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.120]  this broke this is big so i'm glad it's getting picked up out there uh print that off for me thank
[43:57.120 --> 44:03.760]  you very much so hovington post tech dirt info wars dot com it's all being reported so this is the
[44:03.760 --> 44:08.480]  way they operate they're calling you dumb zombies and the reason they're calling you dumb zombies
[44:08.480 --> 44:13.680]  is because people act like it i've told the story my son was about a year and a half old we're at
[44:13.680 --> 44:19.520]  a lebanoline restaurant in north austin my wife and i am my child and i i go into wash my hands
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.960]  in the bathroom and and i and i come out and there's people all gathered around saying call 911
[44:24.960 --> 44:32.800]  and a woman was choking and this went on and on and on and on uh and so i said listen she'll be
[44:32.800 --> 44:39.440]  dead by then short of turn purple kill over the table uh it was a obese woman and i said you got
[44:39.440 --> 44:42.400]  to do the heimlich you might know do the do the heimlich and they were like nine one line nine
[44:42.400 --> 44:49.520]  my mind and so i said that's it i'm going in and i grabbed her and almost had to pick her out probably
[44:49.520 --> 44:55.760]  weighed 250 pounds just to get the big ball of uh bread out of her mouth coughed it up vomited some
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.240]  they were all looking at me weird thank you you're a hero but also i could felt one of her ribs
[45:00.240 --> 45:04.320]  kind of move probably cracked a rib i knew i would get sued so i just said let's get out of here now
[45:04.320 --> 45:10.320]  we hardly even finished our dinner it just been done we left i that's a normal behavior you see
[45:10.320 --> 45:14.560]  the famous case in toronto a few years ago where one was raped in a nice part of town and watched
[45:14.560 --> 45:19.360]  out of a ten story building by everybody enjoying the entertainment and she later died at the
[45:19.360 --> 45:25.200]  hospital no one called the police for hours you see this more and more and this is an example
[45:25.200 --> 45:29.680]  they don't care reactors are leaking people don't care of du kills the troops when they use it wouldn't
[45:29.680 --> 45:35.200]  let them use it until 20 something years ago uh there's a culture of not caring and it's seeping
[45:35.200 --> 45:40.160]  into everything don't fix the railways so railroads are falling apart and trains are flying off the
[45:40.160 --> 45:46.480]  tracks don't upgrade the infrastructure it's a nihilistic attitude of arrogance not just in
[45:46.480 --> 45:52.240]  government but in the general population and it'll lead to world war three it'll lead to bio
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.520]  plagues it will lead to hell being released because people lose their common sense now john
[45:57.520 --> 46:02.960]  bound was driving yesterday and caught this car on fire and saw the woman stand a couple feet away
[46:02.960 --> 46:07.440]  from it by the time he got there yelling at her she was walking towards him but she was standing
[46:07.440 --> 46:14.080]  feet from where it later blew up and and and blew pieces of the car up to 10 feet away the videos
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.080]  up on info wars dot com but for radio listeners here's the audio of it then we're going to go to
[46:18.080 --> 46:24.080]  break and come back and talk to john bound but here is his report shot on the street hey john
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.160]  bound here report for info wars dot com i just want to show you what my commute looked like this
[46:28.160 --> 46:35.200]  morning as i was heading to work i saw a woman standing this close to the burning car now you
[46:35.200 --> 46:45.120]  can see this is where the remnants of the fire are you got burn up car right here it's all burnt
[46:45.120 --> 46:53.200]  right here and of course we're most of the hose that caught fire and caught the rest of her engine
[46:53.200 --> 46:59.360]  on fire it was completely engulfed in flames by the time i left but she stood this close to a burning
[46:59.360 --> 47:07.360]  car talking on her cell phone of the fire department as i drove by i realized that lady was in a lot of
[47:07.360 --> 47:16.080]  danger so i stopped up there at that stop light turned around came back down and proceeded to
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.160]  tell that woman to move away from her car because she couldn't figure it out for herself
[47:20.160 --> 47:30.800]  ma'am ma'am young lady hey you need to get away from that car you need to get away from that car
[47:32.080 --> 47:39.120]  get very far away from that car that that car is on fire there's fire underneath that car
[47:39.920 --> 47:41.280]  so get away from the car
[47:41.280 --> 47:52.240]  that's after he yells at her for a couple minutes yeah the fire department needs to show up right
[47:52.240 --> 47:58.720]  now and start spraying that down you need to get the hell away from that car all right good please
[47:58.720 --> 48:06.480]  keep a safe distance meanwhile traffic was coming this close to the burning car no one was getting
[48:06.480 --> 48:12.160]  in the other lane as you can see from the video and no one seemed to care about the woman who was
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.240]  in mortal danger wow it blows up right there and the cars are driving by
[48:18.240 --> 48:23.200]  noxious fumes and smoke what idiot she stood there long enough she would have had to go to
[48:23.200 --> 48:26.880]  the hospital let me tell you there's ever a big disaster it's over it just goes to show
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.600]  that people really are asleep there's a mass paralysis you see a car on fire with a woman
[48:33.600 --> 48:41.440]  standing next to it why don't you stop and help because you're just as capable as a government
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.880]  official believe it or not all right now again i've seen the studies i've read the history books i
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.080]  remember as a child people would have instantly pulled off to the side of the road people would
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.480]  have turned across the highway over to the other side of the highway because it's open grass there
[48:56.480 --> 49:01.600]  i guarantee when i was a kid my dad would have stopped his car a hundred yards back and stopped
[49:01.600 --> 49:05.360]  the highway or something i mean when you've got a burning car obviously about to blow up
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.440]  that's what the police are going to do it's common sense but of course my dad knows how to
[49:10.480 --> 49:17.600]  skin a buck i run a trot line fix a combine uh drive a tractor uh you know back when i was a kid
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.920]  you know he and my dad you had a steer wrestle the whole nine yards remember a little kid and
[49:23.920 --> 49:27.440]  they'd be rounding the cows up we'd go back and visit the farm and remember my dad going and grabbing
[49:27.440 --> 49:31.520]  the you know thousand pound cows by the horns and throwing them down to the ground my dad's a little
[49:31.520 --> 49:39.040]  guy i think of the average person today they don't know how to tie their shoelaces and john
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.240]  bennon it's amazing to me that maybe 20 of the commenters on youtube and the votes think you
[49:44.240 --> 49:51.120]  were wrong to park and go and tell her get away from it literally standing two feet from it and
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.440]  then she starts walking towards you and you start filming it and then it later blows up as cars
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.880]  are driving right by it i mean something's happening and the statistics show it you show articles
[50:00.880 --> 50:05.440]  which shows iqs are dropping from all the smartphone and tv viewing people think everything is like a
[50:05.440 --> 50:10.880]  television show they don't get it and remember in austin the cop that got run over during rush hour
[50:10.880 --> 50:18.480]  traffic at a four-way stop what was it down at um it was down at um oh what's oh william can in years
[50:18.480 --> 50:22.880]  ago i mean it was like 45 minutes they drove by the cop bleeding to death in the road just drove
[50:22.880 --> 50:28.320]  around him i mean these people are literally idiots and the globalists have helped do this with
[50:28.320 --> 50:33.360]  the television and the culture and now want us dumb down more as if the public needed any help
[50:33.360 --> 50:37.920]  acting like cattle and then these cattle are going to vote to take my guns make me take all their
[50:37.920 --> 50:43.360]  deadly vaccines drink their fluoride they don't have a right to be so stupid john bennon uh what is
[50:43.360 --> 50:50.240]  your take on this in the larger context you're the bad guy right i'm the bad guy we're the bad people
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.440]  now maybe i was a little bit harsh to that lady but i was in the moment i was genuinely well she
[50:55.440 --> 50:59.360]  wasn't listening genuinely concerned i mean i saw the raw tape it went on for two minutes you
[50:59.360 --> 51:03.760]  say and get away well i was talking to her like maybe i talked to my daughter it's like get away
[51:03.760 --> 51:07.760]  from the burning car that's your four-year-old daughter yeah yeah i mean that's basically how
[51:07.760 --> 51:13.520]  i felt i mean and the other side of that is if my wife or my daughter were in that situation i
[51:13.520 --> 51:18.880]  hoped that god somebody would help them you know if there's if my daughter was standing next to a
[51:18.880 --> 51:25.840]  burning car i would hope somebody would run but as i turned around as i drove by i thought i saw her
[51:25.840 --> 51:31.920]  car was smoking okay you know well she's gonna have to get a tow truck and then i as i drove by i saw
[51:31.920 --> 51:37.600]  fire dripping onto the ground underneath it and that's not good so i pulled up to the stop light
[51:37.600 --> 51:43.920]  and i kept looking back and i noticed more fire pouring more fire pouring and as the fire poured
[51:43.920 --> 51:51.040]  i saw the smoke rising and then i turned around and as i came around there was a truck
[51:51.760 --> 51:56.560]  parked across the road directly from her a red truck parked directly across the road
[51:57.040 --> 52:02.240]  and the guy was just sitting in in his truck he's just sitting in his truck staring at this woman
[52:02.800 --> 52:12.000]  who's uh you know clearly making a poor decision clearly making a poor decision in front of god
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.760]  and but the issue is just 10 years ago i i know austinites people would stop they'd be helping
[52:17.760 --> 52:22.560]  or they'd see it back i mean i was in south texas and saw a guy run a red light and run into two
[52:22.560 --> 52:27.760]  old ladies and i was four cars back all three cars ahead of me pulled over to helper i still pulled
[52:27.760 --> 52:33.360]  over to help him as well and to wait till the police got there as witnesses uh a lot of those
[52:33.360 --> 52:39.120]  comments were john you know it uh you're up on your high horse who do you see you arrogant whatever
[52:39.120 --> 52:44.480]  you know how dare you help them but i you know i listen i saw it when the woman was choking
[52:44.480 --> 52:49.280]  yeah no one was gonna help her i had to push men aside who were trying to stop me from doing it
[52:49.280 --> 52:55.840]  because i wasn't wearing a uniform well sorry i took uh first aid i took how to resuscitate people
[52:55.840 --> 53:02.000]  i took that three years in a row when i was in a swim team uh i mean i was a swim team before
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.960]  that but when i was like 13 14 15 i mean i took it from fire departments i was certified in it
[53:06.960 --> 53:11.360]  i know how to do it i save that woman's life i'm not bad well you talk about your dad and you talk
[53:11.360 --> 53:18.080]  about that that mentality that used to be here and i hope it comes back because it is withering on
[53:18.080 --> 53:25.280]  the vine but my grandparents put people up during the depression who were down on their luck in in
[53:25.280 --> 53:30.960]  our basement took care of them until they got back on their feet back in kentucky that's what you do
[53:30.960 --> 53:35.040]  you take the shirt off your back and you take care of because when when it really hits the fan
[53:35.040 --> 53:39.920]  and everybody's gonna it's gonna be everybody for themselves and it's gonna have this mentality
[53:39.920 --> 53:44.480]  where everyone's gonna have this mentality where it's i'm gonna take my shotgun and i'm just gonna
[53:44.480 --> 53:49.520]  go get what i want what i need well the people that are gonna be able to band together are gonna
[53:49.520 --> 53:54.000]  be the ones that are gonna be able to uh take that exactly and the sheep will think banding together
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.040]  or seeing a woman standing by burning car that later blew up yeah if the footage blows up the
[53:59.040 --> 54:03.760]  fire shoots out like five feet from both sides in the top and there's cars a foot away they don't
[54:03.760 --> 54:08.960]  even get in the other lane the other lane and then my instinct was exactly what you said i i wanted
[54:08.960 --> 54:14.320]  to just turn around pull into the meeting and get in the middle of the road and and help the people
[54:14.880 --> 54:19.680]  not just this lady who's standing next to her car but the people in their cars because yeah there
[54:19.680 --> 54:26.800]  is a possibility that that car may explode it did explode well and and could shoot debris maybe
[54:26.800 --> 54:32.640]  into a kid or into a woman you know going to her job that day or whatever i i just want the point
[54:32.640 --> 54:36.480]  is that happens all the time with these car fires and people start wrecking instinct where's the
[54:36.480 --> 54:42.640]  instinct of people to to do that and then when they see somebody do that they go after my character
[54:43.280 --> 54:48.080]  they go after your and again we're not complaining that the sheep will attack us it shows have you
[54:48.080 --> 54:55.360]  ever gone to the ocean and and done crab fishing yeah i mean all you do is you throw in a string
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.920]  with bacon on it they're so greedy let me start eating you drag them in stone crabs i don't care
[54:59.920 --> 55:04.560]  what they are regular crabs and then you throw a bunch in a bucket they could pile up together
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.640]  and and help climb out but what happens to the one crab that tries to get out they don't attack
[55:08.640 --> 55:12.960]  each other till one crab tries to get out then they all come over and grabbing and pulling back
[55:12.960 --> 55:18.480]  down that's right yeah and that's what it is that's what it is that's the mentality and and it's
[55:18.480 --> 55:25.520]  and it's it's it's born in fear it's born in this disassociation with everybody else's uh the
[55:25.520 --> 55:33.840]  empathy of this planet if they can hold on to their disassociation from everything and clutch
[55:33.840 --> 55:38.720]  on to it to the bitter end they can go play their video games go into their their own little world
[55:38.720 --> 55:45.840]  as long as they can and defend that then they actually believe that they're they have some kind
[55:45.840 --> 55:51.360]  of truth weighing behind them well exactly and and and and that this has happened in history
[55:51.360 --> 55:56.160]  but it's mass Stockholm syndrome for those that don't know i've coined that term mass Stockholm
[55:56.160 --> 56:03.440]  syndrome because over the years and of course this has been seen in history before but the last
[56:03.440 --> 56:07.280]  40 years they've had the term Stockholm syndrome where people that are held by kidnappers even
[56:07.280 --> 56:12.720]  abuse rape you name it they start defending the kidnappers because it's so scary to admit the
[56:12.720 --> 56:18.160]  bad person has you they will delusion only like a prostitute under a pimp that puts cigarettes out
[56:18.160 --> 56:23.520]  on her we'll start defending him from even the the families of the prostitutes that come and
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.800]  try to get the women out of the bad situation they're in this is how the mindset works and so
[56:28.800 --> 56:33.200]  those of us that don't want the NSA spying on us for political reasons we're the bad guys because
[56:33.200 --> 56:36.640]  we're the ones exposing it those of us that are right about the preparations for war against the
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.680]  american people we're the bad guys because we're pointing out it's happening and the public they
[56:41.680 --> 56:47.920]  want to in a cowardly way subconsciously accept it and say it doesn't exist or embrace it and
[56:47.920 --> 56:52.560]  so doesn't matter of the radiation levels or hundreds of times safe levels in and around Japan
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.920]  and coming across the water towards the US just say it's fine they told the msnbc host lie and say
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.480]  it's good for you you know lie and say it's not a problem that's now come out sinks gone public
[57:02.480 --> 57:07.600]  about that that's what it is it's like don't say it's bad to teach first graders how to have anal
[57:07.600 --> 57:13.040]  sex in california that's good it's fathers that are bad it's families that are bad you're like
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.320]  wait this is crazy this is unhealthy this is dangerous no no you shut up you shut up you're
[57:18.320 --> 57:22.880]  the one saying there's a problem you're the one causing the problem we're going to kill the messenger
[57:22.880 --> 57:28.160]  and it shows a delusional behavior in the elite themselves now and the type of brinksmanship and
[57:28.160 --> 57:34.880]  arrogance and irrational exuberance and confidence that is going to lead towards war famine societal
[57:34.880 --> 57:39.200]  collapse john bound final comment yeah i'm just amazed with the unyielding conditioning that we're
[57:39.200 --> 57:45.280]  all under that we haven't even got to a huge war at this point we've got china and we have russia
[57:45.280 --> 57:50.000]  and we've got these olympics coming up with the false flags that are going to ensue and everyone's
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.360]  going to sit at home and they're going to you're going to watch your big hd television meanwhile
[57:55.360 --> 58:01.040]  there are false flags being planned by the saudi arabians and we're all being conditioned to allow
[58:01.040 --> 58:05.600]  that to happen and then they'll even take our rights away when the cias involved and the russians
[58:05.600 --> 58:09.200]  are starting to threaten to nuke europe i mean what are they going to do they start nukin as a nuclear
[58:09.200 --> 58:13.600]  war starts what's going to happen to your hd television then and all we are is some guy by
[58:13.600 --> 58:17.680]  the side of the road saying get away from that burning car that's all we are that's who we are

[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.840]  to breed this into us on record they admit this and that's really the ultimate sin in my world
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:39.280]  in my world view i don't know if it is in your world view that taking people's individualism
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:45.840]  taking their dynamic human spirit their instincts away and turning them into spectating biological
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.080]  androids that are trendies there to just be programmed with the latest trend the latest
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:58.480]  download that is really the end of the soul and that's the issue i want to discuss uh for some

[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:08.000]  story on info wars dot com prison planet dot com it's also linked on the mighty drudge report
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.160]  dot com in the middle of the top column u.s government orders 14 million dosages of potassium

[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.000]  drudge has changed the headline something even more powerful it's nuke fear feds order 14 million
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.560]  dosages of potassium iodides we're going to be discussing that there's a bunch of other
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:40.080]  obama care news government promoting pedophilia news huge ns a news where they in uh new snowden
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.400]  documents new nsa documents the powerpoint you know those screens they described their own
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.080]  menus how things work they call the public dumb zombies that don't know they're in 1984 just like
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.760]  zuckerberg calls you dumb efforts and uh this is their attitude and and i mean they'll tell you
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.880]  oh you're so smart i love you aren't death panels good and talk to you in an npr voice
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.440]  like you're five years old i will talk to you like adults i'm talking to new listeners
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.880]  and you tune in man that's wacky that guy's far out no reality's far out
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.440]  and i could unequivocally say this this this radio show with human intelligence
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.240]  because we all see through rose color glasses as the bible says is as close to reality as you're
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.720]  going to get i can really say that it's no brag just fact and that's a really scary thing that
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.400]  when i have all these other constitutional lawyers on and experts and nsa people and journalists and
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:42.560]  i i'm so immersed in this for 20 years 18 years on air since 1995 i'm so immersed in all the
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.640]  different angles of it that i almost always know more than my guest does about any subject they're
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.840]  on they can usually augment give me more they know more than i do in some areas but that's a scary
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.480]  thought that a guy that went to community college for two years and the reason i got out of it was
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.040]  about to go to ut was i could tell it wasn't an education it was an indoctrination the rtf stuff
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.000]  i was learning was like 10 year old garbage i could see where the media was going in the future
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.840]  and i didn't even think of myself in an arrogant way is super smart i know there's super smart
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.960]  people out there that if they get into this knowledge and get into this information and outside
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.160]  the box studying how civilization really works from the globalist white papers not how they
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:33.840]  say it works in the education level bs they put out that there are people out there literally who
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:41.280]  are a lot smarter than i am on so many fronts better orators better looking smarter everything
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.560]  you could save us with god's help but you've got to believe in yourselves to be leaders but i now
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.200]  realize that it's it's not a power trip it's it's very humbling that all my background being a fighter
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.960]  being aggressive not liking undue authority all of it that i've got an incredible responsibility
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:04.480]  and i was born to fight tyranny in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple

[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:22.800]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:29.360]  the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15

[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:24.400]  he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:34.720]  i was just back in the kitchen here at the infowars.com studios and dick chaney was on fox news
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:42.800]  and he said out of his mouth i believe it was live said live he just said minutes ago i'm talking
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.400]  five minutes ago three minutes ago he just said Mohammed Karzai was a guy that was there when we
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:54.160]  needed him and i will not say that he's corrupt and basically he's a good guy ladies and gentlemen
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.520]  Mohammed Karzai is a known mega narcotics trafficker his brother until he got killed was
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.880]  the number one opium dealer in the world our government is there for 12 years to control the
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.560]  opium supply and to keep a war going for no bid weapons contracts we're not meant to win the war
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.880]  that's why obama swore we'd be gone in 2012 and 2014 now 2017 we're never leaving
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:24.640]  and we did not go there to fight al-qaeda we went there to get control of the opium
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.200]  and to get control of the lithium that's worth trillions not for american companies i want to
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.600]  add that'd be bad enough if we didn't really try to help america this isn't an empire that's
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.160]  based in a country like the old british empire where actually stuff came back to the home country
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:46.960]  to build it up this is and that's bad enough but a lot more moral than literally they're
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.200]  they're extracting america they're extracting afghanistan look at how they're funding al-qaeda
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:58.480]  in libya uh in syria in egypt you name it because Saudi arabia is in the middle of this
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:05.120]  and they've been chosen by british intelligence since 1903 on record to take over that entire
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:13.520]  region and they've basically done it and then we put our so-called enemies in charge once they get
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.320]  in control because the government control media thinks you're so dumb because the general public
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.400]  are zombies we showed statistics earlier uh from cnn fox news reporting on it that failure to render
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.040]  aid is exploding all over the western world you see somebody hit by a car on their bicycle
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.800]  a hundred cars will drive by a thousand cars will drive by a cop gets out of his car gets
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:42.880]  hit at a four-way stop for 45 minutes at austin nobody helps him they die uh a woman seen being
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.080]  beat over the head with a lead pipe and raped for hours she's raped for 30 minutes it's a famous case
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.600]  in toronto it covered a few years ago but it happens all the time and then she sat there
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.600]  bleeding in her miniskirt and the and the guy at the telecom corporation on the third floor
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.320]  told all his employees don't call the police and go back to work and laughed at her it came out
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.520]  it was all and they all followed orders i mean if i had a boss at a telecom and he sat there
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.560]  laughing at i mean remember when i see a guy raping a woman i'm gonna go down there beat his butt
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.000]  and it's not because i'm a tough guy i mean that's normal instinct if i was at some place and my
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.560]  boss said don't call the police hey look at her you know look at her naked there and the freezing
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.680]  you know rain the woman later died i would have and i'm sorry i'd punch you in the nose
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.520]  because that's my daughter that's my wife that's my mother that's my grandmother
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.320]  you re put yourself folks we've gotten rid of our common sense and instead though the
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.760]  tattling's at record levels oh my goodness the neighbors saw jimmy and bobby playing with nerf guns
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.160]  call the police the cop shoots one of them or oh my gosh uh you know john was in the backyard
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.880]  with his friend david playing nerf guns and so the school exp suspended him or i see this every
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.120]  couple days in the news all over the country it's always an old man who thinks he's still in america
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.240]  in a quasi rural area where yuppies have moved in and they see him cleaning a gun in their garage
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.440]  workshop every old man has a garage workshop and they call the police and the cops walk around
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.040]  the corner and shoot them that just happened up in fort worth a few weeks ago or uh they take
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.240]  them to jail and say well the neighbors scared of the gun we're going to do a psychological
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:22.160]  evaluation the guy's like what i'm cleaning them their rival that's illegal on my property
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:27.360]  sorry mr johnson or you know mr shavez or whatever your name is we're going to take you to jail now
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.320]  this is the mass mental illness where a woman is choking to death and no one helps her for a
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.480]  minute and a half till i walk out of the bathroom and then they try to stop me from saving her life
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:44.880]  or where you try to warn people on the street corner i mean i've been to national parks i'm gone the
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.520]  u n's taking over this park to restrict access and a buffer zone to local farmers here's the
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:56.880]  executive order people are like shut up conspiracy theorist that was on video how long ago was that
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:08.000]  1997 so we're talking 13 14 15 15 plus years and you could see me at the national park saying

[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.000]  ranches they're shutting down here's the executive orders anybody want to talk about it
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.160]  and people are no i don't want to talk about it but people walk by and go you're like that guy
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:26.000]  in that conspiracy theory movie that had just come out with mel Gibson and laughed at me or the last
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.040]  time i was at the grand canyon and i got video of this i'm around the corner at the visitor center
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:39.680]  no one's around i find the u n plaque that i had visited 15 years before this was just a last year
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.480]  they built a new visitor center a giant one at the grand canyon the place is deserted i go around
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.920]  there and i'm doing a quick video talking about unesco and a guy with an american flag hat and
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:56.800]  veteran stuff navy stuff on walks over with his wife and goes i can't believe the crap this guy's
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.280]  talking about i can't believe an american one us excuse me sir and he goes whatever
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.800]  because he didn't like me pointing out that u n designation put our country under foreign control
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.320]  i was the trader for pointing out u n takeover these people want to live in their pod they
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.040]  want to watch fox news or cnn all day liberal or conservative they want to feel like everything's
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:28.400]  all right everything is not all right i get so upset i forget to breathe everything is not
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.160]  all right ladies and gentlemen everything is not all right and we have to admit there's a problem
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.600]  so john bound sees a burning car with flames under it and a woman standing literally two feet from it
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:45.920]  he parks a couple hundred yards away on a major road 360 runs up to one of our news producers and
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:53.200]  host he runs over says ma'am get away ma'am it takes us several minutes to get away from the car
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:59.280]  we put the video up the car blows up cars are driving right by the car as it later blows up
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.480]  and shoots flame out five direct five feet in all directions before the police get there in the
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:10.400]  fire department who then block the road and cleaned it off i mean just incredible and then people
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:18.960]  complain on the youtube video that we're being busy bodies no i see my neighbor's kid throwing a fit
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.600]  and i see him spank him that's illegal and lawful i don't call the police i see my neighbor putting
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.840]  guns in their car to go shooting i don't call the police i saw something with a gun creeping around
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:34.800]  i'd call the police it's all body language uh if i see somebody not paying their taxes i'm not gonna
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.400]  tattle on if i see somebody uh smoking pot i'm not gonna call the police on them i can't tell you
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.480]  well well we've covered it and had the family on how many people have their little kid taken
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.840]  because they go in to get a medical test done and they find marijuana in daddy's system so they take
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.920]  the two-year-old and a month later the child's dead in the custody of the cps i can't tell you
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.880]  how many people i know or run into who will go to have a baby and who the mama was just at a party
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.840]  and had a low-level thc in her because she got secondhand marijuana smoke or so what if she took
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.160]  a hit of it shows it doesn't do anything to a fetus comparatively the other stuff in the environment
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.240]  and then they come and take their baby no one's warning you no one's telling you about the real
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.200]  danger i am a busy body here to tell you there's government kidnappers i am a busy body telling
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.640]  you that almost everyone i know that owns 50 60 100 acres outside austin haze county travis
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:33.760]  county williamson county californian liberals have moved here everyone i know everyone including
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.640]  myself but i just didn't go out to the gate and answer it when you shoot guns on your own property
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:45.440]  legal and lawfully the neighbors begin screaming in fear and call the police on you i was out in
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.040]  the woods with my kids shooting 410 shotgun last year and i looked over to not even the property
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.640]  next to me that a finger comes down of a 200 acre ranch yet there's only about an acre that comes
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.920]  down by the creek over that about four or five acres away i heard a woman screaming they're
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.440]  shooting they're shooting run finished my shooting went back in later about 30 minutes later saw the
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.160]  sheriff's department driving down by the road looking i mean this is the country we live in
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:19.440]  folks i live in the middle of the countryside and if i fire a firearm on my own property they call
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.920]  the police on me now what i love is all of us and the neighbors have decided to shoot more
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.560]  so they're shooting almost every day there is every weekend and so now the police don't come we
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.400]  exercise our open carry our open use of it so the californians learn and i'm sorry it's always
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.840]  californians californians are colonizing central texas and there's a lot of great californians you
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.480]  know there's some that are patriots but the big wave that have ruined california are now coming
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:50.640]  here so i want to talk about those zombies the face time the the screen time the lowering of the
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.760]  icu all the studies all the statistics people losing touch with reality people not rendering aid
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.680]  how bad is it going to get in a narcissistic mass Stockholm syndrome collapse because i'm already
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.000]  seeing society collapse they're not fixing vehicles they're not fixing highways they're not fixing
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.800]  railways they're all falling apart worse in the world now education's imploding icu is
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:18.000]  imploding health's imploding we are a cursed nation how do you get someone out of the smartphones
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.480]  and out of the computers and out of watching 10 hours of television and video games a day
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:29.600]  i use them but literally only for communication only to shoot videos and upload them on the spot
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.720]  and then i turn it off and put it in a faraday cage a little bag a little lead bag and people laugh
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.400]  at that just like they laughed 10 years ago when they come to my house i'd have a sticker
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.480]  over the camera and i said the fbi activates that they use it in federal court it was all admitted
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:48.240]  then but the media wouldn't touch it now people don't laugh about me sticking phones in a faraday
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.320]  cage when i'm not using them now people don't laugh when they come over everybody's sticking
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.240]  the stickers on there and deactivating the microphone problem is they turn it on anyways
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.840]  i told you they use um on start to listen to you of course they do without warrants that's all
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.280]  been declassified or leaked or i know what i'm talking about is the point and i'm not on a

[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.200]  listing on wbcr 14 70 a.m and what do you say about the zombie state uh what are you seeing in your
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.360]  area uh sir it's it's downright scary here uh you never thought this would happen in the bible
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:47.360]  belt and what's what's really got me is a lot of people are into this obama care website it tells
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.080]  you right on the website that the information will be shared but here's something sir you may have
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.400]  may have not thought about uh you can get exempt through a christian health care sharing ministry
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.680]  you know uh david night is part of that he says it works great uh and and that's the power of the
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.800]  religious exemption uh because congress shall make no law respecting the establishment religion
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.840]  privilege for exercise thereof so that's the great quote waiver out of vaccines everything and yes
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.320]  he did a special report on that a few months ago but tell folks about it well sir but that's
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:24.160]  that's not really what scared me what's scaring me is yes that's the great alternative but the
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.680]  government's going to have record of all the christians that they have opted out of it
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.000]  and i was just wondering they're not going to use that as a database uh that when it times
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.640]  this starts coming for the guillotine i totally agree with you but we're way past that brother
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.920]  they have spot on everything i mean they they know everybody's deepest darkest secrets they've got
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:51.680]  algorithms and they've got psychological databases it's we're already all on the list
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.880]  and we've got to go public that's the answer people always say aren't you paranoid they're
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.720]  going to come get you know i'm the opposite of paranoid i'm paranoid they're going to win
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.720]  and that we're not going to warn as many people as we can because look when this system finally
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.160]  goes into place and that's a foregone conclusion the beast system is going to happen imagine all
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.200]  the work we've done to wake people up that's what the bible says they'll be the greatest awakening
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.640]  and coming to god that world's ever seen because when everybody remembers what we said we're going
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.440]  to fall to evil the beast will wage war against the saints and overcome them but that's only round
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.800]  one brother and i'm in this for the long haul i mean i absolutely know that it's all being
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.920]  fulfilled and we don't know if it's in this year or 20 years from now or a hundred uh the eye has
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.040]  not seen the ear has not heard what's going to happen but the point is is that i'm fully committed
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:46.800]  to this because we're worried about people's souls and look at what the new world order does it
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.160]  literally steals the intellect it steals the spark of humanity these people have dead eyes
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.680]  these zombies they have been they have been literally suck dry we're fighting spiritual
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:02.240]  body snatchers we're in a science fiction movie it's all around us god bless you i appreciate

[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.880]  uh dealing with that obviously with your apple iphone crap and all this other stuff you got to
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.720]  deal with uh to stand down or stare down generations so to speak that's what i call it but it's more
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:29.680]  and more prevalent um uh something that sparked my interest the other day that uh it really got
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.320]  me into this is like this arm of vacation is uh your uh your news article that you did just the
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.240]  other day even if you could put that on screen for your viewers about what just happened here in
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:44.000]  connecticut um i work literally next to where that news report came from and it was interesting going
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.120]  down talking to viewers and also talking to the people standing in line i actually got to do that
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.560]  on my lunch break and uh it's just very very intriguing because the number one question that
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.720]  came up that day about like even the zombie case and so to speak of the mindset is everyone in that
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:09.200]  line is still questioning sandy hook and now it's being talked about on all the news uh local news
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.680]  affiliates here in the state by the way that would have been a mega viral video as a citizen

[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.800]  good out of the devil that way is that you'd have gone over and videotaped you talking to the folks
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.680]  lined up to turn their guns in just hundreds and hundreds of them lined up to register them to then

[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:05.760]  for those that don't know we can probably pull up some of the video of the media approvingly oh look
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:11.200]  at folks in connecticut just like in england just like in australia lining up to register their
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.960]  legally owned firearms and then of course you know what the next step is they always ban them
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:23.200]  new york state is now using gun registration from years past like new york did in the 50s
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:30.080]  to now order the guns handed back in and the goal of the brady center and all of them is
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:37.600]  victim disarmament so people lined up like good slaves to register their firearms and we were
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.680]  talking to the caller which i wish he to shot video with us and he said he was talking to the
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:47.120]  crowds and they were questioning sandy hook well they bulldozed the building and there won't allow
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:50.960]  any of it released probably so they can produce fake video and audio which is very easy to do
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.280]  and they can show godzilla attacking any building may want to show kennedy saying things he never
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:00.400]  said or john wane pitching products you know 20 something years after he's dead uh hardly john
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.520]  wane's been dead so like what 1980 1981 i forget when he died but that's that's longer than that's
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.320]  like 30 years it's weird to get old but we are taking your calls right now about the public and
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:16.080]  the zombie like trance that they're getting deeper and deeper into uh cori quantify what you were
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.240]  saying you were talking to the folks at your lunch break because you're at the building right next
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:27.440]  to where this was happening uh and describe what you saw pretty much the uh the line that the news
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.200]  local news agency hadn't shot was uh the many multiplicities of the gun owners uh coming in
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.960]  and it's amazing because now and now if you really think about it all their faces are now on camera
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.360]  for the public to see that oh these are the people that are going to go turn their guns in but
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:48.800]  that's just another side story no no the on the feds admit that's why they pay for voluntary
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.360]  dna checkpoints now they're making a mandatory just to get the cops trained every people that
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.240]  we've done this before that's how it always works the gun buyback programs are to create the idea
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:04.080]  that guns are bad and the image of you turning them into police it's total pavlovian conditioning
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:09.920]  go ahead no if we're going along with that um of all the things that stemmed out of this obviously
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.360]  the law was created because of a certain circumstance here and that was sandy hook and i i'm not one to
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.360]  be one of those people that want to go out and write blogs about the craziness that's going out
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:25.120]  with that school but i'm a man of following the money and at my position i'm able to do so because
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:30.800]  i speak with police officers not only in that area but even state police uh after they uh release
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.400]  that sandy hook report but the number one thing on the airwaves up here in the past few days since
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.640]  that report has been released that neither divi tic uh 1080 news which is one of the big affiliates
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:48.080]  here up in connecticut in ringland uh they will not touch on this one topic because of the police
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:56.880]  support and digging further into this um following the money the the donations i i had been going
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.520]  through youtube checking on news clips and stuff because it's it's affecting me personally as long
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.760]  with friends and they want answers people in connecticut want answers because this was created
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.560]  well we know there were there were multiple people in camo and black pants the same outfit
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:17.040]  uh that was seen later caught on helicopter then the media denied those arrests had been made
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.960]  and then later said well it's restricted access but it was anti-terror units from nearby counties
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:28.320]  i mean man and then i'm not saying people didn't really die folks but they definitely had actors
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:35.760]  rolling out with bs i mean it's it's it's we don't know really what happened but the official story
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:42.320]  is not true yes and that that's leading into my next point i'm i'm i'm gonna pay attention to the
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:48.800]  facts on that on that but the thing that that most people do not know is uh two weeks after the
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:55.760]  incident i had uh i created a post regarding g e uh if you guys remember the the report on adam
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.760]  land so with the dna test of the evil gene but i didn't really understand what g e was all about
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.320]  at the time and then i started digging in more to the people within the town and the local communities
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.160]  and a danbury officer who just recently retired in the past two weeks who was a canine officer
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:18.160]  brought me up on something dealing with the police report uh dealing with jurisdiction that no one
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:23.520]  in the country is challenging as to why this connecticut state police wrote this report
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:29.120]  and it's now starting to become more massive in the public here because quantify for those
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.680]  that don't know what the report is because people always call in thinking everyone knows what you're
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.320]  talking about i'm sorry the state police uh here in connecticut released the sandy hook report a few
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:47.120]  days ago regarding the audio visual pictures and the so much thousands of pages of documents which
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:52.240]  was obviously put there in place after reviewing them for about eight hours straight and multiple
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:58.000]  people have done that um okay get to the meat state police i'm sorry about that uh basically
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.880]  they're leaving out uh evidence regarding um a man named john trying to conflict trying to cost i
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:10.400]  believe his name i for all the video reports um they're not telling you that all this sandy hook
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.680]  money is being funneled through the federal reserve because i just recently found out
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.720]  that the neighbor of adam lanza to where all the police were actually being located that morning
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.200]  nobody paid attention to the video reports from the helicopters but all the police were at the next
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.520]  store neighbor's house which is uh well listen well listen what you should do is you should do
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.760]  another report on this so that people can actually follow the links you're talking about an investigator
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:39.360]  i appreciate your call look we know aurora was a stage mind control operation i'm not going to
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:46.080]  spend an hour going into that we've done it look it up it was run by the pentagon in a government
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:52.160]  mind control program he was in a super advanced classified DARPA brain interface program with
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:58.720]  the air force he was handled by a top air force psychiatrist who formally commanded a major base
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.640]  in san antonio and was not taking patients previously who had all of the notebooks and things
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.920]  he said i was under mind control he told people in the jail that they confirmed it later they
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.000]  tried to say he wasn't next to cells turned out he was i mean i'm not going to go into the whole
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.360]  deal multiple shooters smoke grenades before uh you get somebody drugged up who wouldn't even
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:25.520]  do in the shooting you you do the shooting then you the person on drugs doesn't remember i mean
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.960]  that's one way to do it and that's what happened there so if they would do that there and we're
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.360]  able to prove that that was a staged event boston bombing i don't want to take an hour doing this
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.520]  it's the same deal there as well if you're a new listener just go look at our boston
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.360]  bombing coverage from a year ago or less than a year ago and you're going to see all sorts of
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.160]  stuff like this in the new year as well but there's one of the headlines colorado shooter was under
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:58.400]  psychiatric care of x us air force doctor that's london independent and then it just goes through
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:05.680]  it all ladies and gentlemen his dad was in high level black ops developing the top level algorithms
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.120]  for so much of the stuff going on the stock market uh he was uh under
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:18.960]  a DARPA program in brain interface that's just like theodore kasinski the unabomber
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:30.400]  was in the mk ultra program for 10 years that was declassified after he was um arrested but only
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:37.040]  the la times reported on it uh the alexa shooter uh patsy from the navel yard said he was under
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:44.560]  mind control and he had a top security clearance he had a secret clearance on a top secrets clearance
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:50.720]  he was in a top secret area an area holding top secret uh compartments put to you that way and
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.320]  he kept calling the police saying they're in my mind they're mind controlling me folks you do that
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.000]  repeatedly and call the police and you're going to lose your security clearance but he's able to go
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.560]  in and do all this i mean i could just go on for hours they're running patsy operations
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:09.680]  it turns out uh tamerlin zharnev told friends and family it's coming out in court he was in the
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.080]  cia and under mind control and it's not like he was some schizophrenic the fbi lied and said
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.640]  they didn't know who he was and for two days who was this on the news so they start desperately
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.720]  calling the fbi saying what are you doing we're part of an operation with you and and and the
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.520]  older brother had been sent to chechnya in operations with the cia and it had his cover
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.840]  blown two years before the boss and bombing by the russian intelligence services and that's
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.800]  mainstream news it's not like he says he was under mind control and then there's no proof
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:43.440]  this is literal born supremacy type stuff every stinkin one of them and yes sandy hook
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.400]  was a real school with real kids but you had to have actors there with cutout families who
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.800]  weren't assigned to the school who could then come out and put out the pr because man you watch it
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.280]  i've seen anerson cooper who's cia on record again you don't believe me just search it his
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:05.520]  nose disappearing in green screen i've seen it over and over again not video break up folks not
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.600]  no green screen we have green screen too i've worked with it for 18 years
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.280]  you see my access television show the green screen behind me i mean i know what green screen looks
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:22.480]  like they weren't in downtown um you know that area sandy hook they weren't they were doing fake stuff
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.320]  i saw shots where there's green screen and it's looping where the paper's blowing
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.400]  and then it blows again the same way it's like oh my gosh they think we're so dumb
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.000]  i don't know what they did at sandy hook i know what they did with boston bombing
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.400]  i know what they did um and this is freaking me out i i wish this wasn't real
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.360]  i wish this wasn't true ladies and gentlemen it makes me physically sick
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.800]  when a caller starts bringing this stuff up and i just i almost don't want to know anymore i mean
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.920]  i know what people are talking about it is so incredibly frustrating by the way i'm not just
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:06.960]  saying anderson cooper cia he admits he is and i mean the bad people at the cia and i don't know
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.640]  exactly what they pulled there but it's bad with all their democratic party operatives clearly out
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.160]  there reading scripts clearly out there doing these pieces some of them start breaking down laughing
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:24.000]  what they did is they had a drill they had some people involved i believe they killed some real
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.680]  people because they always enjoy that but then there was some other setup stuff just like on 9
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.480]  11 they had script readers suddenly all over the news within 15 minutes saying the same message
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:40.240]  former cia director's name and then on the ground guys in ballcaps clearly reading lines
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.080]  clearly professional going well the plane's just slammed in and the jet fuel went in causing a
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.440]  pen caking effect and then the towers came down thank you and then they'd cut to the next person
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:54.560]  and they weren't interviewing a bunch of people they would just cut to we have one guy on the
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:59.280]  street who thinks he knows what happened and you know after they started collapsing within 15 minutes
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.760]  of that and i was sitting there watching it and it's just you know something when it's fake
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.160]  i mean it's it's it's simple especially when you work in media ladies and gentlemen
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:19.600]  it is it is it is really really really really interesting and it needs to be
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:25.040]  investigated yeah go ahead and show that video go ahead i mean i'm this this is a sad father
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.600]  who's sad here though i'm not saying it's staged he's laughing he's smiling and then he walks up
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.080]  and then starts crying and then we saw a whole bunch of other parents do the exact same thing
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:40.080]  and of course you know i took acting classes i've been in some big movies
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.680]  you see people get into method acting and get into the zone and you know exactly what i've seen
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:49.760]  actors do exactly what this father did where they start huffing and puffing to to cry but i think
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.840]  this was real don't you i think when glenn beckwood crowned tv it was real too yeah no i'm not talking
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:02.000]  about that guy i'm not saying that's fake like people said oh no okay i'm going to go to your
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.240]  phone calls talking about the zombie osis of the general population
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:16.640]  but i want to play this report from a year ago the premiere of rex jones he's now 11 years old
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.960]  and when folks watch this video terrorism 101 by rex jones he literally came up with this
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.360]  himself listen to the show he's smarter than most adults i know he speaks for the british accent in
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.440]  it not because he's british as the conspiracy now is because his mother didn't want his face on tv yet
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:39.200]  so we wore a guy fox mask you know like guy fox telling you about this terror being staged
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.080]  in that movie vieja vendetta and so that's why he's wearing the guy fox mask and speaks for the
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:50.000]  british accent for the for the people that can't seem to figure that out out there but here is his
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.880]  report now that we have the globalist activating stage terror attacks through the saudi arabians
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:00.880]  all over uh southern russia did he stabilize the olympics as promised his payment back to uh
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:06.560]  uh putin for daring to not let them put al-qaeda in charge of syria and murder all the christians
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:13.440]  now his payback they're doing this here is uh his report terrorism 101 hello your friendly
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:17.600]  neighborhood patriot here for an episode of how terrorism really works
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:36.960]  first off our terrorist group needs a scary name can you say lc iada let's try again lc iada
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:44.720]  ah it does rule off the tongue lc iada it's a perfect name now let's say the green piece here
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:51.120]  represents the terrorists the terrorists then move into pakistan or afghanistan or whatever
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:59.520]  stan is not under the banker control the media then joins in to hype up the terror threat dry hand
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:10.400]  operates with impunity from safe havens inside fascist empire once the terror threat is established
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.000]  the banksters puppets send in the troops to take out the terrorists they put in there in the first
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.080]  place then the bankers install their own dictator to take control of the resources and oppress the
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:30.400]  people as a bonus the banks via the black ops and intelligence agencies will then ship the drugs
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:36.000]  back into the host country so they can imprison their own citizens for using the drugs make huge
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.160]  profits selling the drugs which finance other terror operations around the globe and the carry
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:48.560]  on the top is billions upon billions made on money laundering operations for the bankers
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:54.400]  in a sense uh you're watching as uh this opium is being grown i know it it grinds at your gut uh
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.960]  how do you deal with it what are you doing about it well uh frankly this is a part of their culture
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:05.200]  so uh while it might grind in my gut it's what they do and if the citizens of the host country
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.760]  gets wise to these schemes or gets uppity the banks via media will hype a nuclear terror threat
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:18.080]  or an underwear bomber or a christmas tree bomber any excuse to take the american people's rights
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:26.400]  well that just about wraps it up for terrorism 101 how terrorism really works i'm your friendly
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.880]  neighborhood patriot and now remember what big brother and other authoritarian say whatever you
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:44.240]  do don't visit infos.com oh no the control freaks don't like it all right good job my son my apprentice
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.120]  now continuing ladies and gentlemen we can laugh about it but that's what's really going on
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:56.240]  they staged the boston bombing they staged aurora sandy hook has every trapping of being staged they
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.320]  bare minimum staged a bunch of stuff after as a pr push to get our guns we know that
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:05.600]  and bloomberg kind of jumped the gun too and she put orders out the day before preparing
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:12.720]  offensive against guns with their social networks so i mean people fall start in in swimming and
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:17.200]  running and in the nfl you know you'll get a fall start i mean it's understandable you guys
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.600]  announced that the world trade center seven had fallen an hour before it didn't 25 minutes before
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.000]  it did exactly as it did then completely collapse and it turned out it was a roiders talking point
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.800]  loaded by the cia into the bbc data banks as we predicted we could look at it until where it came
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:34.560]  from so you know jumping the guns kind of like they published at kennedy been killed by lee harvey
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:41.120]  oswald uh in the eastern press two hours before he was even uh his name was released you know you
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.800]  guys kind of screw up a little bit sometimes and then he gets you already has a new key report up

[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:18.080]  that i'm seeing around here but first off sir i really resent what you've done sad when you said
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:25.920]  that uh the criminal elements within sad the u.s government would attack american people
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:33.920]  the staging event opposes a savior sir like that's just outrageous they'd never do that even though
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:39.200]  they've been caught over and over again well if they ever did it it was back in history sir and
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:44.800]  that that kind of thing don't happen it don't happen in the u.s for that's right everything's good
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:51.360]  right here america actually had a guy do that at the grand canyon i was like privately videotaping
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.880]  something talking about you and take over and he walked over like you wanted to attack me
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:03.280]  traitor go ahead i'm sorry well uh one thing i've noticed here i'm a north carolina native but
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:09.280]  i only live about 10 minutes uh from the south carolina border and i'd like to spend more time
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.680]  there in fact i think i'd like to move there sometimes soon but uh start getting to that
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:19.600]  point and we'll finish up the next segment but tell us about it well i there's no spirit of
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:25.840]  any patriotism not really not not a spirit of of liberty or anything where i live in north carolina
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:29.840]  that could just be my area of north carolina but once you cross the border into south carolina
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:35.120]  you start seeing gats and blacks everywhere and i'm just uh that's because it's the it's the it's
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:44.800]  the southern air culture that's now readopted liberty and the gats and stay there this is gcn
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:54.480]  the genesis communications radio network the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:59.680]  and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:05.920]  of the american people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water symbol dumb down
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:11.520]  the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:16.640]  fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely

[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:21.840]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:31.840]  ladies and gentlemen we're now into hour number three of the first live broadcast of 2014 and
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:39.040]  it's context i'm getting used to before i know it in 2015 2020 2030 cybernetic merger if they have
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:46.560]  their way the singularity prank in north carolina uh you know it's funny the army war college did
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:52.560]  reports uh two years ago now on how they'd have to crush a tea party rebellion in south and north
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:58.240]  carolina and how their main mission this is even mainstream news now will be crushing american gun
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.120]  owners uh in the south of the bible belt you hear obama speeches about bitter clingers and
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:08.640]  and everybody i mean that's it as bad off as the south is and you know unhealthy and
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.960]  obese and a lot of bad statistics in the south i don't care if you're black white what it is in
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:18.240]  the south people are more hospitable they're nice they say hi to you i guarantee if you were in a
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:22.080]  rural area and a car was burning on the side of the road you'd have a hundred people stop to help
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:28.080]  you and they'd know what to do too and um it's just they're just more old-fashioned people
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.280]  and that's why the globalists see it as the enemy but go ahead and make your point about
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:38.240]  the zombiosis we're seeing well you know it's like everybody keeps saying it's the uh the
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:45.200]  obsession i mean literally like an addiction obsession with spectator sports it's almost
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:50.560]  like people i and you know of all sports football is probably the one that i could probably myself
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:55.920]  become addicted to if i had fallen to that but i'm too strong because i know it's a trap i know all
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:00.720]  that's it i mean and it's got the chief and the characters and the warrior leaders the quarterback
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:07.200]  and the and the and the the head coach is the head chief and they have the battle and it's all the
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:13.520]  rules so it's primitive and so that's their manhood and it's designed to rob you of your future that's
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:19.600]  why it's so sick go ahead yeah and i mean i see it as a judo skill i know i know what it is it's a
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:25.280]  trap otherwise the establishment wouldn't be pushing it like like they do the politicians uh
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.920]  you know gov co gov gov you know big government little government government at all levels i mean
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:36.640]  it's all all pushing it um i don't i don't know what's gonna happen man it's it's very depressing
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.400]  i'm encouraged the the guy they called from connecticut the people are asking questions about
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:46.560]  sandy hook i mean you know i see encouraging you know uh stories every now and then like that but
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:51.520]  i mean around here people are just they couldn't care less and if you do if you do care and you
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.600]  question things they don't think you're crazy for for uh you know believing what you believe
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.960]  they just think you're crazy for giving it to them that's what i've noticed is it's like a shield
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:08.480]  they wear their dishonor as honor and they think it's weird that you care and it's what kind of
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:14.080]  world is that a bunch of dishonorable cowards that's why for all its problems and all its corruption
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.880]  more and more the only people i find that i even want to be around other than patriots that are
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.360]  already awake is military people because at least they've been in combat they know what it is to
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.800]  have to tie their shoelaces they're not cowards they they care about something even if they've
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:36.640]  been misdirected and been fooled before uh i mean even as bad as police are a lot of bullies thugs
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:40.960]  out of control folks that's who the feds are looking for but i find statistically more police
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.640]  that are awake and give a damn than the general public i mean it's just it's scary to see the
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:52.800]  globalist loving how dumb down the public is i mean they just love it and this is my society
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:58.480]  this is your society this is our culture and you can see it's getting worse i mean how far do you
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:03.920]  think this can go because historically when stuff gets like this everything collapses well it's like
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:08.000]  you know you don't uh like they taught us in the Marine Corps when you're going into a building you
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.160]  don't uh you you don't want to maneuver yourself where your opponent is going to be backed into
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:19.440]  a corner typically you like to come in and get on the rooftop so they have a way to get out because
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.920]  you know you don't want to back somebody into a corner and leave them with no option but to uh
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:31.200]  but to fight but uh fight to the death but um i i think as long as the establishment and the
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:38.320]  scientific uh you know bureaucracy and whatnot uh give them a place to go where they don't actually
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:43.280]  have to fight i think i think 95 percent of the american people are gonna go they're gonna go
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:48.800]  right where we're the judas code tells them to go it's sad and you're right the globalists don't
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:54.400]  want to push us into a corner they want to flesh us out flesh us out and shoot us take us out that's
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:58.880]  why we've got to pick the battles and go on the offense politically not let them always be on the
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:05.120]  offense alex gones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide i'll also

[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:19.920]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing

[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.920]  muzzle of a swat officer's rifle they let them in the area they told them they could come in and
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.240]  now they're coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people we're not turning our
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.840]  guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to comment
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:46.800]  we are on the march the empire is on the run live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:11:07.680]  jones the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:19.680]  this is the heart of 1776 and it is the first worldwide transmission of the info war in 2014
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:26.160]  it is the first day of january 2014 welcome and thank you all for joining us here on the
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.080]  worldwide radio transmission i want to thank all of our sponsors all of our listeners all of our
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:37.200]  am and fm affiliates everyone out there i wish you a wonderful new year and god bless you all we are
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:42.080]  certainly brothers and sisters together in the animating contest and the quest for liberty
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:48.640]  and freedom in the fight against evil that's what it comes down to and the failure to recognize
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:54.960]  good from evil tyranny from liberty is what will bring down civilizations folks are waking up but
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:59.920]  not to the full magnitude i don't blame them because let me tell you i study this stuff constantly and
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:07.040]  i'm still blown away by just the new evil systems i discover and how far along this is and how
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:11.280]  sophisticated it is and you know yesterday we talked a lot about this with steve quayle you
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.160]  really come face to face with the fact that you're dealing with the spirit this is this is above humans
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:21.440]  the devil whatever you want to call it i mean if you really get deep into this and study it it is
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.560]  an animating spirit of evil that we're fighting with the spirit of god where there is a spirit of
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:30.720]  god there is liberty i forget which bible verse there is well where there is the devil there is
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:37.520]  tyranny and bondage and poverty and and fraud and just sicko gibbering mentally ill control freaks
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:44.480]  that love running people's lives and hate their fellow man and uh just looking at an image of
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:48.480]  that peri lady that was making fun of white people adopting black kids and just she'd rather
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:54.240]  be aborted just makes me think of what a slimy enemy she is it's not even an instinct of hating her
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.480]  it's an instinct just knowing that she is coming for us and just knowing that just keep winning
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:06.240]  against innocent people it makes me sick i'm gonna fight hard i'm gonna figure out how to beat
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.520]  these people with your help but all i know is we just got to resist them every day speak out against
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:17.840]  them be hardcore not back down and never stop and let me tell you folks it's not exhausting
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.400]  sometimes i get tired but i'd be a lot more tired if i wasn't doing this because i've got such you
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:27.920]  know on average so much more energy even being 40 years old compared to when i was 20 because i
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:34.400]  understand the mission and it is it is animating so it's good to fight tyranny folks you were born
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:41.200]  for this but we are fighting a spirit we're fighting a sick culture and we've got to fight it with that
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:45.840]  and doesn't mean any of us are perfect or any of us are on a high horse but we know when it's
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:54.480]  self-assured premeditated evil and fraud and manipulation and corruption the people that
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:14:00.240]  would manipulate their fellow humans towards evil trying to cheat their fellow humans trying to
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.960]  have a corrupt system they are cancer and they need to be routed out ladies and gentlemen
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:12.160]  they need to be cut out like a cancer and they're attacking us with the fluoride the GMOs all of it
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:18.160]  they are wantonly evil it's on record the communist chinese the german government the

[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:17.040]  currentians 317 all right let's go ahead where there's the spirit of the world there's slavery
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:22.480]  and ignorance and pain that's my quote let's talk to christian indiana thanks for holding
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:32.080]  her on the year in the new year happy new year alex thank you brother kudos first time it's a
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:37.760]  wonderful life video and the new employers magazine with obama being displayed as a dictator with a
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:46.400]  huge communist uniform on the front yes pretty symbolic of what's going on um this stock home
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.560]  syndrome mass stock home syndrome as you pointed out it is symbolized very well in a movie with
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:59.520]  al Pacino entitled dog day afternoon that's a good moment have you heard of uh yeah i saw
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:06.240]  him yeah like yeah he robs a bank with his buddy and then the people that are holding him hostile
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:12.800]  that he is holding hostage eventually become uh impartial to him and being on his side even
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:19.200]  when the people try to you know you know the people that are trying to convince
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:22.960]  al Pacino that he's doing things wrong like the police force and so forth the people want to
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:30.720]  stay in there with him they just want to stay hostage that's exactly how it works because
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:36.000]  because they're such zombies they worship the guy even though he's bad who is still a man
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:44.640]  and active that's what it is hey you know what and i'm also uh with this whole patriot thing coming
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:51.840]  in 2014 with the the big 2014 elections i was engaging in some pop crime today my currently
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:57.600]  i'm actually reading george washington in my world war book world book in phyclopedia oh that's
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:05.760]  chance oh i know man i i got a problem right and there is a very interesting paragraph couple
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:12.960]  paragraphs here that i would like to read if you would let me absolutely read it now this is
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:19.520]  really symbolizing people like ron paul rand paul type crews all of the tea party
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:25.600]  patriots but i really don't gain seats in these upcoming elections and symbol of independence
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:30.480]  which is in bold letters i agree read the quote we got a minute and a half
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.960]  to most americans of this time washington became the chief symbol of what they were fighting for
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:42.800]  the colonists had been brought up to respect the british king they did not easily accept the idea
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:48.400]  of independence the congress that approved the declaration of independence on July 4 1776
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:55.200]  was not elected by the people but by the legislatures of the state and the legislatures
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:00.560]  were elected only by property owners and as a result some people who did not own property
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:07.600]  and had no vote due to independence with suspicion thousands of boilers as british sympathizers
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.400]  were called refused to help the fight for independence in any way and that's what really
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:18.880]  symbolizes the people nowadays they don't they're afraid of independence they want the status quo
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:25.680]  which is a rotting culture we're going in the wrong direction we've got to go back to liberty yeah
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:30.960]  right i mean i absolutely agree with you alex and hey have a good new year and i hope i hope
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:36.160]  of just independence thrives up in here i hope we don't see any horrible false flags and just
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:44.480]  people just wake up start reading books like 1984 animal farm farenheit 451 brave new world and
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:50.160]  breathe what these people like in the grand chessboard knuckles is evading the rizinski
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.640]  exactly they're all very public they brag about what they're doing to us that's what's so frustrating
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:58.240]  is that the average sheep will think we're making this up well they could go find out it's true for
[02:19:58.240 --> 02:20:03.200]  themselves more calls coming up than gucciardi alex jones here to tell you about how you can help

[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:40.560]  we said in the article john bounds driving down 360 yesterday morning there is a car with fire
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:45.040]  under it and a woman standing a foot and a half two feet literally in the smoke he pulls over to
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:52.160]  render aid which is the law by the way no one in just literally thousands of cars i mean it's just
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:56.640]  hundreds going by every few minutes just jam packed traffic pull over to help her you're supposed to
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.920]  do that especially if you see it pull over and catch on fire and it's a big problem in society
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:06.960]  people are rendering aid he's not shooting iphone video at first he's standing back 150 yards and
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.840]  get away from the car finally when she starts walking up he starts videotape and talking to her
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.720]  and the idiots are on here going hey she was like you know 30 feet away or whatever she's a safe
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:22.640]  distance we told you morons she was standing next to the car is why he pulled over to go tell her to
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:30.480]  get away from it i mean it's just no one denies that good samaritan activity is way down that's on
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:36.160]  record okay that's what this is all about it's like the woman choking that nobody would help

[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:32.720]  that a third party candidate cannot get elected president yet they celebrate one of the most uh
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:39.680]  famous president the 16th president and if they renew their history they'd know that our 16th
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:48.400]  president was elected in 1864 on a third party candidate it's history but yet we're convinced
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:58.240]  today that ron paul can't make it we're convinced because we are all zombies it's pathetic absolutely
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:04.160]  it's the mind control and and brains from birth we're now 65 years into tv set in front of the
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:09.760]  television we've been programmed to do what it says and that's a false reality where they can
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.640]  present whatever they want very well said appreciate your call karen in arizona thanks for calling
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:21.120]  happy new year go ahead and two uh zombies uh couple about couple months ago i was driving down the
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:28.000]  road and i saw this guy in a wheelchair electric wheelchair motorized and he was struggling because
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:34.640]  he got stuck at some mud cars were going by i turned around to help him and he also had a little
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:41.680]  dog and now we were trying to get his wheelchair and stuck cars were going by cars so one guy
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:47.440]  finally did turn around come by and help us and i noticed all the cars driving by and i thought
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:55.200]  boy are we in trouble another thing as i mentioned to this woman i said uh stop voting straight party
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.240]  and she got into this always then the other guy will win i said that's the problem i said this is
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:06.400]  all a brainwashing job you know because i thought of ron paul i said this is all a brainwashing job
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:13.120]  to convince you that the other guy's going to win and uh so i said no but this is a zombie state
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:19.440]  well no that's it and again when i was a kid if your tire was flat and you were a woman look
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:26.320]  you're having a problem people will stop and help you uh or you know the list just goes on and on it
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:31.600]  it's just scary to see somebody dying in the street and no one helps them i mean they won't
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.320]  even call 911 it's like that guy on the train a few months ago who for several minutes on
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:41.120]  the video is just aiming guns at people's heads and they're all on smartphones and walking over
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:44.240]  people even see the gun but they're so conditioned they can't believe it's actually happening
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:49.280]  then he starts shooting people and then they freak out i mean if i saw some guy pull a gun
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:53.520]  out i would immediately act like i didn't see it until he walked by and i'd grab the gun away
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:57.840]  and and by the way folks i have taken a gun away from somebody i have gotten taken a knife away
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:02.400]  for somebody the culture was much more rough when i was even growing up outside dallas texas and in
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:06.080]  dallas and i'm not going to tell those stories because you know the average you yuppie doesn't
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:09.600]  even know what that stuff's like but i guess the average person gets a knife or a gun pulled on
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:15.040]  when they grovel not me i go completely crazy uh i mean it's almost like enjoyable that you've
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:20.400]  now done something so i can beat the hell out of you and it's not like sadistic like i like to hurt
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:25.680]  people i don't like to hurt a little mouse or i don't like to hurt a cat or a dog or a child i like
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:31.600]  to hurt scum and it's not like i even like to hurt them it's like it's just like if you're gonna
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.480]  fight might as well enjoy it it's like it's not it's just you're ready to beat the hell out of
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:41.680]  somebody and and and i don't know where people don't have that instinct anymore that if somebody
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:46.080]  attacks you you hit them back that's you people in school you don't fight back against a bully
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:51.600]  and you get more trouble if you fight back i mean that's that's pure slavery we're on the march

[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:30.800]  now if somebody's trying to bring you down and then you lower them fair and square that's the
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:36.240]  way it is in business or a lawsuit or they physically attack you break their neck whatever
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:41.680]  you gotta do that's different ladies and gentlemen and that's when your instinct should be to dominate
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.080]  the problem is good people have given up on their instinct to dominate evil and so we let
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:51.360]  evil dominate us and there's no end to the level of evil now ladies and gentlemen if you go to
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:35:02.480]  drudgereport.com you can see uh there in the middle column uh top story nuke fear feds order 14
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:10.400]  million dosages of potassium iodine the way i read the the fedbiz side it's actually 14 million
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:15.040]  packages of it but the point is is this is the biggest order ever it was like eight million they
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:20.480]  ordered back during the last Fukushima this is huge and we've been telling you it's the extraction
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:24.480]  of the rods the cleanup which the japanese news admits has been carried out by the mafia over
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:30.560]  there they're using homeless people basically at below uh minimum wage is like the death commandos to
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:37.280]  go in uh that was in Reuters a few days ago this is incredible that this is happening and
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:44.560]  we're here to break it down now gucciardi's also put uh not just uh watson's report up but uh he
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:49.600]  has also done another report that just went up in the last hour in full wars.com is the government
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:55.600]  stockpiling iodine and prevention for Fukushima meltdown uh do flies follow obama everywhere
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:02.000]  like he's satan incarnate or conversely a pile of pig crap uh yes we know the answer excuse me i
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.520]  just gotta say it i mean he may not be the devil he may just smell like what flies like flies never
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:11.840]  land on me hardly ever unless there's a horse flutter on a bite me in the woods or something
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:16.400]  i mean i mean there's just constantly coming out of his mouth self is spot is spontaneously
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:23.360]  uh generating out of his a toot or whatever's happening uh but u.s. government orders 14 million
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:29.920]  dosages a potassium iodide there's the headline uh and so i wanted to get uh anthony gucciardi's
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:33.760]  take on this because he was the one talking about it yesterday and i noticed watson also
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:38.480]  must have found it in the fed this site or one of our tipsters listening to us an email
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:43.280]  so we're breaking that at info wars.com right now but anthony this is what we've been concerned
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:48.160]  about that radioactive wave coming in all of it and of course you've got uh the head of the young
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.720]  turk saying when he was in msnbc the last straw was they said look don't have reporters there run away
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:57.520]  from it it's really horrible super high radiation but we're not going to tell the public that and
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:03.760]  of course the prevailing winds and the ocean all comes our way so again i personally am
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.720]  concerned about this and i'm not on the west coast radiation's gone up some here now i think
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:13.280]  inculters should move to limited Fukushima she says it's a good deal literally and i you know
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:20.560]  that's her first amendment i don't agree with that uh but um what is your breakdown of this
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:24.960]  serious development what do you think they're doing it for all the reactors that are 40 years
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:29.600]  old here that are rotting they're going to keep going violating federal law uh the other reactors
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:35.760]  or the missing nuclear weapons uh what do you think's going on here anthony gucciardi this is
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:40.720]  the same government we have to remember that raised the allowable radiation limits in our food
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:45.760]  turned off the radiation counters on the west coast and silently have been preparing for Fukushima
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:51.040]  for a while because their experts tell them yeah Fukushima the key thing is the extraction of these
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:56.640]  rods even the conservative conservative uh professors from gale university and others are
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:02.400]  saying yeah the extraction of these rods could lead to quote unquote Fukushima forever uh changing
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:09.520]  the world completely devastating japan but we can go back now and look at this reality that it was at
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:13.840]  this around the same time they've started to take the rods out now the government knows this the
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.400]  federal analysts who look at this say yeah this is the key thing this is the number one issue
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:22.800]  is that they touch because if they touch basically the whole plant will blow up there will be a meltdown
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:26.480]  and there's tons of these things yeah there and they have homeless people can you guys pull up the
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:30.560]  image of the homeless guy they've got doing the work i mean i'm not putting the homeless guy down
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:35.600]  but he looks like you know he has a couple cups of sake a day oh yeah oh yeah human error is just to
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:42.000]  begin with but look at this it was business insider had the photo but go ahead 1,535 rods
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.920]  they have to extract that's 1,535 instances of a potential catastrophe that could melt down
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:53.040]  Fukushima evacuate japan completely obliterate the west coast with fallout nuts conservative
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.440]  yell professor on huffington boast uh david tzuzuki who you know is right about some things
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:02.480]  wrong civilization ending in japan yeah i mean he's saying basically japan will be wiped out
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.040]  by by japan west coast would have to immediately evacuate that's the quote by by japan yeah
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:11.200]  exact quote by by japan it would be completely obliterated and then we'd have to evacuate here
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  in the united states in many areas and the food supply would be completely tarnished
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:21.120]  and but the thing is here they're ordering it is 14 million tablets so you could say packages
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:27.280]  doses whatever 14 million tablets of this potassium iodide which i believe and the experts tablets not
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:31.760]  packages low quality garbage iodine that you know it's better than nothing yeah it's better than
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:37.040]  nothing but you take it in emergency but anyway the key thing here is the iodine iodine manufacturers
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:40.560]  they all know that fukushima is probably going to melt down because they have homeless people
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:45.440]  going in working on these rods extractions that's right that's why we've had everybody in the world
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:51.840]  trying to call it by our our raw crystals that we have stockpiled form of elemental yeah you can't
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:56.320]  even hardly get that anymore and i was talking to some manufacturers they've increased it like 2000
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.840]  percent over the last several years and it's going up more and more with fukushima and everything
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:06.160]  like that in 2011 now it's just extrapolating over and over again the government is undoubtedly 100
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:11.840]  percent preparing for the meltdown of fukushima with this purchase specifically the 14 million
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:16.880]  doses maybe just for the west coast and then you could get into the reality that they're also buying
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.520]  it because they know the prices and by the way that on screen is the small explosion show the mox
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:27.760]  three reactor uh where it's a big 3000 foot tall uh mushroom cloud or just look at mushroom cloud
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:31.760]  fukushima and i'll give it to you guys you you'll see it it's three times the size of that yeah
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:35.760]  that was all downplayed anyway it was over two times the amount of no it's good for you yeah
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:40.800]  there it is that's good for you we should actually make and culture radiation bills just bottled at
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:45.120]  the source from fukushima like spring water except for we should do a joke video i've said a parody
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:53.840]  on that no available and culture fukushima pills yeah and then show a clip uh of her saying it's
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:59.920]  good for you know that's right now you can enjoy brain damage kidney failure cancers and infertility
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:04.480]  bottled there's nothing like your teeth falling out and your fast growing cells all dying do you
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:08.720]  like your guts liquefying and blood pouring out of your body well then and culture radiation pills
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.440]  over you well you know it's good news for her because they did dump i think 73 of all the
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:18.080]  radiation the cesium into the pacific ocean when they couldn't handle it anymore so thankfully we
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:22.320]  do have radiation constantly attacking us through the food supply and through the ocean on a consistent
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:28.720]  24 seven basis that's the other point too here is that silently they're preparing a real government
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:33.520]  would tell its people tell its citizens what's going on and order them to prepare them so russians
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:39.520]  did when a chernobyl blew up they said take iodine and also prussian blue which we can't get here
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.640]  that also takes it out people know that is the color but it but it's a it's a mineral i guess
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:51.440]  that's really good we've been looking into that but the whole point is is that um my wife lived
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.640]  in europe her dad was a diplomat with the agriculture department during that and for
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.520]  about six months they had to have frozen food flowing from the u.s and asia they had to have
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:05.520]  powdered milk no more milk because that bio accumulates in the cow's milk because it was hitting
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:10.960]  the crops italy germany france russia they wouldn't eat their food for at least six months and they
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:16.640]  and the un says over a million deaths in the aggregate since 86 from fukushima in the last 20
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:21.520]  something years but meanwhile they will not even tell us we're literally still importing fish from
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:26.160]  japan and eating them right here in texas and it sold us delicacy why are you racist against
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:29.760]  japanese i'm obviously very racist because i don't like radiation i'm not going to look at
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:32.400]  what you just said i'm just going to call you racist yeah that's a good idea you shouldn't
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:36.240]  look at these quotes where he says much more serious is the danger of the spent fuel rod
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:42.000]  pool this is a yellow university professor where he says 15 uh 35 rods safely transport them to
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:46.640]  the common storage pool then you have 50 meters to go and then it's 6,375 other rods and if they
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:52.000]  blow up then it will be he said uh they would fission and all of humanity will be threatened
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:56.640]  for thousands of years that's okay though he's obviously racist and he says they're completely
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:01.200]  uncontrollable you know and we have homeless people doing it we're paid like three dollars a year
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:07.280]  and the unit four pool is completely destroyed everything about this is red alert level and
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.640]  the whole place what's that hydrology term where it's all turning into a swamp and sponging yeah
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.000]  because they're having to keep dumping water on it yeah we've talked about that before i forget
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:21.360]  the term we always try and bring it up and but it is actually key this whole thing is just riddled
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:25.920]  with error i mean i'm actually looking at southern hemisphere over the radiation because you can't
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:29.680]  fight that i mean if it gets high enough i will leave and i guess i'll take some of the crew with
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:33.840]  me or something i mean i this is that serious that is actually the only answer at that point i mean
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:37.760]  you can protect yourself with some iodine things like that but if it actually completely blows
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:43.040]  sky high even the experts say well that's why we know radiation at this level lowers immunity
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:47.760]  that's why they're having huge flu and cold deaths in japan tens of thousands kids dropping
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:52.160]  dead on playgrounds because they'll have cardiac arrest from it uh this is all admitted to cover
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:56.240]  up and we've been getting hit with radiation we're eating it and you're seeing record deaths from
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:01.520]  bacteria and stuff i mean this is already hammering real hot particles in california as far as
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:07.040]  boston too hot particles you know you inhale that you're essentially dead i mean this is massive
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:12.400]  level they were saying on some reports that it's worse than chernobyl oh it's many times that's
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.080]  that's an understatement yeah exactly that's an understatement because chernobyl not to mention
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:20.000]  was just a one-time event this could go on for thousands of it was one reactor that blew up
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.280]  not five that all partially blew that are continuing to blow you know they're still picking up weird
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:29.600]  isotopes that show stuff's going on and we know we trust tepco which has been unveiled to be like
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:34.240]  run by the mafia and and they're telling us how great everything is hiring homeless people
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:38.640]  that doesn't sound very good they're taping up things nuclear fission technology they're just
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:45.680]  using duct tape you know i'm not for like global government type stuff but this should be like the
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.880]  u.s of course we're leading the evil instead or the u.n or nato or whoever it should be
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:54.880]  they already had navy ships there they're all getting cancer suing over that but but i mean
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:45:01.040]  this should be a hundred thousand people there volunteering you know every month top scientists
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:05.680]  people in lead line suits coming up with the best plans it should be a manhattan level project to
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:09.840]  clean this up instead they just don't care the nuclear commission did raise it to the highest
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:14.480]  level recently the issue is that they created a new level yes and the issue is that no one
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:18.880]  is doing anything about it the governments are just sitting back in the united this is the highest
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:23.840]  level nuclear emergency yeah and now they were saying last time i saw a few weeks ago they may
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:28.560]  create a new level yeah exactly this is beyond anything else and we're just sitting here bread
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:32.000]  and circus level doing nothing about it the government's not telling us anything meanwhile
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.320]  it's like a t6 tornado yeah this is the collapse of the roman empire basically we're just sitting
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:42.160]  here doing nothing and they're buying 14 million well you know the the the romans in 410 when alaric
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:46.800]  was like 50 miles away the visigoths chieftain out of germany and was burning and pillaging and
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:52.000]  slaughtering everyone only taking the women they were still having sex with their horses and partying
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  and just laughing and drugged out of their mind as the hordes rare i mean it's the same deal that's
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.480]  what i'm saying it's zombiosis yeah it's the decadence that's what we're talking about off the
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:07.040]  air the roman empire is the most closely related in my opinion to the united states because obama
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:11.520]  actually doesn't want fervent supporters as much as he has them he wants a population that is
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:15.280]  docile and doesn't care one way or another well that's why they modeled the last hundred years
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:19.120]  brought in the fascist symbols of the senate they modeled themselves look at the architecture
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.120]  that they they say they're the new rome absolute key is apathy because the enemy of all of this
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:29.600]  the establishment is to care about fukushima care about the fact that it's blowing up consistently
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:33.680]  that the experts say it'll threaten humanity for thousands of years that's the antithesis of the
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:39.040]  establishment to not care to have apathy is to allow them to win and to allow them to completely
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:43.120]  destroy a family and that's what john bounds reports about the woman's a foot and a half away
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:47.920]  from the car he finally gets it later blows up yeah i guess he should have just let her blow up
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.240]  i mean that's what it could have come down to because some of the comments were like how dare
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:57.200]  he annoy her like that how dare he go in and barge and be so aggressive just even having
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:03.520]  emotions now is bad because passion is the ultimate enemy of the establishment passion for anything
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:07.520]  as we're doing right now this passion people think it's weird that you care that fukushima is blowing
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.080]  up and killing thousands of millions of people gee that's a good thing to have passion that's what
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:16.080]  all these motivational people have always said you know the ones that are real is have passion for
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:20.480]  what you're doing and that's how you have success in business or anything this is just a new level
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:24.880]  bringing the media to the next level about passion the mainstream media has no passion the mainstream
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:29.520]  media reports and says today fukushima blah blah blah they don't care they don't even report on the
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.320]  real news this is called passion that's why yeah how could they all sit around msnbc and fox and cnn
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:39.040]  it's all coming out and go oh yeah don't send reporters and oh it is increasing here and then
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:44.400]  they don't even they just go home and have sex and party yeah exactly i mean it's just they're nuts
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:50.240]  they're nuts they're nuts it is complete insanity and when people are actually realizing this though
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:54.800]  and that's why 2014 is going to be an absolutely winning i agree now listen we're all honest about
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.440]  this we're concerned about this this is serious the reports nationwide at drudgereport.com
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:03.680]  us government orders 14 million doses of potassium iodine what i do is funder operation
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:10.960]  with stuff i really believe in and we stockpiled this particular proprietary patented nascent iodine
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:19.520]  it's the purple blue true crystal form in gas injected in in the non-gmo
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:28.640]  from germany corn based glycerin and it is very expensive to produce very hard to make
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:32.640]  and i'm going to try to stockpile even more of it we've got more of it coming in but it's selling
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:37.840]  out right now survival shielded in forest life.com we also have the fluoride shield that has five
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:43.920]  other compounds that pull out heavy metals toxins with iodine in it so the fluoride shield has iodine
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:48.480]  in it as well it's in a two ounce bottle and that we haven't sold out of yet but we're getting
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.560]  close as well but more is coming in as well so again fluoride shield the two ounce bottle
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:58.720]  and then we have for 39.95 very low price for what this cost us and we have the one ounce
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:04.560]  nascent iodine that's the pure iodine for 29.95 and that helps funder operation as well so
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:09.200]  i go out and go nobody knows about this this is the best form it does all this i'm going to buy it
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:13.440]  out and sell it i mean it's it's simple and then we funder operation i sell quality stuff
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:19.760]  info warslife.com Anthony comments on people taking action and stockpiling this i mean i've got
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:24.320]  i've got like a hundred bottles at home yeah i've got some right now i have some actually
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.040]  just sitting there fermenting in my basement as well some other products as well preparedness is
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:33.760]  key because as i mentioned before potassium iodide which the government is buying just as they gave
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.480]  out doritos and mountain dew during a hurricane sandy they're going to give out if anything this
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:42.000]  might actually just be for government by the way oh no this is for the government yeah but if they
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.640]  were to give it out they would give out the potassium iodide which is the poor low quality
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:50.880]  synthetic inorganic form and i'll be honest we sell that if people want yeah you do sell it because
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:55.120]  in an emergency scenario if you have nothing else obviously you want to take that obviously
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:58.640]  my thing about the survival shield the nascent iodine is you can take it every day you can take
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:02.720]  it every day to prepare yourself and help you know support your thyroid and everything like that
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:07.840]  before disaster strikes with it's already struck and the radiation levels are up exactly but you
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.680]  know a meltdown or anything like this but this potassium iodide you don't want to take that
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:18.800]  every day absolutely not my thing is nascent iodine 100 all the way i stockpile it i purchased it
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:22.400]  even before we started selling it you know from the manufacturer directly with stockpiling it for
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:27.920]  my family giving it out to others it tastes great that's my thing and we can't even really get the
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:32.720]  elemental form of iodine anymore anyway so i would encourage everyone if they're going to stockpile
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:38.960]  it to do it now well that is a worry because they only have a certain supply of the raw crystals
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:45.040]  that's be all dea approved a lot if all gashima goes down good luck getting iodine that's the truth

[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.160]  and that's what's happening with all this tyranny repeat what you said to me because we were getting
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:34.960]  off the whole Fukushima iodine subject but you said some hardcore stuff that's absolutely true
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:40.160]  uh during the break repeat Anthony what you were just saying about uh what's happening
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:43.920]  with iodine because it's true that tell folks we were just having a conversation about the
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:47.600]  manufacturing stuff you're saying could we actually get more elemental iodine if Fukushima
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:54.720]  does blow up in 2011 some of the numbers I was getting was per unit instead of $200 the manufacturers
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:55:00.160]  were jacking up to $2,000 a unit no one could get iodine and then in addition to all of that
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:04.400]  they weren't even selling it because they're just stockpiling in warehouses like diamonds sitting
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:10.720]  on for those that don't know elemental iodine is like alien blood it eats through five levels of
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:15.120]  steel if you were to drop it on the ground well you know Dr. Group was telling me a story
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:19.920]  about this one manufacturer who yeah they did drip some on the ground on the carpet and went
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:24.560]  through multiple stories of the building I mean that's how raw and serious this is the handling of
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:29.920]  it is totally insane the DEA regulations alone are insane you have to handle this with extreme
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:35.280]  precision and people have warehouses of this just sitting waiting because they know that they can
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:39.440]  jack up the price but the thing is people are willing to pay for that the government is taking
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:43.840]  a preemptive strike right now and getting these 14 million doses because they know when it hits
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:48.880]  the fan they're not going to be able to get any of it just like we saw in 2011 now my thing I was
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.720]  saying is that the public is so unaware of this to a larger degree thanks to the mainstream media
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:58.160]  that if I was into stocks and everything which I'm not and I don't believe in the stock market the
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:03.120]  future trades for iodine would be where it would be at right now because if Fukushima does go
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:09.520]  the iodine alone the elemental pure iodine will be the number one commodity in the United States
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:13.680]  and probably around the world for sure Japan if you know if they can even have a function and
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:20.000]  commerce system over there but iodine will be the number one commodity because even you know food's
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.560]  great and everything but it can't protect you from certain forms of radioactive you know iodine
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:30.320]  so that will be the well said well said and I mean it's already melting down
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:36.240]  but I just why are they using homeless people because we were pulled up a photo earlier wasn't
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:40.000]  the one I saw the day of the group of homeless I mean they look like our homeless like they
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.280]  you know had about a hundred gallons of sake that day no I'm sure they did they got drunk
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:47.680]  homeless people with their hair sticking up this is insane I mean you couldn't come up this
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:50.960]  like I started almost laughing earlier when you were talking because I was thinking about it yeah
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:55.920]  like a Monty Python skit where you have the drunk homeless Japanese people yeah I mean this is not
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:01.760]  funny like doing sir but but it is funny the doctor calls in like the local 711 owner or
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:05.600]  something to do the brain surgery and he's like here you go just use these tools it's real simple
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.520]  you know we'll pay you two three dollars a year he just go ahead and do that well it's had less
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.280]  than minimum wage an hour to be serious but we're cleaning up the area and everything like that
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.760]  but knowing those guys since apparently it is run by completely insane liars which is true in
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:22.480]  valley that type goes mafia that's exactly mafia they're just busy with tattoos five women an hour
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:26.240]  just yeah exactly telling everything telling everyone that is actually fine and there's no
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:30.560]  radiation concern to live in the Fukushima area and then it's fine people still live there all all
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:34.800]  the rich Japanese have moved further south even out of Tokyo exactly move each all the poor old
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:39.520]  safe going getting out of japan entirely too many of them when there's hot particles as far as
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:45.200]  balsam but that is the sad joke that is the completely sad nightmare that we're living in
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:48.880]  right now where they say it's perfectly fine and they're on their jets getting out of there as
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:53.280]  fast as they possibly can and talking about the reality why do you think almost all the rich
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:57.120]  Israelis are leaving Israel right now well you know it comes down to a lot of different things
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:00.880]  but i mean you look at the fact that comes down of the they keep attacking Syria russia
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:04.720]  might nuke is no that's exactly what i was going to say the timeline events basically comes down
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:10.400]  to russia attacking israel and ultimately some analysts say they could fail but russia there's
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:15.120]  one of the tepco workers yeah he looks like a hardened veteran for nuclear fission for sure
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:20.080]  cleaning up how about just some overdrive go to shana i appreciate you holding and uh

[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:07.040]  this is the most important year for the american patriots i'm in litigation with a company okay
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:13.200]  who sold us a house that's not good we are my daughter's a witness and i'm a witness and we
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:17.840]  brought in a home inspector to look at the home we printed presented that before the court that
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:23.040]  they wanted their home inspector to come in he came in falsified a home inspection since that's a
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:28.080]  cps they were at our door with allegations against us that were all false yeah that's what that's what
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:32.160]  the spine in nazi germany it was like that if the neighbor was mad at you or a group they would send
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:39.520]  cps well you need to sue him for a false report they'll try to claim it's it's it's it's secret
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:45.520]  but you need to go after him so so what did the cps claim okay so she came to my house and she said
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:50.880]  that there were false reports that the house is well they said i didn't have a fridge which of course
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:54.960]  i did there was a picture i didn't my range that work it did i didn't have a heater in my bathroom
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:59.920]  which i did but if they were all false i have the documents i can show you she came to my house i
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:04.400]  said you need a court order to come into my home and alex i've been taken nice and i died

[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:43.360]  grid is meant to destroy the average person and a lady called in shawna in kentucky to tell the
[03:08:43.360 --> 03:08:49.760]  story about how they got in a fight over inspections with the house dealing with companies and then
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:55.120]  the the other company wanted to send their inspector so they did and then she was saying
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:59.200]  they called cps on her uh i guess you know saying that they'd have a refrigerator and
[03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:04.400]  stuff that wasn't true i know wealthy people that have had their kids taken because their
[03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:10.240]  kid broke their finger at school and you're at the hospital and you go they broke it at school
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:16.160]  and they go we'll see about that cps comes in it doesn't matter that a week later it comes out
[03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:21.440]  and courted happened at school because they've already started an investigation and they go
[03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:26.240]  just sign these forms admit you know that you'll do what we say and then you can keep your kid
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:30.560]  you sign them they leave just like the marine said earlier when they would clear houses they
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:34.320]  would try to come in from the roof or whatever to to flush you out so they would have to confront
[03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:39.840]  you cornered so they let you go home for two days now you think you're going to keep your kid now
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:45.280]  the sheriff's deputy shows up and they're usually part of special pedo units i'm serious folks i've
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:49.440]  seen it it's unbelievable i mean you cannot understand that the statistically the evil of
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:55.200]  these people uh the special units they have in the cps all of it and then they come in and go
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:59.520]  we're just taking your daughter for a few days for an evaluation they get them there they give them
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:04.640]  cokes all you know pastries they get them all jacked up throw them into a thing with like 10

[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:15.600]  this all the time uh the seven times more likely it was five now seven times more likely to dire
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:20.960]  be hurt and cps clutches than anywhere else you're safer in a crack house statistically i mean it is
[03:10:20.960 --> 03:10:25.520]  the hell pit of earth who would want that job even if you were every once in a while you weren't a bad
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:29.040]  cps person and you were actually trying to help kids that are being hurt or whatever because they're
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:33.360]  bad parents out there well usually they're not allowed to take those kids the court doesn't want
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:37.920]  some kid you know that's also totally screwed up they want your healthy little kid they're gonna
[03:10:37.920 --> 03:10:44.320]  get top dollar and that's what they do if this woman's child have been two gone one year old gone the
[03:10:44.320 --> 03:10:49.680]  fact that she's seven she could speak out when they got their clutches on her and then she could
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:54.880]  and it's not as easy to to to physically hurt and have your way with a seven-year-old that's why
[03:10:54.880 --> 03:10:59.680]  they really love down syndrome kids to get them when they're young because no one's gonna believe them
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:04.800]  that's their that's the that's these units favorite thing to torture and and i'm sorry
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:08.400]  i just thought like this you see to know the government is total scum evil at the top its
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:14.240]  tentacles go down the cps is the mouth of satan basically to eat your children and this woman
[03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:18.960]  saying thank god started crying that she'd heard the show to know how to handle them when all this
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:25.280]  goes on or she wouldn't have her daughter but it's time for us to stand up to the cps they are
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:29.920]  the most evil organization in the world they do the same thing in europe i've had members of parliament
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:34.800]  on they constantly kill these children they constantly beat their brains out they constantly
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:40.480]  rape them i mean it is just hellforce level and and it's something that really gets to my guts
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:47.440]  because i covered this a lot when i was first on air local news and i would go and see them lie in
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:53.360]  court not even put the right names on the paperwork and the judges in travis county over family court
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:12:00.160]  literally judge jiminer and others that they build buildings after our literal janet rino
[03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:07.520]  goblins i mean literally like emper palpatine gets off on people being in pain when the families
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:12.720]  cry and all this bad stuff happens the judge literally is feeding on it psychically okay i
[03:12:12.720 --> 03:12:20.880]  mean i'm telling you i cannot be in the room i mean i literally literally literally it's like
[03:12:20.880 --> 03:12:24.880]  being stabbed by a ring-ray sword ladies and gentlemen when you see them praying on the kids
[03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:30.000]  and you know you can't stop them and you know and then they've got little potbelly cops they're
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:34.800]  special units and you know what they are i mean when you realize you're dealing with literal
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:40.080]  literal scum now ma'am just tell your story in a nutshell so everybody understand what happened
[03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:46.720]  because they may not trying to scare you may be lurking back but uh because but expand on what
[03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:50.880]  happened so so so now how did the sheriff's deputy force their way and i guess they said well we're
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:55.120]  going to come back take your kid which is a terrific threat because the court order was a fraud maybe
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:12:58.560]  they wouldn't get it maybe they didn't tell you could go to court and challenge it they just said
[03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:02.720]  we're going to take your kid if you don't let us in now they'll use a plate in the sink they'll use
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:08.000]  dog hair doesn't matter their facilities got kids with herpes being gang raped that doesn't matter
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:16.080]  they're going to find a dog hair and take your kid so so so what happened okay so she said that
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:19.200]  she's going to get court order i said okay i'm going to go before the judge and i'm going to
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:23.680]  argue this she then she escalated she goes oh no no no i'm going to go tonight and i'm going to get
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:27.200]  a court order and i said well what's the legal way to do this and she said i got to get a court
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:31.520]  order and i got to do something else she said i said let's do it legal get out of my because what
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:36.800]  happened it started to rain and they were in one room i said get out of the home and then she said
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:41.840]  if i come back i'm going to bring a whole bunch of police officers with me we are going to take
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:46.240]  your daughter five days before christmas do you really want to do this to your daughter and then
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:52.080]  this is this is what happened she said oh and then she said real quick i'll tell you she said i said
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:56.720]  to her if you are in my place and you know that somebody put false accusations against you what
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:01.840]  would you do and she said i would say start i have nothing hide okay and alex i'll just jump to
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:07.040]  here at the end of this she searched she found nothing she falsified documents and because i have
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:12.480]  two a bachelor's a master's in educational psychology and i'm in my doctoral program in
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:17.840]  education sciences i pull i looked at each one on there i said this is not true and so she went
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:21.680]  okay fine you'll continue to do this for you daughter and i said this one's not true she wrote
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:26.000]  continue on all of them the only problem she had was she said i have my dogs and she wanted me to
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:30.640]  put my some of my dogs in another room which let's just stop right there they always say you're guilty
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.360]  they're never wrong you might not have gotten a hardcore criminal one they will make up anything
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:39.520]  and once they get your daughter alone they say you will see mommy again when you say
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:46.880]  when you show me the doll and that they put things in the dolls behind and they bring in the doll
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:51.440]  bring in the cop and you go now show us and you'll see mommy then they start the video
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:58.960]  and then you never see mommy again and then they actually take you to the death pit medical science
[03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:03.440]  you name it or they might sell you i mean you may be i mean you may be on a plane i'm not trying to
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:07.920]  scare you man you people have to realize the total satan force we're dealing with now you may not
[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:11.920]  have been dealing with a pure demon but one of the useful idiot trendies that you know sits around
[03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:17.920]  on this all day but exactly since you are so smart you were able to deal with this goblin creature
[03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:22.960]  that was here doing this but this is an example and you notice she lied on you anyways because
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:27.920]  you're the enemy in ohio they're going to take all the children of homeschoolers it's all they've
[03:15:27.920 --> 03:15:32.960]  got the bill they're on tv saying it's illegal in germany from top scientists that are worth 10
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:36.800]  million dollars they take their children who don't want to go to government school those kids look
[03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:41.840]  like something out of a you know postcard from the 50s uh and they flee here to america they're
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:48.320]  sent back this is that they are coming for our children it's announced they are the demons of
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:54.800]  hell okay they are the demons of hell so so how did it end ma'am i went through she i said tell
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:58.240]  me the allegations i want to know i can't tell you they're anonymous i said i know who did them
[03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:03.200]  there were only two people in my home she wrote them down and and i cornered her and i said did
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:07.920]  i do this she said no i went through the whole list and then she then i told her i want your name
[03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:12.000]  on here she said i'm not going to do it i'll get in trouble i'm not supposed to give you the allegations
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:15.840]  and then i said well you know what you listen you use law enforcement techniques the old-fashioned
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:21.920]  ones they've gotten rid of you say you know the guy's name and you say the name of the inspector
[03:16:21.920 --> 03:16:27.200]  or the name of the inspector but it's a female and you say oh he said because they're lying so you
[03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:31.840]  got to use psych warfare back on them only in emergencies just to prove their line you go well
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:36.000]  he said he would do that how dare him and then you'll trick them and they'll say it and now you've
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:43.280]  got them with the false report i'm sorry go ahead absolutely i got i got her her she tore and i got
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:46.720]  it in my hands she tore off a piece of paper it's gonna put her name on that she goes no i'll write
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:50.560]  it on another piece of paper and call it this is what she sent to me it's gotta be my witness
[03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:55.200]  for the three witnesses she said okay you've got the handwriting but nobody will ever know
[03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:59.280]  who wrote hand wrote it no one will ever know and you and i both know i could bring in a handwriting
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:03.680]  analysis and there's the deal when you show them you're strong and know what you're doing they got
[03:17:03.680 --> 03:17:09.360]  a whole list of kids they can go can kidnap so they move on because you know wolf see a sheep
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:12.720]  it's not a sheep they're gonna back off we're gonna skip this network break go to the bottom of the
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:18.000]  hour uh but but this is the evil we're dealing with now how so so this happened a week ago
[03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:22.720]  this happened five days before christmas i've been freaked out i've been preparing a
[03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:29.280]  have the demons come back have the demons come back no i went through the uh the back excuse me
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:33.040]  i went to the county attorney to get protection from me and my daughter because i realized how
[03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:37.440]  this that's right and now you go before the city council you go before the county commissioner
[03:17:37.440 --> 03:17:41.920]  and you go every week forever and talk about the cps and then other people will come to you
[03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:46.880]  because you'll now be a leader and you can form a coalition for with lawsuits and to drive these
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:53.120]  demons back we but that's what we need to do is organize with the love of children to battle these
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:57.120]  enemies and then you'll find cases where there's literal crackhead babies the way half of what
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:18:02.240]  they should walk away in in flee infested facilities that they won't take because they're a eugenics
[03:18:02.240 --> 03:18:08.720]  board uh what county what city are are you in ma'am um i i can give that information to you if you
[03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:13.120]  i can see the document but um i'm not comfortable giving it over the phone no i totally agree but
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:18.640]  just listen that's fine i mean i mean just in general the flame scares away wolves okay light
[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:23.120]  scares them away we don't need to say your name or anything but the whole point is we'll get in
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:27.680]  contact with you and then if you want to go public they try to persecute you i'll fly up there and the
[03:18:27.680 --> 03:18:30.800]  whole thing is i can't do this for every case because i get these calls by the hundreds of
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:35.120]  week people crying and then a lot of times the kids are dead later they kill their children well i was
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:40.000]  going to say grown men i've listened to the show for a while grown men consistently call in crying
[03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:44.080]  talking about how the cps took away their kids and did horrible things to them and every single
[03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:47.920]  time every people i couldn't help or they killed them it's because they sign the documents they
[03:18:47.920 --> 03:18:52.160]  give them and they try and roll over and they think appeasing them will work no these are
[03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:55.840]  child kidnappers that want to convince you that they're doing a good job when they are the most
[03:18:55.840 --> 03:19:01.680]  dangerous group period for children you need to fact criminal organizations exactly police when
[03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:06.160]  you aid them it's all coming down on you and your family god is going to smite you i want the police
[03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:09.760]  to know that are part of this you wonder why your lives are so hellish or why your five-year-old
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:15.360]  just got cancer it's because you did this god is going to cut you down anybody that's part of this
[03:19:15.360 --> 03:19:21.040]  is going to hell go ahead exactly and the only way to fight back with this is to use intellectual
[03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:24.960]  tactics against them nothing that's right you got to maintain i know it's hard to become
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:28.960]  even hearing about what you did handling them now what did the witch say did she say she was
[03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:34.480]  going to come back she said i'll be back in a week and a half the week and half was today
[03:19:34.480 --> 03:19:39.280]  i went to the county attorney and this woman said you won't believe what she said to me okay i went
[03:19:39.280 --> 03:19:44.320]  to her for protection under the law i wrote it all out and i said i aren't we deserve to be protected
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:48.240]  we are witnesses in a trial she's not going to protect you and her demon force go ahead
[03:19:48.800 --> 03:19:53.920]  she that's what she said she said i knew these people i showed her the awful fight they will never
[03:19:53.920 --> 03:19:59.600]  admit any of their people are bad this is the essence of tyranny exactly i freaked out i called
[03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:05.520]  the state police and i said these people i'm in litigation with the attorney well listen now that
[03:20:05.520 --> 03:20:09.200]  you've gotten on record they know it's a dirty trick they play they're all going to cover
[03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:13.920]  each other that's why they catch an officer the torpedo they let them do it that's why they do
[03:20:13.920 --> 03:20:19.280]  this because it's their thing and they may not go after her now that she has dirt she may be safe
[03:20:19.280 --> 03:20:24.080]  but she should get a real shark smart lawyer that knows how they work not some you need to get a hold
[03:20:24.080 --> 03:20:28.080]  of the homeschool legal defense guys put up the info wars articles as a link to them i want to get
[03:20:28.080 --> 03:20:32.080]  that group back on next week at least put up the info wars article about ohio to come take the
[03:20:32.080 --> 03:20:38.640]  children of of homeschoolers uh to send cps to all homes of it uh it's democrats brisket homeschooling
[03:20:38.640 --> 03:20:42.000]  parents and then go click on the link to the homeschooling defense league they have the lawyers
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:47.520]  they also dose up these kids with adhd and add drugs without any actual screening and then they
[03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:53.040]  give them more of the different types of drugs that are prescribed to treat the same thing absolutely
[03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:57.040]  man we're going to get your name and number but send all your documents and stuff to show tips
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:02.240]  and info wars dot com uh but they're really persecuting people in the south and kentucky and
[03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:07.680]  everywhere else uh now now some counties aren't run by demons you'll be in one county and isn't done
[03:21:07.680 --> 03:21:12.320]  uh because you've got a christian you know judges and and sheriffs and people that aren't demons
[03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:16.080]  i mean they're trying to take people's kids in texas for spanking them when they're not even hurt
[03:21:16.080 --> 03:21:20.640]  and the state police and others are going no that's not illegal so i mean i'm not saying they're all
[03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:25.920]  bad but they have special units we had a state senator on from georgia who called me and said
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:30.560]  i've got them i've got the documents where they're shopping for the types of kids they want federally
[03:21:30.560 --> 03:21:34.720]  and then her and her husband committed suicide and burned themselves up two days later i mean
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:38.800]  they murdered her it was found in philadelphia the same thing that they were purposefully sending
[03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:42.640]  these children to jail to have their way with them and to make money off of it for years and years
[03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:47.920]  well janet rino would go check kids out of cps she was caught by the police with an 11-year-old girl
[03:21:47.920 --> 03:21:53.680]  but rino ran off the road and was in the back seat vomiting on her she was on so many barbiturates
[03:21:53.680 --> 03:21:58.720]  and alcohol they took rino in this was she was the district attorney and then we can't even get
[03:21:58.720 --> 03:22:03.040]  past the most simple things in the news cycle right now we're still debating the smallest things
[03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:06.880]  like obama care and these are the literal demons running everything i mean it's what it is it's
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:12.720]  who usually rules it are these women and then they want to be able to go get the little kids
[03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:17.040]  for themselves and then they have pedos under them and then they've got like weird liberal socialists
[03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:21.920]  that hate you know the the the mainline textbooks that i've read on air say the families of bygone
[03:22:21.920 --> 03:22:26.000]  age we've got to eradicate it and now they're doing it so these people really believe families
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:30.160]  are bad and a lot of them were abused if they're not pedos they were abused and mentally ill
[03:22:30.160 --> 03:22:35.520]  and it's like a crazy person says you look like my cousin i don't like i'm gonna kick your butt
[03:22:36.080 --> 03:22:40.320]  and it's the same thing and they everything looks like a a nail because they got a hammer
[03:22:41.120 --> 03:22:45.760]  that's why they have over 50 turnover in cps the highest rate in government because a lot
[03:22:45.760 --> 03:22:49.200]  people get into it for the right reasons and they really want to help people because there's
[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:53.760]  some good social workers out there i've run into them for like old people and stuff like that
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:59.600]  uh but when it gets into child services folks it's it's i mean i'd say 50 demon
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:06.400]  and the other 50 mentally ill mournons or that's the percent that stays in half over half i think

[03:23:47.920 --> 03:23:52.320]  orphanages they took the kids for state training russia has almost gotten rid of that now they
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:56.720]  encourage you to have children and pay you to do it actually and tell you to spank them and uh
[03:23:56.720 --> 03:24:00.160]  everything i mean that's what i'm gonna tell you i mean that's because that's a government though
[03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:03.920]  that realizes they're gonna fully collapse if they don't get away from the eugenics well i was
[03:24:03.920 --> 03:24:08.480]  gonna say it's not that russia's even good it's just they've come to this realization that maybe
[03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:13.120]  we should return to things that actually work to build ourselves up to have ultimate power if they
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:17.280]  want to become a major world power they're gonna have to do what we did through the exactly the
[03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:24.880]  social engineers that run us are so deviant it's about screwing us up it's about in italy and in
[03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:29.360]  california letting 60 year old men grab 11 year olds out of your backyard and rape them and then
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:33.040]  it's called love go into the girls locker rooms for eight year olds now let's show the article in
[03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:38.560]  case people don't believe us yeah yeah and and and and teach five year olds how to put lipstick on
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:42.720]  in california and if you're against it you're racist and that's the people ask these questions
[03:24:42.720 --> 03:24:46.960]  they say well why would they want to destroy this nation why wouldn't we be like russia and be going
[03:24:46.960 --> 03:24:50.560]  to the gold standard be paying for children because the family is actually good and more
[03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:54.880]  population is better and has better jobs why wouldn't we want to do all those things the people in
[03:24:54.880 --> 03:25:00.400]  control are so warped and insane all they want is to destroy let's just say it the russian thugs
[03:25:00.400 --> 03:25:04.800]  that run that country like russians that's right they like russian women they like russian children
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:12.080]  they like being men and and and it's like you look at thug gangster strong men they're like angels
[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:17.840]  compared to what we have pot billied pedophile trash drinking our children's souls up and we used to
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:22.000]  have boss hogs you know around the 40s 50s maybe even into the that's what the russians are yeah
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:28.320]  they're boss hogs the the russian system right now is 1950s america and they're going to succeed
[03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:31.440]  and they're going to have a better economy they're going to dominate they're going to completely
[03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:35.360]  dominate and china is going to see them after we've built they're already doing china's already
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:39.360]  getting away from one child and trying to not destroy men now but our pedophile system build
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:44.400]  up china so we expect china to ally with these elite in the united states but china is going to
[03:25:44.400 --> 03:25:48.480]  betray the united states elite and join up with russia because it's going to be the dominant power
[03:25:48.480 --> 03:25:52.640]  and then russia and china are going to be dominating and we're going to be still here getting arrested
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:57.520]  for having children with dogs in the home and freaking out over obama care as we're completely
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:26:03.520]  obliterated economically and policy wise by absolute psycho enemies that say our children belong to us
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:08.640]  melissa harris parry licking her lips with demonic glint in her eye i mean that woman is an enemy
[03:26:08.640 --> 03:26:16.160]  witch saying our kids belong to her what a filthy piece of crap what an enemy what an enemy let me

[03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:27.040]  a world where you can't say just look at that person look how evil they are because that's
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:30.480]  even you know rude or whatever politically incorrect you could just look at that woman she
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:36.640]  looks like a scaled lizard when i think about her i just i mean all of them you can look at someone
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:41.440]  like janet and it's all about her being in power all these other narcissists trash because they're
[03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:45.760]  all weak they want to destroy what's powerful in america because they hate us because they know
[03:26:45.760 --> 03:26:51.680]  we're better than them that's what it's about it's about packs of weak people dumbasses ruling us
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:57.760]  it's just like the guy we see you parry god i pray you be brought to justice go ahead sorry
[03:26:57.760 --> 03:27:02.080]  they'll get what they want though when the united states is completely collapsed they'll revel in
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:06.000]  it and then realize they have completely failed themselves it's just like yesterday we talked
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:10.000]  to an individual from a foreign nation a third world country and he was talking about how great
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:14.480]  the united states is and how you know capitalism is amazing and all of his friends and family from
[03:27:14.480 --> 03:27:20.000]  that foreign country they hate america and they don't get it and they like socialism and he was
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:25.360]  saying how amazing this was you know back in in the 70s and 80s he was an iranian who came to
[03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:29.200]  austin and made a hundred million dollars yeah probably more than that and he was talking about
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:32.720]  how great it all was now he gives back to the community and everything like that and it's the
[03:27:32.720 --> 03:27:38.080]  real american dream meanwhile his family probably was jealous or something and hated it and hated
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:42.000]  the fact that you know that's what it is it's just like people that hate you if you're successful or
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:45.760]  you're beautiful like back when i was young and didn't you know wasn't out of shape i was really
[03:27:45.760 --> 03:27:51.120]  good-looking a movie star good-looking and and it was like other beautiful women would like me but
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:55.200]  the average person would be real mean to me i didn't figure out till later because i was good-looking
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:28:00.160]  and successful people instead of these losers instead of the losers attaching themselves to
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:03.600]  successful people and saying hey you know teach me about this stuff let's work on this together
[03:28:03.600 --> 03:28:08.400]  they just envy them and hate them and want to destroy them that's because that's that
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:12.400]  uh that's the ideology here for example that's why russia is a little bit different all the
[03:28:12.400 --> 03:28:16.640]  boss hogs and mafia they have like a kingpin and they all want to rally and get into the mafia
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:20.560]  and get in on it make all the money in the united states it's like lemmings just like killing each
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:25.200]  other over a dollar they don't want to split it up it's like a hundred million dollars they don't
[03:28:25.200 --> 03:28:29.600]  want to say hey let's all go make more money they just wanted off of themselves by doing nothing
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:33.120]  and they just want to get rid of anybody that's successful because they hate it because it means
[03:28:33.120 --> 03:28:37.040]  that they would have to do it's like a self-destruct virus has been put into the west yeah seriously
[03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:42.080]  it's it's literal mental illness there's no such thing anymore that's what michael savage says dr
[03:28:42.080 --> 03:28:47.280]  savage is that they are mentally ill and i realize that now they really are mental patients no when
[03:28:47.280 --> 03:28:50.320]  i was on his show he kept asking me you know why would they be transferring the snook it doesn't
[03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:54.560]  make any sense for these people crazy the only answer is yes i mean there's literal mental illness
[03:28:54.560 --> 03:28:58.640]  from the top to the bottom it's because the elite are so insane that the general public is now so
[03:28:58.640 --> 03:29:02.960]  insane no exactly that's how historically it works and that's why other countries they're not as
[03:29:02.960 --> 03:29:07.600]  insane in the public and you know speaking to people from you know other areas in the ukraine
[03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:12.160]  everything like that they they all say you know the united states is so strange no one has social
[03:29:12.160 --> 03:29:17.120]  ability no one can go up and talk no one can even talk now yeah no one can even talk they go out and
