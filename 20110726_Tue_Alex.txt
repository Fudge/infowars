[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:34.120]  Texas Alex Jones we are live my friends thank you for joining us it of course is
[00:34.120 --> 00:43.160]  the 26th day of July 2011 on this live Tuesday broadcast we're going to be here
[00:43.160 --> 00:50.280]  for the next three hours and joining us coming up in T-minus 30 minutes author
[00:50.280 --> 00:55.040]  researcher Jim Mars will be joining us talk about the Knights Templar and groups
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.640]  and organizations calling themselves the Knights Templar over in the UK and the
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.160]  rest of Europe and here in the United States what exactly do they stand for
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.320]  what are they promoting how does it tie in to Masonic organizations we've had
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.760]  one big shooting of course that was used to basically ban guns in the UK in
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.960]  Scotland that was tied to Masons even in the mainstream news and a reported
[01:20.960 --> 01:27.240]  cover-up the shooting in Tasmania Australia used to restrict their guns
[01:27.240 --> 01:34.520]  I was also a bizarre Masonic connection and carried out by a Mason this guy
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.480]  and there's a lot of other weird cases what's going on at these lodges well
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.880]  it's clear that they're used to set up subcults and that intelligence agencies
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.400]  love to recruit out of them because of their secret of nature normally it's
[01:50.400 --> 01:53.720]  just a good old boys club and a lot of small towns and even big cities where
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.760]  you can't get a job unless you're a Mason and then you can't ever fight any
[01:58.760 --> 02:04.520]  corruption in your area because you're sworn to your other brother Masons now
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.880]  some would argue well hey the founding fathers were Masons and I understand that
[02:08.880 --> 02:14.400]  more than half of them were and there's a wide diversity of what goes on in
[02:14.400 --> 02:21.400]  Masonic lodges and Masonic theorem and I understand that but the issue is that
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.760]  more and more I see Masonic organizations promoting global DNA databases
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.000]  police states the surveillance grid and if George Washington and Thomas
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.160]  Jefferson saw you they would basically spit in your face most of the modern
[02:39.160 --> 02:49.240]  Masons that are out there now obviously Obama and I've got quotes out of his
[02:49.240 --> 02:54.600]  speech but everybody saw it and it's really pointless and people are finally
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.720]  getting it that he was carer rising the public last night and I didn't watch the
[03:00.720 --> 03:04.680]  speech last night I watched it this morning and it was disgusting it was
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.560]  nauseating to watch the president engaged in psychological warfare operations
[03:09.560 --> 03:13.200]  against the American people and really it's a replay of what we saw in
[03:13.200 --> 03:17.280]  October of 2008 where the Congress was told there'll be blood in the streets
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.120]  martial law if you don't give unlimited trillions to the banksters and then
[03:22.120 --> 03:27.440]  Henry Paul said in front of everyone gave himself 200 was it 214 218 million
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.880]  dollars of the billions that he directed into Goldman Sachs he of course
[03:31.880 --> 03:35.440]  was the former head of Goldman Sachs and then he gave himself over 200 million
[03:35.440 --> 03:42.800]  of that illegally and Congressman Stern asked him he said and we've played this
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.560]  clip many times he said how does you give yourself a bailout and Paul started
[03:48.560 --> 03:51.640]  stuttering and bumbling couldn't believe his being asked the question and really
[03:51.640 --> 03:57.200]  couldn't talk seem like he was brain damaged a gibbering monkey or something
[03:57.200 --> 04:05.400]  and he said well I gave myself a waiver gave himself a waiver so this is the
[04:05.400 --> 04:11.080]  whole hog level of corruption we've reached even in the height of the Soviet
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.160]  corruption they didn't openly do things like this they still hit it and there
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.400]  was always purges against each other you know using the dirt on different party
[04:22.400 --> 04:28.640]  members in the Duma there in the Kremlin North Korea I guess you could say is
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.120]  this out in the open with the thieving and the stealing to where it's not even
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.720]  thieving and stealing and that's really what's happening here is that we're
[04:36.720 --> 04:42.280]  completely held hostage by a group of complete criminals who are flaunting
[04:42.280 --> 04:46.360]  their criminality in front of everyone I'm gonna be breaking this down we've
[04:46.360 --> 04:50.080]  got Alan Watt joining us as well today about a lot of different issues but
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.720]  Jim Mars coming up 30 minutes we're gonna have completely open phones in the
[04:53.720 --> 04:56.920]  second hour and we're gonna have open phones when we come back stay with us
[04:56.920 --> 05:02.720]  I'll give you the number and tell you what I want you calling about hi folks
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.320]  this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs generator now
[05:06.320 --> 05:10.520]  you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution
[05:10.520 --> 05:14.160]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.560]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[05:18.560 --> 05:23.280]  viruses the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.320]  yourself produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[05:28.320 --> 05:32.680]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[05:32.680 --> 05:36.880]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can now produce pure and
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.800]  endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs generator very easy to follow
[05:41.800 --> 05:46.480]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.400]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[05:51.400 --> 05:58.240]  technology of the Silver Lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[05:59.640 --> 06:05.200]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[06:05.200 --> 06:09.640]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything

[08:08.980 --> 08:24.040]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:24.040 --> 08:31.880]  ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the 26th day of July 2011 and we have Jim
[08:31.880 --> 08:37.560]  Mars joining us to get into the whole Norway situation I will also get into the
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.620]  economy with author and researcher Jim Mars then coming up in the last hour
[08:43.620 --> 08:48.380]  Alan Watt is going to join us on a host of issues I've been trying to get to
[08:48.380 --> 08:55.580]  this since Sunday and have never covered it I've made a few comments on it but it
[08:55.580 --> 09:00.820]  it's something that needs to be discussed in great detail and I'm going to
[09:00.820 --> 09:05.140]  do that with Alan Watt a subject we haven't really discussed with Alan but I
[09:05.140 --> 09:10.780]  know he's a great researcher so he'll be fully informed on it and give us his
[09:10.780 --> 09:16.500]  own unique perspective on things but I'm talking about a science fiction term
[09:16.500 --> 09:20.260]  because we're now not living in science fiction we're living in the science
[09:20.260 --> 09:26.740]  present of super science and here's a headline existence of God particle to be
[09:26.740 --> 09:32.580]  decided by next year the problem is CERN now won't release findings that it
[09:32.580 --> 09:37.980]  finds to be politically incorrect is the problem like it had to be leaked that
[09:37.980 --> 09:43.020]  they confirmed in tests that indeed there is solar radiation coming in that
[09:43.020 --> 09:51.060]  forms the cloud nuclei and that it's not human activity human activity doesn't
[09:51.060 --> 09:56.020]  even cover one percentage point of it it's almost entirely different particles
[09:56.020 --> 10:00.140]  from the Sun I don't need the CERN scientists to tell me that there's been
[10:00.140 --> 10:06.260]  countless studies over the last 20 years where they have in laboratories on
[10:06.260 --> 10:13.820]  aircraft in the atmosphere confirmed this processes taking place so the Sun
[10:13.820 --> 10:18.620]  doesn't just heat the earth it is showering us with just all different
[10:18.620 --> 10:23.020]  types of particles and then of course there's also micrometeorites coming in
[10:23.020 --> 10:27.980]  that also help form nuclei they estimate billions of micrometeorites coming in
[10:27.980 --> 10:35.660]  space is not empty it's full of things continuing here
[10:35.820 --> 10:43.260]  1500 human animal hybrids grown in UK labs that's part human part insect part
[10:43.260 --> 10:51.100]  human part reptile part human part fish and I've talked to scientist one of
[10:51.100 --> 10:58.540]  which is quite prominent and they were they refused to come on air about the
[10:58.540 --> 11:06.820]  human clones and having to watch them in the artificial womb tanks basically
[11:06.820 --> 11:13.500]  little children and and and to watch them attempting to nurse gulping and
[11:13.500 --> 11:23.260]  and trying to pacify themselves another computer engineer well-known
[11:23.260 --> 11:28.260]  Republican here in Texas refused to come on the show he was gonna come on and
[11:28.260 --> 11:32.300]  talk about Singapore and the different how they drug different neighborhoods
[11:32.300 --> 11:38.740]  different chemicals and biologicals to test them on people and he got scared
[11:38.740 --> 11:43.580]  won't come on but I have interviewed people doctors on air who have talked
[11:43.580 --> 11:50.540]  about the camera cows and things that are in the artificial wounds gulping and
[11:50.540 --> 11:54.900]  trying to nurse now that freaked him out in fact a guest talking about that on
[11:54.900 --> 12:00.860]  air spurred the other scientists to tell me about the human clones gulping
[12:00.860 --> 12:08.340]  gulping for milk yes we've been totally dehumanized life isn't cheap it's seen
[12:08.340 --> 12:14.620]  as garbage and trash by the psychopaths who run things and the sky is the limit
[12:14.620 --> 12:24.060]  of their depravity and their evil the sky is the limit and I quite frankly
[12:24.060 --> 12:29.700]  don't even feel worthy to be able to even impart this information to you I
[12:29.700 --> 12:39.420]  don't have the semantical lexicon I do not have the bearing every philosopher
[12:39.420 --> 12:47.620]  every leader every poet every preacher every leader everyone who feels called
[12:47.620 --> 12:56.340]  to be a servant every police officer should be spending at least 18 hours a
[12:56.340 --> 13:02.700]  day right now trying to warn people and trying to have a debate about the future
[13:02.700 --> 13:08.900]  of humanity instead we have just totally handed over all responsibility to a
[13:08.900 --> 13:16.620]  psychopathic decadent ruthless reckless ruling class who are in control of
[13:16.620 --> 13:24.540]  things but they're in control like a Japanese kamikaze pilot about to fly
[13:24.540 --> 13:31.500]  his plane into the deck of the Lexington aircraft carrier they're in
[13:31.500 --> 13:37.900]  control like that they're in control like Jim Jones followers taking the
[13:37.900 --> 13:49.500]  order to drink the grape kool-aid filled with cyanide and every instinct I've got
[13:49.500 --> 13:54.940]  tells me to shut down this entire operation or leave a skeleton crew here
[13:54.940 --> 14:03.460]  to buy a piece of property on a hilltop in Montana and to build a huge bunker
[14:03.460 --> 14:10.380]  under it and to basically broadcast from on top of a hill I don't think it's
[14:10.380 --> 14:22.420]  enough that I've just moved outside of Austin none of it's enough I mean what
[14:22.420 --> 14:27.820]  I'm getting at here is we tend to get close to a problem all of us and start
[14:27.820 --> 14:33.140]  learning to live right next to it it's like oh this watering hole has crocodiles
[14:33.140 --> 14:36.900]  in it and sure you know they eat villagers every few months but it's the
[14:36.900 --> 14:40.940]  only water so we've got to go to the waterhole that's got 20 foot long
[14:40.940 --> 14:46.180]  crocodiles in it and that's what they do in Africa they're just accustomed to
[14:46.180 --> 14:51.420]  oh yeah somebody died this week when a 15 foot cobra bit them the same thing in
[14:51.420 --> 14:57.420]  India with those gigantic king cobras 30 something feet long pump ounces of venom
[14:57.420 --> 15:02.900]  into you when they strike so I mean I get it humans are adaptive and when I was
[15:02.900 --> 15:07.900]  on a airplane flying up to be on the view and other TV programs months ago I
[15:07.900 --> 15:14.300]  was sitting up there in the first class cabin because I you know demanded ABC
[15:14.300 --> 15:18.500]  fly me up there that way they refused at first of all I'm not coming on the
[15:18.500 --> 15:21.820]  view there they said don't you want to be on the view I said no they said well
[15:21.820 --> 15:26.460]  okay thank you and they called back but side issue it's just how it's all just
[15:26.460 --> 15:30.860]  just games of bluff with all these people and I'm sitting there and I could
[15:30.860 --> 15:35.940]  kick myself cuz I wanted to remember his name and I even told Ted Anderson it
[15:35.940 --> 15:38.780]  when I landed I said don't let me forget this write this down and then Ted
[15:38.780 --> 15:43.420]  didn't write it down but he was the he was the managing director of one of the
[15:43.420 --> 15:47.900]  big three banks and he knew exactly who I was about ten minutes into talking to
[15:47.900 --> 15:52.620]  me he was coming to Austin to visit his father and his brother's dad's a former
[15:52.620 --> 15:57.340]  what Air Force General I remember all the stuff that I saw him I know who he
[15:57.340 --> 16:00.900]  was I need to go look at all the managing directors and it's one of the
[16:00.900 --> 16:05.100]  big three and about ten minutes in from taking off to Austin a flight of New
[16:05.100 --> 16:09.860]  York he realizes who he's sitting next to and he kind of pushes back and then
[16:09.860 --> 16:14.980]  wanted to stop talking to me and I said no we're gonna talk and at the end of it
[16:14.980 --> 16:20.620]  he smiled at me and he said people will put up with anything it's part of our
[16:20.620 --> 16:27.260]  adaptive process and the system uses that Jones and he was just so cold lots
[16:27.260 --> 16:34.820]  smarter than I am decided to join evil that's how these guys are you know and
[16:34.820 --> 16:38.180]  he had the perfect banker out you know the perfect suit and and you know the
[16:38.180 --> 16:41.940]  perfect black trench coat when he got up even a three-hour flight got up look
[16:41.940 --> 16:46.500]  absolutely perfect perfect you know posture everything and he was just evil
[16:46.500 --> 16:53.780]  I mean his eyes were just burning with with Machiavellian wickedness and you
[16:53.780 --> 16:58.900]  know here I am this kind of country bumpkin stock you know talking to him
[16:58.900 --> 17:03.260]  and trying to get info out of him and at the end he just looks at me and he goes
[17:03.260 --> 17:09.060]  people will muddle through anything they're adaptive and the system uses
[17:09.060 --> 17:14.660]  that against them and it's true I mean look I would tell you 15 years ago about
[17:14.660 --> 17:20.940]  human clones and they kill them supposedly before they reach term and so
[17:20.940 --> 17:26.100]  it's an abortion so it's okay and they've gotten women to sign on to have
[17:26.100 --> 17:29.860]  the clones grown in on they've they've they did they grow them in cows is their
[17:29.860 --> 17:33.820]  favorite and of course the human no it is made part cows who doesn't have rights
[17:33.820 --> 17:38.420]  but it's a human you know it's less than one tenth of one percent in the in
[17:38.420 --> 17:45.500]  the clones they admit it's less than one tenth of one percent cow and that's
[17:45.500 --> 17:49.300]  done they claim so it isn't rejected in the womb and that's part of it but they
[17:49.300 --> 17:53.740]  brag the good part is this is not a human now this is a new creature and has no
[17:53.740 --> 18:00.300]  rights can you imagine what the globalists are doing can you imagine the
[18:00.300 --> 18:03.940]  power trips they're on the fact that they're 30 years at least ahead of what
[18:03.940 --> 18:09.380]  we know about 15 years ago they admitted that what would they say five years
[18:09.380 --> 18:18.940]  before that be 20 years ago the BBC 20 years ago they had human clones and
[18:18.940 --> 18:24.780]  right around that time they get around oh we just cloned a sheep yeah it's the
[18:24.780 --> 18:31.140]  first time it's confirmed the Nazis were cloning rabbits in the late 1930s
[18:31.140 --> 18:41.180]  ladies and gentlemen it's 100% in fact I went to a NASA exhibition in Dallas when
[18:41.180 --> 18:48.020]  I was a teenager and they had sketches of Werner von Braun my mother and her
[18:48.020 --> 18:51.220]  brother my uncle were actually taken to see Werner von Braun give a speech

[18:56.300 --> 19:00.420]  was always wanted to interest them in science he was a wildcat archaeologist
[19:00.420 --> 19:08.860]  and also inventor he invented a remote control robot to to taser crowds the
[19:08.860 --> 19:15.860]  Pentagon bought it but never deployed it never mass produced it but side issue
[19:15.860 --> 19:23.700]  Werner von Braun was it 34 or his first sketches were in the 20s but in 34 he
[19:23.700 --> 19:31.060]  drawn out and actually mapped the the the design of the space shuttle that what

[24:28.140 --> 24:33.340]  bankers unlimited trillions and it's the same thing now a U.S. president is
[24:33.340 --> 24:37.340]  supposed to reassure the public and buoy confidence if they were real
[24:37.340 --> 24:42.300]  president and that's not what he did he went out there as a front man for the
[24:42.300 --> 24:46.500]  bankers to terrorize the public I've got a bunch of poll numbers here we're gonna
[24:46.500 --> 24:50.500]  cover it coming up the next hour and we're gonna open the phones up here in a
[24:50.500 --> 24:57.420]  moment for a short bit but then we've got then we've got Jim Mars coming on but
[24:57.420 --> 25:02.380]  but I I can't do justice to talking about what Obama did last night in just a
[25:02.380 --> 25:05.980]  few minutes so we're gonna cover that in the second hour but at the end of the
[25:05.980 --> 25:14.140]  day in laboratories in Tokyo Japan you know Costa Rica the United States all
[25:14.140 --> 25:19.020]  of these places they play games like oh we care about babies in there and their
[25:19.020 --> 25:23.940]  DNA and their and their stem cells so we've got laws restricting the use of
[25:23.940 --> 25:30.860]  that but if we change the DNA of a human embryo and add say fish genes or
[25:30.860 --> 25:36.740]  lizard reptile genes or amphibian frog genes to it then we can do whatever we
[25:36.740 --> 25:43.660]  want with these humanoid creatures that have feelings and are in pain and it is
[25:43.660 --> 25:49.220]  it is just demonic to the maximum and that they admitted the news oh this has
[25:49.220 --> 25:54.660]  all been kept secret from you for many years but now they want to announce that
[25:54.660 --> 26:00.740]  they've done this ladies and gentlemen if I told you the stuff I know you wouldn't
[26:00.740 --> 26:04.020]  even believe it you know what we're just gonna leave it at that we're just gonna
[26:04.020 --> 26:07.900]  leave it at that and I'll talk more about it the things I've run into the
[26:07.900 --> 26:13.220]  things I've seen in my life the people I've met the the the the the different
[26:13.220 --> 26:22.220]  folks in my family and the different things they've seen it's like that line
[26:22.220 --> 26:27.460]  from Blade Runner I've seen things you people wouldn't believe but I mean who
[26:27.460 --> 26:33.100]  would believe I saw comments that I'm lying about the 150 plus that they're
[26:33.100 --> 26:39.100]  admitting just in England of part animal part human clones
[26:39.100 --> 26:42.980]  China has announced a month ago that by next year they're gonna have on the
[26:42.980 --> 26:48.420]  market they're just embracing it all like no one else publicly human milk
[26:48.420 --> 26:55.340]  produced in cows you have any idea the ramifications of that the zoological
[26:55.340 --> 27:01.060]  cross species contamination the super viruses it probably has already given
[27:01.060 --> 27:06.140]  rise to I mean do you have any idea the hellstorm they're opening but I'll tell
[27:06.140 --> 27:09.860]  you the only reason they're now announcing all of this is because they're
[27:09.860 --> 27:15.180]  at least at least they admit 30 years ahead in their technocratic towers in
[27:15.180 --> 27:22.460]  their technological breakaway civilization reservations and so they are so
[27:22.460 --> 27:26.780]  advanced past what they're even telling us about that they feel confident they
[27:26.780 --> 27:34.100]  can control all of this well they didn't control Fukushima they stored the
[27:34.100 --> 27:38.140]  rods on top of it but then you talk to dr. Busby who was proven right on every
[27:38.140 --> 27:42.540]  front he says a lot of his colleagues believe it's being done on purpose to
[27:42.540 --> 27:46.540]  destroy human fertility and let me tell you the globalist have developed a
[27:46.540 --> 27:52.340]  system to protect their fertility from radiation they are advanced indeed they
[27:52.340 --> 27:58.780]  are powerful let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Connecticut Ryan you're on the
[27:58.780 --> 28:01.940]  air Jackie Rourke Matt will get to everybody we appreciate you we love
[28:01.940 --> 28:08.100]  you we love the fact that you care about reality and have some wish to say

[28:22.220 --> 28:28.980]  your mind I got two things on my one first of all we've had something done
[28:28.980 --> 28:33.300]  here outside of New York City I live in southern Connecticut and it's called to
[28:33.300 --> 28:38.340]  see something say something and it's about the subway is going in and out and
[28:38.340 --> 28:44.180]  it's basically saying everybody look after everybody else now what you have
[28:44.180 --> 28:50.580]  is cops looking at citizens citizens looking at cops the cops looking at
[28:50.580 --> 28:54.500]  people that work for the train it's almost like a paranoid environment and
[28:54.500 --> 28:57.700]  then once they've got that in place it started in New York it's gone nationwide
[28:57.700 --> 29:01.820]  the last year then they flip it okay we're looking for Muslims though we
[29:01.820 --> 29:04.700]  don't say that but that's who we're really looking for we're all in the same
[29:04.700 --> 29:09.460]  team hey you know everything's fine let's harass this black person and then
[29:09.460 --> 29:13.420]  now they flip it oh my gosh the white terrorist are everywhere and and who are
[29:13.420 --> 29:17.260]  they in the secret training manuals returning veterans oh I forgot retired
[29:17.260 --> 29:22.460]  police that a tyranny always goes after its veterans and it's retired police

[29:26.460 --> 29:29.940]  back to you when Jim Mars leaves and I promise it's open phones in the second
[29:29.940 --> 29:36.100]  hour and I'm gonna get into the whole debt limit debacle the Democrats are
[29:36.100 --> 29:41.300]  lying the Republicans are lying and Ron Paul the Communist Chinese are telling
[29:41.300 --> 29:47.220]  the truth they've already defaulted all right well I'll explain but just stay

[30:07.340 --> 30:11.580]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[30:11.580 --> 30:15.460]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[30:15.460 --> 30:19.140]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.140 --> 30:23.700]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.700 --> 30:28.340]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[30:28.340 --> 30:32.100]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[30:32.100 --> 30:35.540]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[36:04.100 --> 36:07.340]  give the bankers the trillions they want or will implode you give them the
[36:07.340 --> 36:11.700]  trillions okay that didn't fix it give us trillions more okay give us trillions

[36:40.300 --> 36:44.820]  body I had a forced inoculations and DNA samples to get driver's license here
[36:44.820 --> 36:48.700]  it is Rand corporation and what they come up with gets put into policy oh
[36:48.700 --> 36:52.940]  that nut Alex keeps saying we're gonna have troops on the streets of America
[36:52.940 --> 36:58.460]  and they just slowly acclimate you until now well of course there's troops I
[36:58.460 --> 37:07.780]  mean the white al-Qaeda is gonna get us so we're gonna be getting into that news
[37:07.780 --> 37:12.020]  clip from that and going over some of the articles that cover it because I know
[37:12.020 --> 37:16.300]  for our longtime listeners this is ancient news for you I mean I didn't
[37:16.300 --> 37:20.420]  even need to read a rand corporation document 12 13 14 years ago I went to a
[37:20.420 --> 37:24.100]  lot of urban warfare drills and witnessed the military training to take
[37:24.100 --> 37:28.060]  your guns and put you in camp some shot video of it and people couldn't believe
[37:28.060 --> 37:37.700]  it then so they said police state 2000 is actors yes the ships I hired them the
[37:37.700 --> 37:41.940]  Coronado I hired the thousands of troops and foreign troops to come into
[37:41.940 --> 37:46.900]  Oakland and do mock takeover the city yes it's all fake no it was real but
[37:46.900 --> 37:50.580]  people couldn't believe it they couldn't believe it that I had the video of the
[37:50.580 --> 37:57.020]  Marines admitting it and so they just said it was fake you see is it's just
[37:57.020 --> 38:01.340]  incredible okay I want to go to Jim Mars with us a little bit in the next hour
[38:01.340 --> 38:09.020]  that I promise I'm going right to your calls and the whole situation with the
[38:09.020 --> 38:13.340]  whole situation with Obama last night up there terrorizing the public and see
[38:13.340 --> 38:17.980]  his approval rating plunged and his and his approval rating with his with his
[38:17.980 --> 38:21.340]  supporters plunge because they thought their cars would fill themselves up with
[38:21.340 --> 38:25.100]  gas once he was in office that houses were gonna be free I mean remember
[38:25.100 --> 38:30.300]  men Obama played along with that now he's coming and saying hey you do we say
[38:30.300 --> 38:33.020]  or there's gonna be a depression people say well that hurt the economy I'm doing
[38:33.020 --> 38:38.420]  that he's terrorizing folks that's his job is to destroy the economy so the
[38:38.420 --> 38:41.420]  bankers can buy it up and they're gonna do it after they get a couple more
[38:41.420 --> 38:45.460]  bailouts and a couple more debt ceilings but they're not done you know
[38:45.460 --> 38:48.740]  we're like a beautiful woman who's been hoared out for five years and now is
[38:48.740 --> 38:52.140]  you know really run down the cigarette burns but there you could she's not a
[38:52.140 --> 38:57.700]  thousand dollar a night hooker she's now a five dollar five dollar you know in
[38:57.700 --> 39:01.140]  the park hooker but they're not done now they're later they're gonna walk us
[39:01.140 --> 39:06.100]  down the waterfront and shoot us in the back of the head okay they got some
[39:06.100 --> 39:13.620]  more pimping to do but see Obama's now being hated Obama's now being decried but
[39:13.620 --> 39:18.660]  that's his job is to be hated now and to take the blame see and then they're
[39:18.660 --> 39:22.020]  gonna put another shill up there for you to hate for four years and then they'll
[39:22.020 --> 39:24.980]  betray you but it'll be okay because they'll get us all fighting with each
[39:24.980 --> 39:30.340]  other let's go to Jim Mars who of course was a Fort Worth Star Telegram crime
[39:30.340 --> 39:35.420]  writer researcher out there driving around cover in the real world talk
[39:35.420 --> 39:39.420]  about street smarts he's the first person to actually teach a university level
[39:39.420 --> 39:44.580]  course on the JFK assassination from the congressional perspective that it was a
[39:44.580 --> 39:49.860]  government conspiracy he of course was one of the main sources for Oliver
[39:49.860 --> 39:55.940]  Stone's film JFK and worked on that film and it just goes on and on from there
[39:55.940 --> 39:59.580]  he's a member of scholars 9-11 truth and he's written a bunch of best-selling
[39:59.580 --> 40:02.900]  books the trillion-dollar conspiracy rise of the fourth right the war on
[40:02.900 --> 40:06.660]  freedom Jim Mars dot com again I'm Alex Jones have just joined us with him full
[40:06.660 --> 40:10.540]  wars dot com and I wanted to get Jim on is he's written a lot about the Knights
[40:10.540 --> 40:14.140]  Templar and for those that don't know there are groups associated with Knights
[40:14.140 --> 40:19.340]  Templar Rose accrucian slash Illuminati all over Europe a lot of wealthy rich
[40:19.340 --> 40:23.060]  people are involved it's in the news that he was at meetings with very wealthy
[40:23.060 --> 40:28.180]  people now they had a show on sky television making fun of yours truly a
[40:28.180 --> 40:34.260]  few years ago I forget that host name Andy something and they quote go interview
[40:34.260 --> 40:38.300]  a member of the Knights Templars and then and then he swears he's gonna let him
[40:38.300 --> 40:42.500]  meet with the Knights Templar and then he arrives and he's the Knights Templar but
[40:42.500 --> 40:47.580]  so so it's all about magic but but not real magic it's about conning you slide
[40:47.580 --> 40:54.380]  of hand manipulating manipulating the members and you know convincing people
[40:54.380 --> 41:01.140]  alike Bravik to go out and do this and feel like he's a big hero when you can
[41:01.140 --> 41:05.180]  just look in his eyes he's completely insane and he admits all these rich
[41:05.180 --> 41:08.500]  powerful people in government helped him yeah they're gonna help send you right
[41:08.500 --> 41:13.220]  to prison pal but let's go to Jim Mars and talk about the Illuminati the
[41:13.220 --> 41:19.540]  Templars the Friday 13th you know all these terms we have come from come from
[41:19.540 --> 41:24.620]  these groups and and the Crusades and all of this indelible mark on our
[41:24.620 --> 41:29.260]  current situation Jim Mars good to have you here hey Alex good to be with you
[41:29.260 --> 41:36.560]  it's interesting you hear you say that you now understand that they start off
[41:36.560 --> 41:40.820]  calling you a kook and then after a while they everybody finds out that
[41:40.820 --> 41:44.900]  everything you said it was absolutely true but but you're still a kook right
[41:44.900 --> 41:49.780]  yes well welcome to the society because I've been at it for about 50 years now
[41:49.780 --> 41:57.460]  and everything I've ever said has come true but I'm still the kook exactly I
[41:57.460 --> 42:03.820]  mean oh Alex said by silver on his $5 an ounce it's now 42 he's evil Alex said
[42:03.820 --> 42:09.620]  by gold at 300 and something you know now it's 1600 plus he is bad I am I mean
[42:09.620 --> 42:16.420]  literally all over the web I am evil I am evil for being right sorry you know
[42:16.420 --> 42:21.300]  George Orwell said that telling the truth in a dishonest society is a
[42:21.300 --> 42:28.580]  revolutionary act so yeah you're pretty radical okay hey Jim I don't even know
[42:28.580 --> 42:32.140]  your view on this your analysis we've been having different perspectives from
[42:32.140 --> 42:37.860]  different people dr. Steve Pacinic dr. Tarpley different views yesterday and
[42:37.860 --> 42:41.580]  some people are like well why did you have Pacinic on of a disagree with you
[42:41.580 --> 42:44.540]  because I wanted to hear a different perspective and quite frankly I didn't
[42:44.540 --> 42:49.020]  know his view I called him cold game on and I would have done it over again but
[42:49.020 --> 42:51.860]  but so I don't know your view on the shooter I want to get into it and then
[42:51.860 --> 42:56.140]  some of the history of the Knights Templar okay well number one I'm not
[42:56.140 --> 43:02.540]  gonna stick my neck out and say that a good old Anders it was one thing or
[43:02.540 --> 43:07.660]  another because it's too fresh and information is still rolling in but what
[43:07.660 --> 43:14.700]  I will say is we see I see the same commonality of contradictions and
[43:14.700 --> 43:20.140]  questions that seem to crop up in all of these false flag operation first they
[43:20.140 --> 43:25.140]  say oh he's you know it first immediately they say oh it's Alcada and
[43:25.140 --> 43:28.740]  then we find out Alcada apparently ain't got anything to do with it and yet
[43:28.740 --> 43:32.180]  that was all over the news that's gonna stick in a lot of people's minds and
[43:32.180 --> 43:37.420]  then we're told oh no he's just a lone nut even though initial reports that they
[43:37.420 --> 43:43.020]  had arrested someone else and you know this is again because I live through and
[43:43.020 --> 43:47.940]  have covered so extensively the Kennedy assassination there was probably two
[43:47.940 --> 43:52.260]  dozen people arrested in around D. Lee Plaza at the time the Kennedy
[43:52.260 --> 43:56.980]  assassination but they came back later on and admitted that and said yes we
[43:56.980 --> 44:00.500]  arrested all these people for questioning and no they didn't have
[44:00.500 --> 44:04.740]  anything to do with it we let them go the thing that gets me is on this thing
[44:04.740 --> 44:09.300]  first initial reports say they arrested the second person and then this news
[44:09.300 --> 44:13.860]  drops from the media and then they're acting like no there's nobody else
[44:13.860 --> 44:19.540]  arrested you know so I think we see the same types of methodology going on here
[44:19.540 --> 44:25.020]  there and of course the thing that still strikes me is is that Brevis goes into
[44:25.020 --> 44:30.380]  court admits that he was there at the bombing admits participating in the
[44:30.380 --> 44:35.540]  island shooting and then yet he please not guilty and the whole time he's calm
[44:35.540 --> 44:42.260]  relaxed you know this to me smacks of mind control and you know again by the
[44:42.260 --> 44:47.100]  way just breaking it's now admitted he was hopped up on all sorts of drugs just
[44:47.100 --> 44:54.340]  like the Mumbai attacks later turned out led by a quote CIA asset Chicago Tribune
[44:54.340 --> 45:01.140]  and of course blonde haired over there in Mumbai this is the al-Qaeda guys and
[45:01.140 --> 45:04.580]  they just find one patsy you know who was drug completely out of his mind on
[45:04.580 --> 45:10.380]  lsd pcp catamine another drug sorry go ahead no that's exactly right it's like
[45:10.380 --> 45:14.860]  the Robert Kennedy assassination the girl the public at our address there's
[45:14.860 --> 45:18.780]  always seems like there's always somebody around acting as a handler and of
[45:18.780 --> 45:23.060]  course when the news comes out that the two things that strike me is number one
[45:23.060 --> 45:31.460]  he he was in meetings with prominent business leaders and political leaders
[45:31.460 --> 45:38.100]  and that also that apparently the police had him identified before you know
[45:38.100 --> 45:42.340]  before they ever caught anybody before anybody even actually knew what was
[45:42.340 --> 45:47.180]  going on so I just see all these telltale tracks that tell me there's more to
[45:47.180 --> 45:52.260]  this story than what we're being told and of course you and I both Alex we we
[45:52.260 --> 45:58.580]  tend to deal in the macro geopolitical scene and I think it does fit in and
[45:58.580 --> 46:03.100]  then when he starts talking about being a member of the night's temper of course
[46:03.100 --> 46:08.460]  that that throws it into a whole new level because you have to understand
[46:08.460 --> 46:16.740]  that when we start talking about masonic orders there are two very distinct
[46:16.740 --> 46:23.340]  orders the American Premationary and then European Premationary American
[46:23.340 --> 46:28.660]  Premationary pretty well got decimated back in the early 1800s when the third
[46:28.660 --> 46:36.540]  the first third party in America was the anti-masonic party and they got into
[46:36.540 --> 46:42.180]  such ill repute that it took them about a hundred years to rebuild and when they
[46:42.180 --> 46:47.580]  did they they are mostly now into very you know into benevolent activity such
[46:47.580 --> 46:54.180]  as burn centers etc and so I think most American Freemasons are probably just
[46:54.180 --> 46:58.380]  good old boys you know trying to make some business contacts and trying to do
[46:58.380 --> 47:03.620]  some good this is very different from the European Premationary which came
[47:03.620 --> 47:09.700]  under the control of the Illuminati back in 1782 at the time of the Billum
[47:09.700 --> 47:15.300]  Spa conference when Freemason European Freemasonry was infiltrated then
[47:15.300 --> 47:20.140]  basically taken over by the Illuminati and of course then you understand that
[47:20.140 --> 47:26.180]  Freemasonry itself was a creation of the old night's tempers which had become
[47:26.180 --> 47:38.420]  such a powerful wealthy and controlling organization that and the Pope actually
[47:38.420 --> 47:44.100]  had to move against them and and try to eradicate them in fact most of what we
[47:44.100 --> 47:49.500]  know about the night's temper is simply from the anti-temperate propaganda put
[47:49.500 --> 47:55.700]  out by the church and so see history is always with us and now here we have this
[47:55.700 --> 48:02.620]  latest news item and it ties right into this ancient society and of course then
[48:02.620 --> 48:05.940]  where did the night's tempers claim that they got all their knowledge and
[48:05.940 --> 48:11.220]  their information from the secrets of King Solomon and exact from their
[48:11.220 --> 48:15.900]  conquering of course of Jerusalem and claiming that they may have actually
[48:15.900 --> 48:20.220]  dug up the Ark of the Covenant and buried it somewhere Holy Grail all of
[48:20.220 --> 48:23.980]  this myth but the Holy Grail it turns out really is just their their their
[48:23.980 --> 48:28.540]  occultic knowledge and information and then of course tell folks about Friday
[48:28.540 --> 48:33.420]  13th that's when they had the big purge and killed a lot of them and then they
[48:33.420 --> 48:37.220]  were the remnants ran with a bunch of their loot to Scotland and then you
[48:37.220 --> 48:42.060]  see England becoming a new power base that's exactly right in fact a lot of
[48:42.060 --> 48:48.180]  people have seen the Mel Gibson movie Braveheart that the big battle battle
[48:48.180 --> 48:53.500]  there was the battle of Brock Park burn which was what freed Scotland from
[48:53.500 --> 48:59.980]  English tyranny and it's an interesting thing to study because as you say that
[48:59.980 --> 49:06.100]  the night's tempers had fled Europe in the wake of their the attack on them by
[49:06.100 --> 49:12.180]  the French King and the Pope and yet on the battle of Brock Park burn they
[49:12.180 --> 49:17.380]  British had them outnumbered and basically had almost carried the day
[49:17.380 --> 49:24.140]  when suddenly a new contingent arrived on the field and by many accounts this
[49:24.140 --> 49:30.100]  was night's tempers who were basically the Waffin SS of their day they were
[49:30.100 --> 49:35.860]  greatly feared and were a tremendous military order and force and they showed
[49:35.860 --> 49:42.260]  up and suddenly the English turn tail started running and the King you know
[49:42.260 --> 49:46.940]  who was left standing there so he turned and ran to it was the do sex so the
[49:46.940 --> 49:51.260]  Templars were the that you know the hero that comes in out of the blue right at
[49:51.260 --> 49:56.900]  the moment they're needed right exactly and this seems to be part of their
[49:56.900 --> 50:03.100]  forte right up until the day and so all I could say is for the for the listeners
[50:03.100 --> 50:09.460]  is just keep an open mind keep in mind how often you've been lied to and just
[50:09.460 --> 50:16.100]  hang on and don't don't allow them to use this as a further mechanism to
[50:16.100 --> 50:21.620]  destroy your liberties and put their hand further down your pants well
[50:21.620 --> 50:26.060]  absolutely they're using it it's all over the news to go after nationalist
[50:26.060 --> 50:29.780]  parties parties that don't want open borders and when what the political
[50:29.780 --> 50:33.260]  classes are doing is they bring in foreigners who could be assimilated and
[50:33.260 --> 50:40.940]  be good folks but they're turned into political special interests against the
[50:40.940 --> 50:45.340]  people that originally you know were in the area and the older political systems
[50:45.340 --> 50:49.460]  that were hard-won liberties and freedoms across the board the big
[50:49.460 --> 50:56.380]  foundations financed their taxpayer money the immigrant hordes and then turn
[50:56.380 --> 51:01.340]  them into a political weapon we'll be right back stay with us attention
[51:01.340 --> 51:05.220]  gardeners this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just
[51:05.220 --> 51:08.980]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's
[51:08.980 --> 51:12.340]  called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[51:12.340 --> 51:16.180]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and
[51:16.180 --> 51:19.300]  like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
[51:19.300 --> 51:23.420]  self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral
[51:23.420 --> 51:27.020]  uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in
[51:27.020 --> 51:30.220]  minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the
[51:30.220 --> 51:33.500]  capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[51:33.500 --> 51:36.380]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables

[54:02.340 --> 54:09.620]  you try you can't stop us now and again we were getting the immigration issue
[54:09.620 --> 54:14.420]  this has been to demonize anybody who's not for totally open borders take the
[54:14.420 --> 54:18.660]  United States the Ford Foundation brings in millions of illegals they have
[54:18.660 --> 54:24.200]  millions and millions more children and then an American flag at a public
[54:24.200 --> 54:28.740]  school in Texas or California is so evil that you have to take the American
[54:28.740 --> 54:33.100]  flag off I mean that's on record and I didn't mean to get off into that area but
[54:33.100 --> 54:37.460]  during the break I was talking to Jim and he gave us a statistic give us that
[54:37.460 --> 54:40.140]  number Jim
[54:40.420 --> 54:48.860]  in 2010 there were 4.2 million Mexicans emigrated into the United States Jim start
[54:48.860 --> 54:52.180]  over we we didn't have you faded up start the statistic over again okay
[54:52.180 --> 54:59.620]  between 2000 and 2010 4.2 million Mexicans emigrated in the United States
[54:59.620 --> 55:04.060]  doesn't really specify whether this was legal immigration or illegal
[55:04.060 --> 55:09.460]  immigration but the point is that in that same 10-year time period there were
[55:09.460 --> 55:15.420]  seven point two million babies born to these Mexicans living in the United
[55:15.420 --> 55:23.020]  States and if they're legal fine but the problem is when you open the immigration
[55:23.020 --> 55:29.580]  floodgates wide then what was once a reasonably homogenous society that
[55:29.580 --> 55:35.380]  becomes fragmented and then you have these calls you know for you know raise
[55:35.380 --> 55:41.540]  the Mexican flag or raise the some other flag and and this is this this
[55:41.540 --> 55:47.980]  completely destroys the homogenous well that's what the globalists want Jim as
[55:47.980 --> 55:52.940]  you know but that's the plan well I mean they admit they admit they admit that
[55:52.940 --> 56:00.060]  that's the plan and you know to expand on that the illegals are proud of Mexico
[56:00.060 --> 56:05.140]  that's the majority and you know just like at the soccer game in southern
[56:05.140 --> 56:11.180]  California even the 80% of the people cheered you know the Mexican team and
[56:11.180 --> 56:16.380]  booed during the Star Spangled Banner yeah but see this is just totally out of
[56:16.380 --> 56:21.500]  whack let's you know let's go back and look at the are all of America except
[56:21.500 --> 56:25.660]  for the natives of course our immigrants welcome all of us came from
[56:25.660 --> 56:32.100]  somewhere else but in the great immigration thrust of the late 1800s
[56:32.100 --> 56:37.500]  you had people come from Poland and Germany and Italy and you know all these
[56:37.500 --> 56:41.660]  countries and they were proud of their heritage they were proud of their country
[56:41.660 --> 56:46.740]  being proud of heritage is good but then hating America out of their country but
[56:46.740 --> 56:51.220]  if you're gonna come to America you need to do like the immigrants of the 1800s
[56:51.220 --> 56:56.700]  you need to assimilate you need to learn the language in fact so many people
[56:56.700 --> 57:00.620]  particularly from Eastern Europe would come over here and they'd have these
[57:00.620 --> 57:07.260]  unpronounceable names you know Polish and Czech and all like that and so they
[57:07.260 --> 57:12.260]  changed their name and then they pledged to be good Americans and and in World
[57:12.260 --> 57:17.340]  War two you had Japanese Americans you had German Americans Italian Americans
[57:17.340 --> 57:22.580]  fighting a tooth and toenail along with everybody else these are Americans okay
[57:22.580 --> 57:26.860]  that nobody said you're supposed to come to this country ask for all the
[57:26.860 --> 57:31.840]  benefits of being American and then spit on the flag and and say that your
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.580]  flag needs to be raised higher than the United States well look Jim you're
[57:36.580 --> 57:40.740]  right well said it's national suicide but that's the issue it is the Ford
[57:40.740 --> 57:45.140]  Foundation it is the US government they are globalist they want to break down
[57:45.140 --> 57:49.540]  our sovereignty so they're importing a very nationalistic group in telling
[57:49.540 --> 57:54.180]  Americans not to be nationalistic so they can later break up the country and
[57:54.180 --> 57:58.100]  that is the essence of globalism I want to come back for five more minutes with
[57:58.100 --> 58:01.460]  you Jim and get back into Knights Templars what do you make of the news
[58:01.460 --> 58:06.660]  reports that he was on drugs and that he was meeting with a quote powerful
[58:06.660 --> 58:10.980]  people in England well I think that coupled with the idea that the police
[58:10.980 --> 58:18.940]  knew who he was even before the gun smoke it settled tells tells me that there
[58:18.940 --> 58:25.100]  is an underlying story here the drug thing of course this is something I've
[58:25.100 --> 58:29.740]  been screaming about for years one thing that everyone is sincerely concerned
[58:29.740 --> 58:33.860]  about are these school shooting and yet when you go back and study it they're
[58:33.860 --> 58:37.420]  almost stay there let's talk about school shootings we're back in one minute

[59:49.340 --> 1:00:06.380]  Alex waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[1:00:06.380 --> 1:00:13.580]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:13.580 --> 1:00:23.380]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:23.380 --> 1:00:29.660]  you know geeks I don't mean the popular definition of a geek tonight with
[1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:36.660]  broken spectacles on with a pocket protector but real geeks or people that
[1:00:36.660 --> 1:00:43.740]  fares would bite the heads off of chickens and things and do other demeaning
[1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:48.460]  things to themselves so that other people watching it could feel good about
[1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:55.380]  themselves Glenn Beck is a geek you know he came out and said that the
[1:00:55.380 --> 1:01:01.860]  teenagers that were killed he compared them to Hitler youth he said that they
[1:01:01.860 --> 1:01:06.500]  had disturbing similarities the Nazi party's notorious juvenile wing and I'm
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:11.180]  seeing some of this out there with the mainline neocons almost I see the
[1:01:11.180 --> 1:01:18.380]  comments praising this shooter Jim Mars I mean this is absolutely despicable I
[1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:21.980]  mean this guy really shows us who he is and I don't want to get into a Glenn
[1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:26.500]  Beck bashing fest it's just that he does this to just get attention but I'm
[1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:33.020]  seeing other neocons embracing Bravic what's your view of that right well you
[1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:38.180]  know what actually and I think it's good that you're focusing on this Norway
[1:01:38.180 --> 1:01:44.300]  incident because I think this is a microcosm of the ideological struggle
[1:01:44.300 --> 1:01:48.940]  it's going on today you know and of course they try to keep everybody
[1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:54.100]  separated and you know you've got the Christian right allied with the Zionist
[1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:58.860]  against the Muslims against the progressives and yet you know there's
[1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:02.860]  threads of truth all the way through there and but when you try to unravel
[1:02:02.860 --> 1:02:08.860]  that and try to tell the truth then you know you you end up you know being
[1:02:08.860 --> 1:02:17.380]  thrown into one category another in styles and extremists they they I don't
[1:02:17.380 --> 1:02:22.180]  know is we need to just watch this carefully and start separating the fact
[1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:25.700]  from the fiction but you can see the spin machines are already in the high
[1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:32.620]  gear well you're right briefly getting into drugs and and you're talking about
[1:02:32.620 --> 1:02:36.380]  school shootings right this is the subject of the course of concern to
[1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:41.980]  everybody as well it should be and yet what I found out in and once you start
[1:02:41.980 --> 1:02:46.420]  digging into it is that virtually every single school shooter and this includes
[1:02:46.420 --> 1:02:53.860]  the the rise in teen suicide involves psychotropic drugs and of course the mass
[1:02:53.860 --> 1:02:57.580]  media the corporate media will never tell you this because they don't want to
[1:02:57.580 --> 1:03:02.700]  antagonize one of their largest advertisers but the only reason I can't
[1:03:02.700 --> 1:03:08.940]  say that every single school shooter was involved with these psychiatric drugs
[1:03:08.940 --> 1:03:15.820]  is the fact that they have hidden away blocked and censored some of their
[1:03:15.820 --> 1:03:21.180]  medical records such as Cho the gunman at Virginia Tech but we were told in
[1:03:21.180 --> 1:03:25.140]  Cho's case that he was under psychiatric treatment which means
[1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:29.700]  undoubtedly he was probably being given psychiatric drugs but we don't know
[1:03:29.700 --> 1:03:32.860]  that for certain because they've sequestered his medical record and now
[1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:36.900]  the Norway shooter was hopped up on a bunch of stuff exactly that seems to
[1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:42.020]  be coming out too and of course you realize back at first this year the
[1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:47.660]  leading cause of death in the US military was not war related it was
[1:03:47.660 --> 1:03:52.020]  suicide and that was because they're all being medicated with these
[1:03:52.020 --> 1:04:00.580]  psychiatric drugs well obviously they're being medicated and then the
[1:04:00.580 --> 1:04:05.380]  psychiatric drugs make a more suggestible also the prozac class drugs
[1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:10.500]  destroy your inhibition and that's why every mother you hear about killing
[1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:14.620]  their little kids is always on these drugs right they're always involved and
[1:04:14.620 --> 1:04:19.700]  by the way have you ever thought about this Alex if you want to be doled down
[1:04:19.700 --> 1:04:27.100]  and take chemicals to get through the day then you want some prozac okay which
[1:04:27.100 --> 1:04:30.740]  by the way the scientific name is fluoroxane the technical name
[1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:36.220]  fluoroxane because it's predominantly fluoride but now consider that so
[1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:40.860]  consider this if you want to take prozac you got to go to a licensed
[1:04:40.860 --> 1:04:44.300]  position you have to get a prescription so that you can get this
[1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:50.940]  fluoride filled drug and yet if you live in two-thirds of the United States where
[1:04:50.940 --> 1:04:56.260]  they fluoridate the water you have non-medical well said all right and do
[1:04:56.260 --> 1:05:01.940]  your drinking Jim Mars dot com thank you Jim very well said when you're out on

[1:06:22.340 --> 1:06:26.300]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:30.460]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[1:06:30.460 --> 1:06:34.420]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:06:34.420 --> 1:06:38.580]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[1:09:01.820 --> 1:09:07.140]  devaluing the dollar that's what this signifies but it kills it over a few
[1:09:07.140 --> 1:09:11.900]  years it doesn't bring it all to an abrupt halt and in the process of
[1:09:11.900 --> 1:09:15.980]  killing the dollar the central banks transfer more of the economy over to
[1:09:15.980 --> 1:09:21.500]  themselves they create the derivative black hole to wreck the real economy and
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:25.460]  then consolidate it and so we're gonna be getting into that we're gonna be
[1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:31.420]  getting into the Dream Act as America goes bankrupt California moves to give
[1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:40.020]  free tuition to the illegal aliens I mean idiot as the state is completely
[1:09:40.020 --> 1:09:45.260]  bankrupt as carbon tax is going to affect this is the system you're like
[1:09:45.260 --> 1:09:52.020]  but that wrecks California they want to wreck it they want to wreck it okay let's
[1:09:52.020 --> 1:09:56.340]  go to Peter in Switzerland you're on the air thanks for holding yeah hi Alex
[1:09:56.340 --> 1:10:03.980]  welcome point is that after the events in Norway one of the first things that
[1:10:03.980 --> 1:10:08.420]  myself and it's funny speaking with colleagues here Swiss was saying my god
[1:10:08.420 --> 1:10:13.860]  this could happen here too the Swiss are also not in the EU also are not helping
[1:10:13.860 --> 1:10:21.340]  out with the Greek bailouts and it's a pretty much an open society here now
[1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:25.500]  are the Swiss you're talking to having any suspicions I mean the good news
[1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:30.140]  about Switzerland is you've got so many guns that he would have to find an
[1:10:30.140 --> 1:10:37.980]  island or a victim disarmament zone so that they could do this I mean Norway it
[1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:43.460]  turns out has a lot more guns per capita it's the 11th most going on gun
[1:10:43.460 --> 1:10:47.460]  owning country in the world though they have a lot of restrictions people still
[1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:50.900]  have guns so he had to go find a political island where they wouldn't
[1:10:50.900 --> 1:10:55.620]  allow guns to protect the political ruling class to be able to carry this
[1:10:55.620 --> 1:11:02.300]  out evidence how lack of guns creates a zone where these type of tragic events
[1:11:02.300 --> 1:11:05.660]  can take place I mean somebody comes around here want to do a mass shooting
[1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:09.500]  they're going to be met by people that work here that are CHL holders and
[1:11:09.500 --> 1:11:14.980]  they're going to be met by yours truly and so that it's not going to happen okay
[1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:18.540]  two other quick points but I'm asking you a question I want to hear your points
[1:11:18.540 --> 1:11:23.860]  but I mean what are the Swiss saying well I mean it's open here anybody can
[1:11:23.860 --> 1:11:27.860]  drive a truck right in front of the the parliament building here I mean it's
[1:11:27.860 --> 1:11:33.660]  completely open yeah Texas had that until just a few years ago now they got
[1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:37.980]  metal detectors in you can't drive your car onto the Capitol and then if terrorists
[1:11:37.980 --> 1:11:41.660]  bomb the street down the road will we then shut down the streets themselves
[1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:45.540]  will we be like North Korea where the entire political district is barbed wire
[1:11:45.540 --> 1:11:49.620]  yes it's called Homeland Security it's called TSA go ahead and make your point
[1:11:49.620 --> 1:11:55.140]  sorry okay other couple points price of gold continues to go up in dollars in
[1:11:55.140 --> 1:11:59.700]  Swiss francs if you take a look at the kilogram price in Swiss Frank's over the
[1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:06.460]  last six months it's been flat yeah so this is this is directly having to do
[1:12:06.460 --> 1:12:11.820]  with the devalued direct devaluation of the u.s. dollar against foreign
[1:12:11.820 --> 1:12:19.700]  currencies you're absolutely right and now gold today is at one thousand six
[1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:25.220]  hundred and fourteen dollars and eighty cents and you're absolutely right in fact
[1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:30.700]  tracking that gold is flat with the Swiss Frank gold is flat in the few other
[1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:35.460]  countries that are sovereign and have stable currencies because your country
[1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:40.260]  is not run by the globalists it's run by the Swiss people who the system is
[1:12:40.260 --> 1:12:45.780]  trying to be guile into joining the EU like Ireland did notice how as soon as
[1:12:45.780 --> 1:12:49.180]  Ireland entered they were suddenly went from you know the fastest growing and
[1:12:49.180 --> 1:12:53.500]  best country in Europe after Switzerland to completely imploding overnight
[1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:57.500]  because they signed a contract to allow the central banks to take them over
[1:12:57.500 --> 1:13:02.340]  they literally agreed to let the vampire in their front door so of course you
[1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:05.940]  know he snuck in at night and sucked them dry that's what vampires do it's
[1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:09.940]  like the story of the frog and the scorpion and the scorpion comes over
[1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:16.220]  the frog and says well you give me a ride across the the river to the other
[1:13:16.220 --> 1:13:19.380]  side and the frog said no you're a scorpion you'll sting me the scorpion
[1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:22.940]  said no I promise I won't just give me a ride so the frog gives a scorpion the
[1:13:22.940 --> 1:13:27.300]  ride they get over the other side and the scorpion jumps off stings the frog
[1:13:27.300 --> 1:13:31.980]  the frog rolls over in pain says you you killed me you know why did you do that
[1:13:31.980 --> 1:13:36.540]  he said I'm a scorpion and you know people need to grow up and realize this
[1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:41.020]  and they could go in there like the media is like we don't know why oil prices
[1:13:41.020 --> 1:13:45.180]  are going up it must be the Maribs we don't know why gold prices and food
[1:13:45.180 --> 1:13:48.100]  prices are going up and then and then the government says well actually
[1:13:48.100 --> 1:13:52.620]  commodities aren't going up there there's no inflation would just some
[1:13:52.620 --> 1:13:58.460]  more lies more just brazen ridiculous stalling while they looted seven ways
[1:13:58.460 --> 1:14:06.020]  from Sunday and you go to look at the Swiss Frank gold is flat gold is flat
[1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:10.820]  because gold hasn't gone up in prices gas hasn't but by the way it's not just
[1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:17.580]  gold and in oil stock markets all these idiots that go well yeah the
[1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:21.700]  economy's in bad shape but the stock market's been going up of course the
[1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:27.500]  stock market goes up because it takes more dollars and and still the world
[1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:31.220]  reserve currency to be denominated into whatever currency you're buying stock
[1:14:31.220 --> 1:14:36.540]  with to buy the stock the stock hasn't gone up it's it being inflated because
[1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:41.000]  it's a digital currency as well at the end of the day anything else caller from
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:47.140]  Switzerland yes last point a number of Swiss banks are announcing conference
[1:14:47.140 --> 1:14:54.260]  calls for their clients on August 2nd having to do with the potential collapse
[1:14:54.260 --> 1:15:00.740]  of the US dollar if there's no solution with increasing the number of dollars
[1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:05.860]  being printed absolutely good point appreciate your call by dad had a
[1:15:05.860 --> 1:15:11.060]  patient come in who he's known for more than a decade who works at the IRS here
[1:15:11.060 --> 1:15:17.660]  in South Austin and they've been told that they're going to lay off what is it
[1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:24.620]  half of the seasonal workers that work six to eight months a year and then a
[1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:28.020]  lot of folks at Austin work at the IRS because this is the IRS processing
[1:15:28.020 --> 1:15:35.300]  center for four states or is it five states I forget and that if it continues
[1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:41.260]  the shutdown that they're gonna lay off the permanent employees now this is
[1:15:41.260 --> 1:15:46.180]  done to fear monger them what did Obama come out and say last night he said I
[1:15:46.180 --> 1:15:50.340]  need the people to get involved I need the people to to to to realize you're
[1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:54.660]  gonna lose your goodies so see they've got more than 80 million
[1:15:54.660 --> 1:16:01.900]  Obama saying 80 million get welfare checks social security checks or food
[1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:06.020]  stamps it's a lot more than that you're talking I've done the math it's more
[1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:13.660]  like 120 million or so then you've got on top of that you've got contractors
[1:16:13.660 --> 1:16:17.420]  that are living off the government I mean we got a case of cancer and the
[1:16:17.420 --> 1:16:21.180]  cancer is taken over most the body and people are praising the cancer saying we
[1:16:21.180 --> 1:16:24.940]  couldn't live without this why it's part of our brain it's part of our heart it's
[1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:29.060]  part of our lungs and we're going no it's growing we need to cut it out and
[1:16:29.060 --> 1:16:33.500]  they're like no no you cut the blood supply off of the cancer other tissues
[1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:38.140]  might not get the blood I mean that's what the point we and again it's all
[1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:43.860]  about dependency where the majority of people are dependent on government and
[1:16:43.860 --> 1:16:48.220]  where nobody wants their part of the pie cut and meanwhile the bankers are
[1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:52.540]  financing and all out of thin air but then getting real assets out of it when
[1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:56.580]  we default this is about taking the greatest creditor nation in the world
[1:16:56.580 --> 1:17:01.300]  50 years ago in 1960 folks we were still the greatest creditor nation in the
[1:17:01.300 --> 1:17:05.700]  world we were still the greatest creditor nation in the 70s it was about
[1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:09.860]  taking this country and the states and getting us all in debt and teaching kids
[1:17:09.860 --> 1:17:13.580]  how to use credit cards and that and that leveraging yourself with with debt
[1:17:13.580 --> 1:17:17.220]  is the way to make money and yeah as long as the bankers are flooding you
[1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:24.380]  with with liquid cash it's okay but it gets you dependent now they're entering
[1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:29.180]  the final phase of total implosion where they've got you totally junkied out
[1:17:29.180 --> 1:17:33.420]  and no amount of Federal Reserve heroin's gonna help you and of course
[1:17:33.420 --> 1:17:36.300]  they're the drug dealer there they're they're coming out like gangbusters and
[1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:41.420]  now the the the government money junkies are going to start robbing the
[1:17:41.420 --> 1:17:47.380]  computers and stereos and jewelry in society and that's why you see the the
[1:17:47.380 --> 1:17:50.820]  crime exploding and and and they're and they're gonna raise the taxes they're
[1:17:50.820 --> 1:17:54.580]  gonna tell the giant hordes of people who who you know are living at
[1:17:54.580 --> 1:17:58.140]  assistance level who've had their economic destiny destroyed they're gonna
[1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:01.900]  say hey you want to keep half your pension fund don't you police then
[1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:07.620]  support raising taxes you want to keep half your pension funds don't you and
[1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:11.500]  people say yes raise taxes so we can just keep something and then they
[1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:16.620]  hyperinflate the currency more and destroy what you've got left and and
[1:18:16.620 --> 1:18:22.100]  but it takes a couple of years so the general public who's thinking I'm gonna
[1:18:22.100 --> 1:18:25.780]  come back go to Jackie Rourke Habu Sean and others and try to hurry through your
[1:18:25.780 --> 1:18:28.460]  calls but you know the caller raised so many important points that I'm gonna get
[1:18:28.460 --> 1:18:35.340]  more into this I saw as statistic yesterday I think it was in on CNN in
[1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:41.100]  fact Jeremy try to pull this up they were looking at Google analytics in the
[1:18:41.100 --> 1:18:50.220]  search terms and I believe they said it was 400 to 1 400 to 1 the amount of
[1:18:50.220 --> 1:18:57.740]  searches about an NFL shutdown that there were about the debt ceiling well
[1:18:57.740 --> 1:19:03.620]  listen when you've got the men of this country sitting around all day talking
[1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:07.660]  about people throwing balls back and forth and one of our crew was making
[1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:10.220]  the point about you know they'll interview LeBron James and say tell us
[1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:12.860]  about the game well I threw this guy the ball then he threw me the ball and then
[1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:16.380]  he did a really good job with a return of the ball grown men talking about
[1:19:16.380 --> 1:19:20.540]  throwing balls back and forth we've got savage criminal foreign banks who've
[1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:26.300]  economically captured us all the wealth and the largesse all of its going away
[1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:32.020]  we are hurtling towards total collapse they admit in mainstream news there
[1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:36.060]  they are preparing the military for economic collapse they didn't just
[1:19:36.060 --> 1:19:40.420]  prepare this they engineered the collapse that's why back in the 90s they
[1:19:40.420 --> 1:19:44.020]  were getting ready for this they knew what they were gonna do when they got
[1:19:44.020 --> 1:19:48.980]  rid of Glass-Steagall and you've got grown men who get all excited and sit
[1:19:48.980 --> 1:19:52.580]  around and talk about their favorite football team because these aren't men

[1:25:21.900 --> 1:25:26.260]  to dr. Picenic but I totally agree with you that after the Oslo shooting the
[1:25:26.260 --> 1:25:31.860]  first article I read with AP and it said the first paragraph he's a Christian
[1:25:31.860 --> 1:25:37.500]  blue-eyed who grew vegetables belonged to a gun club owned a gun club and I
[1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:43.100]  thought oh my gosh it's so obvious you know we are the enemy now we're the ones
[1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:48.620]  you thanks to your hard work and so many other liberal people seeking liberty we
[1:25:48.620 --> 1:25:52.300]  are the ones that they want to target when there's no longer the Muslims it's
[1:25:52.300 --> 1:25:55.980]  it's the white Christians so I keep joking with my friends yeah be careful
[1:25:55.980 --> 1:26:01.260]  about those you know be be careful of the Christians who are growing vegetables
[1:26:01.260 --> 1:26:04.300]  you know they're they're the real dangerous ones now first they create
[1:26:04.300 --> 1:26:09.620]  all this fake white guilt so that white Europeans will give up all of their
[1:26:09.620 --> 1:26:13.460]  liberties and sovereignty and then they go and by the way you're all Nazi
[1:26:13.460 --> 1:26:17.980]  terrorists and so this is now your guilt and and Americans have been taught
[1:26:17.980 --> 1:26:21.860]  that you know go for the government-run health care and the death panels or you
[1:26:21.860 --> 1:26:28.100]  don't like black people I mean they just inject it into everything Jackie great
[1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:32.140]  points any other points you like to make well I just wanted to ask you if you
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:36.980]  had an opinion about in the next five to ten years if you believe Australia will
[1:26:36.980 --> 1:26:42.180]  be a much safer place to be then than the United States no I don't think so
[1:26:42.180 --> 1:26:46.900]  they're they're bringing in the carbon taxes there they're they are passing
[1:26:46.900 --> 1:26:51.060]  all sorts of anti-free speech laws Aussies are great people I'd love to
[1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:55.260]  visit Australia someday and I have my opinion of Australia from what Aussies
[1:26:55.260 --> 1:26:59.340]  have told me and the news they tried to pass total internet censorship there
[1:26:59.340 --> 1:27:06.540]  just two years ago but that narrowly failed and I think the entire West is
[1:27:06.540 --> 1:27:12.540]  run by the very same globalist who just like a lion will run in and kill baby
[1:27:12.540 --> 1:27:17.660]  male lions and the globalist are targeting the best and brightest and
[1:27:17.660 --> 1:27:24.260]  most educated and most wealthy countries and people because any type of brain
[1:27:24.260 --> 1:27:29.180]  power is a threat to them any type of individualism is a threat to them any
[1:27:29.180 --> 1:27:35.140]  type of cohesion with individuals like the family is anathema this is a total
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:39.500]  takeover of the species just like Monsanto is a total takeover of the
[1:27:39.500 --> 1:27:43.900]  genetic code of all the plants I appreciate your call I mean this is
[1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:48.140]  about domination this is about their will being carried out and to have their
[1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:53.860]  will completely carried out they must destroy every form of independence it is
[1:27:53.860 --> 1:27:59.060]  a war against all that is good that's why it's a culture of death a culture of
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:05.700]  men being arrested development children women being flusy tarts no future for
[1:28:05.700 --> 1:28:10.460]  children no future for any cohesion pure weakness there's there they are
[1:28:10.460 --> 1:28:15.740]  sending psychic death into our psyche so that we stand down and basically fall
[1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:24.260]  over let's talk to Rourke in Texas you're on the air hello Alex I ran

[1:33:45.940 --> 1:33:47.940]  When I heard this talk show man

[1:33:50.940 --> 1:33:53.940]  It was real wild, but the more I heard

[1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:56.940]  Talking about what's been going on
[1:34:56.940 --> 1:34:59.940]  Around the world and here in the nation
[1:34:59.940 --> 1:35:02.940]  They all seem to turn like a pack of wolves
[1:35:02.940 --> 1:35:04.940]  When Alex goes on the air
[1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.940]  In spite of the facts, they launch their attacks
[1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:10.940]  And I just don't like to fight
[1:35:10.940 --> 1:35:16.940]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones
[1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:19.940]  Hey, if you're having a guttion
[1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:20.940]  To find a pre-subtion
[1:35:20.940 --> 1:35:23.940]  To know what's going on
[1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:26.940]  Then I can throw bananas at the global clowns
[1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:29.940]  And hear aristocratic moans
[1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:35.940]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones
[1:35:35.940 --> 1:35:41.940]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones

[1:35:43.940 --> 1:35:46.940]  Keep it rolling
[1:36:13.940 --> 1:36:25.940]  All right, we're back live
[1:36:25.940 --> 1:36:27.940]  And I do have a lot of news
[1:36:27.940 --> 1:36:29.940]  I wanna get more into the debt ceiling
[1:36:29.940 --> 1:36:30.940]  What it really means
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:34.940]  I wanna go to Habu, Sean, Chris, Bob, Otter and others
[1:36:34.940 --> 1:36:35.940]  Before we do that
[1:36:35.940 --> 1:36:38.940]  Then we've got Alan Watt joining us
[1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:41.940]  Coming up in the third hour today
[1:36:41.940 --> 1:36:43.940]  We'll also have some open phones
[1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:44.940]  While Alan joins us
[1:36:44.940 --> 1:36:45.940]  Always extremely informative
[1:36:45.940 --> 1:36:46.940]  We're gonna be talking to him
[1:36:46.940 --> 1:36:47.940]  About a host of issues
[1:36:47.940 --> 1:36:51.940]  Including cross human animal clones
[1:36:51.940 --> 1:36:52.940]  And I have a special report
[1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:54.940]  That I'm working on with Aaron
[1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:56.940]  That'll be out tomorrow
[1:36:56.940 --> 1:36:58.940]  Really documenting this in great detail
[1:36:58.940 --> 1:37:01.940]  That we're gonna premiere here on air
[1:37:01.940 --> 1:37:03.940]  On the Wednesday edition
[1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:04.940]  And then we'll also be put out
[1:37:04.940 --> 1:37:06.940]  On the YouTube channel for the entire world
[1:37:06.940 --> 1:37:08.940]  So that hopefully millions of people
[1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:11.940]  Will watch this key subject
[1:37:11.940 --> 1:37:14.940]  But I wanna go back to that last caller earlier
[1:37:14.940 --> 1:37:16.940]  Not because people are attacking me
[1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:18.940]  That goes with the territory
[1:37:18.940 --> 1:37:19.940]  And that's to be expected
[1:37:19.940 --> 1:37:21.940]  I'm someone who studied history
[1:37:21.940 --> 1:37:23.940]  Studied mass movements
[1:37:23.940 --> 1:37:26.940]  And I've decided to work with the truth
[1:37:26.940 --> 1:37:28.940]  Because it's such a powerful weapon
[1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:31.940]  And because I'm on the side of truth
[1:37:31.940 --> 1:37:33.940]  That doesn't mean I'm perfect
[1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:34.940]  I'm fallible
[1:37:34.940 --> 1:37:35.940]  Just like everybody else
[1:37:35.940 --> 1:37:37.940]  I make mistakes all the time
[1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:39.940]  I look back on things I've done
[1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:42.940]  And say why on earth did you act like that
[1:37:42.940 --> 1:37:44.940]  I certainly have a lot of problems
[1:37:44.940 --> 1:37:50.940]  I struggle with a lot of issues
[1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:51.940]  Trying to control myself
[1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:52.940]  Things like that
[1:37:52.940 --> 1:37:54.940]  Because I'm much more cogent and focused
[1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:55.940]  When I am calm
[1:37:55.940 --> 1:37:56.940]  And I think overall more effective
[1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:58.940]  But then I talk to major media people
[1:37:58.940 --> 1:37:59.940]  That like the show
[1:37:59.940 --> 1:38:01.940]  And they say they enjoy the rants
[1:38:01.940 --> 1:38:02.940]  I've had folks say
[1:38:02.940 --> 1:38:03.940]  Why don't you do rants every day
[1:38:03.940 --> 1:38:04.940]  At a certain time
[1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:06.940]  Because they're not scripted
[1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:07.940]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:07.940 --> 1:38:09.940]  You couldn't work this much
[1:38:09.940 --> 1:38:10.940]  And do what I do
[1:38:10.940 --> 1:38:12.940]  And script anything
[1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:15.940]  I understand people
[1:38:15.940 --> 1:38:18.940]  Not wanting to trust anybody
[1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:19.940]  I understand that
[1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:23.940]  Because in a world of universal deceit
[1:38:23.940 --> 1:38:25.940]  Telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[1:38:25.940 --> 1:38:27.940]  To quote George Arwell
[1:38:27.940 --> 1:38:29.940]  Precisely
[1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:30.940]  Jim Mars talked about that
[1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:33.940]  Earlier in the last hour
[1:38:33.940 --> 1:38:36.940]  I get attacked more than anybody
[1:38:36.940 --> 1:38:38.940]  Pretty much on the internet
[1:38:38.940 --> 1:38:39.940]  Who's involved in alternative news
[1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:42.940]  And information for a lot of reasons
[1:38:42.940 --> 1:38:44.940]  A, I'm very approachable
[1:38:44.940 --> 1:38:46.940]  I don't put on heirs
[1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:48.940]  I try to have a lot of people on
[1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:50.940]  I try to promote other folks
[1:38:50.940 --> 1:38:52.940]  And that actually creates a lot of disdain
[1:38:52.940 --> 1:38:53.940]  And anger
[1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:55.940]  Because if you're number one
[1:38:55.940 --> 1:38:57.940]  And aloof
[1:38:57.940 --> 1:38:59.940]  You know it's lonely at the top
[1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:01.940]  It's self-imposed loneliness
[1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:03.940]  Because people learn, my God
[1:39:03.940 --> 1:39:04.940]  When you're on top
[1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:06.940]  People grovel to your face
[1:39:06.940 --> 1:39:10.940]  But most people who are unfortunately
[1:39:10.940 --> 1:39:13.940]  Not winners
[1:39:13.940 --> 1:39:15.940]  They hate you
[1:39:15.940 --> 1:39:17.940]  And folks
[1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:19.940]  Hate anyone that is successful
[1:39:19.940 --> 1:39:21.940]  Especially if you're successful
[1:39:21.940 --> 1:39:23.940]  In your own right self-made
[1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:26.940]  And they cannot believe
[1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:29.940]  That anyone could be self-made
[1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:31.940]  And I think at the end of the day
[1:39:31.940 --> 1:39:33.940]  That's what's really sad about it
[1:39:33.940 --> 1:39:35.940]  When someone attacks me
[1:39:35.940 --> 1:39:37.940]  With false lies and things
[1:39:37.940 --> 1:39:39.940]  It doesn't hurt me
[1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:41.940]  That I'm being attacked
[1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:43.940]  In fact, one of the things
[1:39:43.940 --> 1:39:44.940]  I'm really ashamed of
[1:39:44.940 --> 1:39:47.940]  And I've repented for this
[1:39:47.940 --> 1:39:49.940]  And I've stopped doing it
[1:39:49.940 --> 1:39:51.940]  In the last couple years
[1:39:51.940 --> 1:39:53.940]  Is that I really like being attacked
[1:39:53.940 --> 1:39:54.940]  And lied about
[1:39:54.940 --> 1:39:58.940]  It's very sick and it's wrong
[1:39:58.940 --> 1:40:00.940]  And I've caught myself even doing things
[1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:01.940]  On air sometimes
[1:40:01.940 --> 1:40:02.940]  So I'll be attacked
[1:40:02.940 --> 1:40:03.940]  Because I really enjoy it
[1:40:03.940 --> 1:40:05.940]  It's very sick
[1:40:05.940 --> 1:40:07.940]  And it's not like a sadomasochistic
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:08.940]  It's funny
[1:40:08.940 --> 1:40:09.940]  I like it
[1:40:09.940 --> 1:40:11.940]  Watson has the same type of weird humor
[1:40:11.940 --> 1:40:14.940]  And I don't know if it's Anglo-Saxon
[1:40:14.940 --> 1:40:15.940]  Or what it is
[1:40:15.940 --> 1:40:16.940]  But the point is
[1:40:16.940 --> 1:40:17.940]  Is that we all
[1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:19.940]  He still tries to bring me these
[1:40:19.940 --> 1:40:20.940]  Delicacies
[1:40:20.940 --> 1:40:22.940]  And I try to not ask him
[1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:23.940]  If he has any
[1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:24.940]  Sometimes I call him
[1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:25.940]  And say
[1:40:25.940 --> 1:40:27.940]  Have you found any new lies about me
[1:40:27.940 --> 1:40:29.940]  Because it's so funny
[1:40:29.940 --> 1:40:30.940]  But see
[1:40:30.940 --> 1:40:33.940]  Everything is multifaceted
[1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:38.940]  I mean, it got to where a couple years ago
[1:40:38.940 --> 1:40:40.940]  I was spending an hour or two every night
[1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:41.940]  Staying up late
[1:40:41.940 --> 1:40:42.940]  Really enjoying myself
[1:40:42.940 --> 1:40:43.940]  Drinking beer
[1:40:43.940 --> 1:40:44.940]  Trying to find
[1:40:44.940 --> 1:40:45.940]  The most horrible things
[1:40:45.940 --> 1:40:47.940]  People are saying about me
[1:40:47.940 --> 1:40:49.940]  And then I realized
[1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:50.940]  At the end of the day
[1:40:50.940 --> 1:40:52.940]  That overall that's hurting
[1:40:52.940 --> 1:40:54.940]  The movement towards liberty
[1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:56.940]  And so I shouldn't be spending time
[1:40:56.940 --> 1:41:00.940]  I don't know what you'll call it
[1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:03.940]  Looking for that form of entertainment
[1:41:03.940 --> 1:41:05.940]  Charlie Sheen finds it to be
[1:41:05.940 --> 1:41:06.940]  A wonderful form of entertainment
[1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:08.940]  I introduced him to that
[1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:09.940]  Four or five years ago
[1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:12.940]  And that's why I made the Vatican assassin jokes
[1:41:12.940 --> 1:41:14.940]  People say Charlie and I are
[1:41:14.940 --> 1:41:15.940]  Vatican assassins
[1:41:15.940 --> 1:41:17.940]  And I mean, that's really funny, folks
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:18.940]  I mean, it is
[1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:20.940]  And so we've spent hours
[1:41:20.940 --> 1:41:22.940]  Before watching things and rolling
[1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:29.940]  Having enjoyment from that
[1:41:29.940 --> 1:41:30.940]  But Charlie, as you know
[1:41:30.940 --> 1:41:32.940]  Is a comedic actor
[1:41:32.940 --> 1:41:35.940]  And been in a lot of famous comedies
[1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:37.940]  He's a big fan of kind of
[1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:43.940]  The airplane style of comedy
[1:41:43.940 --> 1:41:44.940]  I told you I have a really bad
[1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:45.940]  Sinus headache today
[1:41:45.940 --> 1:41:47.940]  So a little bit dingy
[1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:51.940]  Here, I'm going to go to your calls
[1:41:51.940 --> 1:41:55.940]  It's hard to articulate
[1:41:55.940 --> 1:41:58.940]  A complex situation
[1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:00.940]  But I know the thinkers out there
[1:42:00.940 --> 1:42:04.940]  Totally understand where I'm coming from
[1:42:04.940 --> 1:42:08.940]  So the reason I just told that whole story is
[1:42:08.940 --> 1:42:14.940]  At a fundamental level
[1:42:14.940 --> 1:42:17.940]  I don't mind people attacking me
[1:42:17.940 --> 1:42:20.940]  And lying about me
[1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:25.940]  Unless they say things that are criminal
[1:42:25.940 --> 1:42:27.940]  People then say I'm doing criminal things
[1:42:27.940 --> 1:42:29.940]  Then, you know what?
[1:42:29.940 --> 1:42:30.940]  I just analyze that
[1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:32.940]  It's if I know someone personally
[1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:33.940]  And have helped them
[1:42:33.940 --> 1:42:34.940]  And then they lie about me
[1:42:34.940 --> 1:42:35.940]  Then it's not funny
[1:42:35.940 --> 1:42:36.940]  People I've never met
[1:42:36.940 --> 1:42:37.940]  Where it's not personal
[1:42:37.940 --> 1:42:38.940]  That's when it's funny
[1:42:38.940 --> 1:42:39.940]  So I'm here just kind of analyzing this
[1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:41.940]  Because I'm a public figure
[1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:45.940]  And, man, if my detractors had any idea
[1:42:45.940 --> 1:42:46.940]  A lot of them are government
[1:42:46.940 --> 1:42:50.940]  But most of them are just jealous
[1:42:50.940 --> 1:42:52.940]  And powerless people
[1:42:52.940 --> 1:42:57.940]  And they have such low images of themselves
[1:42:57.940 --> 1:43:02.940]  That they can't believe somebody could be real
[1:43:02.940 --> 1:43:05.940]  They can't believe that someone could really
[1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:07.940]  Be standing up against the New World Order
[1:43:07.940 --> 1:43:09.940]  And really having an effect
[1:43:09.940 --> 1:43:11.940]  They just can't believe it
[1:43:11.940 --> 1:43:15.940]  And so they say I'm a murderer
[1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:17.940]  They say I work for Israel
[1:43:17.940 --> 1:43:20.940]  They say I work for the Vatican
[1:43:20.940 --> 1:43:23.940]  They say I'm Bill Hicks
[1:43:23.940 --> 1:43:25.940]  They say anything
[1:43:25.940 --> 1:43:28.940]  And if it's said on the Internet, it must be true
[1:43:28.940 --> 1:43:29.940]  You know, it's like they'll just say
[1:43:29.940 --> 1:43:34.940]  On a YouTube video, CIA
[1:43:34.940 --> 1:43:36.940]  Just no proof, no nothing
[1:43:36.940 --> 1:43:37.940]  They just say it
[1:43:37.940 --> 1:43:39.940]  And it's like there is the proof
[1:43:39.940 --> 1:43:41.940]  That's one of Watson's favorite jokes
[1:43:41.940 --> 1:43:44.940]  He's like, CIA, it's true
[1:43:44.940 --> 1:43:51.940]  It says it there
[1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:56.940]  But when I'm in a focused, more pious psychological position
[1:43:56.940 --> 1:43:59.940]  And not in a nasty, worldly view
[1:43:59.940 --> 1:44:00.940]  I don't laugh at it
[1:44:00.940 --> 1:44:02.940]  It's very painful
[1:44:02.940 --> 1:44:06.940]  But not because I'm being lied about
[1:44:06.940 --> 1:44:09.940]  I'm lying at
[1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:12.940]  I am angry
[1:44:12.940 --> 1:44:20.940]  That these people are lying
[1:44:20.940 --> 1:44:23.940]  And they are lying to themselves
[1:44:23.940 --> 1:44:25.940]  Is what I'm trying to say
[1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:31.940]  They are...
[1:44:31.940 --> 1:44:33.940]  Again, it's so complex
[1:44:33.940 --> 1:44:35.940]  It gets into psychology
[1:44:35.940 --> 1:44:39.940]  And I don't even know how to articulate it
[1:44:39.940 --> 1:44:42.940]  I don't even know how...
[1:44:42.940 --> 1:44:44.940]  It's like a view that they don't believe
[1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:46.940]  Anything can be fixed
[1:44:46.940 --> 1:44:49.940]  And they don't believe that anything can be made better
[1:44:49.940 --> 1:44:52.940]  And so all these different hundreds of groups
[1:44:52.940 --> 1:44:54.940]  All attack each other
[1:44:54.940 --> 1:45:01.940]  And they all attack their own families
[1:45:01.940 --> 1:45:07.940]  And they just run around in a nasty, trolish way
[1:45:07.940 --> 1:45:10.940]  Just being incredibly negative
[1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:12.940]  And it's frustrating
[1:45:12.940 --> 1:45:14.940]  It's frustrating
[1:45:14.940 --> 1:45:18.940]  And I don't want to be sucked in to that nastiness
[1:45:18.940 --> 1:45:20.940]  I don't want to respond to it
[1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:23.940]  I want to see people be sophisticated
[1:45:23.940 --> 1:45:27.940]  I want to see people be able to have complex thoughts
[1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:30.940]  And complex understandings
[1:45:30.940 --> 1:45:34.940]  I mean, they say that
[1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:39.940]  We all lie in one way or another every day
[1:45:39.940 --> 1:45:42.940]  And most of the time, it's unconscious
[1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:46.940]  We lie to ourselves
[1:45:46.940 --> 1:45:49.940]  And I forget the philosopher that said, you know, know yourself
[1:45:49.940 --> 1:45:51.940]  That's the most important thing
[1:45:51.940 --> 1:45:53.940]  And then you can understand the world
[1:45:53.940 --> 1:45:56.940]  But if you can't look at yourself
[1:45:56.940 --> 1:45:59.940]  And be honest with yourself
[1:45:59.940 --> 1:46:02.940]  Then how are you going to be honest with anybody else?
[1:46:02.940 --> 1:46:04.940]  I mean, here's an example when I'm going to your calls
[1:46:04.940 --> 1:46:06.940]  And I don't want callers to get off into this
[1:46:06.940 --> 1:46:08.940]  I don't know why I got off into it
[1:46:08.940 --> 1:46:11.940]  I don't know why I spent eight minutes earlier talking about sneezing on air
[1:46:11.940 --> 1:46:17.940]  Well, I know why I'm a little bit dingy today
[1:46:17.940 --> 1:46:22.940]  People say that, well, Alex Jones works for ABC News
[1:46:22.940 --> 1:46:27.940]  And they say it because, I don't know, people six, seven, eight years ago
[1:46:27.940 --> 1:46:29.940]  Who knew that they were lying
[1:46:29.940 --> 1:46:34.940]  Went and took the fact that one of the satellites that Ted leases
[1:46:34.940 --> 1:46:41.940]  To send our radio show to radio affiliates was an ABC satellite
[1:46:41.940 --> 1:46:45.940]  And he was actually leasing it when it was another company, I forget the name
[1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:48.940]  And then it got bought by ABC and it's since been sold two or three times
[1:46:48.940 --> 1:46:51.940]  And of course, anybody who runs a radio station is laughing because they know
[1:46:51.940 --> 1:46:55.940]  There's only three or four satellites you can get on to be delivered
[1:46:55.940 --> 1:46:59.940]  And anybody, you can start a gardening show, show about rodeos, whatever you wanted
[1:46:59.940 --> 1:47:03.940]  From your own house, you can go lease
[1:47:03.940 --> 1:47:06.940]  Well, the satellites change names again, I forget the name of the new company
[1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:10.940]  And folks can go find the name of that company and find out who's on its board of directors
[1:47:10.940 --> 1:47:14.940]  And give them some ideas and then go say that I work for all of those people
[1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:17.940]  But they're lying to themselves when they do that
[1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:22.940]  And we all lie to ourselves sometimes about how much we eat or what we do
[1:47:22.940 --> 1:47:25.940]  All I'm saying is you need to be honest with yourselves
[1:47:25.940 --> 1:47:30.940]  I mean intellectually, like it scores a point against Alex Jones
[1:47:30.940 --> 1:47:37.940]  To lie and say that I work for ABC
[1:47:37.940 --> 1:47:41.940]  Because you could years ago go up to their website
[1:47:41.940 --> 1:47:48.940]  And see us listed there as someone who leases time from them
[1:47:48.940 --> 1:47:53.940]  And what channel of the satellite the Genesis shows are on
[1:47:53.940 --> 1:48:01.940]  I mean, it's people playing on the ignorance of others
[1:48:01.940 --> 1:48:05.940]  And I learned years ago to my shock and horror
[1:48:05.940 --> 1:48:09.940]  You could even tell these people, you could even send them an email
[1:48:09.940 --> 1:48:13.940]  And say, here's the phone number you can call ABC News
[1:48:13.940 --> 1:48:18.940]  And you can find out that you can lease time on the satellite they bought
[1:48:18.940 --> 1:48:20.940]  And that this is how you're on talk radio
[1:48:20.940 --> 1:48:22.940]  This is what radio stations have as receivers
[1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:27.940]  And they send an email back to you saying, no, you're going down scumbag
[1:48:27.940 --> 1:48:29.940]  Ooh, we've got you now
[1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:34.940]  And you email them back and say, no, this ABC thing isn't hurting me
[1:48:34.940 --> 1:48:36.940]  It's don't you want to know the truth?
[1:48:36.940 --> 1:48:39.940]  I mean, I don't work for ABC
[1:48:39.940 --> 1:48:43.940]  You know, they steal who you really are
[1:48:43.940 --> 1:48:47.940]  And then present something that isn't true
[1:48:47.940 --> 1:48:51.940]  And it's not done to seek the truth
[1:48:51.940 --> 1:49:00.940]  It's done just because they're angry that I'm successful and they're not
[1:49:00.940 --> 1:49:04.940]  But they're not successful because of the type of people they are
[1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:09.940]  You're not successful because of who you have become
[1:49:09.940 --> 1:49:19.940]  And no amount of hate and no amount of striking out at people that you think are more successful than you is going to help you
[1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:22.940]  Oh, there's another example of this
[1:49:26.940 --> 1:49:31.940]  And again, I've totally digressed and I shouldn't even have gotten off all into this
[1:49:31.940 --> 1:49:38.940]  I probably should have called in sick today with the broadcast
[1:49:38.940 --> 1:49:46.940]  Because when I don't feel well, I tend to just focus on more parochial things going on in my head than all the news
[1:49:46.940 --> 1:49:49.940]  Because it's painful to look at this news
[1:49:49.940 --> 1:49:52.940]  I mean, it's scary and I know why people live in denial
[1:49:52.940 --> 1:49:57.940]  I know why they had hundreds of times the people surfing the NFL
[1:49:57.940 --> 1:50:02.940]  Would there be a shutdown, would there be a strike or whatever was going on in the last few days
[1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:05.940]  Then we're looking at the debt ceiling
[1:50:05.940 --> 1:50:10.940]  I mean, I know why people want to totally embrace mindlessness
[1:50:10.940 --> 1:50:14.940]  Because responsibility is frustrating
[1:50:14.940 --> 1:50:17.940]  And it's safe to just talk about football all day
[1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:27.940]  You're not going to have a bunch of detractors and people calling for you to be murdered if you're talking about the NFL
[1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:32.940]  But, you know, I have children and I want them to have a good future
[1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:38.940]  It comes down to that, if you don't have children, you don't know why folks that have children say, hey, I'm involved because I have children
[1:50:38.940 --> 1:50:43.940]  But it's more than that, I like humanity, you know, I see the good things in people
[1:50:43.940 --> 1:50:47.940]  And I know we've got such a greater potential
[1:50:47.940 --> 1:50:53.940]  But we're entering a phase technologically where we're going to destroy ourselves if we don't get a hold of this
[1:50:53.940 --> 1:50:56.940]  And if we don't do something about the corrupt elites that are in power
[1:50:56.940 --> 1:51:14.940]  Well, at the end of the day, I just say ignore Alex Jones and the debates about me, focus on issues
[1:51:27.940 --> 1:51:29.940]  And there is proof that it exists
[1:51:29.940 --> 1:51:36.940]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security
[1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:42.940]  Who has access to it? How is it being used? Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[1:51:42.940 --> 1:51:47.940]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery
[1:51:47.940 --> 1:51:56.940]  The New Books by Jose Calazzo, available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com, America's New Slavery
[1:51:56.940 --> 1:52:18.940]  All Americans should be concerned
[1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:28.940]  The problem is only compounding
[1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:31.940]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:52:31.940 --> 1:52:35.940]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[1:52:35.940 --> 1:52:40.940]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:52:40.940 --> 1:52:44.940]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:45.940]  One of my old sponsors

[1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:56.940]  Recall 800-332-Optics right now to speak with an OpticsPlanet product specialist
[1:53:56.940 --> 1:54:00.940]  800-332-6784
[1:54:00.940 --> 1:54:16.940]  You know, I am just completely blown away by how crazy the world is and I just constantly keep thinking about the fact that they admit they've got all these cross-human animal clones
[1:54:16.940 --> 1:54:20.940]  And they're using them for body parts, experiments, and it's all over the news
[1:54:20.940 --> 1:54:25.940]  And it's not even a big issue, it's just like, oh yeah, oh forget cloning sheep
[1:54:25.940 --> 1:54:29.940]  Yeah, we've been cloning humans a long time, we kept it secret from you
[1:54:29.940 --> 1:54:33.940]  And the government's putting stuff in the water to give us cancer and dumb us down
[1:54:33.940 --> 1:54:38.940]  And we have the government documents and we know the Nazis used it at their camps
[1:54:38.940 --> 1:54:47.940]  And then I'd say half the so-called alternative news websites out there spend all day talking about me
[1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:55.940]  Instead of talking about news and information and they're so stupid, they don't even know that actually makes me bigger
[1:54:55.940 --> 1:55:02.940]  That you're giving me power, you're making me bigger, you're making people say who is Alex Jones
[1:55:02.940 --> 1:55:07.940]  I just, the funny thing is I don't even want it to be about me
[1:55:07.940 --> 1:55:13.940]  I want it to be about the information, I want a future, I want good things
[1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:22.940]  I thought growing up everybody was like me, that they were honest, that they liked seeing their neighbors do well
[1:55:22.940 --> 1:55:27.940]  That they liked it when people had a good looking girlfriend
[1:55:27.940 --> 1:55:31.940]  You know, I'm the type of person that sees a good looking couple and I don't get mad at them
[1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:35.940]  That the guy's better looking than I am, that the woman's super beautiful
[1:55:35.940 --> 1:55:40.940]  And I, oh that's good
[1:55:40.940 --> 1:55:45.940]  And now I've learned that a lot of people get angry by that
[1:55:45.940 --> 1:55:50.940]  And they get angry by people's wealth and they get angry by people's art and poetry
[1:55:50.940 --> 1:55:59.940]  I found out that a lot of famous writers and poets and film directors and people are hated by their contemporaries because they're the best
[1:55:59.940 --> 1:56:04.940]  And then I realized that's how the globalists are, they've taken over through fraud and corruption
[1:56:04.940 --> 1:56:14.940]  And they've sold themselves that Machiavellian injustifies the means is beautiful and powerful and really it's horrible
[1:56:14.940 --> 1:56:21.940]  And I can't believe that I am a shining specimen of goodness when I know how bad I am
[1:56:21.940 --> 1:56:28.940]  I mean I try to be good, I try to be honest, I try to get things right and I get things wrong
[1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:37.940]  I subconsciously lie because I don't want to hurt people's feelings, I don't want to go all the way
[1:56:37.940 --> 1:56:47.940]  And then I see people who consciously want to lie, who consciously sit around and think about ways to manipulate people
[1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:57.940]  I don't even know what to say anymore, we're in so much trouble
[1:56:57.940 --> 1:57:04.940]  The FDA last week said they're just going to allow total unlimited GMO on the shelves everywhere, no testing, no nothing
[1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:09.940]  I mean do you have any idea what this means? Do you have any idea how much trouble we're in?
[1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:15.940]  We're under full globalist assault, Habu, Sean, Chris, Bob, Otter, I'm going to go to you right now
[1:57:15.940 --> 1:57:19.940]  Habu you're on the air, thanks for holding while I've been babbling
[1:57:19.940 --> 1:57:24.940]  Thank you for taking my call and it's always good to listen to you, I'm a faithful listener
[1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:39.940]  Matt please make two comments, one lost in the din of this whole thing about Norway is President Obama's push for free trade agreements
[1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:47.940]  He is right now pushing for this Colombian, Panamanian and South Korean free trade agreement
[1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:55.940]  This is something that's going to completely devastate our already eviscerated workforce
[1:57:55.940 --> 1:57:59.940]  And here they're talking, look at this doublespeak, they're talking about debt ceiling
[1:57:59.940 --> 1:58:10.940]  What it's going to be is American taxpayers will have to pay these displaced workers funds to tide them over while they kind of adjust
[1:58:10.940 --> 1:58:19.940]  And then these people are going to be out of jobs permanently so that means even less money is flowing into the coffers
[1:58:19.940 --> 1:58:26.940]  But at the end of the day it's consolidating the wealth and making people dependent which is the end game
[1:58:26.940 --> 1:58:31.940]  And yes they're trying to ram through a whole bunch of trade deals with South Korea, you name it
[1:58:31.940 --> 1:58:38.940]  And every time they do a trade deal the trade disparities get even worse
[1:58:38.940 --> 1:58:40.940]  We'll be right back with Habu in one minute more
[1:59:08.940 --> 1:59:10.940]  And they really are calling the shots
[1:59:10.940 --> 1:59:15.940]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[1:59:15.940 --> 1:59:25.940]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[1:59:25.940 --> 1:59:31.940]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to?
[1:59:31.940 --> 1:59:38.940]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic
[1:59:38.940 --> 1:59:43.940]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[1:59:43.940 --> 2:00:04.940]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:00:04.940 --> 2:00:09.940]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[2:00:09.940 --> 2:00:13.940]  You want answers? Well so does he
[2:00:13.940 --> 2:00:17.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:00:17.940 --> 2:00:22.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:28.940 --> 2:00:33.940]  We're talking to Habu and other callers, we'll get to everybody when Alan Watts on with us as well
[2:00:33.940 --> 2:00:38.940]  I appreciate everybody calling in and holding, he raises all these free trade deals
[2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:44.940]  Which are really aren't free trade, that's why they're thousands of pages long, they're special interest deals
[2:00:44.940 --> 2:00:50.940]  Written by the big corporations, just like government run healthcare, was written by the insurance companies on record
[2:00:50.940 --> 2:00:55.940]  And the so-called liberals would run around and call you racist if you weren't for it
[2:00:55.940 --> 2:01:02.940]  But all it does is lower the standard of care, make you get the insurance and set up government death panels deciding what care you get
[2:01:02.940 --> 2:01:09.940]  But there's a whole bunch of different analysis going on dealing with it
[2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:16.940]  But they're one-way trade deals written for Korea, Columbia and Panama, where the US corporations are moving
[2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:25.940]  Well, I mean the General Electric bailout sent money to plants overseas and the General Motors
[2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:34.940]  They bailed out a billion bucks to build a plant in Brazil with US money, another billion plus in Eastern Europe and another one in China
[2:01:34.940 --> 2:01:40.940]  I mean, they've got this all figured out, your tax money goes to build a factory over there
[2:01:40.940 --> 2:01:47.940]  Well, of course, I mean it's just the magnitude of the corruption, the magnitude
[2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:53.940]  But yeah, this new deals with Korea, Columbia and Panama, and you're absolutely right Habu, any other points on that subject?
[2:01:53.940 --> 2:02:06.940]  Well, these corporations that are pushing it are the very ones that were at the receiving end of unmitigated largesse of the US taxpayer
[2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:13.940]  And now it's the US taxpayer who is going to be run down by these corporations
[2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:16.940]  But may I have another separate comment please?
[2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:25.940]  I just want to, you know, it was really good that you enlightened the world about the goings on in Quonsite, Arizona
[2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:31.940]  Really, you are a great person and I'm not trying to be a solicitor
[2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:36.940]  You're really a person who's upstanding and a decent and a compassionate person
[2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:39.940]  And for that you have my unending admiration
[2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:48.940]  But may I just bring to you the very strange case of this woman in Detroit called Mary Ann Godbaldo
[2:02:48.940 --> 2:02:52.940]  An African American mother who was homeschooling her daughter
[2:02:52.940 --> 2:02:57.940]  Oh, and she wouldn't give her the vaccines so they came and arrested her, we have covered that
[2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:04.940]  In fact, I haven't checked in to see what ended up happening to her, but what's going on with it now?
[2:03:04.940 --> 2:03:10.940]  Well, I think the case is coming up very shortly, but these people came with a SWAT team and a tank
[2:03:10.940 --> 2:03:15.940]  And they expected the person to turn over her child without a warrant
[2:03:15.940 --> 2:03:23.940]  And then after, in protection, the daughter contracts an STD, can you believe this?
[2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:27.940]  Well, absolutely, you're five times more likely to be abused in government custody
[2:03:27.940 --> 2:03:30.940]  Because there's no enforcement on themselves
[2:03:30.940 --> 2:03:35.940]  And so a lot of them are just cold-blooded people that want to get paychecks for warehousing kids
[2:03:35.940 --> 2:03:37.940]  But that's on the good end of it
[2:03:37.940 --> 2:03:42.940]  And they lock them up in cages inside the foster home houses and feed them one hot dog a day
[2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:48.940]  And I clean carpets for a summer, folks, I've been in the foster houses and they were never nice
[2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:53.940]  I'm sure there may be some that are nice, some Christian families or whatever, but I don't know if it exists
[2:03:53.940 --> 2:04:01.940]  But in the bad cases, people said, how dare you call them pot-bellied potheads, pedophiles
[2:04:01.940 --> 2:04:06.940]  All I'm saying is I'd go in the foster homes, there'd be some nilly pot-bellied white guy
[2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:12.940]  They all look the same, with marijuana smoke wafting with kids living on dirty mattresses
[2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:16.940]  I probably saw that 15 times cleaning houses
[2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:21.940]  And let me tell you, it was a horrible job, folks, going to people's houses and the kind of stuff
[2:04:21.940 --> 2:04:26.940]  Just, you know, no air conditioning on sometimes, you know, cat urine everywhere
[2:04:26.940 --> 2:04:29.940]  I don't want to get off a little story, but...
[2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:37.940]  And I've seen it, and these kids can drown in the back pool, they don't get in trouble, run over by cars
[2:04:37.940 --> 2:04:42.940]  And so pedophiles just become foster parents and they just do whatever they want
[2:04:42.940 --> 2:04:48.940]  The CPS just can do whatever they want to them and the state lets them do it
[2:04:48.940 --> 2:04:54.940]  So they torture them, kill them, beat them, and they also get more money once they drug the kids
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:57.940]  So they give them a mental illness designation and then start doing it
[2:04:57.940 --> 2:04:59.940]  And it's just horrible
[2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:03.940]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones
[2:05:03.940 --> 2:05:08.940]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk
[2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:10.940]  Saving means to make money
[2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:13.940]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars

[2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:35.940]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint
[2:05:35.940 --> 2:05:40.940]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before

[2:06:28.940 --> 2:06:31.940]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:06:31.940 --> 2:06:35.940]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[2:06:35.940 --> 2:06:40.940]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:06:40.940 --> 2:06:45.940]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors

[2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:15.940]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:20.940]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:24.940]  They so pride in every stitch
[2:07:24.940 --> 2:07:28.940]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[2:07:28.940 --> 2:07:31.940]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[2:07:31.940 --> 2:07:33.940]  Where you need it most
[2:07:33.940 --> 2:07:36.940]  Blue diamond gussets got it
[2:07:36.940 --> 2:07:38.940]  Others don't
[2:07:38.940 --> 2:07:40.940]  We turned jeans inside out
[2:07:40.940 --> 2:07:42.940]  Diamond gusset jeans
[2:07:42.940 --> 2:07:45.940]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:49.940]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection

[2:07:57.940 --> 2:07:59.940]  Others don't
[2:08:00.940 --> 2:08:02.940]  Genesis Communications Radio Network
[2:08:02.940 --> 2:08:05.940]  Probably presents The Alex Jones Show
[2:08:05.940 --> 2:08:08.940]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:12.940 --> 2:08:16.940]  Well, it's always riveting when Alan Watt joins us
[2:08:16.940 --> 2:08:20.940]  He is a researcher, an author
[2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:23.940]  Radio host Alan Watt
[2:08:23.940 --> 2:08:25.940]  Cut into the Matrix.com
[2:08:25.940 --> 2:08:27.940]  Joins us
[2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:30.940]  And sometime ought to read his bio
[2:08:30.940 --> 2:08:33.940]  It is very very interesting
[2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:35.940]  He's also a musician
[2:08:35.940 --> 2:08:40.940]  And published a lot of philosophy and poetry under pseudonyms
[2:08:40.940 --> 2:08:41.940]  For much of his life
[2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:45.940]  He was heavily involved in the music industry as a singer, songwriter, performer
[2:08:45.940 --> 2:08:48.940]  He involved in folk music, blues, pop, rock
[2:08:48.940 --> 2:08:49.940]  And even classical
[2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:52.940]  He's also known for his session guitar work
[2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:55.940]  He has played with some of the most well-known artists and groups
[2:08:55.940 --> 2:08:57.940]  Born in Scotland
[2:08:57.940 --> 2:09:02.940]  He watched the subtitles of politics and media as they guided
[2:09:02.940 --> 2:09:06.940]  He watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the UK
[2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:10.940]  Covertly into the European amalgamation
[2:09:10.940 --> 2:09:12.940]  And I was just talking to Alan
[2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:15.940]  He's got allergies or sinus like I do today
[2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:18.940]  So we're like the dynamic duo here
[2:09:18.940 --> 2:09:22.940]  But I doubt he'll sound as dultish as I have today
[2:09:22.940 --> 2:09:26.940]  Alan, so much is going on, so much is happening
[2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:28.940]  I said, what's your take on the shooter?
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:31.940]  And you said, well, I feel like the fool on the hill
[2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:34.940]  Watching the world spinning around
[2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:36.940]  But really the fool on the hill isn't a fool
[2:09:36.940 --> 2:09:39.940]  He sees the majesty, the beauty of the world
[2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:44.940]  So the ugliness, just the incredible spectacle of consciousness
[2:09:44.940 --> 2:09:48.940]  That the establishment tries to keep us from opening up to
[2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:51.940]  Because then we would be aware and not easily tricked
[2:09:51.940 --> 2:09:54.940]  So they wish to keep us psychically and mentally and spiritually
[2:09:54.940 --> 2:09:57.940]  And financially stunted
[2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:02.940]  But I want to get into the Hadron Superconducting Supercollider
[2:10:02.940 --> 2:10:04.940]  And the dangers associated with that
[2:10:04.940 --> 2:10:10.940]  And I want to get into 150 human animal hybrids grown in UK labs
[2:10:10.940 --> 2:10:13.940]  I've got a special report coming out tomorrow on this
[2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:16.940]  Embryos have been produced secretly for the past three years
[2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:18.940]  The Daily Mail can reveal
[2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:28.940]  Human cow, human reptoid, reptile, human fish, human frog, amphibian
[2:10:28.940 --> 2:10:31.940]  But there's something funny here
[2:10:31.940 --> 2:10:35.940]  I remember 15 years ago because I know I've been on air a year and a half or so
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:41.940]  I remember covering BBC articles about human embryonic chimeras
[2:10:41.940 --> 2:10:45.940]  Because they said the only way they could do it was make them part cow
[2:10:45.940 --> 2:10:47.940]  So that they wouldn't have rights
[2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:51.940]  And growing them in the utero of cows
[2:10:51.940 --> 2:10:58.940]  And they were saying that had been done for five years in 1996
[2:10:58.940 --> 2:11:03.940]  So since then every year they say for three years we've been doing this
[2:11:03.940 --> 2:11:05.940]  For five years we've been doing this, that's the two stories
[2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:07.940]  And it's always done the same
[2:11:07.940 --> 2:11:10.940]  And you'd think Daniel Martin and Simon Cadwell with the mail
[2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:14.940]  Would know how to pull these articles up or use Alexis Nexus
[2:11:14.940 --> 2:11:17.940]  And then I remember Alan, I want you to speak to this
[2:11:17.940 --> 2:11:19.940]  We'll speak to this first and then get into the shooter
[2:11:19.940 --> 2:11:21.940]  And the nice Templar thing and the rest of it
[2:11:21.940 --> 2:11:24.940]  I know you've studied it's why you're here
[2:11:24.940 --> 2:11:30.940]  That on the Washington Post it was in 2004 I think
[2:11:30.940 --> 2:11:34.940]  Or it was in 2005 because I recently read it in the Washington Post
[2:11:34.940 --> 2:11:38.940]  And about a week later I was on Ian Punnett's Saturday Coast to Coast AM
[2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:41.940]  Great interview, I loved the interview, never been invited back on
[2:11:41.940 --> 2:11:45.940]  I knew you'd get Ian Punnett on this show and return the favor but I'd like to go back on that show
[2:11:45.940 --> 2:11:48.940]  But he would challenge me a lot
[2:11:48.940 --> 2:11:55.940]  And so I'd say well this company came out Prodigy with a corn that grows live HIV virus in it
[2:11:55.940 --> 2:11:58.940]  And he wouldn't believe it and he'd pull it up and be in the Associated Press
[2:11:58.940 --> 2:12:00.940]  And Pharmacological Corn
[2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:03.940]  And I remember mentioning a Washington Post article about
[2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:06.940]  I said his show was George but I remember it was around that time
[2:12:06.940 --> 2:12:10.940]  The Washington Post said yes there are chimeras, part chimpanzee human
[2:12:10.940 --> 2:12:13.940]  At big labs in Costa Rica but you're not allowed to see them
[2:12:13.940 --> 2:12:16.940]  And I think it was Punnett or maybe it was Norrie
[2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:20.940]  But I remember it was like oh really and then I pulled up the article and read it to him
[2:12:20.940 --> 2:12:22.940]  It all blurs at this point
[2:12:22.940 --> 2:12:25.940]  But the issue is you talk about spider goats
[2:12:25.940 --> 2:12:27.940]  You talk about things like this that have been out for decades
[2:12:27.940 --> 2:12:30.940]  People still don't believe it
[2:12:30.940 --> 2:12:36.940]  And the issue here is if they're admitting this has been going on for decades now
[2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:39.940]  Imagine what's really going on
[2:12:39.940 --> 2:12:42.940]  And so why are they now introducing this to the public
[2:12:42.940 --> 2:12:46.940]  I mean this is H.G. Wells, the island of Dr. Maru
[2:12:46.940 --> 2:12:49.940]  With the humanoid creatures demanding their rights
[2:12:49.940 --> 2:12:54.940]  Wells over a hundred years ago wrote about atomic bombs
[2:12:54.940 --> 2:12:58.940]  And basically world war and how the U.N. would come out of that
[2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:01.940]  Of course he was a top futurist and predictive programmer
[2:13:01.940 --> 2:13:03.940]  That Alan talks a lot about
[2:13:03.940 --> 2:13:07.940]  So more and more it does look like they've got a lot of secret technologies and things
[2:13:07.940 --> 2:13:11.940]  And they may not be 30 years advanced as they admit they are
[2:13:11.940 --> 2:13:13.940]  In their technological systems
[2:13:13.940 --> 2:13:16.940]  It may be 50, 100, we don't know
[2:13:16.940 --> 2:13:19.940]  I mean more and more I realize we are basically in a matrix
[2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:23.940]  Because we're physically here but through the eyes, through the olfactory
[2:13:23.940 --> 2:13:25.940]  Through touch, through everything
[2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:30.940]  We take in this data and the modern civilization is a false reality
[2:13:30.940 --> 2:13:33.940]  It is a artificial habitat that we're in
[2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:35.940]  And they're just bringing us into deeper phases
[2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:38.940]  And Alan Watt is our guest, that's my preface
[2:13:38.940 --> 2:13:41.940]  Alan, break down what we're facing here
[2:13:41.940 --> 2:13:43.940]  Yeah, you're quite right actually
[2:13:43.940 --> 2:13:47.940]  They do give you a reality for the vast population
[2:13:47.940 --> 2:13:50.940]  And it's an antique reality
[2:13:50.940 --> 2:13:52.940]  We think we're on the cutting edge
[2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:54.940]  And the media of course is there to reinforce that
[2:13:54.940 --> 2:13:56.940]  And give out little tidbits over
[2:13:56.940 --> 2:13:58.940]  We're trying to explore this
[2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:00.940]  And trying to explore that one day
[2:14:00.940 --> 2:14:02.940]  We eventually hope to do this
[2:14:02.940 --> 2:14:04.940]  And we believe it all, you see
[2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:06.940]  And reality as you say
[2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:08.940]  At a much higher level of reality
[2:14:08.940 --> 2:14:10.940]  Is the true cutting edge
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:12.940]  We don't even know how high that goes
[2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:15.940]  We know this, we're above the top CIA level
[2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:18.940]  When in the 1950s they had solid state circuitry
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:20.940]  The little gizmos you'd put in your pocket
[2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:23.940]  They could turn someone's heart off basically
[2:14:23.940 --> 2:14:25.940]  And they used them too
[2:14:25.940 --> 2:14:28.940]  And Nick Bagage came out and showed some of this stuff
[2:14:28.940 --> 2:14:30.940]  And talked about it as well
[2:14:30.940 --> 2:14:32.940]  So we are really in the past
[2:14:32.940 --> 2:14:34.940]  And that's how you can at the top
[2:14:34.940 --> 2:14:36.940]  How you can control the future
[2:14:36.940 --> 2:14:38.940]  You plan the future
[2:14:38.940 --> 2:14:41.940]  You bring it in and you feed the public
[2:14:41.940 --> 2:14:43.940]  Predictive programming a little bit
[2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:45.940]  And a little bit at the time
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:47.940]  You must also do social changes
[2:14:47.940 --> 2:14:49.940]  And dehumanize the people
[2:14:49.940 --> 2:14:52.940]  And dehumanization is a big, big part of this agenda
[2:14:52.940 --> 2:14:55.940]  Because Julian Huxley, who was the CEO
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:14:58.940]  Of UNESCO, the first one of UNESCO
[2:14:58.940 --> 2:15:00.940]  He did say that in his books
[2:15:00.940 --> 2:15:03.940]  That it had to knock man off his pedestal
[2:15:03.940 --> 2:15:05.940]  As being supreme on the planet
[2:15:05.940 --> 2:15:07.940]  Bring him down to the level of animals
[2:15:07.940 --> 2:15:10.940]  Now once you start to think of yourself as an animal
[2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:13.940]  And again, you get all these nature programs
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:15.940]  All the green programs telling you
[2:15:15.940 --> 2:15:17.940]  Well, you're just another animal amongst animals
[2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:19.940]  And you have no more rights than any other animals
[2:15:19.940 --> 2:15:23.940]  And then you have to go into the further dehumanization
[2:15:23.940 --> 2:15:26.940]  Of the destruction of the old cultures
[2:15:26.940 --> 2:15:29.940]  Where families normally had children
[2:15:29.940 --> 2:15:31.940]  That was the whole point of them
[2:15:31.940 --> 2:15:35.940]  And now, of course, we don't even have so much that
[2:15:35.940 --> 2:15:38.940]  So we've seen abortion rockets going on
[2:15:38.940 --> 2:15:41.940]  We're now seeing body parts sold across the world
[2:15:41.940 --> 2:15:43.940]  We are a going business
[2:15:43.940 --> 2:15:45.940]  All of us, we are going business
[2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:48.940]  And they're teaching us with the gladiatorial events
[2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:50.940]  And all of it to dehumanize ourselves
[2:15:50.940 --> 2:15:52.940]  And to see beauty as ugly
[2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:54.940]  And ugliness as beauty
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:56.940]  And to just wallow
[2:15:56.940 --> 2:15:59.940]  Because a human would be shocked by the disgrace
[2:15:59.940 --> 2:16:03.940]  And the indignity of humans being spliced with animals
[2:16:03.940 --> 2:16:05.940]  And would be concerned for these poor creatures
[2:16:05.940 --> 2:16:08.940]  But because they're part human, they have no right
[2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:11.940]  When you torture a monkey, people will burn down your business
[2:16:11.940 --> 2:16:14.940]  But with the transhumanist environmentalist
[2:16:14.940 --> 2:16:18.940]  There is a giggling sacrament in trampling humanity
[2:16:18.940 --> 2:16:21.940]  Because they really fear the power of humanity
[2:16:21.940 --> 2:16:23.940]  So it's important for them, the predator class
[2:16:23.940 --> 2:16:26.940]  To trample it and to hike their leg on it
[2:16:26.940 --> 2:16:30.940]  And to turn it into a servile, gibbering religion
[2:16:30.940 --> 2:16:33.940]  Where the slaves revel in their own destruction
[2:16:33.940 --> 2:16:35.940]  That's pretty well it, actually
[2:16:35.940 --> 2:16:40.940]  Dehumanization, with dehumanization comes depersonalization
[2:16:40.940 --> 2:16:43.940]  When you lose your identity of who you are
[2:16:43.940 --> 2:16:45.940]  You are in flux
[2:16:45.940 --> 2:16:47.940]  When you're in flux, of course, the massive propaganda machine
[2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:49.940]  Comes in, takes you over
[2:16:49.940 --> 2:16:51.940]  And then you flow along with the new think
[2:16:51.940 --> 2:16:53.940]  As it's called, always new think
[2:16:53.940 --> 2:16:56.940]  And so we've been programmed like this for such a long time now
[2:16:56.940 --> 2:17:00.940]  Now, recently too, we've seen the big push for euthanasia
[2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:02.940]  That was in the next nail in the coffin
[2:17:02.940 --> 2:17:05.940]  And the people, and they keep the pulse on the public now
[2:17:05.940 --> 2:17:07.940]  With the internet, they know what we're thinking
[2:17:07.940 --> 2:17:09.940]  What we're chatting about, what we're worried about
[2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:12.940]  And so they can tell when we're ready for the next step of it
[2:17:12.940 --> 2:17:15.940]  Now, I've got books going back from scientific journals
[2:17:15.940 --> 2:17:18.940]  Going back 20, 30 years when they were talking
[2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:20.940]  And I've got one here, actually
[2:17:20.940 --> 2:17:23.940]  It's the future of mankind and the planet
[2:17:23.940 --> 2:17:25.940]  And top names in it, of course
[2:17:25.940 --> 2:17:29.940]  And it shows you them making, breeding the public
[2:17:29.940 --> 2:17:32.940]  For different functions, just like Plato talked about
[2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:35.940]  In the Republic, only a bit more advanced
[2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:38.940]  And they said we can create men who eventually will be divers
[2:17:38.940 --> 2:17:40.940]  They'll have gills, like fish
[2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:44.940]  And they can go down and they can weld the legs
[2:17:44.940 --> 2:17:47.940]  On the big platforms that see for oil
[2:17:47.940 --> 2:17:49.940]  And do that kind of stuff
[2:17:49.940 --> 2:17:51.940]  In other words, they're going to make purpose-made humans
[2:17:51.940 --> 2:17:55.940]  Or semi-humans for the particular job they're designed to do
[2:17:55.940 --> 2:17:58.940]  And that's what it's all about, is that designer humans
[2:17:58.940 --> 2:18:01.940]  For specific tasks, rather...
[2:18:01.940 --> 2:18:04.940]  You see, we are supposedly, according to high sociology today
[2:18:04.940 --> 2:18:07.940]  We are the useless eaters now
[2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:09.940]  We're post-industrial, we don't need us
[2:18:09.940 --> 2:18:12.940]  We're almost post-war, once the Middle East is standardized
[2:18:12.940 --> 2:18:13.940]  Into the world's...
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:15.940]  And then they have the predictive programming with movies like X-Men
[2:18:15.940 --> 2:18:17.940]  That show you everybody mutating
[2:18:17.940 --> 2:18:20.940]  And then how they're the poor groups whose rights aren't taken care of
[2:18:20.940 --> 2:18:24.940]  And now, they're going to come out with more and more of these clones
[2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:27.940]  These replicants, and then the government's going to give them rights
[2:18:27.940 --> 2:18:31.940]  And protect them, and then basically use them against the rest of us
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:34.940]  Those that won't buy into all the new technological augmentation
[2:18:34.940 --> 2:18:38.940]  That are really backdoor systems for them to hack the brain
[2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:41.940]  Because there is no firewall as the Pentagon has said
[2:18:41.940 --> 2:18:43.940]  They'll be sequestered like Amish
[2:18:43.940 --> 2:18:46.940]  But then our children are rated and taken
[2:18:46.940 --> 2:18:49.940]  I mean, it is a charnel house
[2:18:49.940 --> 2:18:52.940]  Of trampling and being trampled upon
[2:18:52.940 --> 2:18:56.940]  As O'Brien tells Winston that is being entered here
[2:18:56.940 --> 2:18:58.940]  And just notice how they're now calmly saying
[2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:00.940]  Yes, we're splicing humans with animals
[2:19:00.940 --> 2:19:02.940]  I mean, they're just telling you, but it's secret
[2:19:02.940 --> 2:19:04.940]  You're not allowed to see them
[2:19:04.940 --> 2:19:06.940]  Yeah, and it's no doubt about it
[2:19:06.940 --> 2:19:08.940]  And most folks, really, I kid you not
[2:19:08.940 --> 2:19:12.940]  Most folks today who haven't had an original thought in their heads
[2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:14.940]  They like the mainstream media
[2:19:14.940 --> 2:19:16.940]  They won't have a thought on this
[2:19:16.940 --> 2:19:18.940]  They'll not be hot or cold
[2:19:18.940 --> 2:19:20.940]  They'll just be, oh, well, that's science for you
[2:19:20.940 --> 2:19:22.940]  That's progress, by the way
[2:19:22.940 --> 2:19:24.940]  Science always charges progress
[2:19:24.940 --> 2:19:26.940]  And they'll go along with it
[2:19:26.940 --> 2:19:29.940]  Never thinking about the implications of where it's all to go
[2:19:29.940 --> 2:19:31.940]  But make no doubt about it
[2:19:31.940 --> 2:19:35.940]  This system is not about a new world order
[2:19:35.940 --> 2:19:38.940]  There's lots of stages of coming new world orders
[2:19:38.940 --> 2:19:40.940]  In societies and systems
[2:19:40.940 --> 2:19:42.940]  Already on the books
[2:19:42.940 --> 2:19:44.940]  We're just seeing that the next step
[2:19:44.940 --> 2:19:48.940]  Of purpose-made humans for specific functions
[2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:50.940]  And you don't need silly humans anymore
[2:19:50.940 --> 2:19:52.940]  With their limited capabilities
[2:19:52.940 --> 2:19:55.940]  You'll have a sex slave who looks like Marilyn Monroe
[2:19:55.940 --> 2:19:57.940]  And even has her DNA
[2:19:57.940 --> 2:20:23.940]  One percent squid, so she has no rights
[2:20:23.940 --> 2:20:36.940]  And you'll have a sex slave who looks like Marilyn Monroe
[2:20:36.940 --> 2:20:48.940]  And you'll have a sex slave who looks like Marilyn Monroe

[2:21:59.100 --> 2:22:05.100]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:10.740]  I designed our top-selling holster, the Supertuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked,
[2:22:10.740 --> 2:22:13.420]  pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[2:22:13.420 --> 2:22:18.780]  The Supertuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[2:22:18.780 --> 2:22:21.780]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[2:22:30.140 --> 2:22:31.540]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:22:31.540 --> 2:22:35.340]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:36.340]  IRAs?
[2:22:36.340 --> 2:22:40.340]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[2:22:40.340 --> 2:22:42.020]  of gold for your retirement.
[2:22:42.020 --> 2:22:45.500]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[2:22:45.500 --> 2:22:50.460]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[2:22:50.460 --> 2:22:56.340]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[2:22:56.340 --> 2:23:00.180]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:02.740]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[2:23:02.740 --> 2:23:07.340]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your
[2:23:07.340 --> 2:23:08.340]  money?
[2:23:08.340 --> 2:23:12.820]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport and I've just completed Zero Debt 100.com, a program that stops and
[2:23:12.820 --> 2:23:17.980]  prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed
[2:23:17.980 --> 2:23:18.980]  results.
[2:23:18.980 --> 2:23:19.980]  Forget loan modifications.
[2:23:19.980 --> 2:23:23.700]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while
[2:23:23.700 --> 2:23:26.180]  stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[2:23:26.180 --> 2:23:29.660]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what
[2:23:29.660 --> 2:23:31.740]  I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[2:23:31.740 --> 2:23:37.060]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[2:23:37.060 --> 2:23:41.420]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion
[2:23:41.420 --> 2:23:44.580]  about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[2:23:44.580 --> 2:23:52.300]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256, 800-477-9256.
[2:23:52.300 --> 2:24:04.940]  That's 800-477-9256 or visit www.ZeroDebt100.com.
[2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:05.940]  Your calls are coming up.
[2:24:05.940 --> 2:24:10.980]  We're going to get into Alan Watts' view on the situation in Oslo, Norway.
[2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:17.460]  Now being used to call for crackdowns on the Internet, free speech, the Second Amendment
[2:24:17.460 --> 2:24:20.460]  and gun ownership.
[2:24:20.460 --> 2:24:24.500]  It is really, really obvious what's going on here.
[2:24:24.500 --> 2:24:29.060]  And this guy now he learned, Norway Nazi was on drugs, Maniac took substances to make
[2:24:29.060 --> 2:24:30.060]  him strong.
[2:24:30.060 --> 2:24:31.900]  We're going to get more into that.
[2:24:31.900 --> 2:24:34.540]  Alan Watts, it is so fundamental.
[2:24:34.540 --> 2:24:44.700]  It is such a huge issue to sit here and talk about how we're living in an antique reality.
[2:24:44.700 --> 2:24:50.180]  That's a great way of putting it, that there is a breakaway civilization, that the establishment
[2:24:50.180 --> 2:25:00.420]  has written white books, white papers on all of this for decades, that the cloning is much
[2:25:00.420 --> 2:25:01.420]  more advanced.
[2:25:01.420 --> 2:25:04.980]  And they admit, oh yeah, we kept it secret from Ian England, we're splicing humans with
[2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:05.980]  everything.
[2:25:05.980 --> 2:25:11.540]  They don't have rights because they're part spider, they're part, I mean this is so incredible
[2:25:11.540 --> 2:25:19.980]  that they for at least 20 years have been growing humans in cows that are part cows
[2:25:19.980 --> 2:25:23.260]  so that the cow doesn't reject them to then harvest their organs.
[2:25:23.260 --> 2:25:27.980]  I mean that was in BBC 15 years ago and they said that that had been going on for five
[2:25:27.980 --> 2:25:29.260]  years secretly.
[2:25:29.260 --> 2:25:32.220]  Now this is what they admit they're doing.
[2:25:32.220 --> 2:25:37.180]  From your research Alan, how advanced is it because the word I've gotten from a physician
[2:25:37.180 --> 2:25:42.460]  and others that have treated heads of state is that they're already staging their deaths
[2:25:42.460 --> 2:25:47.100]  and that it's not just Ken Leigh that went to Paraguay right before he was about to be
[2:25:47.100 --> 2:25:52.700]  sentenced or after he'd been sentenced but turned himself in that this is going on.
[2:25:52.700 --> 2:25:56.100]  But I mean undoubtedly there's a lot of secret technology.
[2:25:56.100 --> 2:26:02.020]  From your research how much more advanced is it or do we have no idea?
[2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:06.620]  I think from the clues of the past that's where you go on and they're probably at least
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:10.180]  200 years ahead of where we are.
[2:26:10.180 --> 2:26:16.180]  When you look into the writings even of Mary Shelley, for instance Shelley was her husband
[2:26:16.180 --> 2:26:21.860]  the poet was a member of the high societies at that time they clouded themselves under
[2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:26.900]  secret societies and masonry and so on but in reality at the very top of that there was
[2:26:26.900 --> 2:26:31.500]  pure science there and they were given access to the sciences of the time and she didn't
[2:26:31.500 --> 2:26:37.380]  come up with the idea of a Frankenstein, a human being put together by body parts by
[2:26:37.380 --> 2:26:38.380]  herself.
[2:26:38.380 --> 2:26:41.860]  It was because she was in with the groups that were actually discussing this and maybe some
[2:26:41.860 --> 2:26:47.900]  who were actually trying to do it at the time and really they're so far ahead that it boggles
[2:26:47.900 --> 2:26:54.580]  the mind as I say in the fifties before we even had the transistor radio they had the
[2:26:54.580 --> 2:27:01.340]  CIA as Nick Biggage showed on television he showed the equipment which would beam a thought
[2:27:01.340 --> 2:27:07.020]  into your head or a sound or music into the middle of the center of your head on line
[2:27:07.020 --> 2:27:08.020]  of sight.
[2:27:08.020 --> 2:27:11.540]  So it could go for miles if you were high enough on a hill you could literally pick
[2:27:11.540 --> 2:27:17.580]  your target and do it then it was more than voice to skull and but these things also had
[2:27:17.580 --> 2:27:24.220]  the capability of interfering with basically the way that comes the pulse for your heart
[2:27:24.220 --> 2:27:28.900]  originally it's in the brain and you can interfere with that pathway and give a person a heart
[2:27:28.900 --> 2:27:29.900]  attack.
[2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:32.980]  Now this stuff you could put in these little gadgets you could put in your pocket in the
[2:27:32.980 --> 2:27:40.260]  1950s it had to be incredibly amazing solid state circuitry with micro transistors etc.
[2:27:40.260 --> 2:27:46.180]  Oh let me stop you you know you talk about it too Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley's brother
[2:27:46.180 --> 2:27:52.580]  who wrote about genetic engineering and GMO food and different classes of humans and Brave
[2:27:52.580 --> 2:27:57.420]  New World published in what 32-33 he gave a speech when he knew he was dying and said
[2:27:57.420 --> 2:28:01.300]  this is all real and even though I'm telling you you're not going to be able to stop us
[2:28:01.300 --> 2:28:06.500]  and was laughing at everyone they thought he was being a good guy warning them and he said
[2:28:06.500 --> 2:28:13.700]  at our universities we have people with microelectronics already in their brain and we're already
[2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:18.340]  testing this to be able to remote control humans and then in by the 70s they admitted
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:25.060]  they had microchip remote control cockroaches in university reports they're just now telling
[2:28:25.060 --> 2:28:30.340]  the public now so here he was saying actually my book isn't fiction this is what we've been
[2:28:30.340 --> 2:28:36.940]  doing secretly you know decades ago we had microelectronics in people's brains.
[2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:43.860]  Oh yeah and you had Del Gadaw I should say famous for his bull what we put a microchip
[2:28:43.860 --> 2:28:48.940]  in his brain and remote control that he could stop a charge from the bull but he was also
[2:28:48.940 --> 2:28:53.060]  and there's videos up there on YouTube where he's talking about it wasn't just animals
[2:28:53.060 --> 2:28:58.260]  he was practicing on he was practicing on humans of course he was and so this is very
[2:28:58.260 --> 2:29:03.980]  old this is very old stuff because the idea when they began this socialist movement the
[2:29:03.980 --> 2:29:08.660]  most folk think is left wing it's really at the top of the right wing who run the socialist
[2:29:08.660 --> 2:29:13.780]  movement and that's why banks are all behind it and so on but they knew they wanted to
[2:29:13.780 --> 2:29:19.380]  bring in a society of well-behaved people who would simply be a slave society cause no
[2:29:19.380 --> 2:29:25.980]  problems no crime and how do you make that happen well they expected all forms of conflict
[2:29:25.980 --> 2:29:30.180]  all conflict right down to the family home by the way and that was part of the reason
[2:29:30.180 --> 2:29:34.580]  we came up with we must dissolve this time the unit and they admit and they admit the
[2:29:34.580 --> 2:29:39.540]  whole plan is to play men and women off against each other and they give the cues to men how
[2:29:39.540 --> 2:29:44.940]  to behave that'll enrage women and they give the women cues to tell them act like this
[2:29:44.940 --> 2:29:51.460]  you'll be successful it's really the opposite total civilization sabotage.
[2:29:51.460 --> 2:30:01.420]  here on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:07.500]  you may be arrested and or subject to other police action tyranny is here the grim future
[2:30:07.500 --> 2:30:13.820]  foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says that the state is god the united states
[2:30:13.820 --> 2:30:19.180]  is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth this film
[2:30:19.180 --> 2:30:25.340]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of fema cams now being expanded nationwide

[2:33:39.700 --> 2:33:45.020]  the globalists want to play god they want the live extension technologies they've undoubtedly
[2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:50.580]  already have them they're down bragging they have them they're offering extended lives
[2:33:50.580 --> 2:33:57.460]  to people now who are quote wealthy if they'll buy into transhumanism but the but the transhumanist
[2:33:57.460 --> 2:34:04.420]  technocratic technological systems they're offering are basically enslavement systems
[2:34:04.420 --> 2:34:08.620]  so that's what the general public's going to get is an enslavement system the name of
[2:34:08.620 --> 2:34:14.300]  life extension and we have no idea what the actual controllers are doing when you see
[2:34:14.300 --> 2:34:20.220]  people like gordon brown or bill clinton or storage of your bush or obama they're meant
[2:34:20.220 --> 2:34:25.500]  to politically rise and fall be built up and destroyed like a shield that a night holds
[2:34:25.500 --> 2:34:30.940]  up and the shield gets all bent up and battered and bruised and then when they're done it for
[2:34:30.940 --> 2:34:34.900]  four day years they throw it down and pick up another one and it's these fundamental
[2:34:34.900 --> 2:34:42.460]  things people need to understand you know if you look at the news today they're saying
[2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:48.940]  no debt deal and oh my gosh now we may default and have depression but they're already defaulting
[2:34:48.940 --> 2:34:53.740]  they're already devaluing the dollar we're already in a depression and and and the bankers
[2:34:53.740 --> 2:34:57.260]  are training us to just everything's about the government everything's about the bankers
[2:34:57.260 --> 2:35:04.860]  and everything's about our credit agents the credit agencies ratings I mean they're more
[2:35:04.860 --> 2:35:08.980]  important now than the president and then who are they revolving door minions of Goldman
[2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:15.220]  Sachs JP Morgan and others and and you know now the GOP is revolting just like in 94 with
[2:35:15.220 --> 2:35:20.740]  newt genrich who ended up making sure the contract on america didn't get through a guy wrote
[2:35:20.740 --> 2:35:26.900]  them forward to multiple alvin and heidi toffler books calling for world government calling
[2:35:26.900 --> 2:35:33.020]  for a technocracy calling for the end of america and and they talk about how conservative newt
[2:35:33.020 --> 2:35:39.300]  genrich is because people say he's conservative when he's promoting carbon taxes but I gotta
[2:35:39.300 --> 2:35:45.260]  tell you 10 years ago people wouldn't wake up the newt genrich today they do and so that's
[2:35:45.260 --> 2:35:50.860]  the good news but now they're saying the GOP has revolted and isn't gonna go along with
[2:35:50.860 --> 2:35:56.300]  all this but but again it's all part of this process and as long as people can be kept
[2:35:56.300 --> 2:36:01.460]  in this false narrative this false reality as you go up through politics and media if
[2:36:01.460 --> 2:36:07.580]  you show that you'll buy into the false system you are promoted in the false system but if
[2:36:07.580 --> 2:36:12.940]  you don't go along with the false system if you question the the the the the presented
[2:36:12.940 --> 2:36:19.780]  reality then oh you're a conspiracy theorist and now having any opinion is a conspiracy
[2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:26.040]  theory and cast unsteam at the White House says we'll flood the internet with false conspiracy
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:31.020]  theories we'll flood the internet with in fighting with bickering and they're trying
[2:36:31.020 --> 2:36:37.620]  to do that but in the writings of the ruling class use what they really set up and that's
[2:36:37.620 --> 2:36:42.820]  what ellen watt covers that's what I cover alan continuing looking at the globalist
[2:36:42.820 --> 2:36:51.140]  program and operations I see revolts from people within the technotronic technocratic
[2:36:51.140 --> 2:36:55.020]  class being one of the biggest threats of their system that's why they're trying to
[2:36:55.020 --> 2:37:00.100]  go to an automated global computer system where they don't need armies because it's
[2:37:00.100 --> 2:37:04.780]  robot and drone driven and the robots are worked on by robots and robots work on those
[2:37:04.780 --> 2:37:09.820]  robots and then some human technicians they already admit no one at a major computer company
[2:37:09.820 --> 2:37:15.580]  even knows how the computers work now it's just different systems integrated together
[2:37:15.580 --> 2:37:20.860]  and the humans can't even understand it this is going to get more and more pronounced and
[2:37:20.860 --> 2:37:26.020]  the elite are all over the news saying we don't need people anymore humans will humans
[2:37:26.020 --> 2:37:31.460]  be kept as pets and the elites are already talking about the computers like they've
[2:37:31.460 --> 2:37:36.740]  already merged with them and ray Kurzweil says within 15 years the elite will merge
[2:37:36.740 --> 2:37:40.860]  but if the evidence is that they're already more advanced than we know the question is
[2:37:40.860 --> 2:37:48.060]  have they already attempted to merge or is it all a bunch of quackery where they claim
[2:37:48.060 --> 2:37:53.420]  that they have these systems but they can't even really use them because they don't understand
[2:37:53.420 --> 2:37:59.860]  them yeah well they already have a whole list of things lined up they're working on
[2:37:59.860 --> 2:38:06.780]  now even DARPA has admitted that homeland security I mentioned that on a page last week
[2:38:06.780 --> 2:38:12.140]  all things are coming up and they're working on and one was an artificially intelligent
[2:38:12.140 --> 2:38:17.740]  computer system that would literally analyze you and decide even if you should pass the
[2:38:17.740 --> 2:38:21.140]  information that you're putting out there on to others or not or who they should pass
[2:38:21.140 --> 2:38:25.580]  it on to no one would interfere with it it would be on its own independent and so they
[2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:30.980]  already have artificial intelligent machines using various kinds of different algorithm
[2:38:30.980 --> 2:38:37.020]  algorithms and so on however at the top you can understand too that they've been doing
[2:38:37.020 --> 2:38:42.700]  amazing stuff even in Sweden for since the 70s that we know of on prisoners that's where
[2:38:42.700 --> 2:38:50.260]  they first try to do human and machine interface brain interface this interfacing isn't just
[2:38:50.260 --> 2:38:56.380]  to help paraplegics believe me like DARPA would have you think it's to do with if they can
[2:38:56.380 --> 2:39:01.540]  possibly in the future or if they've done it already who knows download a person's memory
[2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:08.260]  that's the whole point of it all for the ruling elite who age they can certainly slow their
[2:39:08.260 --> 2:39:13.700]  aging in fact David Suzuki a big player in the greening program who calls people maggots
[2:39:13.700 --> 2:39:18.180]  by the way he's their hero of Canada the people are maggots but he says there's better kinds
[2:39:18.180 --> 2:39:23.700]  of maggots than others I guess he's referring to his own class but he said on television
[2:39:23.700 --> 2:39:28.900]  years ago national television life that says we now and he's a geneticist by the way he
[2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:34.460]  says we now have the ability to make a person live to 500 years if we want to well why not
[2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:39.420]  a thousand or two thousand the problem is the brain but tend to deteriorate so the idea
[2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:44.180]  even mentioned years ago in the science magazines if we could possibly clone and he said they
[2:39:44.180 --> 2:39:49.020]  could by the way clone a full human being within two weeks because they can switch on
[2:39:49.020 --> 2:39:53.020]  your growth fighters near hormones and so on make you literally grow up from an embryo
[2:39:53.020 --> 2:39:58.700]  into into a whole human in a few weeks and at first they said it was for body parts for
[2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:05.900]  special people but now it's more into no could they possibly take the memory of that aged
[2:40:05.900 --> 2:40:11.740]  person especially the first batch who haven't stayed young put it that way if they haven't
[2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:15.900]  had the treatment for eternal youth but could we possibly take that memory from the aged
[2:40:15.900 --> 2:40:21.820]  person and transfer it into his own clone and and so they've been talking about this
[2:40:21.820 --> 2:40:26.020]  and working on it obviously and that's what really the brain machine interface has been
[2:40:26.020 --> 2:40:31.380]  all about and again the spin-offs are amazing because they also say well if you can tap
[2:40:31.380 --> 2:40:36.060]  into the brain we won't need to torture techniques anymore we need to plug into you and find
[2:40:36.060 --> 2:40:40.420]  out what you're thinking download all your memories and don't know exactly if you've
[2:40:40.420 --> 2:40:45.340]  been lying to them or not this is all been going ahead as we quietly watch soccer or
[2:40:45.340 --> 2:40:50.940]  football or whatever else we're watching or Lady Gaga dancing with plasticized corpses
[2:40:50.940 --> 2:40:57.860]  I mean this is the this is that the reality of where we are the elites prime directive
[2:40:57.860 --> 2:41:03.220]  is for their own survival you must always remember that they have contingency plans
[2:41:03.220 --> 2:41:07.900]  for all kinds of things that could go wrong in the world for themselves we know they've
[2:41:07.900 --> 2:41:13.180]  got underground cities even they've even had characters in England going around the
[2:41:13.180 --> 2:41:17.420]  underground bases not getting into them but they admit they're there and they've had them
[2:41:17.420 --> 2:41:22.460]  for years in case there's of all kinds of things not just nuclear disaster but possibly
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:26.820]  all an asteroid hitting you anything at all they can think of because the elite being
[2:41:26.820 --> 2:41:30.580]  at the top of the tree the evolution trees they talk about it themselves that's what
[2:41:30.580 --> 2:41:36.740]  they say the fittest to survive must make sure must ensure that their own personal survival
[2:41:36.740 --> 2:41:41.740]  comes first we are all expendable in the process that's right now in sci-fi movies show you
[2:41:41.740 --> 2:41:48.700]  that like 2012 it's always the elite to survive the rest are sacrificed absolutely and expanding
[2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:55.580]  on that just like I knew they were about to move from the Muslim al-qaeda to the white
[2:41:55.580 --> 2:42:01.740]  terrorist so the whole apparatus could be turned loose on everyone as it was always built
[2:42:01.740 --> 2:42:11.060]  and designed for now they're just admitting it's a true function that they are now preconditioning
[2:42:11.060 --> 2:42:19.380]  how sexy it is the world after humans TV shows movies books on in caps at grocery stores
[2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:24.980]  everyone learning how trendy it is to hate their fellow humans so when you're swat teamed
[2:42:24.980 --> 2:42:30.500]  or drug away or dying of cancer when half your blocks dying of something you know as
[2:42:30.500 --> 2:42:38.540]  the soft kill is incrementally intensified the ambient slow kill system accelerated towards
[2:42:38.540 --> 2:42:47.980]  fast kill that it's it's it's a subconscious preparation of a celebration of our destruction
[2:42:47.980 --> 2:42:54.100]  and the potbellied parasites ruling over us and I see this now building towards a crescendo
[2:42:54.100 --> 2:43:00.340]  I know they'll want to really smaller bioplegs first poses saviors use that as an excuse
[2:43:00.340 --> 2:43:04.740]  to put in a tighter control grid and then release even more deadly plagues and then
[2:43:04.740 --> 2:43:10.140]  a tighter control grid always playing the part of the saviors while they murder us but
[2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:15.500]  I see them edging towards that and I see them debating you know how great it's going to
[2:43:15.500 --> 2:43:19.620]  be when the airborne Ebola is released and how great it is that the human mouse pox kills
[2:43:19.620 --> 2:43:26.220]  99% and isn't it time to just go ahead and pull the trigger like it's an exciting sexy
[2:43:26.220 --> 2:43:32.460]  something new for them and they want to pull the moon raker trigger how far away do you
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:36.780]  think that is till they I mean they got all these new movies coming out with Matt Damon
[2:43:36.780 --> 2:43:44.740]  about billions dying and everything from the new biopleg so so how long till they really
[2:43:44.740 --> 2:43:48.940]  get to have their holiday their their mass murder enjoyment time because then they get
[2:43:48.940 --> 2:43:53.580]  to go to the bunkers and you know be given the cure and everything and kind of all be
[2:43:53.580 --> 2:43:58.220]  honest about it and watch it on their robotic cameras the mass destruction and then they
[2:43:58.220 --> 2:44:04.380]  get to reemerge and everything so much fun I mean how long till they till they take the
[2:44:04.380 --> 2:44:09.460]  people that they've turned into mindless sports fans and just start mass slaughtering everybody
[2:44:09.460 --> 2:44:16.100]  well we're we're in the phase now which they have disclosed from their own military think
[2:44:16.100 --> 2:44:21.900]  tanks for the next 50 years or so their projections and they've had that up for a few years now
[2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:28.860]  and the both the U.S. and the British NATO group came to the same conclusions they're
[2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:32.980]  going to and they're doing it they're getting folk off the land the rural areas through
[2:44:32.980 --> 2:44:40.420]  incredible masses of new regulations the gasoline is going up I'll get you off to the close
[2:44:40.420 --> 2:44:44.740]  down most of the country hospitals so you have to move into the city if you want treatment
[2:44:44.740 --> 2:44:49.380]  that a hundred different ways to get you to move just like animals again how do we get
[2:44:49.380 --> 2:44:55.380]  them to move from here to there and it's all been discussed and so once we're all in the
[2:44:55.380 --> 2:45:00.140]  already overcrowded cities they've already got an internal army a rand by the way I've
[2:45:00.140 --> 2:45:04.740]  got the rand document on that too where they talked about the coming civil strife in the
[2:45:04.740 --> 2:45:09.100]  U.S. as they as they push more and more folk into the overcrowded cities so they always
[2:45:09.100 --> 2:45:14.060]  plan ahead for the for the fallout and once we're together it's easier then to release
[2:45:14.060 --> 2:45:20.500]  the plagues now they're talking up to the year 2020 to try crammers into the cities
[2:45:20.500 --> 2:45:25.580]  that's why they're on a roll now with austerity austerity suddenly comes in after that the
[2:45:25.580 --> 2:45:32.140]  last planned bank crash which wasn't a crash at all really and things didn't just go to
[2:45:32.140 --> 2:45:38.140]  money heaven somebody's got the key to it but the reality is this is austerity and we've
[2:45:38.140 --> 2:45:42.540]  also got to share and reduce our standard of living and eventually the United Nations
[2:45:42.540 --> 2:45:47.020]  as it says in its own charter for the Department of Agriculture will dish out the food they'll
[2:45:47.020 --> 2:45:52.380]  dole out the food to each region off the earth and then you must bring down your own population
[2:45:52.380 --> 2:45:56.300]  according to the rations that you're given that's in their own mandates by the way yeah
[2:45:56.300 --> 2:46:01.340]  that's in the Kissinger documents and all of the new ones but instead of doing it secretly
[2:46:01.340 --> 2:46:07.260]  like 30 years ago now Ted Turner comes out with Nat Rothschild and says you should only
[2:46:07.260 --> 2:46:11.540]  be able to have one child and that child to be taxed but then meanwhile they've all got
[2:46:11.540 --> 2:46:18.340]  private jets and private trains and yachts and you know five children a piece and you
[2:46:18.340 --> 2:46:24.180]  know Kate Middleton is lecturing you on carbon taxes and we've now moved into a cottage it's
[2:46:24.180 --> 2:46:32.100]  only 300 rooms for the earth I mean it's just all asinine hypocrisy in our face
[2:46:33.060 --> 2:46:36.660]  yes but from the point of view they don't see that is that because they do but they
[2:46:36.660 --> 2:46:42.820]  truly believe that they are superior people genetically and they believe that they've evolved
[2:46:42.820 --> 2:46:47.700]  we're junk genes we're the junk genes left at the bottom and one of the arguments I saw in a
[2:46:47.700 --> 2:46:53.460]  scientific discussion was the the proof of the fact that the people are junk genes is
[2:46:54.100 --> 2:46:58.580]  that they would have they would have been up amongst the elite if they had the ability to get ahead
[2:46:59.460 --> 2:47:04.580]  in their genetic makeup therefore because they haven't gone up to multimillionaire status
[2:47:04.580 --> 2:47:10.660]  and have no desire to then they equate that to what they call arrested civilizations of Africa
[2:47:10.660 --> 2:47:15.940]  and primitive tribes they're junk genes they can't move on we have we do move on all the time
[2:47:15.940 --> 2:47:21.380]  and we're involved in planning the future we control the future exactly moving on is being
[2:47:21.380 --> 2:47:27.940]  well willing to slit your grandmother's throat and enjoy it the true human genes of helping
[2:47:27.940 --> 2:47:34.340]  your community building being admired because of your art or your strength or your ability to
[2:47:34.340 --> 2:47:41.460]  hunt or your ability to build uh no no no now it's your ability to team up in gangs and lie
[2:47:41.460 --> 2:47:46.740]  and manipulate people and dumb folks down and make things ugly and that's why they're selling us
[2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:53.620]  with Lady Gaga with the dead chinese corpses just openly flaunting look i'm dancing with murdered
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:58.500]  prisoners it's beautiful that way no one will stand up for you when you're being murdered
[2:47:58.500 --> 2:48:04.420]  also that about people who are debased and thoroughly dehumanized do not stand up together
[2:48:04.420 --> 2:48:10.500]  for anything and so it's a warfare technique as well and you use you use cultural wars all the
[2:48:10.500 --> 2:48:15.860]  time and economic wars all the time as well but these elites you see are really the deviants and
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:23.620]  we understand that because uh in the psychopathic nature of humanity that the groups that inbred
[2:48:23.620 --> 2:48:30.340]  over time were the ones that uh slaughtered their neighbors and it took over the land and then and
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:35.220]  that's really real estate was always land that's real estate as opposed to fake estate you know
[2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:40.260]  which is the money system which we believe and we've been taught to believe in it and uh but in
[2:48:40.260 --> 2:48:47.380]  reality that they became kings and queens and nobles because they had the ability to always
[2:48:47.380 --> 2:48:53.700]  slaughter anybody for as an example to others at any time at all and uh and and they they've actually
[2:48:53.700 --> 2:48:59.460]  got books out trying to rationalize the the necessity for this kind of behavior and that
[2:48:59.460 --> 2:49:03.940]  mankind can't do without without them that's what they say themselves we can't do without them
[2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:09.620]  because they're the risk takers etc etc but in reality we're we're run by clubs of psychopaths
[2:49:09.620 --> 2:49:15.620]  and breads uh so the deviants run the normal people the ordinary people who can get along and
[2:49:15.620 --> 2:49:21.460]  who can cooperate for their own survival the elites are afraid of the masses uh even though
[2:49:21.460 --> 2:49:26.020]  they've used the masses that they see the time is coming when they will no longer need them because
[2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:33.860]  they can then create a specific job created uh uh human or beings for the specific tasks that we
[2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:38.660]  used to do the ordinary folk used to do and that that's what all this work is about they're using
[2:49:38.660 --> 2:49:44.100]  our tax money like crazy to make this happen to ensure their survival whether we serve with all
[2:49:44.100 --> 2:49:50.580]  kinds of uh chimeras basically they're especially bred for the purpose that they will do all their
[2:49:50.580 --> 2:49:57.060]  lives and and that's going on at breakneck speed uh undoubtedly these chimeras are out walking the
[2:49:57.060 --> 2:50:01.940]  streets now this has been going on for decades and they're just now telling the slaves this because
[2:50:01.940 --> 2:50:07.540]  they think they've got us into a deep enough trance but i'm here to tell you alan i'm seeing
[2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:14.260]  record numbers of people waking up and i mean fully waking up uh how do you uh break people out of
[2:50:14.260 --> 2:50:22.180]  their trance you you have to you have to start with them by telling them why their dollar is
[2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:26.580]  being divided something they can understand it it hits them personally telling them why their
[2:50:26.580 --> 2:50:30.820]  families are breaking up or their daughter's gone off with another woman or something like that
[2:50:30.820 --> 2:50:35.540]  and that's gonna say where it's coming from and and what's the purpose is behind it things that
[2:50:35.540 --> 2:50:41.140]  he can actually relate to in their own lives and that's the start of it all yeah yeah i found

[2:55:54.420 --> 2:55:59.300]  got to awaken folks uh i got you on here alan originally because i wanted to talk about this
[2:55:59.300 --> 2:56:05.140]  shooter who we now knows on drugs and and all the rest of it i mean this is i could see the
[2:56:05.140 --> 2:56:09.700]  predictive programming i could see the media getting ready to rebrand terrorism onto the
[2:56:09.700 --> 2:56:14.660]  evil white male and i i called it last thursday i said the attacks imminent and and and that's
[2:56:14.660 --> 2:56:19.780]  what you talk about once you see the fifth grade level propaganda you know exactly what they're
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:24.660]  going to do it's so frustrating to like you said being the fool on the hill but really you're not
[2:56:24.660 --> 2:56:28.980]  the fool on the hill everybody else is deaf dumb and blind alan what final comments on that
[2:56:29.780 --> 2:56:33.300]  yeah it's like deja vu you know what's coming and what they have to do because
[2:56:33.300 --> 2:56:40.340]  even even to do with the the big bone of contention from the whole 9-11 deal onwards across the world
[2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:46.980]  the western world and in britain and elsewhere is why should everyone else have to uh go through all
[2:56:46.980 --> 2:56:54.500]  of this have all of their mail ripped open have all their emails uh uh copied and and stored forever
[2:56:54.500 --> 2:56:59.380]  be under the scrutiny of the microscope how come everybody and supposedly it was all to do
[2:56:59.380 --> 2:57:05.220]  with starts started off with muslim extremists and in the middle east and elsewhere and so
[2:57:05.220 --> 2:57:10.100]  people were saying why are why are all ladies who've lived up to all their life in america
[2:57:10.100 --> 2:57:14.820]  with blue eyes and all granny being searched and groped at the at the at these particular check
[2:57:14.820 --> 2:57:19.780]  out but that was a bonus contention now they've given you a reason why it could be any one of
[2:57:19.780 --> 2:57:25.380]  you you see is a white guy and so they have to justify all it could be a policeman it could be
[2:57:25.380 --> 2:57:31.860]  a policeman oh it's the returning veterans exactly and they had so they had to give you a reason why
[2:57:31.860 --> 2:57:36.900]  because for since 9-11 to the present you see we haven't seen it and so they've given you the
[2:57:36.900 --> 2:57:43.140]  sacrificial lamb or whoever those set ups whatever uh guy that's set up to do it and remember too
[2:57:43.140 --> 2:57:47.460]  we'll never get the truth on this story never ever get the truth if his fellow did go over to
[2:57:47.460 --> 2:57:52.740]  london and meet with the top ranking secret supposedly and makes tamper's group or was or
[2:57:52.740 --> 2:57:59.300]  were they a bunch of of cia mi6 most bad guys conning this little fool to go and do this job
[2:57:59.300 --> 2:58:05.780]  we'll never know we'll never know but it's got all the earmarks that it was staged yeah it does it
[2:58:05.780 --> 2:58:10.580]  does and and believe me in this day and age you cannot get do anything and get away without without
[2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:16.980]  people knowing about it we're all under observation and it even even admitted that the cia were watching
[2:58:16.980 --> 2:58:24.660]  this guy and now so is mi so is mi5 and 6 uh oh and of course the forums too that you belong to
[2:58:24.660 --> 2:58:29.700]  yeah no it's it's a hundred percent staged and now we know he's all hopped up on drugs he'll end up
[2:58:29.700 --> 2:58:35.460]  going into the mental institution there and never be seen again uh alan watt great points thank you
