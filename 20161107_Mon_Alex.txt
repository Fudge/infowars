[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[00:07.840 --> 00:09.560]  be followed.
[00:09.560 --> 00:15.040]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for
[00:15.040 --> 00:17.360]  launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:17.360 --> 00:23.720]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[00:23.720 --> 00:25.680]  like any other attack.
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.680]  We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[00:30.680 --> 00:35.800]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for
[00:35.800 --> 00:37.480]  Hillary, it's war.
[00:37.480 --> 00:42.560]  We came, we saw, we died.
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.760]  With her you'll end up in World War II.
[00:44.760 --> 00:48.600]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.640]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.360]  to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:58.360 --> 01:02.760]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[01:02.760 --> 01:08.600]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed
[01:08.600 --> 01:10.840]  reports of further hacking.
[01:10.840 --> 01:13.520]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:13.520 --> 01:14.760]  Of course not, because she's-
[01:14.760 --> 01:16.880]  Look, there's a really loud noise.
[01:16.880 --> 01:21.920]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:21.920 --> 01:28.080]  We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[01:28.080 --> 01:57.920]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:57.920 --> 02:12.760]  For the past 17 months, I've traveled across this nation and met the amazing people of
[02:12.760 --> 02:14.160]  our country.
[02:14.160 --> 02:18.720]  Their hopes have become my hopes and their dreams have become my dreams.
[02:18.720 --> 02:21.720]  This is not just a campaign, it's a movement.
[02:21.720 --> 02:26.400]  It's a once in a lifetime chance to take our government back from the donors and the special
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.280]  interests and return the power to you, the American people.
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.720]  15 days ago, I proposed my contract with the American voter and a 100-day action plan to
[02:36.720 --> 02:39.320]  bring real change to Washington.
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.640]  We need change so badly.
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.420]  If we win on November 8th, an elected Republican House and Senate, we can finally deliver the
[02:46.420 --> 02:48.960]  change the American people deserve.
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.120]  My contract includes a plan to create 25 million new jobs.
[02:53.120 --> 02:59.880]  We will cut taxes on the middle class Americans by 35 percent, and we will repeal and replace
[02:59.880 --> 03:03.360]  the total disaster known as Obamacare.
[03:03.360 --> 03:05.040]  It doesn't work.
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.480]  We will also immediately fix our terrible trade deals and stop the jobs from leaving
[03:09.480 --> 03:10.680]  our country.
[03:10.680 --> 03:16.960]  My contract includes a pledge to end illegal immigration and end it rapidly, cancel federal
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.120]  funding for sanctuary cities, and suspend the admission of Syrian refugees into our
[03:22.120 --> 03:23.200]  country.
[03:23.200 --> 03:30.440]  They're coming in by the thousands, and Hillary Clinton wants to increase that by 600 percent.
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.520]  We will rebuild our badly depleted military and take care of our great, great veterans.
[03:35.520 --> 03:39.240]  We will give every parent in America the right to send their kids to the school of their
[03:39.240 --> 03:45.840]  choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.840]  so long for generations, in fact, by the Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton.
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.120]  They just haven't been able to do the job.
[03:55.120 --> 04:00.720]  They've treated African-Americans and Hispanics horribly in so many ways.
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.160]  We will undertake a national effort to reduce crime and poverty and bring jobs and safety
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.000]  to our inner cities finally at last.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.520]  We will restore the Constitution and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same.
[04:14.520 --> 04:18.520]  At the center of my contract is my plan to end government corruption.
[04:18.520 --> 04:22.480]  Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United
[04:22.480 --> 04:29.400]  States, and if she were to win, it would create a constitutional crisis like no other.
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.080]  She is under multiple federal investigations, has committed many crimes, including perjury,
[04:35.080 --> 04:38.720]  and she is now facing the prospect of a federal indictment.
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.320]  It's time to close the history books on the Clintons and to open a bright new chapter focused
[04:43.320 --> 04:45.800]  on the great citizens of our country.
[04:45.800 --> 04:51.400]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress
[04:51.400 --> 04:56.800]  so that we can finally change this broken system and make America great again.
[04:56.800 --> 05:25.280]  And when I say great, I mean great for everyone.
[05:25.280 --> 05:32.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[05:36.280 --> 05:43.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[05:43.280 --> 05:50.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[05:50.280 --> 05:57.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[05:57.280 --> 06:01.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[06:01.280 --> 06:08.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[06:08.280 --> 06:16.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[06:16.280 --> 06:24.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[06:24.280 --> 06:28.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[06:28.280 --> 06:35.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[06:35.280 --> 06:45.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[06:45.280 --> 06:53.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[06:58.280 --> 07:06.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[07:06.280 --> 07:14.280]  I'm asking for your vote and your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress.
[07:14.280 --> 07:22.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[07:22.280 --> 07:26.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[07:26.280 --> 07:34.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[07:34.280 --> 07:38.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[07:38.280 --> 07:46.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[07:46.280 --> 07:50.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[07:50.280 --> 07:59.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[07:59.280 --> 08:03.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[08:03.280 --> 08:11.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[08:15.280 --> 08:24.280]  It's time to close the history books on the United States and to open a bright new chapter
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.280]  focused on the great citizens of our country.
[08:28.280 --> 08:35.280]  I should say that you could cut the tension in the air with a knife is a cliche, but it's absolutely true.
[08:35.280 --> 08:38.280]  I have never felt such suspense in my life.
[08:38.280 --> 08:43.280]  Quite frankly, not even when I was about to see my wife have our first child.
[08:43.280 --> 08:46.280]  This is the only thing I can describe it like.
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.280]  And the reason this is even more important than that is all of my children's lives are on the line now.
[08:51.280 --> 08:56.280]  Our entire future, our culture, our world, it couldn't be bigger.
[08:56.280 --> 08:58.280]  It's not the real else, the stamina of Trump.
[08:58.280 --> 09:00.280]  No one's ever shown anything like this.
[09:00.280 --> 09:05.280]  Not a 25-year-old special forces soldier.
[09:05.280 --> 09:10.280]  The will, the fact that he's taken so many attacks, the fact that he's so honorable,
[09:10.280 --> 09:15.280]  the fact that he hasn't wavered or faltered.
[09:15.280 --> 09:17.280]  And you know a man by his enemies.
[09:17.280 --> 09:20.280]  The enemies of Donald Trump are legion.
[09:20.280 --> 09:25.280]  The communist Chinese president has lectured the American people as they prepare to take over all six Hollywood studios.
[09:25.280 --> 09:27.280]  That's official.
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.280]  The Chinese government is making fun of folks today and saying this is just the way it is.
[09:31.280 --> 09:32.280]  Learn to be dominated.
[09:32.280 --> 09:33.280]  We have been sold out.
[09:33.280 --> 09:36.280]  We have been absolutely turned over.
[09:36.280 --> 09:40.280]  And as Trump has said over and over again, this is America's last chance.
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.280]  This is America's last stand without probably a violent revolution, which we don't want to have,
[09:46.280 --> 09:48.280]  to try to turn this thing around.
[09:48.280 --> 09:52.280]  This is such an epic time to be alive.
[09:52.280 --> 09:56.280]  Trump has already won the election, whether they steal it from him, whether he wins in a landslide,
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.280]  the evidence shows that's where it's going.
[09:59.280 --> 10:05.280]  Because he has introduced Americanism, not globalism, to the world.
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.280]  He has brought out 1776 worldwide, Americanism, not globalism.
[10:10.280 --> 10:16.280]  He has brought forward the private cell reserve, the big mega banks that are tax-exempt and set up trade deals
[10:16.280 --> 10:18.280]  to make us poor and consolidate wealth.
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.280]  He has exposed the secret that they don't want a middle class and that it's by design.
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.280]  And now the WikiLeaks come out with them saying they want to make us poor, keep us in the dark,
[10:27.280 --> 10:29.280]  keep us dumb under their control.
[10:29.280 --> 10:35.280]  They want to destroy healthcare with Obamacare to then have foreign multinationals come in and rip you off even worse.
[10:35.280 --> 10:38.280]  It's all so cold-blooded.
[10:38.280 --> 10:41.280]  People keep saying Assange was supposed to release stuff that would destroy Hillary.
[10:41.280 --> 10:43.280]  It has destroyed her.
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.280]  The mainstream media is just propping up the facade.
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.280]  Obama has been caught telling the federal government, Congress, the FBI, the world,
[10:51.280 --> 10:53.280]  that he was never talking to Hillary in secret emails.
[10:53.280 --> 10:55.280]  In fact, he didn't even know about secret emails.
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.280]  It turns out they were engaging in thousands of emails between each other.
[10:59.280 --> 11:06.280]  And they said, in the new WikiLeaks, two weeks ago, the data dump 27 or something, we're up to 50 now.
[11:06.280 --> 11:12.280]  Just on Podesta, one guy in their system, it's this corrupt, where they're saying, we got to cover this up.
[11:12.280 --> 11:17.280]  POTUS has been using another server and his own secret email. They all do it.
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.280]  The first window into this was the head of the EPA.
[11:23.280 --> 11:25.280]  Remember, five years ago, she had to step down.
[11:25.280 --> 11:30.280]  She got caught with a fake server, fake name, double set of books. This is so huge.
[11:30.280 --> 11:36.280]  And Trump has won by making it okay to stand up to the bullies, the political correctness that want to shut down free speech.
[11:36.280 --> 11:45.280]  Trump has won because he's helped put the nail in the coffin, the final straw on the camel's back of MSM.
[11:45.280 --> 11:55.280]  Wall Street Journal and others reported last week that revenue in the third quarter for MSM newspapers is now 97.5%.
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.280]  That is supposedly one of your best quarters normally.
[11:58.280 --> 12:06.280]  That is total and complete free, full, cardiac arrest, dead on the table.
[12:06.280 --> 12:12.280]  We knew the dinosaur media was one of its last legs. You can stick a fork in it now.
[12:12.280 --> 12:19.280]  We're kicking off a 52-hour global transmission right now at infowars.com forward slash show.
[12:19.280 --> 12:22.280]  Our affiliates pick up the four-hour daytime radio show.
[12:22.280 --> 12:28.280]  Infowars live, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. We have the nightly news every night, 7 o'clock central.
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.280]  A comeback Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. with an abbreviated live broadcast.
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.280]  We broadcast Saturday. We did a special show. This is obviously so important, so historical.
[12:38.280 --> 12:40.280]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.280]  In the next 52 hours, and quite frankly, we're going to go past that.
[12:43.280 --> 12:48.280]  But from now until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, we're going to be live.
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.280]  Except for, like, 2 or 3, 4 in the morning, we're going to air some documentaries and special reports that are really powerful.
[12:53.280 --> 12:59.280]  But we're going to be here with a live feed going out, transmission.
[12:59.280 --> 13:06.280]  Unscripted, teleprompter-free, telling the truth with a huge raft of incredible guests, some of which we never had on the show,
[13:06.280 --> 13:09.280]  that are going to be here in studio. Roger Stone's going to get here tonight.
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.280]  He's having to stay in D.C. over Supreme Court with their cases of, quote, voter intimidation,
[13:13.280 --> 13:19.280]  trying to have basic exit polls, which is totally legal and lawful, under State Department guidelines.
[13:19.280 --> 13:25.280]  That looks like it's going to Supreme Court because he just won in federal court at the highest level below the Supreme Court.
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.280]  But he's going to be here by tomorrow with us during the live 52-hour broadcast.
[13:30.280 --> 13:35.280]  And you're part of overthrowing the mainstream media and further showing how pathetic they are.
[13:35.280 --> 13:38.280]  Guess how many views? And this isn't about info wars.
[13:38.280 --> 13:41.280]  It's about just how they're such a joke.
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.280]  In the New York Times, it's Trump's last stand. He's a big loser. CNN keeps saying he's going to lose.
[13:45.280 --> 13:52.280]  Hillary's already measuring the drapes. You know, he's way behind as they sample 9 to 46 points more.
[13:52.280 --> 13:58.280]  The lowest 9, the highest 50. I've actually seen 50% before, but 46 is usually as high as they go.
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.280]  Then guess who does it? CNN.
[14:00.280 --> 14:07.280]  46% more people in three polls they've done after debates where they sample 40% plus more Democrats.
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.280]  And then say Hillary's winning by 68. She should be winning by 90 something at that.
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.280]  I mean, this is crazy, folks, how rigged it is.
[14:15.280 --> 14:22.280]  And even with rigged polls, with 9, 12, 14, 20 points in the battlegrounds, he's two, five, six, eight, 10 points ahead.
[14:22.280 --> 14:27.280]  This is a tsunami against globalism, a total referendum.
[14:27.280 --> 14:33.280]  So even if they steal it, we have all the WikiLeaks, how they rig the polls, how they give the questions beforehand to CNN,
[14:33.280 --> 14:38.280]  how the White House runs CNN, how the White House tells Wolf Blitzer what to do in the interview,
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.280]  how Stephanopoulos is told what to do before an interview.
[14:42.280 --> 14:48.280]  Of course he is. He's the former Clinton Chief of Staff. I don't need WikiLeaks to know this.
[14:48.280 --> 14:51.280]  And please, Stephanopoulos, get out of the country.
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.280]  Look, whether you steal it from Trump or not, we all hate you. You have no ratings.
[14:54.280 --> 15:01.280]  Please, you un-American piece of trash. Move to North Korea with that piece of filth.
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.280]  Towards Sauros. I think it's the Yardies here because they were showing me the numbers.
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.280]  He and Tim Proget. And I just said, just come on here and talk about this.
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.280]  And it's not to brag, but it's what I was getting at.
[15:12.280 --> 15:18.280]  It's what I was getting at because Info Wars is just one of dozens of now large organizations fighting the New World Order.
[15:18.280 --> 15:25.280]  We're rated by the top web rating agencies out there, 172 on the World Wide Web.
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.280]  That's bigger than the Wall Street Journal, bigger than CNN, bigger than all these garbage trucks.
[15:29.280 --> 15:35.280]  And by the way, CNN does stuff like every day take their whole catalog of five-year-old stories
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.280]  and repost it digitally to lie on the search engines and repush.
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.280]  And they've got fake Twitter followers, fake Facebook. We have none of that. We don't do any of that.
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.280]  Well, CNN has hundreds of millions of dollars of funding, too, from drug companies and so on.
[15:48.280 --> 15:50.280]  That's right. Let's turn this mic up. I can barely hear it.
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.280]  So check this out. Infowars.com. You talk about, we could sit up here all day.
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.280]  We could talk about WikiLeaks. We could talk about whatever.
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.280]  We could talk about them giving the debate questions to Hillary ahead of time.
[16:01.280 --> 16:03.280]  Just talk about how the media, the so-called establishment media...
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.280]  They're ringing everything, but they won't rig the election as the president comes out and says,
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.280]  Letty Legal's vote.
[16:09.280 --> 16:11.280]  Okay, but we could say that they're dying, right?
[16:11.280 --> 16:16.280]  We could talk about their transmogrification of reality, how they just skew everything and make it seem like they're so big.
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.280]  But nothing really does it like actual hard numbers, okay?
[16:20.280 --> 16:25.280]  And Quantcast, which is one of the most reputable ranking websites in the world, here's the funny part.
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.280]  These numbers that we're about to talk about, these are still behind.
[16:28.280 --> 16:32.280]  They don't even totally match our Google Analytics for Infowars, okay?
[16:32.280 --> 16:38.280]  So the Google Analytics, which is the back-end systems that totally track the real-time numbers, are higher than this.
[16:38.280 --> 16:42.280]  But now we can see, because Alexa... Alexa's kind of a joke now.
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.280]  Two years ago, they de-listed every conservative and libertarian side by 80%.
[16:46.280 --> 16:47.280]  Right.
[16:47.280 --> 16:49.280]  And then they boosted by 80% all the others in total fraud.
[16:49.280 --> 16:50.280]  Right.
[16:50.280 --> 16:51.280]  But check this out.
[16:51.280 --> 16:52.280]  That's Bezos, though, who's the top Democrat.
[16:52.280 --> 16:53.280]  Amazon bought it, right?
[16:53.280 --> 16:57.280]  So Infowars now 172 rank 172 in the United States.
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.280]  That means of all the billions of websites in the world, you can imagine all of them out there.
[17:01.280 --> 17:06.280]  Infowars is 172, the 172nd thing.
[17:06.280 --> 17:11.280]  And Infowars, quite frankly, we know from Google, is only about 20% or 25% of our traffic.
[17:11.280 --> 17:13.280]  It's all our other platforms.
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.280]  My God, that's why even the New York Times now in the Washington Post said,
[17:17.280 --> 17:19.280]  oh no, there's nothing as big as Alex Jones.
[17:19.280 --> 17:20.280]  Well, there is.
[17:20.280 --> 17:23.280]  It's called DrudgeReport.com, bigger than all Facebook traffic, not just news,
[17:23.280 --> 17:25.280]  and the New York Times combined.
[17:25.280 --> 17:26.280]  Let's talk about DrudgeReport.com.
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.280]  DrudgeReport.com, you know, two people, Drudge and one great fellow that helps him,
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.280]  working 18 hours a day because they have passion, never compromising,
[17:36.280 --> 17:40.280]  is really what helped blow the door open for Trump, for Infowars.
[17:40.280 --> 17:41.280]  We would already be huge.
[17:41.280 --> 17:42.280]  But let's just give the credit.
[17:42.280 --> 17:47.280]  In the revolution against the New World Order, the number one most valuable player isn't Nigel Farage.
[17:47.280 --> 17:48.280]  It isn't Donald Trump.
[17:48.280 --> 17:49.280]  It isn't Alex Jones.
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.280]  It's Matt Drudge.
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.280]  And Matt doesn't want that credit.
[17:51.280 --> 17:52.280]  You're getting it.
[17:52.280 --> 17:53.280]  You showed up first.
[17:53.280 --> 17:54.280]  You did it the longest.
[17:54.280 --> 17:56.280]  You broke through the big stories.
[17:56.280 --> 17:58.280]  You broke the mainstream media's control.
[17:58.280 --> 18:00.280]  You did it.
[18:00.280 --> 18:01.280]  So, there you go.
[18:01.280 --> 18:03.280]  And again, and again, Trump's already won.
[18:03.280 --> 18:04.280]  I don't care.
[18:04.280 --> 18:05.280]  Have they steal it?
[18:05.280 --> 18:06.280]  What?
[18:06.280 --> 18:07.280]  It doesn't matter.
[18:07.280 --> 18:08.280]  Let them steal it.
[18:08.280 --> 18:09.280]  I've looked at it.
[18:09.280 --> 18:10.280]  That's even better.
[18:10.280 --> 18:11.280]  Okay.
[18:11.280 --> 18:12.280]  Now, because let me tell you, they're going to sabotage Trump.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.280]  They're going to attack from every angle.
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.280]  They're going to plunge the economy like they're doing with Brexit.
[18:15.280 --> 18:16.280]  It's going to be a hard fight.
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.280]  They're dumb enough to steal this thing with that ailing witch and stick her up there.
[18:20.280 --> 18:21.280]  Woo!
[18:21.280 --> 18:22.280]  Baby, throw me in that briar patch.
[18:22.280 --> 18:24.780]  I mean, and we've got their whole narrative down.
[18:24.780 --> 18:27.020]  I got it from inside Intel and it's all coming out.
[18:27.020 --> 18:31.280]  The alt-rights totally discredited now after Hillary even took Texas.
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.120]  This is the script they're writing of their dumb enough to pull it and even took Utah
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.280]  why in Georgia, my God, everyone love the Republican Party has fallen and their own leadership
[18:40.280 --> 18:43.040]  will say, yes, we're over because they're Democratic operatives.
[18:43.040 --> 18:46.360]  We've got Paul Ryan and the emails behind the scenes with Supreme Court Justice crap
[18:46.360 --> 18:47.360]  with Hillary.
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.040]  I mean, they're going to sit there and act like we've all been discredited when the
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.720]  mainstream media is gone, 97 plus percent drop in revenue, all going bankrupt.
[18:56.720 --> 18:57.720]  Everyone hates you.
[18:57.720 --> 18:58.720]  We're exploding.
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.720]  Everyone hates you.
[18:59.720 --> 19:00.720]  Everybody loves us.
[19:00.720 --> 19:01.720]  Everybody hates you.
[19:01.720 --> 19:02.720]  Oh, there it is.
[19:02.720 --> 19:03.720]  Florida shock.
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.720]  Drudge.
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.320]  Trump outperforms Romney by 1,130,000 in early voting.
[19:08.320 --> 19:09.880]  Oh, that was the thing.
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.880]  New York Times.
[19:10.880 --> 19:19.000]  New York Times, CNN, all of them running around over and over again, Anthony, saying she's
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.480]  going to win an early voting in places like Florida.
[19:22.480 --> 19:26.160]  And then when it came in, even though they were stuffing and they've been clot stuffing,
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.040]  Trump's way ahead, they are in crap, your pants.
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.120]  That's why she suddenly in all these blue states, they claim she has firmly.
[19:32.120 --> 19:34.280]  She does not have Pennsylvania firmly.
[19:34.280 --> 19:36.640]  She does not have New York firmly.
[19:36.640 --> 19:37.640]  Internal Trump polling.
[19:37.640 --> 19:38.640]  They don't want out.
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.080]  They don't want you in real polls have shown him the entire time 30 points ahead of her
[19:43.080 --> 19:44.160]  in New York.
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.320]  Here's the problem.
[19:45.320 --> 19:47.440]  There aren't hardly any Republicans registered.
[19:47.440 --> 19:49.120]  The Democrats run it all.
[19:49.120 --> 19:53.960]  So it's like he's the son of New York, obviously they want him.
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.460]  So it's crazy.
[19:55.460 --> 19:57.360]  He's going to take New York people.
[19:57.360 --> 19:59.240]  He's going to take everything.
[19:59.240 --> 20:03.000]  But they've never wanted this out because they don't want to discourage people from
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.480]  going and voting, thinking it's in the bag because they're going to try to steal it.
[20:06.480 --> 20:08.840]  But they're dealing with mega tsunami.
[20:08.840 --> 20:15.520]  Look, Hillary gets a crowd of 300 people when LeBron James comes, they advertise for a week.
[20:15.520 --> 20:18.480]  Trump shows up somewhere and 10,000 show up in small towns.
[20:18.480 --> 20:22.680]  Again, we just showed you the Comcast numbers and quite frankly, they don't track everything.
[20:22.680 --> 20:25.320]  They show us in 170 something of the worldwide web.
[20:25.320 --> 20:26.800]  Anthony, go over this.
[20:26.800 --> 20:28.320]  It's not about bragging about info wars.
[20:28.320 --> 20:29.320]  Yeah.
[20:29.320 --> 20:30.320]  Okay.
[20:30.320 --> 20:32.520]  It's about people understanding what jokes they are.
[20:32.520 --> 20:37.680]  I mean, they're the big ivory towers owned by the Mexican kingpins and owned by the Chinese.
[20:37.680 --> 20:39.560]  And again, people say, oh, we don't like Chinese.
[20:39.560 --> 20:42.520]  The Chinese government that killed 80 plus million of its own people, that has mobile
[20:42.520 --> 20:48.800]  execution vans, that announced they're buying all six Hollywood, I mean, that's official.
[20:48.800 --> 20:52.720]  I mean, I was already told when I was in Hollywood, you know, 10 years ago, you know, going out
[20:52.720 --> 20:56.040]  there, I was already told, oh my God, the Chinese are buying everything.
[20:56.040 --> 20:59.360]  Now it's a, remember I said the Chinese and the Arabs are buying Hollywood.
[20:59.360 --> 21:00.360]  Oh, you cook.
[21:00.360 --> 21:01.360]  You shut up.
[21:01.360 --> 21:02.360]  You know, you're covering up for blah, blah.
[21:02.360 --> 21:05.960]  I was just going with people telling me in Hollywood, I mean, major producers, I mean,
[21:05.960 --> 21:06.960]  as big as they get.
[21:06.960 --> 21:07.960]  Okay.
[21:07.960 --> 21:08.960]  I've had breakfast.
[21:08.960 --> 21:09.960]  You name it with the biggest ones.
[21:09.960 --> 21:14.600]  And we're sitting there and people ask, well, why do they want to have breakfast with you?
[21:14.600 --> 21:16.360]  Because I'm talking about the real world folks.
[21:16.360 --> 21:18.480]  They know mainstream TVs for idiots.
[21:18.480 --> 21:21.480]  When you know about this is when you go to the big dinners, it's when you have dinner
[21:21.480 --> 21:26.520]  with three star generals and I'm not bragging, but they want you literally thinking JZ and
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.680]  all this crap is cool and calling us conspiracy theorists because we're conversant in how the
[21:30.680 --> 21:31.680]  real world works.
[21:31.680 --> 21:36.480]  So I told you 10 years ago, the Chinese and the Muslims, the Saudi Arabians were taken
[21:36.480 --> 21:37.480]  over Hollywood.
[21:37.480 --> 21:38.680]  Now it's official.
[21:38.680 --> 21:39.840]  Now it's official.
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.000]  Now it's official.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  Now it's official.
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  Go ahead Anthony.
[21:43.000 --> 21:44.800]  So you talk about Matt Drudge, right?
[21:44.800 --> 21:45.800]  Think about Matt Drudge.
[21:45.800 --> 21:46.800]  Think about yourself too.
[21:46.800 --> 21:50.320]  I, we talked about before, I think Matt Drudge is the man of the year 2016.
[21:50.320 --> 21:53.160]  I think because of the fact that his platform is independent from these platforms.
[21:53.160 --> 21:54.160]  That's right.
[21:54.160 --> 21:55.160]  It was Putin last year.
[21:55.160 --> 21:56.160]  It should be Matt Drudge.
[21:56.160 --> 21:57.160]  I think it's Matt Drudge.
[21:57.160 --> 22:00.360]  And I think that Matt Drudge is a world changer because of one thing, even if you don't agree
[22:00.360 --> 22:02.600]  with the things that he posts, guess what?
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.040]  He is independent of the system.
[22:04.040 --> 22:06.280]  He creates independent narratives of debate.
[22:06.280 --> 22:10.200]  The globalists in all their internal emails are, Jones is changing the narrative and Drudge
[22:10.200 --> 22:12.160]  is, we gotta shut them down.
[22:12.160 --> 22:13.160]  We can't beat these people.
[22:13.160 --> 22:14.160]  Let's take these members.
[22:14.160 --> 22:17.960]  Well, I mean it's not hard to beat our narrative when we go, look, here's Obama saying it's
[22:17.960 --> 22:18.960]  free.
[22:18.960 --> 22:21.640]  Or here's Obama saying you can keep your doctor and then we've got Obama saying, I never
[22:21.640 --> 22:23.040]  said that.
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.560]  How is, how are we smart?
[22:24.560 --> 22:27.600]  We just call known scumbag liars out.
[22:27.600 --> 22:29.460]  We're not out to F everybody.
[22:29.460 --> 22:33.640]  We don't get up on TV like Gruber and say, thank God the American people are so dumb.
[22:33.640 --> 22:34.800]  We're really ripping them off.
[22:34.800 --> 22:37.640]  That's because you don't talk about football and it's scary to people.
[22:37.640 --> 22:41.040]  I think they should pull up Quantcast, by the way, I want to go over these some things,
[22:41.040 --> 22:44.200]  approve some things, but pull up Drudge Report also and see where that is.
[22:44.200 --> 22:45.760]  But here's what I'm saying.
[22:45.760 --> 22:50.880]  There is an official narrative that must be carefully protected and it must be put out,
[22:50.880 --> 22:51.880]  right?
[22:51.880 --> 22:55.680]  It must be projected with one loudspeaker and all the news media companies, they plug
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.640]  in their auxiliary cable from this loudspeaker.
[22:57.640 --> 22:58.640]  So it's all the same thing, right?
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.040]  And that's why they're all such servants.
[23:00.040 --> 23:04.600]  They've got to sycophantically love the lying to keep their little place as a revometer.
[23:04.600 --> 23:05.600]  Right.
[23:05.600 --> 23:08.240]  So look, there's Drudge Report and by the way, the monthly is way higher than that.
[23:08.240 --> 23:10.400]  But okay, so here's Infowars on this show.
[23:10.400 --> 23:14.080]  Drudge is 101 on the World Wide Web and from our Google tracking, it's more like number
[23:14.080 --> 23:15.080]  30.
[23:15.080 --> 23:16.920]  But if we go to 172, there's Infowars.
[23:16.920 --> 23:19.200]  Now look what Infowars is higher than.
[23:19.200 --> 23:25.720]  Sears.com, CNBC, okay, it's beating out CNBC, Expedia Wall Street Journal.
[23:25.720 --> 23:26.880]  I mean, just think about that for a minute.
[23:26.880 --> 23:30.960]  I'm reading these, it doesn't sound like much, but Wall Street Journal, Infowars is crushing
[23:30.960 --> 23:40.400]  Wall Street Journal, DonaldJTrump.com, Solon.com, TheOnion.com, Overstock.com, the Better Business
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.160]  Bureau, and it goes on and on.
[23:42.160 --> 23:44.360]  This is just one little sheet that I had here, okay?
[23:44.360 --> 23:47.240]  And if you imagine how much they hate us.
[23:47.240 --> 23:50.800]  Neck and neck, but it's actually beating if we have the real analytics.
[23:50.800 --> 23:55.600]  Anthony, we're not making it up that now we're having like 50 million extra viewers a week.
[23:55.600 --> 23:57.360]  I mean, this is important, look.
[23:57.360 --> 24:00.040]  But that doesn't even, people don't even go to the website small.
[24:00.040 --> 24:01.040]  I know.
[24:01.040 --> 24:07.440]  Look at it though, compared to BBC, even these numbers, it's 40,000 less or 20,000 less,
[24:07.440 --> 24:08.440]  okay?
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.440]  So we're bigger than BBC.
[24:09.440 --> 24:10.440]  It's already bigger than BBC.
[24:10.440 --> 24:13.000]  The whole MI6, British World Wide Brainwashing Service.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  Bigger than BBC.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.160]  That is a literal pedophile network on record.
[24:16.160 --> 24:17.240]  We have defeated them.
[24:17.240 --> 24:22.200]  And then that's why I have to say, if you really think about it, this man right here,
[24:22.200 --> 24:26.440]  Alex Jones, okay, even if you don't agree with everything he says, he did all this.
[24:26.440 --> 24:27.440]  He created all this.
[24:27.440 --> 24:28.440]  He made it independent.
[24:28.440 --> 24:29.440]  No, no.
[24:29.440 --> 24:30.440]  I'm going to say it for a second.
[24:30.440 --> 24:31.440]  Anthony, just stop.
[24:31.440 --> 24:32.440]  And Matt Drudge, because guess what?
[24:32.440 --> 24:37.160]  BBC is backed by an entire government, CNN is backed by hundreds of millions of dollars
[24:37.160 --> 24:39.360]  of mega sponsors that don't care about you.
[24:39.360 --> 24:41.800]  CNBC is a joke, okay?
[24:41.800 --> 24:46.120]  All these corporations and mega companies are being beaten by Infowars.com.
[24:46.120 --> 24:48.600]  And by the way, we didn't plan this today.
[24:48.600 --> 24:53.360]  I was planning to come on, as I did, and say Donald Trump's already won this election,
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.080]  whether they steal it or not.
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.160]  And then I was just thinking, yeah, but this is about the fall of the mainstream media.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.200]  We have to declare this because we're still also humble.
[25:03.200 --> 25:06.880]  We're just in here fighting and warning people and analyzing and everything else.
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.700]  What this really shows is you are the man and woman of the year listeners.
[25:10.700 --> 25:12.320]  You are the people that broke with the globalist.
[25:12.320 --> 25:15.480]  You're the people that educated your friends and family.
[25:15.480 --> 25:16.960]  And now they're in free fall.
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.920]  So the only way we lose, which is very hard to do at this point, is to believe their next
[25:21.920 --> 25:25.880]  con game if they steal it from Trump and then just believe, because that's the new narrative,
[25:25.880 --> 25:27.680]  the alt-right has been discredited.
[25:27.680 --> 25:28.680]  Now see it everywhere.
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.040]  Trump's going to lose.
[25:30.040 --> 25:33.960]  And the stuff they're talking about, Brexit, New World Order, and not letting millionaires
[25:33.960 --> 25:40.720]  be tax-exempt and not launching wars, that's warmongering, the total upside-down world.
[25:40.720 --> 25:41.880]  Don't listen to them.
[25:41.880 --> 25:42.880]  They're discredited.
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.000]  No, this is absolute poison to them.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.640]  This is cyanide.
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.560]  This is high noon to Count Dracula.
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.000]  As I say, this scares the living hell out of them.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.200]  And I'm here to tell you, I love seeing all these new slick, smart sites pop up that get
[25:58.200 --> 25:59.200]  it.
[25:59.200 --> 26:00.960]  And they're not regurgitating what I say.
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.280]  They get the real narrative, because what we're seeing is really what's going on.
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.280]  It's not going through filters.
[26:05.280 --> 26:06.520]  It's a historic understanding.
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.840]  It's the globalist-owned admissions.
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.680]  We get WikiLeaks, and it's literally everything we've ever said, except a little bit worse,
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.400]  because I read hundreds of history books.
[26:14.400 --> 26:15.400]  I've studied it.
[26:15.400 --> 26:17.160]  I've had them try to buy me off.
[26:17.160 --> 26:22.360]  I mean, I've been in the trenches for 25 years, on air for almost 22, and again.
[26:22.360 --> 26:24.160]  So we're not up here announcing this.
[26:24.160 --> 26:25.160]  No, no, let's be clear.
[26:25.160 --> 26:26.160]  They're never...
[26:26.160 --> 26:28.640]  We're not announcing it to make ourselves feel big, okay?
[26:28.640 --> 26:31.320]  The difference is, I work 18 hours a day, because I know I have a responsibility in
[26:31.320 --> 26:32.320]  this position.
[26:32.320 --> 26:34.680]  I have a responsibility to beat these people, because they're going to come after us if
[26:34.680 --> 26:35.680]  we don't win.
[26:35.680 --> 26:38.760]  I mean, this is definitely life and death now, folks, and you have to understand.
[26:38.760 --> 26:43.560]  We are here to let you know you're big, you're strong, you're incredible, you're amazing,
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.400]  you're just as important as any of these people in mainstream media, as Matt Drudge.
[26:47.400 --> 26:50.400]  Matt Drudge years ago would always tell bloggers and people, and folks, you're just as important
[26:50.400 --> 26:51.400]  as the New York Times.
[26:51.400 --> 26:54.040]  And he was building confidence in people, because it was true.
[26:54.040 --> 26:56.640]  And again, it's not Kiss Matt Drudge's ass.
[26:56.640 --> 27:03.400]  We have to recognize the models of truth and justice and the return of Americanism that
[27:03.400 --> 27:04.960]  made us the apple of the world's eye.
[27:04.960 --> 27:05.960]  Sorry, Anthony.
[27:05.960 --> 27:06.960]  No, exactly.
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.760]  I was going to say, it's individuals that represent a shift, okay?
[27:09.760 --> 27:11.120]  You're the opposite of someone that wants...
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.360]  You don't even want to talk about this stuff.
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.840]  That's why I had to force you to talk about it.
[27:13.840 --> 27:15.640]  You don't want to sit up here and so-called brag.
[27:15.640 --> 27:16.640]  It's not bragging them.
[27:16.640 --> 27:18.840]  You've been coming in for weeks like we're number 200, we're number 190 times.
[27:18.840 --> 27:19.840]  Guess what?
[27:19.840 --> 27:22.160]  It's the millions of people that actually go to the website, and it's the millions of
[27:22.160 --> 27:24.760]  people that actually care about stuff that make it possible and make it happen.
[27:24.760 --> 27:25.920]  They need to know we're winning.
[27:25.920 --> 27:26.920]  We're a representation.
[27:26.920 --> 27:30.200]  We're not just saying, we're not just saying we're getting 50 million extra views a week
[27:30.200 --> 27:31.200]  now.
[27:31.200 --> 27:32.200]  We are.
[27:32.200 --> 27:33.200]  I'm not just sitting here saying, you're so amazing.
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.800]  I'm saying, look at what has happened with the cultural and intellectual shift in the
[27:36.800 --> 27:38.840]  country to where people actually give up for the crowd.
[27:38.840 --> 27:39.840]  You're right.
[27:39.840 --> 27:40.840]  We need to celebrate.
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.160]  I prayed to God on air and privately that people be awakened, that there be a paradigm
[27:45.160 --> 27:46.160]  shift.
[27:46.160 --> 27:47.320]  And Donald Trump was that answer.
[27:47.320 --> 27:50.760]  But don't get mad at God, folks, if it doesn't all happen right away or are they killing?
[27:50.760 --> 27:52.080]  Because that's probably what they're going to do.
[27:52.080 --> 27:54.000]  I'll be frank with you.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.560]  And it's very, very powerful time to be alive.
[27:56.560 --> 27:57.560]  Thank God he's so fatalistic.
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.360]  And I mean that in a good way.
[27:59.360 --> 28:00.560]  Trump knows exactly what he's doing.
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.560]  He's committed.
[28:01.560 --> 28:03.800]  His sons are committed.
[28:03.800 --> 28:06.920]  And I just want to salute everything they've done and what they've put on the line.
[28:06.920 --> 28:11.520]  We are totally behind Donald Trump because he is the main target, folks.
[28:11.520 --> 28:14.600]  People are pissed off with what's happened and they've been sold a lie and they realize
[28:14.600 --> 28:15.600]  it.
[28:15.600 --> 28:19.800]  And they realize the symptoms of the sickness that is the complete tumor on society.
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.000]  And no matter what the resolution is, this is proof 100 percent that people actually
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  care.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.280]  And people are so-called waking up.
[28:26.280 --> 28:27.920]  People are actually aware of all this.
[28:27.920 --> 28:30.280]  And the facade of the media system is-
[28:30.280 --> 28:31.280]  So I'm going to say it again.
[28:31.280 --> 28:32.280]  Correct.
[28:32.280 --> 28:34.360]  I'm going to say it again.
[28:34.360 --> 28:35.360]  It's all rigged.
[28:35.360 --> 28:36.360]  They admit it's rigged.
[28:36.360 --> 28:37.360]  It's not.
[28:37.360 --> 28:38.360]  It's rigged.
[28:38.360 --> 28:39.360]  They're going to tell you Donald Trump lost.
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.280]  Donald Trump is going to win in one of the biggest landslides in U.S. history.
[28:43.280 --> 28:44.920]  And the insiders all know this.
[28:44.920 --> 28:48.880]  They just didn't want to build confidence too much so people didn't go vote.
[28:48.880 --> 28:49.880]  Hillary is done.
[28:49.880 --> 28:52.000]  I mean, she is absolutely in shambles.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.200]  She is losing.
[28:53.200 --> 28:55.200]  They are telling the military right now, get ready.
[28:55.200 --> 28:57.720]  It's going to be given to Hillary supposedly, stand down.
[28:57.720 --> 28:59.320]  So folks, they can false flag.
[28:59.320 --> 29:00.480]  They can launch new wars.
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.040]  God knows whether you're going to see helicopters at the White House like you see in Turkey
[29:05.040 --> 29:06.880]  or something and jets in the sky.
[29:06.880 --> 29:10.040]  I mean, I don't know, man, because I'm not involved in it all, but there's people on
[29:10.040 --> 29:11.040]  planes.
[29:11.040 --> 29:12.040]  There's stuff going on.
[29:12.040 --> 29:13.200]  There's folks.
[29:13.200 --> 29:14.200]  There's major movements.
[29:14.200 --> 29:15.960]  There's world leaders on the phone with Trump.
[29:15.960 --> 29:16.960]  This is huge.
[29:16.960 --> 29:17.960]  This is-
[29:17.960 --> 29:20.960]  So while we're sitting there saying, wow, we're huge, the mainstream media is in trouble.
[29:20.960 --> 29:25.760]  I understand when we come back, massive election fraud confirmed across the board, huge corruption
[29:25.760 --> 29:30.520]  taking place, new WikiLeaks, all the big guests, 52-hour broadcast.
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.000]  We're not out of the woods yet, but we're in the fight and we're taking action.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.120]  And I want to, by the way, commend our crew, not just the listeners and everybody else
[29:38.120 --> 29:39.920]  in GCN as well.
[29:39.920 --> 29:43.520]  All of the crew that makes it possible, you the listeners, your prayers, all of it.
[29:43.520 --> 29:47.320]  We're all in this together and doesn't it feel good to see the tide turning?
[29:47.320 --> 29:48.320]  This is amazing.
[29:48.320 --> 29:49.320]  I salute you.
[29:49.320 --> 29:50.840]  We're on the march.
[29:50.840 --> 29:53.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.280 --> 29:56.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.280 --> 30:04.680]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com, and this is one of the most amazing times to be alive
[30:04.680 --> 30:06.200]  right now in history.
[30:06.200 --> 30:10.320]  Something your grandchildren will look back on and go, grandpa, grandma, you were part
[30:10.320 --> 30:11.320]  of that?
[30:11.320 --> 30:12.680]  That is mind-blowing.
[30:12.680 --> 30:13.680]  Think about this.
[30:13.680 --> 30:19.160]  In 24 hours, we will know who the next president of the United States is.
[30:19.160 --> 30:21.240]  This is so crazy.
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.640]  This is down to the wire.
[30:22.640 --> 30:26.600]  Let's look at some of these headlines that are happening right now on Drudge Report.
[30:26.600 --> 30:32.480]  Obama encourages illegals to vote, stocks go boom, high drama and sunshine state, election
[30:32.480 --> 30:38.280]  in-game fight, final charge through battleground states, Trump pops the biggest lead at IDP.
[30:38.280 --> 30:43.320]  LA Times has Trump plus five, traffic to get into Trump's rally in Pennsylvania backed
[30:43.320 --> 30:48.240]  up for miles, WikiLeaks server under hack attack as DMC emails released.
[30:48.240 --> 30:49.240]  Think about this.
[30:49.240 --> 30:50.240]  This is our Brexit.
[30:50.240 --> 30:51.760]  They're telling us we can't win.
[30:51.760 --> 30:54.400]  George Washington, Brexit before it was cool.
[30:54.400 --> 31:24.360]  This has been Joe Bates with infowars.com and we will prevail.
[31:24.360 --> 31:51.360]  You will find a brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslifetime.org.
[31:51.360 --> 31:58.360]  their game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[31:58.360 --> 32:03.960]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question. Will you and your family be financially protected
[32:03.960 --> 32:08.080]  if there's another economic meltdown? Like many experts, I believe another devastating
[32:08.080 --> 32:12.680]  crash is coming. I think it's a matter of when, not if. Don't wait for another crisis
[32:12.680 --> 32:16.280]  that could wipe out your hard-earned money. Do what I did and call United States Gold
[32:16.280 --> 32:23.200]  Vault at 844-541-ALAX. It's a company I trust. They're offering gold and silver coin survival
[32:23.200 --> 32:28.000]  packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown. I'm talking real
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.240]  money, not paper or worthless stocks. China recently bought more than a billion dollars
[32:32.240 --> 32:37.600]  worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move. Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[32:37.600 --> 32:43.400]  as one of the most stable means of protecting finances. Don't delay, call 844-541-ALAX
[32:43.400 --> 32:48.560]  now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[32:48.560 --> 32:53.760]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority. I personally
[32:53.760 --> 33:22.160]  owe me survival packs and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALAX now.
[33:22.160 --> 33:27.280]  We've been building the Info War for 21 years to warn the people about globalism, knowing
[33:27.280 --> 33:31.920]  that it was an authoritarian planetary program of oppression and that when it attempted to
[33:31.920 --> 33:41.360]  finally go operational and establish their anti-family, anti-free market super-terranny
[33:41.360 --> 33:47.320]  that we would have major forces on the ground aware of the power, aware of their program
[33:47.320 --> 33:53.880]  and aware of systems to stop them. And now in every major globalist publication, public
[33:53.880 --> 33:59.520]  and private, they are in panic mode. And the best part is the last five years they've been
[33:59.520 --> 34:05.120]  going to armored redoubt scenarios, not just within the United States or Europe, but fleeing
[34:05.120 --> 34:18.480]  to very far away, hard to get to remote, circuitous areas. And that's the enemy evacuating. Now
[34:18.480 --> 34:22.560]  that means they're ready to start big wars to keep their power, but their minions thousands
[34:22.560 --> 34:29.440]  of miles away are going to be educated by us and we're going to stay behind. We'll go
[34:29.440 --> 34:35.320]  on to the end, whatever the cost may be, we will defend our republic and we will never
[34:35.320 --> 34:39.400]  surrender to paraphrase Winston Churchill. And then these idiots think they're going
[34:39.400 --> 34:44.160]  to take the gloves off and start getting rough with us because in their psychology, they
[34:44.160 --> 34:48.480]  think that'll cause capitulation. Only in people that we're already going to roll over,
[34:48.480 --> 34:53.320]  in the real men out there and women as well, you take the gloves off, which you've already
[34:53.320 --> 35:00.040]  been doing, what effect did that happen? Persecuting whistleblowers going after the press. What
[35:00.040 --> 35:04.000]  effect did that have? Your whistleblowing problems are a hundred times what they were
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.960]  a decade ago, aren't they? You just don't really know human nature. Just like Hitler,
[35:11.960 --> 35:15.760]  I'm going to bunch of clubs, the latest election is here in a moment, but just like Hitler was
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.800]  winning World War II and they, this is, it was declassified decades later and British
[35:21.800 --> 35:29.200]  intelligence came up with a plan to fly a bunch of Lancasters over and bomb the government
[35:29.200 --> 35:35.640]  district in Berlin to piss Hitler off so that he would take his bombing off the airfields
[35:35.640 --> 35:43.360]  and factories and then bomb central London. And they went, they bombed it. They didn't
[35:43.360 --> 35:49.520]  even have the bombers really even do it. They barely made it back in a sneak attack and
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.040]  it totally got the German high command. Well, they told Hitler was a trap, but he didn't
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.400]  listen and he sit, then his forces just to start the blitz, which then only made the
[36:01.400 --> 36:04.840]  Brits go from not wanting to be in the war because they knew World War I had been wrong
[36:04.840 --> 36:08.640]  and they'd been on the wrong side and started it with the Austrian Hungarian Empire. A lot
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.360]  of Brits were like, whoa, we don't want to the war, but oh, Hitler started bombing the
[36:12.360 --> 36:20.120]  bombing neighborhoods and killing a bunch of kids. Oh, that's why I say they start doing
[36:20.120 --> 36:25.160]  atrocities. They start killing patriots. Just let them. They kill me. Don't riot. Don't do
[36:25.160 --> 36:32.320]  a thing. Just take action and don't comply with them. Same thing with Trump. Just keep
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.840]  moving forward. Americanism, not globalism. Don't let them trick you. We're going to win
[36:36.840 --> 36:42.320]  economically in the Info War. We're going to win. Let that major debates with people
[36:42.320 --> 36:45.920]  that have overthrown countries. You name it, multiple folks and they, they were all hot
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.480]  war, hot war, hot war. And I'm like, no, you watch this is 10 years ago. We're going to
[36:49.480 --> 36:56.160]  win this in the information war. And it's crazy how right I've been. Uh, it's, it's,
[36:56.160 --> 37:00.080]  it's actually, I'm a very humble person. And then it's not a good feeling because then
[37:00.080 --> 37:06.160]  I'm like, well, if I get this more than almost anybody else, I have this giant responsibility.
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.880]  It's really crazy. And that's why they spent all their time clipping me out of context and
[37:10.880 --> 37:14.440]  made me look like a goofball. All that does is make people come to the show. God turns
[37:14.440 --> 37:20.960]  their best attacks into our greatest gifts. But the responsibility we're all in is incredible.
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.600]  And all of you that got made fun of by your neighbors or your pastor or your school or
[37:24.600 --> 37:29.520]  your coworkers, your boss, your employees, all of you that stood up for America and talked
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.040]  about globalism and exposed it. I salute you because let me tell you something. You're
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.400]  the reason we're kicking new world order butt right now. You're the reason they're being
[37:38.400 --> 37:43.680]  forced to cheat out in the open. You're the reason they're having to uncloak and making
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.680]  them uncloak and attack. He is going to bring them down now. Got a bunch of clips I want
[37:48.680 --> 37:52.640]  to get to. I have an assignment to ask Nico. Can I have the full schedule? I know some
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.520]  other guests are being added, but I'm going to be on tonight again, like a eight to midnight.
[37:57.520 --> 38:01.160]  Basically, we got a bunch of other guests and hosts coming in, but I want to start telling
[38:01.160 --> 38:05.080]  folks, we're going to post the roster of who's going to be on in the next hour or two at
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.040]  infowars.com forward slash show where there's the free audio and video feeds. And the biggest
[38:10.040 --> 38:17.320]  activist thing you can do is send those links out to everybody. And if you go to drudgereport.com,
[38:17.320 --> 38:21.760]  Drudge in the top right hand corner is linked to infowars.com forward slash show. Let's
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.520]  symbiotically return that favor. In everything we do, let's send out drudgereport.com, tip
[38:27.520 --> 38:33.520]  of the spear, spread it. Drudgereport.com, carry the spear, throw the spear, whatever
[38:33.520 --> 38:40.440]  term you want to use, use the spear. Florida shock. Trump outperforms Romney by 130,000
[38:40.440 --> 38:49.680]  in early voting. Huge. And again, the, oh, by the way, what, what an omen. Janet Reno,
[38:49.680 --> 38:54.800]  I'm not going to get into her, but you know, with all this stuff in the new WikiLeaks about
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.880]  little kids in the hot tub waiting for you and, you know, all the rest of it, I can't
[38:59.880 --> 39:03.560]  say 100% that sex trafficking, even though the NYPD saying they're looking at it and
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.440]  Wiener is sending stuff to underage kids and there is Satanism and all the normal trappings
[39:07.440 --> 39:13.040]  in the Epstein and the Lolita Express plane and Eric Prince coming out and saying he has
[39:13.040 --> 39:16.520]  sources. That guy never pops a set up unless it's something hardcore. And he's been very
[39:16.520 --> 39:21.600]  accurate in the past saying he's got sources that it is a pedophilia network. Good God.
[39:21.600 --> 39:25.080]  That'll even get Eric Prince to come out from whatever base he's hiding in. I'm not saying
[39:25.080 --> 39:29.840]  that's bad, but the point is it's a real James Bond character right there. Get him to pop
[39:29.840 --> 39:33.360]  up to tell you because the pedophilia gets folks to go public. It gets people to, you
[39:33.360 --> 39:36.920]  know, put themselves in the line. It's like a flip. It's a crazy switch in me. I mean,
[39:36.920 --> 39:41.120]  I'm somebody that, I don't get off on killing, but I started thinking about pedophiles and
[39:41.120 --> 39:45.960]  let me tell you, I started having some real mean thoughts about ice picks and, you know,
[39:45.960 --> 39:50.640]  people. I'm going to stop right there. The point is, is that there's a big spectrum of
[39:50.640 --> 39:53.800]  smart people saying that's what's happening and a lot of evidence popped up. But with
[39:53.800 --> 40:00.520]  Janet Reno, when she was the head prosecutor down in Florida, major city, there's been
[40:00.520 --> 40:05.400]  books written on it. I've read books on her. She'd get caught by state police in the back
[40:05.400 --> 40:10.640]  of a convertible with a 12 year old girl. Reno would be drunken on pills, vomit everywhere,
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.360]  their clothes off. Then she got caught in a parking garage and she'd go check kids out
[40:15.360 --> 40:24.640]  of the CPS lockup and take them for a test drive. So Janet Reno, by the way, you can
[40:24.640 --> 40:30.240]  look through this was, this was in Florida newspapers. They went and got Reno because
[40:30.240 --> 40:36.080]  she was just like them, I guess. I mean, I always thought, why would you hire a big fat
[40:36.080 --> 40:43.000]  disgusting lesbian pedo? And why would you do? Cause she's totally compromised. Dita
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.920]  Parkinson's. It's funny that Hillary and Bill both got that. You can see it. And a lot of
[40:49.920 --> 40:54.680]  great folks at Parkinson's is very, very sad thing. Very, very bad degenerative disease.
[40:54.680 --> 40:57.920]  It's happening more and more because of all the heavy metals and vaccines and the rest
[40:57.920 --> 41:03.520]  of it. But Janet Reno, I saw this hit piece on me the other day. It was like Alex Jones
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.840]  wanted people to blow up for hood. It actually said that she totally made up. Did you show
[41:06.840 --> 41:12.000]  where I said it? Just Alex Jones hates the military. And Alex Jones says, he's actually
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.360]  said this just to show you how evil they are. It's not about me. Alex Jones says, the most
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.680]  evil group in America that funded the Nazis and the, the communist is the national guard.
[41:22.680 --> 41:29.320]  It'd be like saying, I said, you know, buckwheat funded Hitler or something. It's just like
[41:29.320 --> 41:35.200]  what? And then it goes on and he's a major follower of David Caresh and believed in his
[41:35.200 --> 41:43.240]  religion and followed him with no proof, no link, no nothing. Other than we built a memorial
[41:43.240 --> 41:46.680]  church for all those that died because my listeners got involved and did it on their
[41:46.680 --> 41:47.680]  own.
[41:47.680 --> 41:51.640]  So I was going to broadcast out there in one of the surviving divisions said we were exposing
[41:51.640 --> 41:59.480]  what Reno did. And then I said, I want to plaque here for the dead ATF people. They're,
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.240]  you know, I don't know what they did, but this is for everybody. We, we, we paid and
[42:03.240 --> 42:08.480]  even had a plaque put for the ATF and it turns into I followed it. I said, David Caresh was
[42:08.480 --> 42:12.600]  a cult leader and a bad guy and they should have arrested him in town. He had a business
[42:12.600 --> 42:16.400]  in town and the sheriff pointed that out of that county and said it was wrong and they
[42:16.400 --> 42:22.120]  burned that place up and killed those kids. David Caresh was a cult leader and bad and
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.520]  should have been arrested and here's a plaque for the dead ATF, but when you did to the
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.160]  women and children was wrong and we built a memorial church for everybody that died
[42:30.160 --> 42:36.480]  and you turned that into I want to blow up Fort Hood and I support David Caresh again.
[42:36.480 --> 42:40.120]  That's why I have such a kinship with Donald Trump because I see him with the same stuff.
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.880]  You know, Mexico, Latin America, great people hire a lot of them, wonderful hardworking people.
[42:44.880 --> 42:48.880]  You know, really good people, but I'll tell you a lot of criminals are coming across and
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.760]  they let them come across and a lot of rapists, a lot of killers and you got to do something
[42:52.760 --> 42:55.480]  about that. You just can't have the border completely wide open and just let people
[42:55.480 --> 43:01.960]  be here. You know, a lot of bad people coming in. Yeah, Mexico, a lot of bad people, a lot
[43:01.960 --> 43:06.160]  of criminals and then they would just lie and say he said all Mexicans. It's what they
[43:06.160 --> 43:14.840]  do. When Mexico bitches and says don't send your criminals down here, we don't go here
[43:14.840 --> 43:18.760]  being racist. Everybody knows it's where you run. You run to Mexico because they have no
[43:18.760 --> 43:27.880]  extradition. It's the same thing. They run up here. Our criminals run down there. It's
[43:27.880 --> 43:32.240]  a fact that Fidel Castro dumped 300,000 criminals out of his jails on the United States in the
[43:32.240 --> 43:42.840]  Cuban boat lift. Does that mean we hate Cubans? No. This is how they distort everything. All
[43:42.840 --> 43:46.640]  right. I'm going to get into what's coming up. I'm going to tell you about the big guess
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.760]  we've got 52 hour broadcasts. We're now 43 minutes into that 52 hour broadcast. We're
[43:51.760 --> 43:54.960]  going to be broadcasting right through tomorrow, right through the next day and then right through
[43:54.960 --> 44:00.120]  the nighttime. But I say 52 that we stop at 3pm. Then we have the nightly news, more updates
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.040]  that evening at 7 o'clock. That'll be out there for everybody. And now we have an incredible
[44:04.040 --> 44:07.880]  page up on infowars.com. Well, that looks really good. I hadn't seen you guys build
[44:07.880 --> 44:17.360]  that infowars.com forward slash election. That's some busy, busy beavers around here.
[44:17.360 --> 44:20.760]  And that's got all the feeds as well. And it's going to have graphs on where they say
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.800]  the race is. And we're going to have early projections. Don't worry. We're going to have
[44:24.800 --> 44:32.160]  our own to counter seeing it and the rest of them. They have their games. We have ours.
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.160]  Ours are based on truth. Those are based on being scumbags paid for by Nazi collaborators
[44:36.160 --> 44:42.040]  George Soros who has a warm nest waiting for him in the center of Hades. But before we
[44:42.040 --> 44:47.400]  go any further, spread that link infowars.com forward slash election infowars.com forward
[44:47.400 --> 44:52.080]  slash show be part of that revolution. Let's not just have 10 million people tune in, which
[44:52.080 --> 44:58.200]  they will conservatively just on Facebook mentions right now. One feed of seven we have going.
[44:58.200 --> 45:04.480]  We have a half million people tuned in. Not to mention all the 230 plus affiliates. It's
[45:04.480 --> 45:10.160]  been, it's been hovering at 170 for years. Station sell stations change hands state,
[45:10.160 --> 45:15.200]  you know, you lose stations gain stations. We're now gaining something like 2030 affiliates
[45:15.200 --> 45:21.120]  a month. In fact, 50,000 waters, 10,000 waters just all over the world. The info war is exploding.
[45:21.120 --> 45:25.600]  I want you to know we're the future. They're the past. American is a not globalism. They're
[45:25.600 --> 45:29.280]  the losers. They're the ones in free fall. Because they're going to tell you that when
[45:29.280 --> 45:35.200]  they steal it from Trump, that's their plan. They stole everything else. That it's a repudiation
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.600]  of the craziness that Obamacare didn't free and that Hillary wants your guns. Everybody
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.440]  knows. Well, the WikiLeaks says she plans on banning them and even all the major papers
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.560]  say they want to take them, but it doesn't exist. And no illegals are voting. But Obama
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.240]  goes on TV and basically agrees with the reporter. Yeah, if you're here, you can vote and we
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.080]  won't prosecute you. That's coming up. But first off, funding this operation funding
[45:57.080 --> 46:01.080]  it. We don't go get the big corporate establishment sponsors because they're all for the big rig
[46:01.080 --> 46:05.880]  system. Just like Donald Trump got no corporate money, no foreign billionaire money. Hillary,
[46:05.880 --> 46:09.800]  I mean, you think liberals would vote for him just because that well, real ones like Jill
[46:09.800 --> 46:17.480]  Stein and folks like Bev Harris and people that have integrity, people like Julie Massange
[46:19.640 --> 46:22.840]  and every Democrat I talked to in person. I mean, almost every Democrat I talked to goes,
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.720]  I mean, I mean, my mom has friends that are Democrats, lifelong Democrats. And I get like
[46:27.720 --> 46:31.320]  the sixties. That's how I like to get grip to being, you know, claiming it was for race,
[46:31.320 --> 46:34.760]  relations, all the rest of it was a bait and switch before a bunch of sixties kids. These
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.680]  women run up to me just hugging me. My mom had a Halloween party just to cook out. I was over
[46:40.680 --> 46:44.440]  there. Oh, Alex. Oh, you're so right. Oh, Donald Trump. Oh, God help him. She's so evil.
[46:46.040 --> 46:49.960]  These women are the same age as Hillary Clinton. One of them looks like Hillary Clinton and they
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.840]  were had tears in their eyes. This thing I used to maybe cry on air once a year. I thought about
[46:54.840 --> 46:59.960]  some dead kid or something. Now it's all the time, not because I'm it's the energy and how epic this
[46:59.960 --> 47:06.040]  battle is and how incredible this is. I never knew why as a kid, I'd get a tear in my eye during
[47:06.040 --> 47:11.000]  the Star Spangled Banner or during the Pledge of Allegiance, but it was a sense, a psychic sense of
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.400]  what people done for that and why it was under attack and why it was so important. And now I know.
[47:15.400 --> 47:22.520]  Now I know why they want to pull America down and why we're the testing ground of all the GMO and
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.640]  all the poison and all the garbage is because they hate us, folks. The globalists can't compete
[47:27.640 --> 47:32.840]  with the system. We're announcing a once we've never even done this before, actually. Maybe this
[47:32.840 --> 47:37.240]  comes around once a year. The total absolute biggest sale across the board will have a biggest sale
[47:37.240 --> 47:40.520]  of the year on this item or that item every day or so. We've got thousands of items in
[47:40.520 --> 47:46.440]  them for store.com, all super high quality. But we're doing a 52 hour live election broadcast and

[48:04.440 --> 48:09.640]  the globalists in the battle for the republic. And I tell you, this is an absolute toe to toe,
[48:09.640 --> 48:15.080]  sudden death over time battle. Our store for two hour live election broadcast has officially begun
[48:15.080 --> 48:21.000]  and we have launched a number of super sales and info or store.com to help fund the fight against
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.720]  election rigging and the globalist takeover. These unprecedented super sales are now live

[48:44.280 --> 48:49.800]  50% off all Molan lobby apparel. That's come and take it if you don't know Latin.
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.160]  Texas isn't the first place to say it folks. They were repeating what the 300 did. That's what
[48:55.160 --> 49:02.120]  history does. It repeats and it rhymes. And so much more info or store.com. We're bringing the fight
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.840]  to Hillary and the globalist like never before. And our listeners are to every day they're
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.000]  confronted with Bill Clinton's rapes, his crimes. And these are techniques we can learn
[49:12.200 --> 49:17.480]  on other subjects. Benghazi, the emails, Obama, we're not going to stop. The people are activating.
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.760]  The globalists are scared. Wars won't stop us. Depressions won't stop us. You're going down.
[49:24.280 --> 49:32.360]  I like it to World War II folks and we're 50 miles outside Berlin.
[49:32.360 --> 49:38.280]  And I hate to make that some bash the Germans thing in the modern context. It's just that that's
[49:38.280 --> 49:44.440]  a military. It's Yorktown and the British are surrounded folks. It's entering those phases,
[49:44.440 --> 49:51.880]  okay? But it's mind war now. So you've got to understand they can sophisticate this and

[50:10.440 --> 50:13.400]  the clips. We've got a bunch of guests. We got so much to cover. We have Obama,
[50:14.360 --> 50:18.600]  all scripted. This is what the standard thing they do. They got Democrats. I told you,
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.440]  in seven states that got out of their house, he got out of the legislatures. He got to
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.680]  governor's desk, but it was a little too obvious. The Democrats said, not quite yet. We got to get
[50:28.680 --> 50:32.520]  the public ready for this to have a Supreme Court ruling. Once we get a new Supreme Court justice
[50:32.520 --> 50:41.640]  are two in. It's so amazing. And so when we come back, we're going to break it all down. So Obama
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.320]  comes out and she goes, you know, if you're just here, you have a right to vote because you're a
[50:45.320 --> 50:49.640]  citizen. If you're here, he goes, yes, citizens can vote and we will not prosecute anybody that
[50:49.640 --> 50:54.760]  votes. It's all private. So come on and vote. He tells he legals to vote. This is the most naked,
[50:54.760 --> 51:20.760]  brazen, open, pissing on America you could ever do. It's a joke.

[54:12.040 --> 54:17.560]  7 or 11. Snake Eye is watching you. Let me bring in his hand.
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.520]  Biking lore, baby. I want the fight for liberty. That's the animated contest.
[54:28.440 --> 54:33.800]  That's what the sellouts don't get. I'll take a sword in my hand in the information war.
[54:33.800 --> 54:43.160]  The ace of spades and liberty always has the ace of spades.
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.600]  All right. Let me give you what could be the biggest news of the campaign yet.
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.280]  Hillary is in mega free fall. She in mainline polls. They're all over the place is two, five,
[54:54.280 --> 54:57.240]  six, eight, 10 points behind depending on the state, depending on the poll.
[54:57.240 --> 55:03.880]  In places where they're over sampling for her, Clinton is in panic mode, running around telling
[55:03.880 --> 55:09.080]  illegals to vote. So is Obama. The Democrats are in newspapers everywhere saying it's okay for
[55:09.080 --> 55:13.320]  illegals to vote, knowing that a bunch of them are now being caught. That was on Fox News this
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.760]  morning voting. So they're like, it's no big deal. It's legal. See the mind control they're involved
[55:18.760 --> 55:25.000]  in. But now from the daily caller, it's up on info wars.com. It's up on drugsreport.com. This
[55:25.000 --> 55:31.480]  could be the biggest is Hillary now preparing to lose is the headline cancels her fireworks display.
[55:32.520 --> 55:37.800]  That's the headline. Hillary Clinton cancels victory fireworks show. Joe Biggs just brought
[55:37.800 --> 55:43.000]  this into me for the Democratic nominee was planning to celebrate the outcome of the election with
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.480]  within two minutes of the power of Texas over the Hudson River. The Coast Guard said her camp
[55:47.480 --> 55:52.440]  had campaigned scrap their plans today. They announced this morning Clinton camp
[55:52.440 --> 55:59.400]  reached out Thursday to say it would be shooting off 10 aerial shells after all that they wouldn't
[55:59.400 --> 56:04.200]  be doing it. The campaign did not give the Coast Guard a reason for the cancellation. Ah,
[56:06.520 --> 56:13.720]  isn't that just cute? In 2012, Mitt Romney famously planned an eight minute $25,000 fireworks show
[56:13.720 --> 56:18.440]  with a Boston Harbor to celebrate the victory over Burama that never happened. The fires were
[56:18.440 --> 56:24.760]  eventually removed and taken back to the company's headquarters. Not so sure now.
[56:27.320 --> 56:33.800]  Now let's play the president in a scripted event. Democrats all over the country have had bills
[56:33.800 --> 56:40.280]  and seven states on governor's desk to let illegals vote. You can get off a plane, no passport,
[56:40.280 --> 56:48.440]  no nothing, no visa, you just you're here, no ID, you can vote. Vote as many times as you like.
[56:49.240 --> 56:54.360]  But there is no election fraud. Donald Trump say we have all these new videos of people out
[56:54.360 --> 57:01.000]  in Austin screaming on our reporters going homophobe, Trump's a homophobe. I mean one
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.440]  conservative complaint conservatives could have is that he's been for equal rights for 30 years
[57:06.440 --> 57:12.600]  and doing interviews on the advocate and stuff 20 years ago and is totally inclusive. See it's
[57:12.600 --> 57:17.320]  again everything is inverse folks. It is just we have video of these women just screaming and oh and
[57:17.320 --> 57:26.680]  he's a homophobe. Let me talk about mind control. Here is Obama agreeing that we won't go after you
[57:26.680 --> 57:33.080]  illegals if you vote. Of the millennials dreamers undocumented citizens and I call them citizens
[57:33.080 --> 57:39.720]  because they contribute to this country are fearful of voting. So if I vote will immigration
[57:39.720 --> 57:45.560]  know where I live? Will they come from my family and deport us? Not true and the reason is first of
[57:45.560 --> 57:53.080]  all when you vote you are a citizen yourself and there is not a situation where the voting
[57:53.080 --> 57:59.720]  rules somehow are transferred over and people start investigating etc. The same to the vote
[57:59.720 --> 58:09.640]  is strictly confidential. I can't believe I heard what I heard. Now let's continue here. I'm gonna
[58:09.640 --> 58:14.040]  go to break. I'm gonna start telling you about all the huge guests we've got coming up as well
[58:14.040 --> 58:20.200]  as soon as I get that full schedule but Stefan Malin is coming in. We have Dr. Group on huge
[58:20.200 --> 58:25.560]  vaccine reactions across the country paralyzing not thousands but tens of thousands of children.
[58:25.560 --> 58:30.360]  This is mainstream news. We don't know why it's happening. We've got breaking intel on that. Larry
[58:30.360 --> 58:34.760]  Nichols is coming back on. David Knight, Jesse James, you know who Jesse James is? He's a friend
[58:34.760 --> 58:39.480]  of mine. He's gonna be in here and we've got a whole bunch of other folks just today. Stay with us.
[58:41.480 --> 58:47.160]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.720 --> 58:53.720]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so
[58:53.720 --> 58:59.640]  good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I
[58:59.640 --> 59:04.920]  mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[59:05.480 --> 59:11.560]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[59:11.560 --> 59:17.240]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have
[59:17.240 --> 59:21.640]  biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff
[59:21.640 --> 59:25.320]  I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic
[59:25.320 --> 59:30.920]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[59:30.920 --> 59:34.360]  All right well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came
[59:34.360 --> 59:38.920]  back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com and folks you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's
[59:38.920 --> 59:44.840]  great for your body period and you support the broadcast infowarslife.com. Thank you Dr. Group
[59:44.840 --> 59:52.200]  from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.240]  Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.360]  A massive awakening is happening worldwide and you're a big part of it. You're the heart of it.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.400]  Send those links infowars.com forward slash show out to everybody you know. Drudge is doing it right
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:38.200]  now and send a link to drudgereport.com. Say this is the dominant media. This is the people's media.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:45.400]  This is the future that totally dwarfs all the dinosaur mainstream media. We got to shoot
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.640]  some reports on how drudge is bigger than New York Times and all of Facebook combined
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:57.480]  and now infowars is right behind drudge and then Breitbart I guess is right behind us.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.640]  I don't care in front of us or behind us. I could care less. I'm going to be quite a
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:08.520]  honest man. I don't want a bunch of more money. I want a nice car that runs nice to decent house
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.360]  and yeah swimming pool for the kids and medical care and be able to go on a couple of vacations a
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:19.560]  year. I don't do this for money. I need more money to expand my operation as a globalist.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.280]  I would love to see some wonderful talk show hosts pop up and some other dominant group
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.440]  smarter than I was to defeat these new world order people. They'll never be a utopia so they'll
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:35.080]  still be tyranny to fight but I'd make maybe a two or three films a year maybe maybe write a book
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:41.320]  every few years. I mean I just I don't want to say I don't want to do this. It either totally takes me over
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.720]  or I don't want to be involved in it. It's like I'm so driven and possessed by this that I don't
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.280]  even have any free will anymore. I just run around foaming at the mouth all day fighting
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.440]  with the world order. I dream about it. I jump out of bed. I run around like a crazy animal just
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:06.440]  wanting to fight. I just I'll be at midnight just doing more and it's just like because I know I'm
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.960]  under assault by the globalists. They think we're done. They're laughing at us. They're hurting people.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.600]  I just wanted to stop putting cancer viruses in the vaccines. I just wanted to stop
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.680]  paralyzing hundreds of kids per town and city. It's all admitted. That's coming up 30 minutes.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:25.480]  I just I know their plan. I just we need to stop it. You just need to stop because I want to go
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.720]  hiking. I want to travel the world. I want to do stuff. I do not want to sit here talking
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.680]  about Hillary Clinton all day. I'd rather get Trump in, cut the taxes, fix a lot of stuff,
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.160]  have a lot of detente, pressure China to reform. Trump gets off the reservation,
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.480]  you know, trying to keep him in line and just not dead. I want to work six, seven hours a day
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:49.720]  and see my kids. You know what I mean? And we can do that, folks, but we got to come together.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.840]  There's a powerful piece. I haven't gotten any of the clips yet, but we'll get to them all today.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.040]  Let's go to this massive evidence of election fraud and voter fraud taking place. It's up on
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.680]  inforwars.com from Fox News with the Washington Times reporter talking about it. Here it is.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.120]  Today is before the election three to be exact and voter fraud already cropping up in many of the
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.000]  races in the key states. So could the corruption impact the election results? We'll hear to look
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.480]  at some of the worst cases across the country. Washington Times editor Kelly Riddell. Kelly,
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.840]  good morning. Good to see you. Good morning. All right. So let's just get to some of these
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.440]  cases because this has already proven to be a real thing. For example, in California,
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.960]  man finds dozens, 83 balance on someone's home. So apparently 83 people live in one home.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:36.200]  Yeah. Well, Jerry Mosner, he was out gardening his house. He has an elderly neighbor who lives in
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.320]  a small little home. Notice that she had a lot of mail that day. So went to pick it up, found 83
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.800]  balance. And he's just an old woman living in this house. So they went to actually the LAPD
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.080]  to report this. And LAPD kind of shrugged their shoulders. They said, I'll go to the post office.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.400]  The post office was like, eh, we don't know what happened. Eventually, another neighbor went to
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:02.200]  the registrar's office and they're now investigating this. But it didn't seem too concerned there in
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.440]  California that 83 people were living in this small house all registered to vote. Well, and that's
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.360]  California. Here's where it could get serious in a state like Florida, where the polls are neck
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.400]  and neck for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Florida. They busted two women, two women,
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.880]  two women on, you know, third degree felonies for voter fraud because the first woman was out
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.920]  canvassing or she was supposed to be out canvassing for United people for like medical marijuana,
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.160]  out getting voter registrations. Well, apparently knocking on door to door was too difficult for
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:35.320]  her. So she just made up names. She put some dead people. She registered some dead people. She just
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.640]  made up falsified information, sent it all in and the registrar called. I'm going to come back and
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.360]  play this again. I should have probably opened the show with this because I don't know about how
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.160]  we're winning, whether they seal it or not. They're telling the military that, yes, we know Trump's
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.800]  going to win. You stand down. Hillary is our new God. So they're, and they got the military on
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:57.800]  standby for basically martial law. So there you go. And next she's going to raise your taxes. She
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:06.440]  wants to hurt you. Jobings here with info wars.com. You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:13.080]  Furious Trump blast FBI director after Houdini Hillary is cleared over second email investigation
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:19.080]  sparked by Anthony Weiner's teen sexting scandal. Donald Trump blasted the FBI's director on Sunday
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.480]  night telling a crowd of 8,000 people in Michigan that he rejects the bureau's latest move to
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.920]  exonerate Hillary Clinton. FBI chief James Comey told leaders in Congress hours earlier
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.520]  that a review of 650,000 emails discovered on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner had reinforced
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.160]  his July 5th decision to let her off the hook. Right now she's being protected by rig system.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.120]  Donald Trump said you can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You just can't do it. The
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.400]  investigations and her crimes will go on for a long, long time. Trump said in the Detroit suburb
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:55.960]  of Sterling Heights, somebody get James Comey Viagra because he finished too soon. This has
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:02.840]  been Joe Biggs with info wars.com. You know in the coming election, no matter who gets in,

[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:07.400]  pope is is just a piece of work all the saudi arabians that that are more probably more evil
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.640]  in the communist chinese they're just not as many saudi arabian elites so per capita
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.760]  they're probably worse but to have every evil organization this legion of doom lecturing us that
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.480]  we can't have donald trump and then now over sampling in the polls everywhere and he's still

[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.080]  but before i go to malinu because i want to ask you about this first here's fox news which
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.840]  out of the gates we already played this is like well trump is tied this is the same
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.240]  daughter of the republican neocon ambassador who was on cnn and said that she'd like someone
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.960]  to dress up in a uniform and kill me it just has a side issue that you know her and buzz
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.080]  vissinger fantasize about how they want to murder me and ritualistic kill me as long as we're in
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.360]  uniforms which just shows the real psychopathic weirdness you know as long as we're in a uniform
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:22.040]  and she goes uh but but now she's at fox and she she gets out oh trump's tied no trumps way ahead
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.640]  just let you know she's an operative the ambassador's daughter and then she goes the
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.600]  washington times editor who just starts listing some of it we have vote at info wars dot com is
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.120]  where you report what's happening with the vote it's flooding in dead people illegals the presidents
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:42.440]  on tv saying illegals we won't prosecute you you can vote i mean this is all about breaking our will
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.760]  in a congame we're going to molly new here in 60 seconds but but here's just some of that report
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.880]  of a laundry list that goes on for like 10 minutes of just fraud all over the country here it is all
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.400]  right so let's just get to some of these cases because this is already proven to be a real thing
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.640]  for example in california man finds dozens 83 balance on someone's home so apparently 83 people
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:07.880]  live in one home yeah well jerry mosner he was out gardening his house his he has an elderly
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.200]  neighbor who lives in a small little home noticed that she had a lot of mail that day so went to pick
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:19.320]  it up found 83 ballots um and he's like she's just an old woman living in this house so they went to
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:24.280]  actually the la pd to report this and the lmpd kind of shrugged their shoulders they said i'll go to
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:29.160]  the post office the post office was like yeah we don't know what happened um eventually another
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.960]  neighbor went to the registrar's office and they're now investigating this but um it didn't seem to
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.600]  concern there in california that 83 people were living in this small house all registered to vote
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.360]  and that's california here's where it could get serious in a state like florida where the polls
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.880]  are neck and neck for donald trump and hillary clinton florida they busted two women two women
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.920]  two women on you know third-degree felonies for voter fraud because the first woman was out canvassing
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.400]  or she was supposed to be out canvassing for united people for uh like medical marijuana
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.200]  out getting voter registrations well apparently knocking on door to door was too difficult for her
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.640]  so she just made up names um she put some dead people uh she registered some dead people she
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:12.200]  just made up falsified information sent it all in and just so happened to be with the democrats
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.800]  it just so happens to all being as trump another woman was actually working in the
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.880]  miami day elections department she was a volunteer opening up mail-in ballots when she noticed that
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.200]  some people didn't vote all the way down the ballot for the mayor she started checking boxes for them
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.080]  for her favorite candidate and uh was caught doing that yeah by the way that's the deciding county
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.680]  in florida how many others are out there yeah let's stop there i want to go to our guests
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.040]  i want to go to our guestroom skip this breaks we have more time stuff i'm all in and the point is
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.440]  is that i say trump's insane election fraud doesn't exist or voter fraud well when you organize
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.560]  voter fraud that's also election fraud we have electronic fraud going on it's all against trump
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.280]  beth Harris big liberal big democrat she has credibility bipartisan she says they're stealing
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.360]  it from trump she broke that last week they found the code nationwide they're doing to shave
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.160]  votes but they don't have it in every county and a few states don't have it so again it's it's
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.400]  kind of a cobbling of fraud early projections and other ways they're going to do it but then
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.280]  obama says there's no such thing i'm insane trump's insane but we're having the u in the e you and
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.240]  everybody else go out and sue donald trump everybody to stop exit pollers which are legal
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.400]  and lawful now the state department looks at third world elections to make sure they're open and free
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.160]  will there be unrest are they going to steal it is the landslide for trump
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.320]  i want to get his take on all of this stefan malinu i mean can you feel the energy my friend
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.680]  i gotta tell you alex i've never been a big sports fan for watching sports but getting pulled into
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:42.680]  this election cycle and being so interested in the outcome it's kind of like watching a football
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.640]  game where the winning team gets to rule western civilization for the next thousand years so pretty
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.240]  damn important quite an intense time so it's a more important game ever yes this is where it all
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.560]  comes down to this is literally the winner take all election because if trump gets in then the
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.720]  republican mandate at least the ones that the republican people want the republican supporters
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.720]  want not the one that the rhinos have been bait and switching republicans with for the past couple
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.760]  of decades they get their mandate if the uh if the democrats get in they're gonna legalize of
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.760]  course all the illegal immigrants we already know that the media is largely in the tank for them
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:20.360]  and they will be unbeatable statistically for pretty much ever and i love how i'm sitting here
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.840]  babbling you crystallize it perfectly walk through this the us for all its problems is
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:30.680]  is the inheritor of western civilization the new atlantis francis bacon the renaissance uh
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.400]  the rosa crucians whatever you want to call it that idea here we are all this wealth true
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.040]  liberalism all this freedom being pissed on by the multinationals telling us we're not the liberals
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.600]  when we are the original liberals uh we're the folks that ended slavery we're the ones behind it
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.640]  so so so we're now learning to live in this mind control zone as you said this decides
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:56.280]  where western civilization goes for a very long time uh it's such clear choices here break it down
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:04.280]  well okay so the question is are the rulers below or encapsulated within the rule of law
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:08.440]  this of course has been something that western civilization has been fighting for over a thousand
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:13.080]  years you could say back to the time of socrates 2,500 years ago we've been trying to put this
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.440]  control this lid over the power of the rulers and i think we can see but the what five now
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:25.080]  i guess down to four after comey's uh review of a tiny subset of the 650,000 emails said that they
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.480]  found no smoking gun of intent which of course nobody expected them to find we've got four other
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:35.000]  fbi investigations into clinton associates or their immediate families and this clinton stuff has
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.200]  been going on for decades as you know you've been covering it for a long time i've been
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.760]  observing it for a long time are the rulers below the rule of law can they be encapsulated and
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.480]  controlled by the rule of law if not we're back to monarchy but a very well armed monarchy and a
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.840]  monarchy with incredible electronic surveillance and control tools a monarchy with powers we never
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.760]  could have anticipated in the past or are we going to put government back under the rule
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:02.680]  of law are we going to have debates about ideas rather than demographics it all comes down to
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:10.440]  tomorrow that's right again it's the most racist thing ever when christians and patriots come
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:16.280]  real christians and and get rid of slavery worldwide england bans it and then somehow
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.600]  they turn it around and we're the ones making it not about what color you are but what you stand for
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.440]  now under the democrats and with all the minorities as if they were going to be
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.720]  more altruistic or better than a white person no they're just the same
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.600]  they're being turned to little clan members and we're hearing the most racist crap ever
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.160]  and the colleges are all self-segregating and we're hearing taught white people are inherently
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:42.280]  the problem and must be exterminated it is just as a classical liberal it totally flips me out
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:48.200]  that it's it's such a quick move to this but the left you know this as well as i do i'm sure but
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.840]  it may be new to your audience alex the left doesn't care about minorities they don't care about
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.240]  women they care that good people want equality for the races they care that good people want
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.800]  equality for the for the gender for the sexes and so what they do is they say well we care about
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.160]  blacks well how much do they care about clarence thomas or herman kane or other black republicans
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.720]  well they generally try to destroy and smear and all that kind of stuff how much do they care
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.960]  about some of the amazing women who were on the right that's right they bully them and they treat
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.400]  their people like they own them yeah it's not about it's it's it's trying to take our natural
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.880]  care and concern for equality between the races and the genders and turning it against us it is a
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:31.160]  lever it is a mechanism to use our best and most noble qualities against us it's a way of advancing
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:36.280]  socialism and collectivism and central planning using our sympathies for various groups they don't
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.240]  care about these groups other than a sort of pinion or ratchet way to get into more and more power
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.840]  that's right and we we see it in the wiki leaks how they're dividing groups how they want to quote
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:50.200]  keep us dumb keep us in the dark keep us confused keep us poor i mean i knew all this watching them
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:56.120]  but i knew they were telling cnn and msnbc what to do but it's all there a total blueprint
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.800]  how does hillary survive this even if she steals it i mean is this not a classic pyrrhic victory
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.960]  well of course it would depend on how stern congress would be in the aftermath of a hillary
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:12.680]  presidency would they go after her for some of the alleged law breaking activities that she's
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.960]  been engaged in would there be an impeachment uh that would be up to uh the spine and resolution
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:22.840]  of the republicans in congress and of course i'm not exactly sure where that stands i think that
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.640]  they've been stiffened up a little bit by trump who's lent them some significant free market spine
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.160]  but i don't know if they would have the resolution to go in it would really depend maybe on the
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.200]  republican voters to see how staunch they would be but alex at what point this collusion coming
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.120]  out of the wiki leaks coming out of the dnc leaks and the pedestrian emails the collusion between
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:45.880]  the clinton campaign uh and various media outlets dear lord above alex at what point is this just a
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:50.280]  campaign donation at which point are they just going to be registered as packs and be honest about it
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.000]  well that's why they want to take all libertarian or conservative or any other anti-war whatever
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.960]  they don't control and make that political speech something taxable controllable because
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.760]  they're going to be exempt from all this just as they've been with the whole irs persecution
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:09.400]  no 501 c threes to conservative groups or libertarian groups or veterans groups or gun
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.760]  groups tens of thousands of their groups it truly is as you say a monarchy where they hand out the
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:20.520]  licensure the letters of mark just like obama care thousands of waivers to big companies
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:25.000]  don't have to do it but i have to do it well how do i compete then well i don't i'm supposed to go
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:32.280]  away and this is the amazing thing when you think of the amount of cultural and educational and
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:37.960]  um academic force behind the democrats that they're still faltering at the moment you know the
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.520]  democrat controlled government schools control children's minds for 12 years indoctrinated them
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.680]  into big state big government policies uh you have the withholding information of information
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.840]  in crucial elections like blaming Benghazi on a video when they knew it was false you have the
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:56.520]  importation of tens of millions of immigrants from the third world they're inflicting children
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.240]  with super guilt if they're white and then teaching minorities are a majority to hate
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.720]  because they're now a minority a majority of the schools to hate the white kids they are inflicting
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:11.480]  them with all this environmental crime they're creating basket cases sorry no and so you have
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:17.320]  you have education you have hollywood you have academia you have the mainstream media constantly
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:22.360]  pounding this provisional misinformation and ignoring facts and rejecting rational arguments
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.640]  rejecting empirical evidence and still like watching a superhero coming crawling out of the
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:32.760]  wreckage comes the clarity and resolution of the american people of all races and genders wanting
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:39.320]  to push back against this tidal wave of misinformation to me this is a truly heroic time watching it's
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:44.040]  like watching i agree it's so epic it's it's it's pull his way out of these these chains of these
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.360]  tiny people now i totally agree it's like watching samson even though the american people have their
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.680]  eyes gouged out and their ears gouged out and have been starved death for 10 years in a dungeon
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:56.920]  still knocked the pillars down i think we're reaching that moment so so stefan looking into your
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.560]  political crystal ball you're a smart guy you saw this coming a long time ago what does your gut
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.320]  tell you i mean if they rigged everything else they're going to rig the election they've been
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.720]  caught it's all in the wiki leagues what do we do if there's all this evidence of fraud already
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.960]  coming out they're oversampling the polls still he's winning in those polls if he loses in oversampled
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.920]  polls against him i mean if he's winning in polls that are oversampled and then he loses
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.320]  in the general election we know there's a fraud they already told us in plain view oh your vote
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.840]  doesn't matter in the primary the republican party will decide we are sovereign george will
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:37.240]  actually said the sovereign party will decide not a mere plurality of the public and he let us know
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.440]  his arrogance from the washington post well guess what my website's bigger than yours according to
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:51.880]  comcast dumbass you sit there i am i am george will i were a bowtie you don't count we are the
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:59.560]  sovereign what the hell's wrong he's just stupid looking and ridiculous is kim jong-un well the
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:05.400]  key of course to winning the election is to have win to have trump win by such a margin
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.120]  that it becomes impossible to rig so that of course is one solution and really i think it's
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:15.880]  a solution that would be the very best if it's close or if there appears to be some significant
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:21.240]  manipulation of the vote if it wasn't trump i would say that the republicans would probably
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.200]  cave but trump is a fighter trump is somebody who as he's always said you hit me i'm gonna hit back
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.320]  harder uh he is gonna stand for the right process he is gonna stand to make sure that the election
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:36.200]  is as honest as possible i don't think he's going to fold if he thinks something really uh
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:41.800]  untoward has occurred and that of course may be the only hope uh if if it's close enough and it
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:47.240]  appears to be um some some hinky stuff going on if it wasn't trump i would say there'd be a folding
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:53.800]  but i don't think that will be with him and someone named mr. podesta was in emails to top democratic
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:59.400]  operatives this was in i think data dump 12 and they said there's going to be some wet work in the
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.200]  next few days they're like oh my god we made the decision they go yes we're going to launch operations
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:08.680]  batting down the hatches it's going to get rough i mean those are terms they use and then uh the
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:14.280]  supreme court justice who last time defeated them in 2000 we're not saying bush is good but you know
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:21.000]  what happened now it's going to be four four split they would have had scalia to put trump in so scalia
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.120]  sleeps with the fishes and then the washington post the same publication let us know a month later
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:32.680]  oh he was in a secret society when he died and there was a pillow on his face bye bye i mean
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:38.280]  they just throw it in our face i think the key thing to understand for me about the left alex
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.120]  is that it's impossible to really fathom their motives and their machinations without understanding
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.200]  that they're addicts to power and uh if you've ever known somebody and i hope you haven't but if
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.760]  you have ever known somebody in your life who's a real addict whether it's sex or gambling or
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:58.840]  drugs or alcohol or whatever they will do anything to get their drug of choice they will step over
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.760]  bodies they will destroy their lives they will lose their savings their marriage their relationships
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.800]  with their children look at the clinton's look at the clinton's look at the clinton's they are
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.120]  everywhere they go we learned the state department you name it why else they steal everything they're
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.160]  mentally ill they are addicts to they believe everything is theirs they have this total entitlement
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:20.920]  mentality and they'll be as nice to whoever holds that power in this case it happens to be the
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.000]  american electorate and of course the complaint has been made by african americans and i think
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.280]  quite reasonably that the democrats will kind of bungee in and love them to death every time they
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.360]  need their votes and they'll bungee back out and leave the inner cities to continue into look at
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:39.880]  haiti look at haiti yeah yeah they bungee in and and they they say all of these wonderful great things
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.480]  are going to happen and as soon as they get what they want you know it's like it's like a drug addict
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.720]  who comes to you because they want to borrow 50 bucks well they're real nice to you until
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.080]  you get you give them the 50 bucks and then they vanish and then they're only going to come back
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:57.240]  when they want more so if we frame the left as as addicts for power then i think it's a lot easier
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.720]  to understand how they operate and what they're doing there's no particular standards it's just
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.240]  can i get the next hit of my drug of choice let me give people a little insight into trump
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.920]  psychology because before i started endorsing him i did a lot of research people that know him
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.400]  if it's a big powerful corporation or a group he's obsessed with beating him and nobody's going to
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.080]  cheat him but with little people in his organization at work hard it's almost like he has this almost
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.400]  like a white guilt or something he like promotes minorities women puts them in charge they work
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.560]  hard to get super loyal to him that's what jesse jackson gave him an award for hiring record numbers
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.480]  of black folks and putting him in positions of power and the truth is when he says great energy
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:37.960]  i love i love you know black people it's not a patronizing thing trump trump likes like real
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.880]  people i don't know he likes energy he likes not putting on an act he likes confidence and he likes
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:50.200]  boxers he likes men and he just he can't stand going to these black areas and seeing what horrible
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.360]  squalor it is and and the corruption what the democrats have done he literally sold people
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.440]  on lgbt freedom the democrats wouldn't even mention hillary wouldn't even do it okay he literally sold
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.360]  everybody on reparations which you shouldn't do reparations just whites did something but okay
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.560]  let's have tax exemption for black folks in these areas let's have uh a tax credits to move businesses
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.640]  in for people that actually want to take advantage oh yeah sure let's let's help groups that have been
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:21.000]  disadvantaged with with the tax code you know instead of these elite billionaires the black
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.760]  people should be falling down before donald trump what he's done it's total trailblazing instead we
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.680]  go out in public and have groups running up screaming you homophobic support donald trump
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.680]  you son of a bitch i'm like we've got it on them what are you talking about he wants he wants to
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:42.440]  kill gay people it's total made up crap well okay first of all donald trump has the amazing ability
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.000]  even though he grew up relatively privileged and of course it's immensely wealthy but as far as i've
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.320]  read and and what he said and the people i've talked to he likes hanging out with the construction
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.040]  workers rather than the the sort of black tie affair no that's it he doesn't like the elite cab
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:00.120]  drivers and he's got the common touch he's got a huge amount of power he's vastly intelligent the
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.840]  man's a complete genius i mean this he just wandered into politics and is winning against somebody
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.480]  who's been in politics for decades that's immensely impressive that's like a boxer wandering off the
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.640]  street and taking down mike tyson i mean you've got to give the man some props for his skills his
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.680]  resolution his courage his thick skin his dedication his passion and his seriousness there's almost
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.320]  nothing more powerful in public and they say no one has ever campaigned like this he is the
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:29.160]  total presidential material look at him imagine him negotiate events yesterday i mean good lord
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:33.560]  that is a i don't know how much coffee i'd have to drink to do five giant speeches in a day but the
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.880]  man's 70 and he's a complete workhorse in a powerhouse and he has this capacity to connect with
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.760]  the needs of the people here's what happens he he thrives on beating people that are trying to
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:47.880]  suppress him and he sees america he sees himself as america that's why they're so scared they figured
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:55.240]  out oh my god we're on the mark we'll be back with stefan molyneux run alex jones and the gcn radio

[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.640]  lackadaisical not care they want us to take our normal instincts to be politically and culturally
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:45.160]  involved and put it onto the prosthesis of sports that's like having sex with a blow-up doll folks

[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.800]  that's not our religion is what i'm getting at and we've reached this this tipping point now
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.760]  where people are into politics they're awake they're involved and donald trump was just that magic
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:26.600]  little little sprinkle in this whole recipe that is just exploding and there's gonna be more so

[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:19.160]  basically we want to just absolutely show them not in some weird exercise of dominance but because
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.520]  we know they're a fraud they're a joke and they've collapsed because it's not that we're that big
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:31.000]  it's they're they're that small now and the fact that there are stuff on Malinus and so many others
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.600]  now there's hundreds and hundreds of prominent smart really cool educated people hitting on all
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:43.000]  cylinders and it's the real wake of humanity so as negative as things are and as bad as some of it
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.760]  is Hillary just canceled two hours ago she was gonna she already had a set up her victory fireworks
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.800]  display and it's on infowars.com she canceled it step on in the five minutes we have left i want
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.360]  to commend you want to invite you back on a regular basis you know more than once a month we appreciate
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.280]  the work you do and i'm gonna give out your website here for a moment people should mark it down
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:08.520]  that is freedomainradio.com but Stefan do you disagree with me if you do please tell me but
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:15.800]  i just seem to feel it see it intellectually at just a mathematical level it's almost euphoric
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.800]  the victory we're having but then i got to be honest they got the nuclear weapons they've
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:25.640]  seized control they're still in charge they still tax me they still control the enforcers
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:30.760]  even if the enforcers are awake and don't like what's happening so i shouldn't as the wolf says
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:36.440]  in pulp fiction we shouldn't start taking care of each other quite yet well here's the thing alex
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.000]  and i sort of want to put this out to your audience to to remember that the wheels of truth of
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.480]  reality of justice of evidence do turn slowly and many times in human history it has felt that
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:54.920]  there is no possibility of survival of flourishing of freedom of reason of evidence of connection
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.960]  of virtue there have been many times where it looks like society is falling like Atlantis into a
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:06.040]  boiling sea of collectivism and moral decay and that is when people need to step up if you know
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.600]  this information you need to become a leader in your community don't consult don't necessarily
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:15.640]  just have debates be a leader get the information into people's heads however you can that's it get
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:20.520]  aggressive now get aggressive get aggressive yeah now's the time what do you have to lose the
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:26.520]  alternative to not being an aggressive leader in your own community and making people understand
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:32.120]  how important it is right now to do the important thing to take a stand for everything that our
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.240]  forefathers built all the freedoms all the equalities equality under the law equality of the
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.760]  genders opportunities for everyone the pursuit of happiness millions of people's millions of men's
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:47.960]  bloods were shed for this incredible opportunity this great glorious cathedral of freedom we've
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:53.400]  all inherited now is the time to take a stand to take leadership to protect it and it doesn't
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.480]  matter if people don't like you and it doesn't matter if you think that they're in your face it
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:02.920]  doesn't matter at all because what matters is we keep our freedoms and it's like taking the drink
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.760]  away from the drunk he may dislike you in the moment but down the road he is going to get on
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.880]  his hands and knees and thank you for saving him from himself and that is our job right now
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.680]  i mean that's the most powerful two minutes of radio i've heard in 10 years
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:22.280]  stephane crystallized and that's the great abomination the tyrants couldn't compete with a
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:29.480]  moral group of people that wanted equality so they in the 60s became the supposed leaders of the
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:35.960]  movement to then only invert it and create a giant infighting race-based gender-based thing
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:44.120]  and it's so outrageous to see them attacking the west that has been the heart and the soul and the
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:51.080]  fulcrum of renaissance it's truly an abomination but but but once you see the deception it all
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:56.440]  crystallizes and we don't have much in common with our leaders this is the thing i'm going to
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:02.280]  say this to everyone particularly those who are tempted by hillary clinton blacks whites men women
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:09.240]  we are a horizontal slave pen of tax livestock at the moment do not identify with the leaders who
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.480]  want to increase their power over you it is horizontally that we're going to find our freedom
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:19.000]  it is in our support of each other race community sex gay straight doesn't matter it is in our
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.680]  solidarity with each other that we are going to gain our freedom get rid of all of this overstating
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:29.160]  power all of this intrusion all of this control these regulations these high taxes these foreign
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.200]  wars and we shall find a peace with each other horizontally we shall find a tribalism and and
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.880]  a companionship with each other that means we don't have to look upwards anymore to to to get
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.880]  connection we get connection with each other we build communities with each other what a glorious
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.200]  place that will be because at the ground level is real connection all the other connection is
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.920]  artificial absolutely beautiful words it's all artificial it's all about not giving us connection
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:58.280]  everything they do saying put a baby in a crib don't touch people don't don't have sports don't
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:03.320]  go through crises don't go through trials don't go through rituals don't go through rites of passage
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:10.600]  they admit it's all about killing leadership killing free association killing ascension of the
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:16.520]  species it i don't believe it's space aliens in closing but the attack the globalists are involved
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:21.480]  in stuff i'm on the new is what i would do if i was an alien force trying to kill a species
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:27.240]  and keeping it from going to the stars well of course united we stand and divided we fall and
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:31.640]  the goal of those who want to rule over us is to set us against each other with artificial divisions
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.800]  whether it's the color of the skin or the gender or sexual orientation none of these things matter
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.840]  we are all good people who wish freedom and wish equality under the law turning against each other
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.160]  is only handing more and more ammunition upstairs to those who would rule over us and it is a
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:50.760]  suicidal course we must reach out to each other in companionship that solidarity is what destroys
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.320]  oligarchical hierarchies and nothing else in the long run will do and that's why they're desperately
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:01.320]  opening up huge new forms of division so nakedly the opposite of what martin Luther King said
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.800]  i know you're back tonight i'm told this is great seven p.m with rob do with more with
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:11.240]  stefan malinu stefan powerful radio thank you thank you alex and of course it's powerful
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:17.400]  everything is even more powerful now the energy level is just maximum because the decisions being
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:24.120]  made the species level at the main command base of of liberty and the new renaissance and everything
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:30.200]  christianity really meant to be is being decided right now by a bunch of of course there's devil

[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:45.320]  hanging around a bunch of kids i mean that sounds like hell doesn't it but see for them
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.440]  it's about being nasty little pieces of crap and we're going to bring them down don't worry you

[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:10.040]  you know about all the secret testing why would you trust these people let's go to a john bound
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:16.280]  report it's extremely powerful election chaos unleashed here in us and when a woman is running
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:22.200]  for office nobody likes it nobody likes an ambitious you know a woman like that nobody likes that but
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:30.120]  what once they're in then she's like mommy she's mommy now and everybody's gonna like her grab my
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:35.560]  hand she said your mom was well i agree she must money i said but why do you think she must win
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.520]  and she told me her name she told me she was eight years old she said well two reasons i said okay i
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.760]  i have a lot more than two reasons but but what are your two reasons she said well one it's time
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:49.960]  for a girl i said i agree it's time for a girl and then and then she looks at me and she said something
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:56.920]  that broke my heart she said well she also has to win because the boys in my school say that if
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:01.160]  donald trump wins my dad's gonna have to go back into the closet and there are monsters there
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.800]  and i looked at her and i said there are monsters there we're not gonna let that happen
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:13.800]  well chelsea mommy is a high-level practitioner of the black magic arts and daddy is alleged to
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:20.360]  have raped girls younger than the one chelsea was speaking to mommy and daddy are the monsters
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:26.680]  in the closet and their unyielding pursuit of total power is tearing the united states
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.880]  apart as if hillary clinton's email scandal couldn't harm her campaign enough today the new
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:37.800]  york post reported as secretary of state hillary clinton routinely asked her made to print out
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:44.920]  sensitive government emails and documents including ones containing classified information from her
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:51.560]  house in washington dc emails and fbi memos show but the housekeeper lacked the security clearance
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:58.280]  to handle such material in fact marina santos was called on so frequently to receive emails
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.600]  that she may hold the secrets to email gate if only the fbi and congress would subpoena her
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:11.400]  and the equipment she used meanwhile and for the sake of the real danger facing us all let's not
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:19.080]  call them illegal aliens undocumented immigrants refugees or even migrants foreigners beholden
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:25.080]  to the obama and hillary illegal salinsky i divide and conquer scheme are being thrust
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:32.280]  towards the voting booths to decide the outcome of an election hijacked from the dwindling grasp
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:40.280]  of the american people more than 37 and a half million people in our country have already voted
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:52.040]  now why are they out there voting because i believe they are standing up for a hopeful
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:59.400]  inclusive vision of america many of the millenials dreamers undocumented citizens and i call them
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:06.360]  citizens because they contribute to this country are fearful of voting so if i vote will immigration
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:12.440]  know where i live will they come for my family and deport us not true and the reason is first of all
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:20.040]  when you vote you are a citizen yourself and there is not a situation where the voting rules
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:27.560]  somehow are transferred over and people start investigating etc the same to the vote is strictly
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:36.280]  confidential while we're at it great and i witness told me i interviewed her i just haven't uploaded
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:42.680]  the video yet but i interviewed her and she said that a guy was carrying a sign and apparently it
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:49.000]  had some it was like reporting to be a pro trump sign but it had some tape on it that would indicate
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:59.320]  it was anti-trump and the guy had a gun on his hip and apparently there were at least four men
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.480]  probably more who made sure that he could not draw the gun out of his holster so they basically all
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:12.280]  pressed down on the gun kept it in the holster and you know that of course the law enforcement
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:19.480]  formed him and just got piled on the guy uh and held them until law enforcement could card him away
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:24.360]  and now the military industrial intelligence apparatus wants to keep the american voter
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:31.560]  afraid to approach a voting booth as the site intel group a rand corporation creation posts
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:38.280]  twitter warnings reading breaking isa special hi-hat media dot calls for attacks on voters
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:45.880]  on election day demands muslims not participate in democratic process vote america vote like your

[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:21.800]  now i'm going to take the record viewers we have they're not just listeners normally it's about three
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.960]  million every couple hours probably about six seven million right now from what we're getting
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:31.880]  metrics of a lot of new folks are tuning in right now i want to take the opportunity to warn people
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.240]  the la times you name it or announcing all these kids are getting paralyzed they won't say what it is
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.880]  this linked to vaccines same thing with adults getting sick from flu shots it's on the inserts
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.480]  folks they can make you sick so dr grip coming back we're going to break this down tell us what's
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:51.240]  happening what's happening is is very uh distressing to me alex because i've been getting a lot of
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:58.440]  calls over the last couple weeks you know everybody is so uh glued to the election process and i
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:05.960]  always think you know is there something else that could possibly be going on that is a stealth attack
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:11.480]  that nobody's talking about and as a matter of fact you know i go to soccer practice and football
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:15.000]  practice and everybody's talking about this flu shot this year and how they're getting sick and
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.400]  how their kids are getting sick so i started digging in and doing some research and the first
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:26.440]  thing that i found was that obama signed an executive order on november the sixth november the
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:32.520]  fourth two thousand sixteen no one really knows about this the executive order is advancing the
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:38.120]  global health security agenda to achieve a world safe and secure from infectious stay there under
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.880]  unesco u n he's got a special vaccine and you've got your patients everybody calling you super sick

[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:55.240]  the fall it's on plus all these other shots making kids get paralyzed everywhere a shot insert says
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:59.320]  it can paralyze you but the doctors tell you we don't know why it's happening to cover their butt
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:05.480]  you know in the cunning election no matter who gets in one of the biggest issues nobody's talking
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:11.160]  about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid the potential for power grid
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:19.160]  chaos emp cyber warfare onto mentioned dangerous weather hurricanes ice storms all a very real
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:23.720]  threat to our grid my friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse that's

[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:30.280]  and talk about the election as well but listen to me very carefully there've been thousands of
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:36.920]  secret government testing projects carried out by illegal subgroups in the government basically
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.600]  just like pedophiles in government try to get you involved in pedophilia they'll also try to get
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  you in secret testing thinking you're following orders then to say by the way what you did was
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:50.520]  illegal for the rest of your life you follow my orders that's how cults work so that's why they
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.760]  keep doing secret testing and other governments do it like why shoot black people up with syphilis
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:00.120]  for 45 years to corrupt people while you carry out your operations why would Bayer mail out for a
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:05.720]  decade hundreds of thousands of hemophilics getting HIV and hepatitis from one of their products
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:11.240]  factor eight it came out lawsuits to corrupt governments and people that went along these
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:16.840]  corporations are very sophisticated and dr groups here breaking down the fact that thousands of kids
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.400]  all over the country we have the article cnn you name it are becoming paralyzed and they keep saying
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:26.840]  we don't know why well it's the back to school shots they know that but now with this flu it's
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.800]  even bigger this is killing people this is this is causing massive injuries worse than anything
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.600]  we've ever seen the flu shots always cause problems so what are they really up to dr group
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:43.000]  well you got the bill that's what i wanted to talk about today yeah absolutely it's crazy that
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.480]  that obama would sign this executive order promoting global health security as a core
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:53.080]  tenant of our national strategy for countering biological threats what does while they leave
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:56:00.440]  the open for syphilis and for a bubonic plague and now leprosy to come across the southern border
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:05.400]  they let it come through but he's gonna keep it safe right right therefore it's a policy of the
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:11.560]  united states to advance the global health security agenda which i i i recommend everybody go to
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.240]  whitehouse gov and read this thing it's it's pretty long but you and take over what does
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:19.560]  that have to do with vaccines well if you look at the people that are involved in this global
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:25.560]  partnership and then you start looking at this year's vaccinations i then went to the cdc and
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:35.960]  found this what's new for the 2016 2017 flu season there will be some new vaccines on the market this
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:42.840]  season and this is from now until the end of 2016 to the beginning of some new cancers are available
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:48.200]  mind you that everybody right now has election stress disorder everybody's immune systems are
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:55.880]  down everybody's dealing with emotional situations right now and we are in stress and all the holiday
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.880]  foods right so they always time it to when they know your immune system is going to be at its
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:07.880]  weakest point so this season only injectable flu vaccines should be used now remember we had in the
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:14.920]  past we had nasal miss vaccines but this year they're recommending only injectable why is that
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:20.200]  there's two different vaccines that totally bypasses the immune system dangerous this year
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:28.360]  a high dose shot for older people now remember oh special just for you 65 and we don't want to give

[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:51.320]  what did julien assange come out five days later in a big exclusive interview and said the intel
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:54.760]  is they're gonna fix the election people keep saying well where's the big bombshells he's
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:58.840]  released it obama talking to her with secret email talking about keeping the public poor
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:06.440]  disparaging poor people talking about rigging cnn rigging msnbc rigging questions rigging polls
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:14.040]  in between weird-ass devil worship stuff i mean you know i i quite frankly can't believe this stuff
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:18.520]  now and more came out today about them rigging questions that wolf blitzer would ask donald trump
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:25.560]  the democrats have hit a new bottom i'm sure the republican establishment that's been backing
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.560]  them would probably hit an even bigger bottom if it was some republican candidate they put in
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:33.880]  but trump is the opposite of that now our guest isn't on about trump he isn't on about parties
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.400]  but the truth is whether it's assange or whether it's the head of the green party
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:44.760]  uh you're coming out saying hillary's a vote for war or whether you're jill stein real liberals
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:50.600]  just cover the facts and the fact is there's election fraud going on the fact is they've
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:56.680]  discovered software around the country that allows them to shave with the fractions and so bev
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:02.520]  harris joined us last monday it was huge bombshell interview more than eight million views just on
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:08.280]  video platforms not just a show with three million listeners and viewers every hour now on average
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:11.960]  so the good news is this is getting out the problem is mainstream media is acting like no
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.960]  this is happening they will not cover it they would have her on when she was exposing the
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:21.720]  republicans of fraud but she said listen and i know he is i'm aware of his work she said john
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:26.520]  breakey is like the one of the leading p at real experts you should have on so we're honored to have
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.160]  him here uh he is a elections investigator election integrity advocate and former business owner
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:39.320]  he is co-founder of audit az americans for democracy integrity and transparency in elections
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:45.080]  which assisted with winning the rta election records lawsuit awarding plaintiff's largest yield
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:52.360]  of electronic elections data in the country today while fighting for transparency publicly
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.080]  verified elections john breakey and his team discovered and i should just let him go through
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:01.480]  this because this will take 20 minutes to go through but they they are the real deal and they're
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:08.520]  proving it in court and winning and now they found the mother load and it is just horrific to know
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:14.680]  this is happening and then to see the media say it doesn't exist there's no fraud it's very very
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:20.040]  painful so election officials dig into high potential proof of electronic vote rigging
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.240]  tuesday so he's here to break it down one of the leading experts bev harris says bigger expert than
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.280]  she is she's a very humble lady the point is she's been very effective and very accurate uh wow thank
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:36.280]  you for joining us sir election nightmares dot com uh is there on screen for tv viewers election
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:43.240]  nightmares dot com you're the expert where should we start well you know uh let's leave off where
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:48.280]  bev harris you know start we'll pick up where she left off is that you know the big effort that we're
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:56.680]  making on a national level is that the technology is changing and we want elections that are one
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:05.720]  transparent take the black box and turn it into a um a transparent box last house yeah two we must
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:13.080]  have elections that are transparent and that means chain of custody uh you know it means uh in the
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:19.640]  esns world or sequoia cast vote records and have a hyperlink to the ballot image and then it also
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:25.880]  means that elections become publicly verifiable and we know how to do that and the technology is
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:32.920]  taking us there because the old system of a marked sensor technology is disappearing and they are
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.960]  creating ballot images now the bad thing about these ballot images they're being destroyed
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:44.200]  everywhere and that's what we're finding out i have sued pima county won the court case they must
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:50.920]  preserve their ballot images and then we put another 10 counties in the state of arizona on notice
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:58.280]  that if they destroy these images they have committed a class six felony and we are urgently
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:03.560]  pushing them very hard and letting them know that we'll put our lawyers on them if they do destroy
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:09.960]  these images and then we find it's happening in colorado bob fratricus in ohio just sued his
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.320]  secretary of state and of course we have no media but we got alex jones and thank you
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:20.520]  well i was about to say though sir obama says there's no such thing as election fraud but he
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:25.800]  separately says we're at the greatest threat ever from the russians so we've had to federalize it i
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.760]  i mean that sounds like a fever dream or something it sounds like insanity what's really going on
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:36.520]  well we're moving into an orwellian world and everything they say is the opposite
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:43.720]  and uh and you know we don't need the feds involved we know you know in my experience you know i've
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:48.760]  been doing this for 12 years in fact alex this is my anniversary wow we're getting down the rabbit
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:57.080]  hole it was on november 7th 2004 that i caught a very sophisticated trick and switch uh going on
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:03.320]  at my precinct i was a cluster captain of four and i spent a thousand hours investigating that
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:10.520]  and then realized that what i caught wasn't happening everywhere it was a stack and in case
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:15.560]  they had an audit they can say go audit this precinct because the way they had set the thing up
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:19.400]  so they got an algorithm that selectively does it here and there so they can deny
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:26.680]  fine fraction magic is real okay and it is very easy to and define that because i know you're
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:31.560]  really smart engineers you're inside the box and outside the box you define it for me like i'm five
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:40.680]  years old well fraction magic is a application that was found by benny smith out of uh minnesota
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:47.640]  tennessee where he followed basically the cheese back to the rat by getting those databases that
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:53.000]  ben sent off to europe to get decrypted when they came back that he was able to go ahead and find
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.640]  how the system was rigged the and of course they do it on a precinct level because elections are
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:05.960]  stolen on a precinct level because that's how the demographics work and so basically you can go ahead
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:12.680]  and really program the database uh through this application to give the results that you want to
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:19.000]  give and uh and then what's really startling about it is that you know at some locations not very many
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.760]  we do have some hand count audits and the first time i got introduced the fraction magic what i
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:31.240]  wanted to see is how fast i could derig because you know i've been arrested because i've challenged
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:39.400]  elections and how they did the lottery drawings or try to rig the recounts and uh i know that when
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:46.840]  they do a lottery pick if they do not commit the precinct results on the spot before they do the
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:52.760]  drawing that they can walk in the back room and with that or a minute derig the precincts
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:59.000]  that they have selected to audits and the audits will match up that's a scary thing so we've got
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.720]  criminal managerial level accounting obviously that's how they've taken over but they've already
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:11.720]  got it set up for their so-called remedy if you do catch them how do you counter that well pretty
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:20.760]  simple fraction magic will change the numbers in the database but it cannot choose a you cannot
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:25.960]  change a ballot image so we make mistakes of the the the ballot image now now let's talk about
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.240]  this election all the different news coming in of dead people people voting multiple times
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:35.880]  but that's voter fraud that's being organized and then we also have obviously digital stuff
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:40.680]  it's a lot harder to find and we've got a lot of vote flipping i mean i guess that's the older
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:44.760]  standard way what does it mean when we start seeing a bunch of vote flipping like like one
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:52.840]  and it seems we always against trump you know the uh a very sophisticated hack is not going to show
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:58.200]  you on the screen what's really happening with a lot of these dres and i can't say this is a fact i
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:03.640]  mean you know but they're 12 years old they were cheaply built back in with the help america well
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:08.440]  it's a 12 year old cheap computer so it's just frizzing out it's freaking out it's not calibrated
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:14.280]  problem the screens are delaminating and uh the real you know look there look there but the real
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:19.320]  trick is going inside the computer and we've caught companies loading the fraction magic program on
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.680]  shouldn't be there to be able to pre-program i mean that's the proof yeah yeah and the proof is
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:30.600]  is they can't prove that elections are honest because they don't verify and if we can get
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:37.720]  at these ballot images okay then we could verify it's these ballot images is what the machine
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:43.320]  counts when you guys are excited because you found a way since these programs already have it in them
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:46.920]  to be able to have people have a record have a receipt go back and check it do spot counts do
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:52.920]  spot checks and really verify precinct by precinct but it's not being done it's being rigged let me
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:58.040]  ask you listen why did the wire more and more of the companies doing the image save software
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:04.520]  if it's their undoing because the mark sensor technology remember we were in school and we
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:09.160]  took the iowa test and you filled in the bubble oh the scanner is working off of that so that's
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:15.640]  just the basis of it right the new scanners use ballot images because that's the technology
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:22.120]  we're at a point now it's like scantron it's like scantron yeah it's like taking a document scanner
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.920]  and scanning in your document got it okay i see so it's part of the process so they might as well
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:30.520]  just save that it's like saving the balance it's digital with compression it's totally cheap
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:35.800]  yeah and they're not doing it now in fact as you expose and others they're they're working
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:41.480]  very hard to expunge it yes and they're doing it over and over and places that we check yeah and
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:45.720]  that's always evidence of the crime what we've caught them wow john breaky amazing election

[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.800]  eastern funny a lot of times you wouldn't think the election results wouldn't be until maybe 10 or
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:26.200]  11 pacific that'd be eight o'clock pacific but they've canceled that fireworks display
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:29.640]  they're not saying they're holding back they're just they've just canceled it
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.640]  and every battleground state drumps ahead in their skewed polls even in the skewed polls
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:41.240]  and here's the new york times tv networks face a skeptical public on election night
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:45.000]  yeah look for cnn that keeps projecting her as the winner to say she's the winner at six o'clock
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.200]  at night so people all across the west don't go out and vote just another nasty trick like
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:55.320]  Ted Cruz got caught doing in Iowa saying Ben Carson had quit and then he got a big percentage
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:01.320]  of his votes for the next three hours i want to have this gentleman back obviously to get into a
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:06.520]  bigger in-depth discussion of this but i gotta tell you it is just mind-blowing when bev Harris
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:11.640]  she's not a person that gets up there and crows about things she said undoubtedly this is the
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:15.560]  biggest thing she's ever discovered they've ever discovered it in fact it's bigger than everything
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:18.680]  it's how they're doing and how they're putting a program on that shouldn't be there
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:26.200]  you know it's it's it's it shouldn't be there and it's there and they've been and they go to
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:32.600]  the polling places and they run in fear they've arrested this guy uh wow uh so going back to
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:37.800]  john bricky of election nightmares.com in the five minutes we have left other key points you want
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:47.080]  to impart to people well i would urge people to file a records request at their county and i would
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:52.440]  ask for the ballot images and when they say they don't have them then why don't you and uh because
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:57.960]  that is the future we need to change out this junk equipment we got to make elections transparent
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:03.400]  trackable and publicly verifiable you know in your earlier hour you were talking about community
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:08.680]  and uh you know what i want to add to that is is that you know the final solution is to get back
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:15.000]  to a precinct type level voting that we are doing hand counts and verifying there at these precincts
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.120]  which they admit says you said statistically it's easier to do paper verify at the precinct it's
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:25.320]  put on the wall everybody sees it you add them together that's how it should be done absolutely
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:30.760]  alex and uh we have to get there because everything else is a game and and the sad thing that's kind
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:36.120]  of the history of this country is that it's the very beginning that you know really voting has
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:41.880]  been a struggle and uh you know and there are people in this country i call them a status quo
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:46.680]  that keep things the way they are uh our whole system i can see from all the years i've been
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.880]  involved fighting corruption is that pay to play system is how it works that's right i mean the real
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:57.080]  way you get stuff done is pay to play and some areas may have have decent voting others don't
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:00.520]  there's clearly though because they know there's an awakening of populism that transcends
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:04.680]  left or right there's a real appetite now in the establishment to really push the envelope and be
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:10.680]  very naked about it and i think that's where they failed i think they're brazen rigging of polls
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:15.960]  and everything is really blowing up in their face and i've never seen the public more receptive now
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:21.400]  to exposing election fraud have you found that totally alex is that you know i feel like we've
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:27.560]  passed the rubicon voter fraud uh was an orwellian trick everything that went wrong in election they
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:33.480]  call it voter fraud when the reality is it's election fraud election fraud yeah you know if i
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:38.040]  could just give one little quick story about massachusetts you know i canvassed the whole country
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:43.560]  in this last election cycle i took off uh all the whole year thus far and worked elections in
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:49.800]  massachusetts they have 351 municipalities and you know far as i'm concerned the uh votes that are
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.560]  counted in five of the states of new england are counted by the mafia it's a group called lhs okay
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:28:02.040]  and in massachusetts the 351 municipalities a lot of them subcontract out their elections to this
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:06.920]  company and they come in and basically run the machines program them and set them up well anyway
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:12.120]  in that election with bernie sanders against hillary bernie sanders lost the state by 1.42
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:20.280]  percent but shockingly 68 of these small communities hand counted their votes and sanders won that by
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:26.280]  an average of 17.9 isn't that funny where you actually had real voting sanders won but they
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:30.360]  were so naked again they just said we don't care he's winning all over the country in stanford
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:35.720]  certified that it's a fraud hillary just said i have the superdelegates that's who counts so
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.000]  i think they're arrogance again i mean to see them on tv going your popular vote doesn't matter
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:47.800]  i mean that was crazy why they do that because they are running the game they manipulate uh
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:55.400]  they're ballot harvesting uh you know uh i uh i look at the system and i break it down by segments
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:01.800]  and you know another good example of the biggest in this country thus far was california that heist
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:07.800]  was incredible what they did there okay from sanders back yeah it was even in the new york
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:13.320]  daily news that they just met the day before with cnn and ap with the superdelegates and decided
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:20.200]  what it would be yeah and then they stole it what they did in california is an incredible
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:24.920]  that on the front end of the election night hillary was winning by 26 points in the vote by mail
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:31.160]  the next morning when i woke up she only won by 13 uh the vote by mail was stacked in the front end
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:36.280]  they sent other ballots back to the back end which is unaudited at the precinct two and a half million
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.640]  you know what if you can do five more minutes and then i've got another big clinton insider
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:43.480]  coming on can you break down as i followed it but you're an expert can you break down what they
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:47.880]  admit they did in california yeah i certainly can well let's come back and talk about that this is
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:55.800]  incredible we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:25.240]  you hillary's canceled her victory fireworks display she is desperately uh in seven different blue
[02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:30.440]  states refuses to campaign until now begging people to vote because they're all about to
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:35.080]  fall to trump the new populism they stole it from sanders folks he probably could have actually
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:41.080]  beat trump he wasn't outsider whether you like his politics or not and they stole it and tried
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:46.280]  to put a clinton in i mean jeb bush was getting four percent in national polls so was hillary four
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:50.280]  five percent and they didn't look at that and say hey we shouldn't sell these people
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:55.880]  to the public nobody's gonna buy it they still did it i tell you there is a wind on down the road
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:34:02.200]  folks and in 2016 we're there and if they try to steal this in front of god in country it's gonna
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:08.360]  wake up the country even faster why frankly i hope they try to steal it from trump because that ensures
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:14.600]  their defeat but trump gets in we're gonna be in an uphill battle because things are really
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:22.040]  in deep trouble but we're gonna see what happens but if they try to steal it now here is the latest
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:29.720]  breaking news this is from the clinton news network having to admit it hillary is behind
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:39.640]  in early voting in florida hillary is behind in north carolina of course she is the democrats hate her
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:45.800]  i live in austin texas my mother was a democrat my dad's a republican all her friends of the
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:51.080]  democrats they came over to her house last week i was there they all hate hillary they know what
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:35:00.680]  went on every real liberal like julie nasan's bev harris you name it jill stein is against hillary and
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:06.520]  say she wants world war three because she does she makes terrible decisions she cannot be challenged
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:11.480]  she must have her way you can't do that with china and russia so i can tell you right now
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:17.800]  the numbers are there we've covered them he's two he's three he's six he's seven he's eight
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:21.640]  he's ten points ahead and all the battlegrounds depending on which senate is which poll it is
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:25.720]  it's that whole gambit and that's with oversampling for hillary and i get there's more democrats and
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:30.280]  republicans but they in the acts where he's vote less the republicans so it kind of equals out
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:37.640]  now so she should be with oversampling ten points ahead she's not she's behind but the
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:42.840]  mafia is behind her the big money the banks goldman sacks wall street they're not going to give up
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:46.520]  folks they overthrow countries all the time that's why they're so confident america is just one more
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:53.720]  piece of of living space for them but it's an epic time because nobody jokes about election fraud
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:36:01.160]  now nobody believes mainstream media now again we have video streams running right now separate
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:06.280]  from 20 years of me being on air 20 plus to get three million listeners during the show
[02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:14.680]  it took me 20 years we had 50 million views last week on just live streams
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:20.600]  we have two million people right now on facebook youtube and our own stream watching
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:28.040]  two million cnn doesn't have two million viewers for their top shows and again i'm not bragging
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:33.080]  it's not that i'm good they're that bad larry nickle's coming up former clinton insider moment
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:38.120]  who said comey by senator sunday said a week ago would say no investigation was way to distract
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:43.080]  from wiki leaks which was all bombshell now in closing i want to thank john breakey of election
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.400]  night mayors dot com or the leading experts in the country uh engineers exposing fraud been arrested
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:52.680]  you know trying to ferret this info out you were getting into california and how it was stolen
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.400]  from sanders lay that out for folks because again even stanford university looked at your research
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:02.120]  and others and said yeah in what 10 states he was robbed my god he won new hampshire and then they
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:05.560]  gave the delegates to her we interviewed a superdog he goes it doesn't matter if he wins all the
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:09.880]  state teller he gets it we decide in the party george will wrote that washington post article
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:18.760]  saying quote a mere plurality of voters does not win this it is we the sovereigns of the party
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:24.760]  i mean these guys are almost like kim jong un of north korea waddling around not realizing how
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:33.480]  ridiculous they are saying our vote doesn't count to our face so where does that go john break it down
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:39.960]  for us we've lost his audio let's fade him up or check it yeah we lost your audio real quick
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.440]  uh john go ahead start back over do we have you i'm back uh can you hear me now i can't go ahead
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:51.240]  yeah it's uh as you say it is election fraud we most of us can clearly see it uh like i said
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.520]  i've been canvassing the whole country california had to be the biggest heist that i've ever personally
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:02.600]  covered and i've covered a lot of heists americopa pima county uh massachusetts other states but
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:08.280]  california was bold because an election night when the vote by mail came in you know of course i
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:14.280]  pulled down the results and uh and you can see what the precinct votes coming in when it says zero
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:19.240]  and there's 200 000 votes there it's all vote by mail in the vote by mail they stacked it on the
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:25.080]  front end and they're using these pitney bold mail sorters that also verify your signature
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:30.520]  and it could be a situation that uh you know oh you're voting for bernie we'll count you later
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.800]  because we're not verifying 35 percent of the vote which is the tail end that's the stack at the
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:40.920]  precinct is shocking it was the strip and stripping people of the right to vote by forcing them into
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:46.600]  provisional two and two million five hundred thousand people want to vote on a democratic ticket
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:52.840]  at the precinct five hundred and fifty thousand people were forced into provisional ballots that
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:59.480]  did not get counted until after the canvass once the precinct vote was in which is about 64 to 65
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:05.080]  percent of the overall vote they called the election okay with 35 percent more to be counted
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:10.280]  which was another two and a half million that was in my belief was fraction magic because if you
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:16.360]  look at the rules of large numbers and how they table off and go flat this thing didn't you found
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:23.480]  a situation like in arizona bernie clinton win the vote by mail by 60 percent and then bernie
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:30.600]  sanders wins the precinct vote by 59 percent that's a 40 point spread that's unheard of i've never
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.120]  seen anything like it in all the years i've been canvassing okay this is part of the pattern that
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:43.000]  happened across in fact bob critrachis and harvey wasmit wrote a book called the the strip and flip
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:50.040]  and i add to that to stack and by the way that's what i found 12 years ago in that first uh canvas
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:56.360]  i ever did on my own precinct they spent so here's my question for you john bricky is hillary arrogant
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:01.480]  enough to do it because it appears and this is what bev said that there's a landslide for trump
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:06.120]  they've been rigging everything are they crazy enough or you disagree that they're stealing it
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:10.840]  are they crazy enough to really try this with this huge populist movement you know i don't know
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:16.280]  what the polls really are and i don't believe the polls at all okay i think that they are rigged
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:21.400]  and you know and once again thank you bob critrachis and ohio for suing edison the company
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:25.880]  you know for uh they they try to no but i mean sure but i mean they tell you in the cnn polls
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.600]  and others they go we're adding 12 percent more democrats or we're adding i've seen 46 percent
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:37.080]  more added the cnn poll to have her at 68 percent i mean that's ridiculous i agree but i'm not looking
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:41.640]  into that hard i think the poll that really matters to me is the one that's going to happen tomorrow
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:46.120]  and then try to figure out how they rigged it and then look at the numbers as they come in because
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:49.480]  you know there are patterns and you look for that's what i call sure and they'll have early
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:54.280]  announcements early projected winners isn't that one of their favorite tactics oh of course it is
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:58.440]  but we're not done until all the numbers are in at least the work that we do to try to and that's
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:02.360]  that i mean i mean regardless of what you think of trump i don't know your view on him isn't it
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:05.880]  good he's pointing out fraud isn't it good saying he'll challenge isn't that refreshing
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:10.200]  yes it is and i want you to know that we made a reach out to the trump campaign
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:15.240]  to try to help them understand election fraud and we didn't have much success well here's the
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:21.080]  problem because it's not a bureaucracy you're literally dealing with one guy and uh he literally
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:25.400]  is up 18 hours a day trying to figure it all out and it's been a crash course in brain surgery for
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:30.840]  him but believe me he's aware and he appreciates what everybody's doing and we want to thank you
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:35.640]  uh john breakey uh election nightmares dot com thank you sir i don't want to thank you for all the
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:39.880]  good you do my friends and i'm very appreciative of the opportunity to come on your fine show thank
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:43.960]  you no i am just so honored to be associated with people like that i mean it's good to be around
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:47.960]  people that care have that fire of liberty that are informed that are smart now look at the general
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:53.960]  public you know a lot of them are like zombies people run to me and they say hey alex um you know
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:59.240]  they say uh you only think of the nfl i got some tickets you want to fly out and see the see the see
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:05.240]  the uh playoffs and i'm like i remember actually going and seeing nfl playoffs when i was about 18
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.200]  i actually i'm actually thinking yeah that'd be fun but you know what remember one time no one
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:14.760]  ryan said invited me to go see a rangers game it was like 20 years ago and i said you know i can't
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:19.960]  do it i said i just got a fight and and and it's not that i'm being goody tissues about it it's just
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:27.160]  that i can't sit there and go to these things and do this and care about a game i can go watch a
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:31.560]  movie and have fun but i just can't go and like have all my political energy and everything
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.160]  involved in caring about a game when there's this big giant game that affects my life forever and
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:42.760]  it's being rigged and that's what stefan malin who was talking about earlier he said this he said
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:50.680]  this is a big game for the whole future of western civilization and it's so epic so of course i'm
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:58.760]  fully committed to this game because it affects my kids let me tell you i could get lost hiking and
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:06.360]  kayaking and painting and cooking i used to be a great cook oh man i love cooking steaks or chicken
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:12.760]  or casseroles and i used to be a great cook i'm a great cook i could just so easily work eight hours
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:16.520]  today and just go home and cook food hang on my kids i want you so bad here's the deal there's bad
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:26.440]  people coming after my kids and i try not to cry over the air but this is the whole
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:30.280]  cut future of the country line up here and it's not crying because i'm sad it's crying because
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:37.080]  i feel extremely violent coming up so i don't want hillary clinton's president i don't mean
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:43.480]  violence against her but just my very energy is you know i can work 25 hours a day and i mean
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.880]  that's fricastically right now but i mean that's the point i've reached here i've got a limited
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:53.240]  energy now my understanding of things is intensified so much because i have fully committed to this
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:59.000]  fight i don't let's just understand it's not a burden to be committed to liberty it is a blessing
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.920]  and i think my lucky star is every moment that i am not like these zombies i mean i go out in
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:14.760]  public and i am freaked out when i go into wealthy and trendy areas the ocd the the the the weirdness
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:21.240]  the neuroses the entitlement do you know where i feel really good when i get a tour of a factory
[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:26.200]  or i go out around people working in the fields or i get around people that are involved and happy
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:30.200]  and having a great life who have got things and and pressures in their lives they're alive you
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:33.560]  know that's why people see this beauty and immigrants to this country when they come from
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:38.040]  places like mexico or wherever because it's hard working folks and people are involved they seem
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:44.360]  satisfied and there's something about them there's just farmers we used to be farmers they took that
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:52.120]  away from us we're just one generation away from that and our farmers were great people
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:58.440]  but you take some mexican farmer and their kid gets put in school and turned to spoiled brat
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:08.360]  anti-american asshole and that's because that's what the these corporations want they don't want
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:14.760]  what thomas jefferson wrote about yeoman farmers hard-working smart people that are confident and
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:21.320]  good i'll tell you right now if you read history the globalists are so scared of farmers
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:25.080]  because what are farmers they're families they're men they're women they're self-sufficient people
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:29.000]  they grow things they're close to the earth they're strong
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:34.040]  they don't want you to be a farmer they want you to be under their control
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:41.640]  i'm not going to belabor this we're running specials right now that undoubtedly fund the very

[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:36.760]  strength is these pieces of crap and i believe humanity has the energy and the soul and the
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:41.960]  will to do it and we're proving that and info wars and our spirit is powering the resistance
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:47.640]  the enemy smart they said 10 years ago when the tea party started they said alex jones is the
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:53.080]  high priest of the tea party and needs to be washed because they know they know my spirit's real that's
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:57.960]  why hillary calls me dark heart it's not about me but i'm just telling you this rediscovery
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:05.160]  humanity is the key and i want to thank you all for your support and everything you've done

[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:06.520]  our spirit of liberty has spread they are panicking they want to steal this from Trump
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:10.760]  they don't know what to do they want to declare that we're discredited they're discredited it's a
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:18.440]  joke Donald Trump's already won you've already won we forced these guys out into the daylight
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.720]  i'm gonna skip this break so we have more time for Larry Nichols but i want to thank you all for
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:30.760]  your support this is his history that's happening right now so thank you take advantage of things
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:37.240]  you need and take advantage and get those things you need and the funding we need together to dominate
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:43.720]  the enemy and to be strong and to be able to take their slings and arrows i've taken so many slings
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:48.360]  and arrows i make a joke i didn't i wouldn't i wasn't born in this life with body armor but i've
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:53.320]  taken so many arrows and so many stones and so many cuts and i've got so much scar tissue that it's
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:50:02.040]  my strength thick drags the ground and i love every bit of it because it's the animating contest
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:07.400]  of liberty it's everything they've tried to stop us from going through so that we will not rise to
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:13.240]  the next level let's go to Larry Nichols Larry i appreciate you former clinton insider your
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:16.600]  credibility only goes up as everything you've talked about comes true you said the witches
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:22.680]  coven the satanic rituals it's all out in the wiki leagues you said eight days ago on air that
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.920]  they're going to come out on saturday or sunday two days for the election and now she's totally
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.720]  exonerated to ignore all the other stuff that happened rush limbaugh was correct as well but i
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:35.560]  guess you might have talked to the same supreme court justice that told you that and and we know
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:40.440]  about the fbi guys got fired to talk to you just yesterday but it doesn't matter there's no future
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:45.400]  that's not dishonor to be fired doing the right thing this is an epic town to be alive uh they're
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:53.000]  saying she's behind in south in north carolina uh north carolina she's behind in florida she's
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.320]  canceled her fireworks display that may be playing possum and she's got a lot of tricks up her sleeve
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:01.080]  but what are you smelling and what are your sources saying right now what's in the air larry
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:06.760]  nichols all right alex you got to be careful remember what i've told you for years literally
[02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:12.680]  that the last thing they'll do is show her behind but they want her underdog to get her
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:19.560]  minions out and make it believable they're scared to death and that's why they're pushing so hard
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:26.200]  at this late date i would have never agreed to them showing underdog status the day before the
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:32.600]  election that's pushing it too bad but that's how nervous they are obama looks completely
[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:39.560]  shook up too yeah alex he looks like he's scared i love seeing that yeah here's here's the truth
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:48.120]  as i see it from looking i enjoyed your guest before me as i see it today here he wins by six
[02:51:48.120 --> 02:51:56.280]  now wait a minute here he wins by six but in truth the actual vote trumps up by two or three
[02:51:57.480 --> 02:52:03.560]  so what does that mean that means if we will do the two things that i'm going to tell today if i
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:11.720]  have time we can curtail voter fraud enough alex to where you can have victory we can have victory
[02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:15.800]  when you say voter fraud it's all election because it's individuals what they're being
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:20.280]  orchestrated so isn't that really election fraud as well that's right i mean it's absolutely
[02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:25.160]  they're pulling out every trick in the book every one so let me and they're getting caught so what
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:30.120]  does that mean well now there's the problem who you're gonna call they're getting caught but you
[02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:36.120]  see that's the problem with this syndicate that i've told you about that's arkansas in the 80s
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:43.000]  and 90s they control the justice department they control the fbi they control the media they are
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:48.360]  going to control congress very soon if we don't stop them so the problem is they don't even care if
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:54.920]  they get caught because they know there's no place for us to go to take action on it so they think
[02:52:54.920 --> 02:53:02.200]  me here's the dirty trick they're scared to death so if your listeners will do this for me two
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:06.760]  things two things and i'd like to talk about gun control because i brought that up yesterday
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:12.680]  yeah that's in the way he leads total gunman well so everything the bolt action well let me
[02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:16.120]  tell you what they're going to do in gun control because i've just been besieged because of your
[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:21.240]  program about it here's what's coming within six months i have actually seen the draft of it
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:28.120]  they're coming in six within six months hillary will do a presidential executive order calling for
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:35.640]  gun registration nationwide no that's in the that's in the wiki leaks well okay well i what i saw
[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:40.360]  wasn't wiki leaks what i saw was what i was provided about the same group that told me about what was
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:45.400]  happening with the wiener he made oh it's just her promising executive action once she's in
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:49.720]  and once there's a trigger event it's that's right and the way she's going to get around it is by
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:56.520]  going executive order doing registration on firearms she's not violating and she will say
[02:53:56.520 --> 02:54:01.880]  that second amendment because we're not keeping people from having weapons we're just tracking
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:08.120]  people tracking them then within six months of that as within her first year year and a half
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:15.400]  she will do what they call conforming conforming under their code word conforming means they're
[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:20.680]  going to say all right folks alex you've got a shotgun let's see what can a shotgun be used for
[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:25.480]  well it can hunt ducks you can use it to hunt you can use it to protect yourself so therefore
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:33.080]  you know what you can have one of those but then they're going to say an ak-47 with clips that hold
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:39.640]  20 30 40 rounds what can you use those for well you don't use them to hunt ducks you can't take
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:45.480]  them into the woods because of the high capacity clips the only thing they can be used for are you
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:50.040]  sure they they admit it they want to ban all semi-auto that's that's the admitted hell they're
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:55.320]  in they're in the Washington Post saying time to ban everything but that's right so once again
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:55:00.760]  she's going to go at that and see this is how this dirty plot works this is how this trick works out
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:06.520]  so she's going to issue another executive order within this first year and a half making people
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:12.920]  turn in their weapons that do not conform to what you know they think and when folks don't they do a
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:17.640]  soft gun control they persecute gun owners as they beta tested Illinois in California I concur
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:21.960]  we're experts on that we agree with you there you go first so anyway that's what's coming to the
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:28.840]  people that what about election tomorrow you do two things two things tomorrow and I swear to
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:34.680]  everyone listening to me you will we'll win this election when you go in we've talked about it before
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:40.520]  first thing protect your vote you walk in if it's a voting machine you make them prove before you leave
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:48.200]  that booth that every vote you cast is officially recorded the way you cast it if they don't then
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:53.560]  you make them give you a paper ballot now I've already had people call me Alex thanks to you
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:59.560]  they've recorded it to your website by the way they've already gone requested paper ballots they
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:04.360]  were told they didn't have them couldn't get them well when they press the issue come to find out
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:10.600]  they did have them but when you go in if they can't verify your vote demand a paper ballot if they
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:15.640]  say they don't have them then you know when that precinct goes sideways you can overthrow the entire
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:20.120]  deal because they didn't give you a paper ballot and yes what you did so what you do is you find
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:24.440]  out where can you go to get a paper ballot and that's a well you'll have to go to the whatever
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:30.920]  place will go there get a paper ballot but before you leave that precinct if they make if they say
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:35.960]  they don't have a paper ballot because remember under the law they're supposed to have paper
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:41.080]  ballots available if nothing else that the power goes off if they don't do that before you leave
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:45.880]  you call the police get enough they're not going to come with their lights flashing you're just
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:50.360]  calling and reporting exactly what happened well I gotta say I mean the police aren't perfect but
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:53.720]  compared to the globalists they have they're good people they're really awake to what's happening
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:58.360]  I'm told they've been there they've been arrested a bunch of people and actually filling up reports
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:02.840]  where they usually you know the cops are told to cover it up they're not covering it up no
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:07.800]  no remember those guys are with us they own Hillary my god they're the ones being shot
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:12.760]  they're the ones who've got targets on their backs thanks to Obama and Hillary so anyway call the
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:19.800]  police then the minute you call the police you go to info wars where your site is to report voter
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:28.200]  fraud report it now folks please if that has to be contested in court Trump needs he needs verify
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:34.520] able instances of voter fraud he needs a crap ton that's right now the next thing you do is
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:41.160]  this is where it gets a little difficult Alex when you're through voting take time out of your day
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:49.480]  and spend an hour or two or three or the whole day set there at that precinct and watch and when
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:54.920]  you see a van pull up with five or six people getting out going in and voting come back getting
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:58:00.200]  the van you get photos up front you follow it legally to the next place you show the photos again

[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:24.680]  i was on the front lines 21 years ago when i first got on air i was interviewing an fbi
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:31.320]  agent secret service nsa people larry nickles i had like stuff you wouldn't believe i haven't
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:36.120]  told half the stories because the clintons were really smart it came out in the joseph ferrell
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:41.720]  lawsuits and judicial watch from the clinton library how before they were even president
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:44.680]  they were obsessed with controlling media and having no other narratives
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:50.440]  and they were all in there saying that we must shut down anything new in the future
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:55.160]  and their first target was the western journalism center joseph ferrell then it was matt drudge
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:01.160]  but obviously larry nickles even before that but i'm going to come back the next
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:06.280]  seven-day of the night continue on for a while and then i'll be i'll be back tonight like i guess

[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:18.840]  jury and others they're big patriots and of course he's big friends with uh trump and trumps
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.160]  launched a national organization pro gun movement with jesse james so we're gonna have jesse james
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:28.120]  in studio tonight by the way people say jesse james and the standard bullet stuff that everything
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:33.160]  you hear and that's the opposite folks and i'm not gonna talk about it but everything you heard
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:39.880]  was the opposite of reality and he's not coming on about that it's just that that guy is like
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:45.080]  a literal blacksmith 15 hours a day in a burning blacksmith deal
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:49.320]  because i used to live next door to him i don't need more it's like i moved in and jesse james
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:55.720]  moves in that's how i got to know jesse james like six years ago but the guy is like vulcan or
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:01.000]  something you know the greek or the roman god and they're beating in a furnace in these spacesuits
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:05.240]  he wears making with huge fires i mean it's him actually and they're making all this stuff it's
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:10.280]  crazy uh you're like ten o'clock at nine it's like fire shooting out he's like you know beating it
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:15.880]  with hammers but he's he he wants to come on and it's okay he's coming on the show uh so so that's
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:19.720]  happening tonight a lot of other surprise guests as well getting back to larry nickles i want to put
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:25.000]  this on screen larry we went up there a year ago because he's diagnosed with lung cancer and he's
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  really gotten in bad shape since then and we're praying for him and uh yeah he's a really great
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.360]  guy and i don't want to get into with him on air how he's doing because he's told me it's not too
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:37.480]  well but it's nicklesliveataol.com go make a five dollar ten dollar hundred dollar donation his
[03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:42.360]  cancer treatment is very expensive he's taking it to stay alive we need him nicklesliveatol.com
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:48.280]  he doesn't ask for it but larry nickles 58 kingson drive conaway arkansas 72034 he's a great patriot
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:55.320]  and uh is just dead on what he's been breaking down but in the few months we got left getting into
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:03:00.520]  any any other facets we should cover yeah there are two things completely what i was saying the
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:05.240]  the biggest thing that will swing this election i swear to god because i've done it i've written
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:10.920]  more elections than most people have ever voted in if you will commit to the time to stand at the
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:17.720]  precinct after you vote and suddenly don't make a big thing just suddenly let people know that
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:23.560]  you're there watching and witnessing to catch voter fraud you know what'll happen now it's
[03:03:23.560 --> 03:03:28.600]  they'll leave they'll go someplace else just like the home that has you know to a burglar a home's
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:32.600]  got no i get it you're stalling them instead of them getting to vote 10 times they'll get to vote
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:38.360]  twice that day if citizens just just show that we're watching they'll back off they'll back off
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:43.160]  and i know it because i had to direct it i let me ask you why would why would obama come out
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:48.360]  and say yes go ahead and vote if you're illegal we won't come after you because he doesn't care
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:54.360]  alex this is the beginning of the takeover of this nation and they're all in they're all in
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:58.520]  they aren't it shows you how far they're in trouble and they know it because they're calling it out
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:04.760]  now the second thing and alex this is an awkward one for me but i'm going to do it it's called
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:14.840]  second chronicles chapter 7 verse 7 verse 14 that is the one scripture out of the bible alex
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:21.400]  where god tells you if you'll get on your knees pray seek his face turn through your evil ways
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:30.600]  heal heal our land folks god is in control if we ask oh no in fact i don't mean to do this all day
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:36.360]  and then last week i haven't done it this is my flesh is so prideful but we it is true we have to
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.680]  hit our knees and admit we've been bad and and really but really mean it like king david did
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:44.280]  to turn this around and it is time to hit a knee because some of the dollars comes perfect but he
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:51.720]  he symbolizes the return of of of not having an evil system out to get everybody larry neville's
[03:04:51.720 --> 03:04:58.200]  one thing in clothes and grow this network this network and others like it but this is send it
[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:04.600]  out absolutely larry god bless you hillary clinton wins the election she has defeated the fear and
[03:05:04.600 --> 03:05:10.600]  hate-based conservative donald trump well that's according to newsweek who reportedly has already
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:16.920]  issued a special commemorative edition with hillary on the cover behind the words madame president
[03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:23.080]  hillary clinton's historic journey to the white house they know something we don't dc clothesline
[03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:29.240]  reports that the fix is in newsweek already has an issue in print boxed and ready to ship declaring
[03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:34.840]  hillary the winner but others think the whole thing might be a hoax newsweek has been asked
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:41.080]  repeatedly whether the magazine is real but has failed to respond so far if the issue is indeed a
[03:05:41.080 --> 03:05:46.200]  fake well it's very convincing the one thing we know for sure is that newsweek will not be
[03:05:46.200 --> 03:05:51.960]  publishing a special commemorative edition that is favorable to donald trump if he wins
[03:05:51.960 --> 03:05:55.160]  and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com

[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:43.400]  if you want to but you need to stop killing my grandkids never forget that i was 16 and
[03:09:43.400 --> 03:09:48.760]  they're looking at me i already paid for like five abortions said i want you to stop killing my
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:53.800]  grandkids and after that i promised myself i would never do that again and i
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:10:00.440]  i got a woman pregnant got married and kids it's been wonderful they teach you it's so
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:05.160]  horrible to have kids it's the greatest blessing ever ladies and gentlemen and i have killed my
[03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:13.400]  children i love god i know god forgives me i love god i'm proud of it and you know it was
[03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:18.440]  like oh it's just a blob of tissue oh i lied to myself at the time whatever what are you gonna do
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:26.840]  when you're 14 15 16 and you know the girls wanted to do it themselves so i could you know pass on
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:39.160]  the blame and say it was their fault but it was my fault but that's a whole other story the point
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:44.760]  is let's just get real here time for making jokes is over just like that famous song along the watch
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:50.200]  tower written by bob dillon there are many of us here who think that life is but a joke but you
[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:54.840]  and i we've been through that and it's not our fate so let's stop talking falsely now the hour is
[03:10:54.840 --> 03:11:03.960]  getting late we put that back on screen i want to read from it from the bible because as larry
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:09.640]  nickle said that's the key and larry nickles did do the things he said for the green berets and then
[03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:14.040]  the cia he never talked about that i don't people that know him and he was a sign of the dixie mafia
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:24.920]  and stuff even worse and the clinton's it's carinthians 714 king james verson if my people
[03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:30.280]  which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from the wicked
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:41.800]  ways then what i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land god healed my
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:50.280]  land when i was 16 years old and i decided to stop brawling and stop running around trying to get
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:55.720]  every girl i could and it wasn't that i was some goody two shoes i was mr badass it was that
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:12:00.920]  hell i was doing stuff 20 year old men were doing i was 12 but the point was is that it
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:06.440]  wasn't fulfilling me it wasn't good the minute i got on the straight and narrow the minute i started
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:12.680]  following what god said i'm not perfect the minute was my life opened up and things were fulfilling
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:18.280]  and donald trump isn't perfect he's ever claimed to be perfect
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:24.680]  but he isn't out to get the people and that's why the enemy is legitimately so scared of him
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:32.520]  you understand the level of industrialization we've reached that we could have space elevators
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:36.920]  by now mars bases the whole nine yards you understand that right by the elite are so arrogant
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:41.720]  they've all sorts of super technologies been discovered the internet's 40 years old folks
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:47.480]  50 years old it's unlimited what we could do together but they don't want you the profane
[03:12:47.480 --> 03:12:52.600]  to have access to all that and all i'm telling the so-called elitists anybody butchering the
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:58.760]  genetics of this planet anybody hurting the future free will of humanity is no super uber mentioned
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:13:03.480]  there's nothing superman
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:12.360]  when you actively dumb people down and i know full well i could take anybody white black
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:21.160]  hispanic you name it who had average iq genetics and turn them into a absolute badass in politics
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:26.760]  in life and everything if i have the time and energy to spend time with and i see you doing
[03:13:26.760 --> 03:13:32.760]  everything you can to make people small and i'm just here to tell you that's not godly
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:42.920]  that's not boardly that's not noble you're not elite you have stolen our future and you're going
[03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:50.600]  to be removed and that doesn't mean we're offering some valhalla ragnarok gutter dharma wrong perfect
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:52.440]  nirvana
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:57.880]  but we have free will and good intention
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:08.520]  and seek an open free society with free will you seek to dominate and shutter free will
[03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:14.600]  and that is satanic that is satanic i look on the modern world they push satanism and stuff as
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:19.000]  if it's the free will and do what you want i really mean some freaking cult that abuses people all
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:25.400]  day that lowers you down to the level of the devil so you can be a slave of this fallen piece of trash
[03:14:26.360 --> 03:14:32.200]  no i want to play this clip or come back with david night skip this break as we're broadcasting
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:36.520]  20 something hours went on 50 something hours excuse me right there we always do 20 something

[03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:44.600]  hours are you part of spreading the word you've already taken action it's already shaken the
[03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:48.440]  foundations the new world order what if you take the video feeds and info wars.com forward slash
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:53.320]  show what if you send them out to everybody like matt drudge has done what if you email it to your
[03:14:53.320 --> 03:14:56.600]  email list what if you say this is forbidden information live broadcast with all these special
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:01.560]  guests covering the election fraud what's happening or how hillary's canceling or fireworks display
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:07.560]  and losing in north carolina and florida what happens if you do that you change the world
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:12.920]  because you believe in yourself you believe in god you believe in taking action and
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:18.680]  so many people have committed themselves doing bad things so they're guilty so they say i'll
[03:15:18.680 --> 03:15:24.200]  just go all the way i'm never gonna say i'm sorry oh god understands god made us in his image
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:30.760]  how many trillions of times has god through his consciousness through us experience what we've
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:36.360]  been through god knows us better than our own mothers and god knew you before you were forming
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:47.800]  your mother's womb some will ask why why why would god love people like king david or the prodigal
[03:15:47.800 --> 03:15:52.920]  son that comes back with some of these bad things and prepare the big feast the older son says
[03:15:54.280 --> 03:15:59.560]  why are you doing this for him i was always faithful i was always here i didn't do anything
[03:15:59.560 --> 03:16:08.520]  wrong the father looks at him and says he's back he's not destroyed i don't need to do that for
[03:16:08.520 --> 03:16:16.440]  you you never went down that path imagine how much i love you what's the celebration of pulling
[03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:23.640]  humanity back from the edge of doom out of the devil's jaws that's a celebration those of you
[03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:27.720]  out there that are better than i ever was thank god you don't need some celebration for whatever
[03:16:27.720 --> 03:16:33.880]  reason you're made of better stuff than i but the celebration when you've been so close to the devil
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:42.920]  to be pulled back from that makes me thank god and god's real the enemy knows there's a god
[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:48.040]  that's why it wants to set itself up as god and teach you that the state is god
[03:16:50.600 --> 03:16:54.120]  they traffic in the souls of men there's a very important piece i don't know what to call it it
[03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:58.840]  should go super viral put together with trump the latest info by michael zimmer one of our great
[03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:02.840]  researchers and editors here where i come back i got a few other news stories to hit i'm gonna
[03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:09.720]  hand the baton tonight and uh night is going to be going all the way until four o'clock today
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:14.600]  and then we're going to have a good shari and dr group coming in with huge news i mean
[03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:21.720]  when i saw the la times in the in the in the in the associated press and seeing in last weekend
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:26.200]  and say we don't know why there's all these thousands of kids one article was hundreds of
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:30.760]  thousands were suddenly paralyzed and and then we knew full hours of vaccines it was like a punch
[03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:35.400]  in the stomach it was like get out there and expose them it's like i'm some goody two shoes
[03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:42.920]  who had this instinct to go out and expose them that's a normal response i mean i saw a lady run a
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:47.400]  red light yesterday and plow into some guy's car on the way to work and i saw this firefighter get
[03:17:47.400 --> 03:17:51.720]  out of his car his truck go over help him and i still had to go over because the car was on fire
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:55.640]  and then they said that we got it they spread it off and i said yeah i wasn't really seeing it all
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:59.720]  i just saw her running and they go yeah we have enough witnesses you can go but it wasn't some
[03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:03.960]  heroic thing to pull over and do that it was just that if i i almost drove off because i got all
[03:18:03.960 --> 03:18:09.000]  they got people there but i better go over there and and again what if the car would have stayed
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:14.600]  on fire what do they want to need help i want that same help back but i watched how people
[03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:19.320]  that were three cars ahead of me who were right there is even more important witnesses than i
[03:18:19.320 --> 03:18:22.680]  they spat off as soon as they could from that car wreck
[03:18:25.400 --> 03:18:30.840]  and that's really the illustration of why we're in this crisis so here is this report
[03:18:30.840 --> 03:18:40.440]  we'll come back with david night stay with us ladies and gentlemen i am officially running
[03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:47.160]  for president of the united states and we are going to make our country great again
[03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:56.840]  they see that the elites who ruin their lives ate from the career politicians eat from it's just
[03:18:56.840 --> 03:19:03.720]  awfully good that donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country because you'd be in jail
[03:19:03.720 --> 03:19:11.560]  trump election is going to be the biggest you ever recorded in human history you think your
[03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:16.840]  business background helps you with campaigning there's doing the primaries i spent less money than
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:21.560]  other people and i did better and that's what we want to do for the country we want to spend less
[03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:28.280]  money and do better i am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack
[03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:36.280]  my father hi this is tit cruz calling
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:51.880]  death destruction terrorism and weakness this is the legacy of hillary clinton
[03:19:51.880 --> 03:19:58.680]  now the two faces of hillary clinton are coming out the fact through wiki leaks that she says
[03:19:58.680 --> 03:20:05.160]  one thing uh and oh no all right let's see if we can get congressman collins back obviously
[03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:12.280]  we just lost the satellite feed i think the media is very dishonest i say it all the time i think
[03:20:12.280 --> 03:20:24.760]  they're among the most dishonest human beings i've ever met
[03:20:30.760 --> 03:20:36.600]  remember hillary clinton has some vulnerabilities herself because of her support in the 1990s
[03:20:36.600 --> 03:20:42.440]  for anti-crime legislation that ultimately helped contribute to this era of mass incarceration
[03:20:42.440 --> 03:20:49.160]  that she now uh speaks out again we just lost uh we just lost priona keeler
[03:20:57.800 --> 03:21:01.000]  i will be the nominee there is no way that uh i won't be
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:08.200]  is it acceptable that wall street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
[03:21:08.200 --> 03:21:17.320]  trying to buy elections is that democracy all of those bernie sanchez voters who have been
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:34.040]  left out of the club by a rick system history is watching us now it's waiting to see if we will
[03:21:34.040 --> 03:21:41.160]  rise to the occasion just win baby and if we will show the whole world that america is still free
[03:21:41.160 --> 03:21:50.440]  and independent and strong i am with you i will fight for you and i will win for you
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:54.600]  i am your voice
[03:21:57.560 --> 03:22:00.760]  by the way michael zimmerman's made a lot of great videos and he ran here during the break he said
[03:22:00.760 --> 03:22:04.920]  no i put it in my folder you should air it this is put together by some great youtuber
[03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:14.200]  uh and that is uh we are deplorable add hashtag drain the swamp and that only has nine thousand
[03:22:14.200 --> 03:22:18.200]  views so everybody needs to get 30s to have 100 million views we're going to put it up on
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:24.200]  info wars dot com on our facebook um and i would just basically say donald trump the media is our
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:30.040]  number one enemy i think that's what you call the video uh so we will get that out on info wars
[03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:36.360]  dot com and prisonplanet dot com i like the one part about slapping jeb bush's hand but uh
[03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:41.000]  the bushes are really evil we know he tore bush all the way up that was one of the first debates
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:46.120]  but other than that it's a perfect perfect ad to counter all this uh briefly i'm gonna end
[03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:51.800]  up the time today for the next hour and 40 minutes then i'll be back tonight uh jesse james coming in

[03:23:12.360 --> 03:23:16.120]  doesn't need that but some of the other people do quite frankly and and we've kind of kept
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:20.360]  being very honest so you know that's a good thing here we're the people we're policing all this
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:24.120]  we're supposed to be involved that like some evil things for us to be involved in policing
[03:23:24.120 --> 03:23:28.760]  things no we're going to do it it's happening but i do just want everybody to know we're running the

[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:06.840]  what's going on but there's obviously little bugaboo's and gremlins and saboteurs and infiltrators
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:14.840]  and the rest of it that we have to deal with but that's all part of my life i mean it's fun people
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:19.080]  play video games where they're battling bad guys because it's fun to dodge them and beat them well
[03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:24.760]  we're doing that in the real world we're not doing a simulation here this is a real deal and uh
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:31.560]  i i resonate with trump's commitment for justice at a level playing field and we're going to keep
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:40.920]  trump honest i'll be honest with you the calculus is complex i just want to do what's right i don't
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:47.480]  engage in calculus i just do what's right and
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:55.480]  if hillary's dumb enough to steal this election and get in there it's going to be an even worse

[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:37.480]  talk about how this is being spun and of course right now donald trump is in north carolina
[03:28:37.480 --> 03:28:42.920]  for yet another event this guy is everywhere it's amazing the amount of energy that donald trump has

[03:29:00.920 --> 03:29:07.080]  soared i've seen just one other metric our youtube channel i've seen the number of subscribers
[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:14.200]  nearly go a factor of 10 higher than it was when i joined four years ago so things are starting to
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:18.360]  pull together but you know when i look at this election the thing that kept coming to mind i
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:24.200]  used to this time of year every year i would read with my sons when they were younger we would go
[03:29:24.200 --> 03:29:29.000]  through and we'd read the lord of the rings and there's a quote from the lord of the rings the
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:35.480]  quest stands on the edge of a knife stray but a little it will fail to the ruin of all yet hope

[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:18.040]  i said before we went to the break the quest stands on the edge of a knife and as we hobbits
[03:34:18.040 --> 03:34:25.400]  move along to try to throw this ring of power that has been forged by the democrats this one
[03:34:25.400 --> 03:34:32.760]  ring of crony capitalism this massive web of corruption that is interweave woven at the top
[03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:37.640]  this kind of racketeering corrupt organization that we've seen the federal government become
[03:34:37.640 --> 03:34:45.400]  under hillary clinton and her cronies nothing epitomizes that more than what fbi director
[03:34:45.400 --> 03:34:50.440]  comey has done i'm going to talk about that in just a moment but i want to focus now on just
[03:34:50.440 --> 03:34:57.560]  briefly why is it that info wars is ramping up exponentially and why is it that the mainstream
[03:34:57.560 --> 03:35:01.800]  media has lost so much credibility well we've seen this coming for a long time you've known for a long
[03:35:01.800 --> 03:35:06.200]  time that they've been lying to you that they're biased you can see that anybody that watches this
[03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:12.920]  that has access to the internet that can see these people on a daily basis catch the snippets of
[03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:17.720]  this they understand that it was biased but then we see the wiki leaks leaks the emails that have
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:22.040]  come out these things just in the last couple of days daily caller points out wiki leaks shows
[03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:27.880]  washington post writer asked the dnc for anti trump research washington post columnist dana
[03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:32.040]  millbank appears to have asked the democrat national committee to do the majority of the research for
[03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:37.800]  a negative column he wrote about donald trump in april this year okay so it's called the 10 plagues
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:43.560]  of donald trump so it's not enough that they want to be in the tank for the democrats in the tank
[03:35:43.560 --> 03:35:48.360]  for hillary clinton but they actually go to them and ask them to give them talking points help me
[03:35:48.360 --> 03:35:52.040]  write my article and you know when they do an interview with hillary clinton they come back to
[03:35:52.040 --> 03:35:55.640]  hillary clinton and say we'd like for you to review what we're going to say about you is it
[03:35:55.640 --> 03:35:59.960]  positive enough do you like the way that we quoted you and these closer do you want to
[03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:05.400]  rearrange those quotes in which case they're not really quotes are they so we understand what the
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:12.280]  game is here's another one wiki leaks dnc and cnn the democrat national committee and cnn the
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:17.560]  clinton news network colluded on questions for trump and for crews newly released emails from
[03:36:17.560 --> 03:36:22.280]  wiki leaks suggests the democrat national committee colluded with cnn and devising questions in april
[03:36:22.280 --> 03:36:26.680]  to be asked of then republican primary candidate donald trump in an upcoming interview they did this
[03:36:27.320 --> 03:36:33.080]  for wolf blitzer wolf blitzer remember the guy he went on and uh he and uh jimmy kimmel laughed
[03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:39.160]  about uh alex jones and the the pickle uh joke that jimmy kimmel did and we pointed out hey you're
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:44.120]  trying to make her look good we understand that jimmy kimmel's got a comedy show folks but you
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:50.600]  also understand the optics that are there even when people know that this is a put on that it's a gag
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:55.080]  it still makes a difference it's just like saturday night live you think uh their antics on saturday
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:37:01.080]  night live don't have uh an effect of course they do of course they do they show cartoon versions of
[03:37:01.080 --> 03:37:08.520]  donald trump and also equally cartoon versions of hillary clinton so earnest so intelligent so
[03:37:08.520 --> 03:37:14.760]  organized and then donald trump is this slob as they portray him with a alec baldwin that has a big
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:18.440]  difference it's a comedy show but it makes a big difference and so when alex called him out on that
[03:37:18.440 --> 03:37:22.840]  on the jimmy kimmel show they bring on wolf blitzer and wolf blitzer you know plays with
[03:37:22.840 --> 03:37:26.920]  the pickles and stuff but the wolf blitzer he's the guy that's uh asking the dnc to write
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:33.400]  his questions for him how pathetic is that how pathetic is that uh and then you got the guy who
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:44.120]  is cnmc nbc's uh head of operations here um he's asking john pedesca john pedesca what should i ask
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:51.000]  jeb bush see that's the way that it goes so whether it is other republicans like uh crews or jeb or
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:57.560]  trump or if it's a democrat like bernie sanders you see how the mainstream media has attached
[03:37:57.560 --> 03:38:04.120]  itself to hillary clinton against everyone else even against a bush even against another one of
[03:38:04.120 --> 03:38:09.720]  the anointed enter clans okay it's always for hillary always for hillary you have to understand
[03:38:09.720 --> 03:38:14.600]  that fix is in you have to understand what level that fix is in but let's take a look at some of the
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:20.520]  uh optimistic information is coming out and of course this is taken from the top of drudge here
[03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:26.920]  there's now a jump in the uh and trump uh jumps to the lead in colorado this is on matt drudge
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:32.680]  also you know this is not on drudge but i've been hearing from people uh reporting on this
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:37.240]  of the news question the fact that hillary spent so much time in michigan the fact that people in
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:43.240]  her campaign would say if we can hold on to michigan well why would that be an if for them
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:50.200]  see michigan has been solid democrat for a very long time uh going back to the 1980s it's been
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:55.960]  solid democrat since then they're about to lose it because the people in michigan have been eviscerated
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:02.920]  by these so-called trade deals they're not trade deals they're trader deals these are traders who
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:08.200]  have sold out our company our country who have transferred these companies uh elsewhere who have
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:12.920]  provided incentives for people to move elsewhere disincentives for people to build a business
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:17.960]  here in america they've done everything to disincentivize having a business here in america you know
[03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:25.160]  when i was i can remember back in the early 90s right after bill clinton got elected and hillary
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:30.920]  was as first lady usurping the authority to try to take over our health care and i can remember
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:36.200]  the arrogance of hillary clinton saying uh when people pointed out to her this is going to be an
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:42.280]  incredible burden on small businesses it's going to cost jobs just as obama care has done okay and
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:47.560]  she was proposing something that was more radical than that and her response to that was typical
[03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:53.720]  hillary clinton typical arrogance she said i can't be bothered by every under capitalized small
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:39:57.960]  business no she can't be bothered for the people who can't afford to pay her hundreds of thousands
[03:39:57.960 --> 03:40:04.840]  of dollars to make a speech hillary clinton doesn't care about main street as far as she's concerned
[03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:10.040]  all of you small businesses you're just under capitalized you can't afford to buy hillary clinton
[03:40:10.040 --> 03:40:15.560]  you can't afford her to help you she's going to go to wall street she's going to go to the bankers
[03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:22.520]  for help because she doesn't want your help you're under capitalized you don't deserve to have a life
[03:40:22.520 --> 03:40:28.760]  of business independence financial independence no you don't deserve that that made me furious and i
[03:40:28.760 --> 03:40:34.600]  i remember going to uh to meetings that were held by our democrat congressman david price back in
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:38.520]  north carolina and he was uh pushing hillary clinton health care and i remember getting up
[03:40:38.520 --> 03:40:45.080]  and speaking at some of those rallies and one thing that really took me back was i said something
[03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:51.160]  about okay there's people who are in in health care situations and we need to try to focus on
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:55.320]  private charity do other things like that to help them and that was just one thing that
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:01.800]  minute i said charity i got roundly hissed and booed by the crowd i know that really kind of
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:07.800]  surprised me this surprised me i was surprised that people would be so openly contemptuous
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:13.960]  of the idea that we would help each other outside of the government that government wouldn't hold
[03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:18.680]  a gun to your head and say you're going to help your neighbor that you your neighbor you would
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:23.400]  help your neighbor yourself or that there would be uh private entities that would rise up into it
[03:41:23.400 --> 03:41:28.440]  you know when alexis detochville wrote about democracy in america in the early days of the
[03:41:28.440 --> 03:41:34.360]  republic one of the things that he talked about was how everyone was helping each other with
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:40.120]  volunteer societies so it was absolutely amazing and that's the way america was until we decided
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:46.120]  that it was a role of government not the role of individuals not the role of churches not the role
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:51.720]  of communities but the role of government at the highest level to help people and that's how we get
[03:41:51.720 --> 03:41:57.880]  the kind of corruption that we have now because they don't know who to help they're corrupt they
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:42:03.080]  don't know how to they don't even they don't know the people that are the deserving poor they don't
[03:42:03.080 --> 03:42:07.560]  have any way of knowing that like you do at the community level and of course they are
[03:42:08.680 --> 03:42:14.280]  using their power for other reasons they're just using this idea of helping people as a beard for
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:18.040]  their power but let's take a look at what's going on in north carolina as i pointed out
[03:42:18.680 --> 03:42:25.960]  we've got donald trump there speaking right now and we've got a couple of interesting things that
[03:42:25.960 --> 03:42:32.600]  i found from the site that i go to for local news still in north carolina carolina plot hound he
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:39.400]  just focuses on on local news and the state here's one roy cooper now this is the guy who is running
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:43.640]  for governor the democrat who's running for governor he was the attorney general he was one who
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:50.600]  tried to shut down this grab against restrooms we tried to tell everybody whether it's a private
[03:42:50.600 --> 03:42:54.360]  property or whether it's a church property or whether it's a public restroom they're going to
[03:42:54.360 --> 03:42:59.720]  tell you how your restrooms are going to be organized right and the legislature which is all
[03:42:59.720 --> 03:43:04.360]  republican and the governor and they said no you're not going to dictate to us what our restrooms
[03:43:04.360 --> 03:43:11.640]  are going to be like and roy cooper basically shut this whole thing down and now he's been caught
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:16.680]  busing people in from out of state i want to play this little clip here uh where they interview
[03:43:16.680 --> 03:43:22.440]  some of the people who have come in to help as campaign workers volunteers from new york
[03:43:22.440 --> 03:43:27.160]  or again in washington dc shook hands and talked with cooper before leaving to canvass in different
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:32.200]  areas throughout the city this is just such a critical election for north carolina and our
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:41.160]  country and i believe that there are many informed people here that just need to know where and when
[03:43:41.160 --> 03:43:45.240]  to vote it was really important to me to get back down here to help elect north carolina
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:49.720]  democrats up and down the ticket patrick to me and his mom marine kelly explain why they support
[03:43:49.720 --> 03:43:54.040]  democrats like cooper i think roy cooper really wants to just move this state forward and passed
[03:43:54.040 --> 03:44:00.840]  uh sort of all the divisions that we've had um under governor mccrory on the hb2 thing on voting
[03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:08.280]  rights on so many issues yeah we need to have these other states like north carolina we need to
[03:44:08.280 --> 03:44:13.880]  have people from new york or again in washington dc come to us and explain to us uh how we should
[03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:18.600]  live tell us how to vote because you see there just aren't enough people in north carolina who
[03:44:18.600 --> 03:44:23.560]  want to vote democrat and let me tell you something this whole nonsense about north carolina being
[03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:28.120]  in play it's only in play if there's fraud involved folks let me tell you a little bit of the brief
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:34.840]  history of north carolina after reconstruction after what the republicans did with that it was
[03:44:34.840 --> 03:44:39.800]  like the rest of the south thoroughly democrat it would be uh once you finished just like it was
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:44.440]  in florida when i was growing up in florida uh the real election was a democrat primary nobody
[03:44:44.440 --> 03:44:49.960]  really ran as a republican because of the bad taste that reconstruction had left in people's uh
[03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:55.240]  mouth and so in north carolina they had only had i think one republican governor maybe two since
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:45:00.840]  reconstruction when ronald reagan came through it changed things a little bit they got a couple
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:04.920]  republican senators but it would go on and off to be a republican and democrat so it was kind of a
[03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:10.520]  purple state even ronald reagan couldn't overcome that for a while and so it would go republican
[03:45:10.520 --> 03:45:15.960]  it would go democrat but the house and the state house the state senate were thoroughly democrat
[03:45:15.960 --> 03:45:21.960]  and of course the state legislature does the gerrymandering where they set up the congressional
[03:45:21.960 --> 03:45:26.920]  district so the congressional district uh congressional districting was thoroughly democrat
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:31.480]  as well so the only chance that you had was occasionally uh get a republican senator a
[03:45:31.480 --> 03:45:38.680]  republican democrat until obama remember that obama won north carolina 2008 and then people
[03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:47.800]  saw what he did and in 2010 they had a massive change in the state house and the state senate
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:53.080]  and the state legislature and that was the point at which the republicans took over for the first
[03:45:53.080 --> 03:45:58.040]  time since reconstruction they took over state government at the legislature level they also
[03:45:58.040 --> 03:46:04.120]  elected republican governor and uh got republicans in the senate as well but they still pretty much
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:09.560]  had a republican congressional delegation until the next election so once the house took over
[03:46:09.560 --> 03:46:15.960]  in 2010 once republicans took over the house in 2010 they reversed the gerrymandering that had
[03:46:15.960 --> 03:46:22.840]  favored democrats to favor them and so pretty much republicans have had the rule in north carolina
[03:46:22.840 --> 03:46:27.960]  since obama so he did for republicans in north carolina what he did for gun ownership throughout
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:35.080]  this country and so now they want to tell us that they're going to vote against you know even even
[03:46:35.080 --> 03:46:43.240]  romney beat obama in 2012 but the mainstream press that lies through its teeth wants to tell you that
[03:46:44.280 --> 03:46:49.560]  things are in play now for the third term of obama which is what hillary clinton is no it's not
[03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:55.240]  it's a matter of fact the article that had that clip in it says after taking million this is a
[03:46:55.240 --> 03:46:59.960]  quote from governor mccrory's office and of course he's a republican running against attorney general
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:05.960]  roi cooper for governor the republican says after taking millions in contributions and support from
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:11.720]  out of state liberal groups roi cooper is now turning to them to save his campaign after momentum
[03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:16.840]  has shifted towards governor mccrory they say our state needs a governor who is elected by north
[03:47:16.840 --> 03:47:24.840]  carolinians not liberal activists from washington dc new york and origan that's exactly right
[03:47:24.840 --> 03:47:30.280]  now one other bit of news out of north carolina this is from the north carolina g.o.p and i
[03:47:30.280 --> 03:47:34.200]  thought this is interesting because i said the north carolina g.o.p is going to present evidence
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:40.920]  in federal court of the n double a cp and democrat leaders using voter suppression and what is this
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:46.200]  about this is a leader in lee county democrat party calling on their supporters to bring weapons
[03:47:46.200 --> 03:47:52.360]  like baseball bats to polling sites where did we see this before remember we had a polling sites in
[03:47:52.360 --> 03:47:57.400]  chicago where we had the new black panthers show up and intimidate people you know if you're going
[03:47:57.400 --> 03:48:01.880]  to show up and you're white they you might be voting against obama so get out of here before
[03:48:01.880 --> 03:48:07.240]  i hit you with a baseball bat and then of course obama's attorney general says uh nothing to see
[03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:11.960]  here eric holder says we're not going to prosecute that no that's that's nothing to worry about so
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:16.280]  that's the kind of corruption that we've got at the top that's what we're seeing from fbi director
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:22.920]  comey as well this is margaret mercheson who is a leader in the lee county democrat party calling
[03:48:22.920 --> 03:48:27.960]  on supporters to bring weapons she's this is an attempt to stop voter information from being
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:33.640]  distributed about veterans who are running for office okay so they don't want you to know
[03:48:34.680 --> 03:48:40.520]  that certain that veterans are running for office you might want to vote for somebody
[03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:44.840]  because they're military veteran but no no no somebody shows up telling you about veterans
[03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:49.720]  who are running for office run them off with a baseball bat she says we need enough volunteers
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:57.720]  at both sites and also on election day to uppercase screaming nip this in the bud even if it means a
[03:48:57.720 --> 03:49:02.440]  baseball bat is necessary she says okay so there you go see when you tolerate the kind of corruption
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:08.200]  that we had with attorney general eric holder letting the new black panthers run people off of
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:15.960]  polling sites with baseball bats then it spreads to north carolina it's corruption it's the rotting
[03:49:15.960 --> 03:49:21.880]  that begins at the head right the fish rots from the head down that's what we've always seen
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:28.040]  now let's take a look at uh some other metrics that are coming out some other positive news
[03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:33.160]  that is coming out we see uh of course drudge was on top of this he pointed out democrats
[03:49:33.160 --> 03:49:38.680]  widen their lead over gop in florida early votes this is from politico and they talk about how
[03:49:38.680 --> 03:49:42.760]  florida democrats increased their lead over republicans and casting pre-election day ballots to
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:49.320]  nearly 33 000 as of sunday night uh as of sunday morning rather so this is politico which is thoroughly
[03:49:49.880 --> 03:49:57.240]  in the hillary clinton camp so happy about the fact that they have a 33 000 vote of republicans
[03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:03.960]  versus democrats in terms of absentee ballots that have been mailed back in but not so fast
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:11.080]  because let's take a look at this and let's look at the metrics involved here and as drudge has at
[03:50:11.080 --> 03:50:18.120]  the top of uh the drudge report he points out that in uh in florida let's do florida first
[03:50:18.120 --> 03:50:22.440]  because he's got one about florida he's got another one about north carolina he says in florida
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:30.600]  uh trump outperforms romney by 130 000 in early votes so think about this okay here's the here's
[03:50:30.600 --> 03:50:36.600]  the issue both in florida and in north carolina when they turn in the ballots the absentee ballots
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:44.440]  that is always heavily democrat knit romney went into election day with a deficit of 161 000 and
[03:50:44.440 --> 03:50:51.560]  absentee ballots and the fact that the democrats have about 33 000 edge on trump is not good news
[03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:58.680]  politico that means that trump is outperforming mit romney by about 130 000 and mit romney even
[03:50:59.480 --> 03:51:03.880]  lost the state by 74 000 we'll be right back for someone you know suffer from chest pain

[03:54:30.120 --> 03:54:34.600]  stefan mollano who is on earlier with alex jones but he'll be back for more in-depth coverage with
[03:54:34.600 --> 03:54:40.680]  rob do and we'll have the entire staff coming through here for the next 52 hours very important
[03:54:40.680 --> 03:54:45.960]  time that we're facing here as a country that's why we're covering this live as i was saying just
[03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:50.120]  before we went to break we look at the top of drudge and we look at these metrics coming out of
[03:54:50.120 --> 03:54:57.240]  florida and north carolina and as i said before north carolina didn't turn red because of reagan
[03:54:57.240 --> 03:55:02.760]  he moved them in that direction but it was obama who turned north carolina red north carolina
[03:55:02.760 --> 03:55:09.640]  voted for obama in 2008 but they voted for romney in 2012 and now we see that donald trump is out
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:14.840]  performing romney who won in north carolina now we look at the absentee ballots that come in
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:19.480]  they're not going to give us results as to how people voted but they're simply looking at this
[03:55:19.480 --> 03:55:24.760]  point as to how many democrat ballots have been returned how many republican ballots have been
[03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:29.640]  returned and they're looking at that in north carolina and in florida so here's the situation at this
[03:55:29.640 --> 03:55:38.040]  point four years ago romney was down by 447 000 so it's 447 000 more democrat ballots than republican
[03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:43.960]  ballots and understand the democrats do far more mail-in of ballots whether that's their real ballots
[03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:50.120]  or whether that's just the way the democrat machine works but they do far more mail-in ballots the
[03:55:50.120 --> 03:55:55.880]  republicans tend to go in and vote on election day so at this point four years ago romney was down
[03:55:55.880 --> 03:56:02.200]  by 447 000 but he still won by 97 000 he still won north carolina even though he started out before
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:10.040]  election day down by nearly 450 000 he won by 100 000 on election day trump now is only down
[03:56:10.040 --> 03:56:15.720]  305 000 in other words he's outperforming where romney was four years ago by 142 000
[03:56:16.520 --> 03:56:22.840]  and romney won four years ago by 100 000 so so far trump is doing better and that's what we've seen
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:28.840]  everywhere we've seen that we've had record turnout following donald trump that's the fundamental flaw
[03:56:28.840 --> 03:56:35.400]  with all of these analyses that are being done by people like nate silver uh with 538 this is the
[03:56:35.400 --> 03:56:42.760]  way that they're missing this metric they don't have any way to measure enthusiasm they ought to
[03:56:42.760 --> 03:56:48.360]  take a look at the number of small contributions made to donald trump they ought to take a look at
[03:56:48.360 --> 03:56:52.440]  the number of people who have registered for the first time the number of people who have switched
[03:56:52.440 --> 03:56:57.720]  their registration from democrat to republican and democrat states they ought to look at the
[03:56:57.720 --> 03:57:04.200]  crowd sizes but they ignore everything including social media and they focus simply on their own
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:09.720]  internal polls and have to say we look at every single metric even silly ones like the number
[03:57:09.720 --> 03:57:15.480]  of halloween masks or uh which standee does the monkey kiss you know does the standee in china
[03:57:15.480 --> 03:57:22.120]  you know the chinese monkey that kisses donald trump or kisses hillary clinton uh well you know
[03:57:22.120 --> 03:57:27.800]  why why wouldn't that be as important a metric as the phony media that gives hillary clinton a big
[03:57:27.800 --> 03:57:34.040]  hug and a kiss i mean the the chinese monkey is every bit as is a valid as the mainstream media
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:39.480]  quite frankly but when we look at what's going on in florida again romney was down 161 000 at this
[03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:45.480]  point with mail-in ballots democrat versus republican he went on to lose by 74 000 florida last time
[03:57:45.480 --> 03:57:51.720]  trump now is down by just 33 000 not 161 000 but just 33 000 in other words he's outperforming
[03:57:51.720 --> 03:57:59.560]  romney by 130 000 and remember the difference between the two last time was 74 000 all right
[03:57:59.560 --> 03:58:04.840]  we're going to be back in uh just a uh moment we're going to take a quick break and i want to
[03:58:04.840 --> 03:58:12.840]  talk about janet rino the butcher of weco and i want to talk about what her life says to people
[03:58:12.840 --> 03:58:19.160]  like james comey fbi director you know she was head of the justice department but now
[03:58:19.160 --> 03:58:24.520]  she is going to be facing justice eternal justice it's appointed to man wants to die
[03:58:24.520 --> 03:58:29.240]  and then face the judgment and people who want to rig this election need to understand there's
[03:58:29.240 --> 03:58:49.880]  going to be a reckoning if it's not in this life it'll eventually be there we'll be right back
